10745,rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 is reported to cause fertilization effect resulting in enhanced crop biomass and yields and may alter the water use of plants however factors like air temperature and nitrogen n management could modify the feedbacks of co2 on crop water use hence this field study was carried out in open top field chambers otc for two crop seasons to investigate the interactive effects of climate and n on evapotranspiration yield and water use efficiency in soybean glycine max l soybean crop was grown under three climate conditions ambient ac elevated co2 ec and co elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet and four n treatments during july to october 2016 and 2018 elevation of co2 was done to the level of 535 540 μmol mol 1 and temperature was elevated by about 2 c above ambient the four n levels were n0 n50 n100 and n150 referring to 0 50 100 and 150 of recommended n dose 30 kg n ha 1 crop evapotranspiration et was computed by soil water balance method the two years field study indicated ec and ecet showed significant yield advantage to the extent of 32 47 over ambient significant effect p 0 05 of climate was observed on crop et profile water storage and water use efficiency wue during both the study years the effect of n application on these three parameters was significant only in 2016 crop year averaged across n treatments profile soil water storage at harvest was higher by about 5 in 2016 and by 9 in 2018 crop season under ec and ecet treatments as compared to ac the crop et was significantly lower under ec and ecet in both the years with significantly higher wue the wue varied from 2 99 to 4 48 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 and from 4 62 to 6 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 crop year stomatal conductance during major growth period reduced by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet though it did not reflect in reduced transpiration the study indicated significantly higher leaf area contributing to reduced soil water evaporation is the major mechanism explaining higher soil water profile under ec and ecet over ambient the wue was higher by 48 50 in 2016 and by 37 39 in 2018 under ec and ecet treatments which was mostly attributed to higher grain yield keywords co2 fertilization plant water use water metabolism climate change impact 1 introduction the globally averaged surface mole fraction of carbon dioxide co2 reached a record level of 405 5 0 1 μmol mol 1 in 2017 constituting 146 of the pre industrial levels wmo 2018 as per the measurements at mauna loa observatory the co2 concentration grew at 2 87 μmol mol 1during 2018 and the rate of increase in the last two decades has been 100 times faster than previous natural increases noaa 2019 such an unprecedented annual growth rate of atmospheric co2 concentration particularly over the last two decades bears significance in the context of climate change and the ecosystem responses further there is a rise in average global temperature by 0 85 c due to global warming as per the latest assessment by ipcc the feedbacks of co2 on plant carbon and water metabolism are primarily decided by changes in photosynthesis and stomatal behaviour smith et al 2014 xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 in plants since co2 is a primary raw material in the process of photosynthesis increase in atmospheric co2 concentration has been reported to enhance crop biomass and yields particularly in c3 plants long et al 2006 lenka et al 2019a b previous studies indicate yield increase to the extent of 31 32 for soybean glycine max l and wheat triticum aestivum l long et al 2006 in open top chambers and by about 19 in free air co2 enrichment face experiments kimball 2016 numerous studies are available on the effect of elevated co2 on plant growth and biomass but effects on crop water use and water use efficiency wue are less studied kumar et al 2017 lenka et al 2017 few studies have reported elevated co2 to reduce the water use by plants owing to a reduced stomatal conductance gs leakey et al 2006 bernacchi et al 2007 however the extent to which the feedback of elevated co2 at leaf scale is translated to ecosystem scale is poorly understood bernacchi et al 2007 lenka and lal 2012 srinivasrao et al 2016 because many other factors such as soil water evaporation runoff and higher leaf temperature due to reduced transpiration play a compounding role at the ecosystem scale further despite a lower gs at an individual leaf scale water demand may increase due to higher crop growth and biomass production in any case the reported effects of elevated co2 on plant water use may get modified when there is simultaneous increase in growing temperature field studies on the effects of co2 alone and in conjunction with temperature on water use by crop plants are few availability of plant nutrients particularly soil nitrogen n is another crucial factor regulating the co2 fertilization effect wieder et al 2015 he et al 2017 thus the major hypotheses for setting the experiment were 1 elevation in growing temperature neutralizes the potential benefits of elevated co2 in conserving soil water and 2 under elevated co2 condition the water use efficiency increases with increase in n application a net saving in water use under elevated co2 condition should show an interactive and positive effect on plant growth under higher n supply however information on crop et and water use efficiency from field studies on the combined effect of co2 and temperature under different levels of n supply are limited in soybean crop hence this study was taken up in open top field chambers otc which closely simulate the free air enrichment as the structures are open from the top and also economical as compared to face systems the major objectives were to investigate the effect of three input parameters viz co2 temperature and n supply on plant water use and water use efficiency in a rainfed soybean crop in sub tropical india 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and climate the study was taken up as a field experiment in otcs of 4 4 m size m s moreson pune india at the research farm of the indian institute of soil science bhopal the study site is located at 23 15 n latitude and 77 25 e longitude at 427 m amsl and is characterized by a humid subtropical climate with mild dry winter and a hot summer followed by rainy season the soil of the experimental site is a deep vertisol isohyperthermic typic haplustert with clay texture and is characterized by slightly alkaline ph average ph of 7 96 low salt content and low organic matter content 2 2 experiment facility open top field chamber with control and automation soybean crop was grown during two crop seasons in the otcs under three climate conditions ambient ac elevated co2 ec and co elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet and four n treatments total 12 treatments during july to october 2016 and 2018 in the relevant treatments elevation of co2 was done to the level of 535 540 μmol mol 1 and temperature was elevated to about 2 c above ambient elevation in co2 was made during the day time only the four n levels were n0 n50 n100 and n150 referring to 0 50 100 and 150 of recommended n dose for the four n levels p and k were applied at 100 recommended dose the recommended dose of nutrients for soybean was 30 60 40 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o in each otc n treatment plots were separated using impervious polycarbonate sheets from 30 cm below ground and 10 cm above ground to prevent lateral seepage the otcs were open from the top and fabricated using polycarbonate sheets from four sides having 4 m 4 m land area plate 1 the co2 cylinders were connected to pre heaters and then supply of co2 gas 99 5 purity was made from co2 cylinders at an outlet pressure of 2 0 kg cm 2 through a manifold system and solenoid valve arrangement in the elevated co2 chambers co2 was released through nozzles connected to polyvinyl tubes the co2 concentration was monitored through a co2 monitor make tongdy usa model f12 s8100 and the set parameter concentration was maintained on real time basis through an automated control facility connected to dataloggers and a supervisory control and data acquisition scada software temperature elevation was done through ceramic infrared heaters and temperature was monitored using temperature sensors make hk tempsensors model ptx100 the photosynthetically active radiation par was measured using a par sensor make apogee usa model sq110 mounted on the centre of the chambers and also in open field at a height of 1 2 m above ground the par data showed about 85 transmission of incoming solar radiation in the otcs the par value varied from 1111 241 in the open to 941 228 μmol m 2 s 1 inside the chambers otcs in 2016 crop season and the corresponding values in 2018 season were 900 427 in the open and 788 324 μmol m 2 s 1 inside the chambers the average values of co2 temperature and par were recorded at 5 min interval the average co2 concentrations and air temperature averaged over 24 h inside the chambers of different treatments are given in table 1 2 3 crop management soybean crop cultivar js 20 29 was grown for the experiment for two crop years during july to october 2016 and 2018 in addition to the level of nutrients as per the treatment requirement vermicompost containing 0 66 n was applied at the rate of 2 0 ton ha 1 on dry weight basis in all the treatments the chemical fertilizers and vermicompost were applied as basal dose at sowing soybean was sown at a row spacing of 40 cm and within row spacing of 15 cm on 19 july 2016 and 2nd july 2018 as a rainfed crop the crops were harvested on 22nd october 2016 and 8th october 2018 respectively the plots were maintained weed free with three hand weedings at 15 30 and 60 days after sowing das the crop was protected from insect attack by spraying chloropyriphos 25 ec and trizophos 40 ec 1 5 and 0 75 l ha 1 respectively 2 4 yield leaf area and stomatal conductance the response of soybean crop to elevated co2 alone ec and in combination with elevated temperature ecet under different n application was studied in terms of soybean grain yield leaf area stomatal behaviour water use and water use efficiency sampling for grain yield was done from 0 5 0 5 m area for each replication and the data was recorded for four replications in 2016 and six replicates in 2018 leaf area monitoring was done at 50 and 70 days after sowing das using a leaf area meter li3100 licor usa for minimum three replications stomatal conductance transpiration and leaf temperature was monitored at the recently fully expanded leaf for three replicates in each treatment during the 2018 crop season using a licor 6400xt photosynthesis analysis system 2 5 computation of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was computed using the field water balance equation hillel 1998 as given below 1 e t p i u r d δ s where et evapotranspiration mm p rainfall mm i irrigation mm u capillary rise mm r runoff mm d deep percolation mm and δs is change in profile soil water storage mm runoff r was assumed to be negligible as the field plots were bunded 30 cm height and no case of bund overflow occurred rainfall data was collected from the meteorological observatory of central institute of agricultural engineering ciae which is located about 0 5 km from the experimental site the crop was rainfed and thus no irrigation was given the water table was below 4 m and therefore capillary rise u was assumed to be zero deep percolation was computed beyond 45 cm 30 60 cm soil depth using darcy s formula hillel 1998 ghiberto et al 2011 for calculating soil water flux q 2 soil water flux q cm day 1 k θ h2 h1 z2 z1 1 where k θ is the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 h1 and h2 are matric potentials cm at depths z1 and z2 cm respectively and was derived from the ψ θ relationship for the experiment soil the k θ values were determined from the k θ relationship developed by saxton and rawls 2006 when q is negative there is downward flux and when q is positive flux is upward deep percolation loss over the crop period was computed from the following equation 3 d qi qf 2 t where qi initial flux qf flux after end of time period t days water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 was computed using the following formula 4 wue grain yield kg ha et mm change in soil water storage δs was calculated from the difference between initial and harvest time soil water storage soil moisture was determined by gravimetric method and samples were collected from 0 to 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm soil depths at regular intervals including at sowing and at harvest with three replicates from each treatment 2 6 weather condition during experiment period the observed weather data during the two crop years fig 1 indicated clear variation in the rainfall pattern during the growth season the 2016 crop year experienced higher rainfall with 716 mm received during 2016 and 599 mm during 2018 growth season despite a lower rainfall amount the distribution was well spread during the 2018 crop year on the other hand most of the rainfall amount was concentrated in the initial crop growth stage of the 2016 crop the average minimum and maximum temperature during the soybean growth period were 24 1 1 2 c and 31 0 2 4 c in 2016 while it was 24 0 3 0 c and 30 3 1 0 c in the year 2018 respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the recorded data on the selected parameters were analysed using a two way analysis of variance anova as relevant for a factorial treatment structure with climate and n as the two factors a post hoc analysis was carried out with the treatment means being separated by least significant difference lsd test at 95 probability p 0 05 using sas 9 3 statistical software 3 results 3 1 soybean grain yield across n levels the grain yield varied from 1469 to 2049 kg ha 1 under ambient 2044 to 2657 kg ha 1 under ec and from 2162 to 2898 kg ha 1 under ecet table 2 similar trend in grain yield was observed in 2018 with values varying from 1700 to 2145 2259 2838 and 2328 to 3097 kg ha 1 under ambient ec and ecet treatments respectively in both the study years significant effects of both climate and n level were observed on grain yield though the interaction effect was non significant table 3 significantly higher grain yield was observed under ec and ecet as compared to ambient in both the years however the difference between ec and ecet in terms of grain yield was not significant averaged over n levels the yield advantages of ec and ecet treatments over ambient were 43 and 47 respectively in 2016 however the values were lower in 2018 crop season with 32 and 34 yield advantage under ec and ecet respectively table 4 the yield advantage of elevated co2 alone or in combination with elevation in temperature was observed across all n application levels including at n0 in general the yield advantage was lower at n application below or more than the recommended level 3 2 crop evapotranspiration the mean crop evapotranspiration et values in 2016 were 576 553 and 562 mm under ac ec and ecet treatments respectively and the corresponding values for 2018 were 425 410 and 411 mm respectively table 2 significant effect p 0 05 of climate was observed on crop et in both years of study table 3 however the effect of n was significant only during 2016 crop season the interaction effect was not significant at 95 probability in both the years significantly higher et was observed under ac than ec or ecet with the latter two being at par in year 2016 significantly higher et was observed under n150 which was at par with n100 and both being significantly higher than n0 or n50 on an average et was lower in the 2018 crop year 3 3 profile water storage at harvest the profile water storage up to 60 cm soil depth showed a significant effect of climate in both crop years with effect of n as significant p 0 05 in 2016 crop season only and the interaction being non significant in both the years table 3 significantly lower water storage was observed under ac than ec or ecet with the latter two being at par among the n treatments only n150 showed lower profile water storage which was significantly distinct table 2 in year 2016 significantly lower profile water storage was observed under n150 which was at par with n100 and both being significantly lower than n0 or n50 in the 2018 crop season the n150 treatment showed significantly lower profile water storage than n0 3 4 water use efficiency wue the mean wue values in 2016 were 2 99 4 44 and 4 48 kg ha 1 mm 1under ac ec and ecet treatments respectively and the corresponding values for 2018 were 4 62 6 34 and 6 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 2 in the two study years significant effects of climate p 0 0001 n p 0 0001 and their interaction p 0 0001 were observed on wue table 3 among the climate treatments ecet and ec were at par in terms of wue and both showing significantly higher wue than ambient in 2016 crop season tables 2 and 3 in the 2018 crop season ecet was significantly higher than ec followed by ambient table 2 effect of n on wue also varied with crop year in the 2016 crop season the wue followed the trend of n150 n100 n50 n0 where as in 2018 the order was n150 n100 n50 n0 in absolute terms the wue was higher in 2018 crop season table 2 among all the treatment combinations the wue was significantly higher under ecet n100 in 2016 crop season and under ecet n150 in 2018 crop season significantly lower wue was observed under ac n0 in both the years of study 3 5 leaf area at 50 and 70 das there was a significant effect of climate on leaf area at 50 and 70 das in both the study years though n application showed significant effect only in 2018 crop year at 70 das table 3 fig 2 the interaction effect of climate and n was not significant in none of the years table 3 in 2018 crop year there was a conspicuous trend of ec and ecet being at par at 70 das but were significantly higher than ambient in 2016 ecet clearly showed significantly higher leaf area in 2018 crop year significantly higher leaf area was observed under n150 followed by n100 with n0 and n50 at par 3 6 stomatal conductance gs transpiration and leaf temperature a significant effect of climate on gs transpiration and leaf temperature was observed table 3 fig 3 at different crop growth stages in the 2018 crop year the only year in which these parameters were measured however n application as well as climate n interaction did not show any significant effect on these parameters in most of the observation dates the gs values were significantly lower under ec and ecet treatments than ambient fig 3 in most of the crop growth stages as compared to ambient the gs values were lower by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet climate showed a significant effect on transpiration rate at 32 71 and 85 das table 3 the measured transpiration rate showed a distinct trend at 71 das with significantly higher values under ecet than ac and ec with the latter two being at par fig 4 at the later stages difference in transpiration rates among the climate treatments did not show any specific trend effect of climate was significant on leaf temperature at all the growth stages table 3 at most parts of crop growth period leaf temperature under ecet was higher or similar to ec with both treatments showing higher leaf temperature than ac fig 5 effect of n on leaf temperature was significant only at later crop growth stages 4 discussion 4 1 elevated co2 and temperature effect on grain yield yield increase in soybean under elevated co2 has been reported from controlled studies singh et al 2016 open top chambers li et al 2017 lenka et al 2017 2019a b and also face experiments hao et al 2016 previous reports indicate 12 91 higher grain yield due to co2 fertilization li et al 2017 in soybean the results obtained from this study are in agreement with previous reports though the magnitude of increment varied this study showed 43 higher grain yield in 2016 crop season and 32 higher grain yield in 2018 crop season under elevated co2 as compared to ambient table 4 elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet did not show any adverse effect and the yield advantage over ambient was 47 and 34 in 2016 and 2018 crop seasons respectively correlating with the rainfall data fig 1 with the yield data apparently indicates the yield advantage due to co2 elevation was higher in a rainy season however this result does not mean elevated co2 had a more significant effect on yield increase in rainy years from a closer look at the rainfall distribution the rainfall in 2018 was more evenly distributed which favoured the grain yield in ambient condition also hence the relative advantage was lower the yield advantage due to elevation of co2 ec as well as elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet treatments was observed across all n application levels including at n0 however data of both the years could not conclusively indicate whether yield advantage due to co2 elevation was more at higher n application or not this implied elevated co2 in combination with elevated temperature showed a yield enhancing effect irrespective of n application however from this result it is difficult to say whether this positive effect on crop yield holds good at higher temperature elevation than the extent of elevation considered in this study in the two years of our study maximum elevation in temperature was within 2 0 c table 1 in some other experiments soybean cultivars exhibited no significant differences in seed yield at the ambient 1 5 c and ambient 3 0 c treatments compared to ambient while a significant yield reduction was observed at the ambient 5 0 c treatment choi et al 2016 4 2 elevated co2 and temperature effect on crop et profile water storage physiological attributes and water use efficiency higher co2 concentration has been shown to reduce crop et in soybean bernacchi et al 2007 kimball 2016 though not much studies are available on the combined effect of co2 and temperature on crop et and profile water storage a lowered crop et leading to higher profile soil water storage was observed in both the years in ec as well as in ecet treatments table 2 thus disproving the first hypothesis higher temperature elevation than considered in the present study may show a different result on the soil hydrology though such reports are not available averaged across n treatments soil moisture was higher by 4 5 in 2016 and by 9 in 2018 crop season under ec and ecet treatments table 4 the crop et was also significantly lower under ec and ecet treatments in both the years bernacchi et al 2007 showed elevated co2 to decrease et by 9 16 due to a decline in stomatal conductance however the relationship between crop et and co2 concentration is influenced by the growing temperature regime allen et al 2003 in a study in controlled sun lit environmental chambers allen et al 2003 reported 9 decrease in et due to doubling of co2 at a temperature combination of 28 18 c but there was a little effect at 40 30 c and 44 34 c temperature regimes results from previous studies indicated variable response of crop et to co2 enrichment in different crops for instance about 10 decrease in crop et was observed from the free air co2 enrichment face experiments in maricopa arizona in c3 crops triggs et al 2004 kimball 2016 but no change in et was observed for cotton kimball et al 1994 reduction in crop et is mostly attributed to a decrease in gs upon exposure to elevated co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 locke et al 2013 kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 through lowered plant canopy transpiration we observed a reduction in gs by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet in the major crop growth stages fig 3 the findings are in line with the observations of ainsworth and rogers 2007 where a reduction in gs to the extent of 40 was reported in soybean upon doubling of co2 however the lowered gs did not reflect in reduced transpiration under ec or ecet as observed in our study fig 4 thus significantly higher leaf area under ec and ecet leading to a more ground cover and consequently lower soil water evaporation can be a major contributor to overall reduction in et we did not directly measure the soil water evaporation in this experiment however during the soybean crop period the maximum air temperature remained above 30 c fig 1 which is ideal for a good amount of soil water evaporation averaged across n treatments leaf area at 70 das under ec and ecet was higher by 9 25 in 2016 and by 24 29 in 2018 crop season fig 2 higher leaf area upon exposure to elevated co2 has been reported by earlier authors lenka et al 2017 jin et al 2017 hence it is quite apparent that both gs and leaf area are the crucial factors regulating the profile soil moisture and crop et as observed in this study the transpiration rate was either higher or similar under ec and ecet treatments as compared to ambient fig 4 thus considering a higher leaf area under ec and ecet the amount of water loss through transpiration is ought to be higher if this is the case the higher soil moisture storage and reduced soil et under ec and ecet treatments is explained by reduction in the soil water evaporation component of et due to a significantly higher leaf area leading to a more ground cover increase in temperature along with co2 concentration is reported to increase the leaf temperature due to physiological forcing caused by a reduction in the stomatal conductance allen et al 2003 kimball 2016 increase in foliage temperature by 0 72 and 0 77 c per 1 0 c increase in chamber temperature at 350 and 700 μmol co2 mol 1 has been reported in soybean allen et al 2003 the same study showed an increase of foliage temperature by 0 7 1 4 c with doubling of co2 in the chambers having mid day air temperature in the range of 25 37 c significantly higher temperature under ec and ecet is in line with the reports of earlier workers averaged over the measurement dates leaf temperature in this study was higher by 2 65 c under ec and by 2 72 c under ecet fig 5 in most cases the leaf temperature was similar for ec and ecet but both showed higher leaf temperature than ambient this was because co2 elevation was done in both ec and ecet leaf temperature is primarily decided by transpiration the data indicates similar stomatal behaviour in terms of transpiration under both ec and ecet the additional temperature increase under ecet to by about 1 5 c was probably not high enough to show a difference in leaf temperature a reduced crop et and higher grain yield resulted in significantly higher wue under ec and ecet treatments over ambient table 2 the higher wue values in 2018 crop season as compared to 2016 was because of a higher grain yield and lower et in the former the 2018 crop season received less rainfall but was well distributed over the growing season and also the thermal regime was better fig 1 which led to a better soybean growth and yield li et al 2013 from a pot study reported 26 2 increase in wue due to elevated co2 in soybean on the contrary our field study showed 48 50 higher wue in 2016 and 37 39 higher wue in 2018 under ec and ecet treatments the significant interaction between climate and n indicated requirement of optimum n availability for achieving higher wue thus proving the second hypothesis the enhanced wue under ec and ecet treatments was because of a higher grain yield and lower crop et in these treatments as compared to ambient which was mostly attributed to higher grain yield upon exposure to elevated co2 however from the data it is quite clear that higher wue in these treatments is more attributed to increased grain yield rather than crop water use it was because the savings in crop water use was lower as compared to the gain in yield the crop et was lower under ec and ecet treatments maximum to the extent of 4 5 whereas the grain yield advantage over ambient was recorded to the extent of 32 47 5 conclusions the two years field study indicated effect of co2 and or temperature elevation to be favourable for soybean crop with yield advantage to the extent of 32 47 over ambient the study clearly showed elevation of co2 alone or in conjunction with elevated temperature to significantly reduce crop et enhance soil water profile and improve wue in soybean under sub tropical climate of central india declaration of

growth period reduced by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet though it did not reflect in reduced transpiration the study indicated significantly higher leaf area contributing to reduced soil water evaporation is the major mechanism explaining higher soil water profile under ec and ecet over ambient the wue was higher by 48 50 in 2016 and by 37 39 in 2018 under ec and ecet treatments which was

on plant water use may get modified when there is simultaneous increase in growing temperature field studies on the effects of co2 alone and in conjunction with temperature on water use by crop plants are few availability of plant nutrients particularly soil nitrogen n is another crucial factor regulating the co2 fertilization effect wieder et al 2015 he et al 2017 thus the major hypotheses for setting the experiment were 1 elevation in growing temperature neutralizes the potential benefits of elevated co2 in conserving soil water and 2 under elevated co2 condition the water use efficiency increases with increase in n application a net saving in water use under elevated co2 condition should show an interactive and positive effect on plant growth under higher n supply however information on crop et and water use efficiency from field studies on the combined effect of co2 and temperature under different levels of n supply are limited in soybean crop hence this study was taken up in open top field chambers otc which closely simulate the free air enrichment as the structures are open from the top and also economical as compared to face systems the major objectives were to investigate the effect of three input parameters viz co2 temperature and n supply on plant water use and water use efficiency in a rainfed soybean crop in sub tropical india 2 materials and methods 2

co2 concentrations and air temperature averaged over 24 h inside the chambers of different treatments are given in table 1 2 3 crop management soybean crop cultivar js 20 29 was grown for the experiment for two crop years during july to october 2016 and 2018 in addition to the level of nutrients as per the treatment requirement vermicompost containing 0 66 n was applied at the rate of 2 0 ton ha 1 on dry weight basis in all the treatments the chemical fertilizers and vermicompost were applied as basal dose at sowing soybean was sown at a row spacing of 40 cm and within row spacing of 15 cm on 19 july 2016 and 2nd july 2018 as a rainfed crop the crops were harvested on 22nd october 2016 and 8th october 2018 respectively the plots were maintained weed free with three hand weedings

replicates in 2018 leaf area monitoring was done at 50 and 70 days after sowing das using a leaf area meter li3100 licor usa for minimum three replications stomatal conductance transpiration and leaf temperature was monitored at the recently fully expanded leaf for three replicates in each treatment during the 2018 crop season using a licor 6400xt photosynthesis analysis system 2 5 computation of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was computed using the field water balance equation hillel 1998 as given below 1 e t p i u r d δ s where et evapotranspiration mm p rainfall mm i irrigation mm u capillary rise mm r runoff mm d deep percolation mm and δs is change in profile soil water storage mm runoff r was assumed to be negligible as the field plots were bunded 30 cm height and no case of bund overflow occurred rainfall data was collected from the meteorological observatory of central institute of agricultural engineering ciae which is located about 0 5 km from the experimental site the crop was rainfed and thus no irrigation was given the water table was below 4 m and therefore capillary rise u was assumed to be zero deep percolation was computed beyond 45 cm 30 60 cm soil depth using darcy s formula hillel 1998 ghiberto et al 2011 for calculating soil water flux q 2 soil water flux q cm day 1 k θ h2 h1 z2 z1 1 where k θ is the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 h1 and h2 are matric potentials cm at depths z1 and z2 cm respectively and was derived from the ψ θ relationship for the experiment soil the k θ values were determined from the k θ relationship developed by saxton and rawls 2006 when q is negative there is downward flux and when q is positive flux is upward deep percolation loss over the crop period was computed from the following equation 3

storage δs was calculated from the difference between initial and harvest time soil water storage soil moisture was determined by gravimetric method and samples were collected from 0 to 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm soil depths at regular intervals including at sowing and at harvest with three replicates from each treatment 2 6 weather condition during experiment period the observed weather data during the two crop years fig 1 indicated clear variation in the rainfall pattern during the growth season the 2016 crop year experienced higher rainfall with 716 mm received during 2016 and 599 mm during 2018 growth season despite a lower rainfall amount the distribution was well spread during the 2018 crop year on the other hand most of the rainfall amount was concentrated in the initial crop growth stage of the 2016 crop the average minimum and maximum temperature during the soybean growth period were 24 1 1 2 c and 31 0 2 4 c in 2016 while it was 24 0 3 0 c and 30 3 1 0 c in the year 2018 respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the recorded data on the selected parameters were analysed using a two way analysis of variance anova as relevant for a factorial treatment structure with climate and n as the two factors a post hoc analysis was carried out with the treatment means being separated by least significant difference lsd test at 95 probability p 0 05 using sas 9 3 statistical software 3 results 3 1 soybean grain yield across n levels the grain yield varied from 1469 to 2049 kg ha 1 under ambient 2044 to 2657 kg ha 1 under ec and from 2162 to 2898 kg ha 1 under ecet table 2 similar trend in grain yield was observed in 2018 with values varying from 1700 to 2145 2259 2838 and 2328 to 3097 kg ha 1 under ambient ec and ecet treatments respectively in both the study years significant effects of both climate and n level were observed on grain yield though the interaction effect was non significant table 3 significantly higher grain yield was observed under ec and ecet as compared to ambient in both the years however the difference between ec and ecet in terms of grain yield was not significant averaged over n levels the yield advantages of ec and ecet treatments over ambient were 43 and 47 respectively in 2016 however the values were lower in 2018 crop season with 32 and 34 yield advantage under ec and ecet respectively table 4 the yield advantage of elevated co2 alone or in combination with elevation in temperature was observed across all n application levels including at n0 in general the yield advantage was lower at n application below or more than the recommended level 3 2 crop evapotranspiration the mean crop evapotranspiration et values in 2016 were 576 553 and 562 mm under ac ec and ecet treatments respectively and the corresponding values for 2018 were 425 410 and 411 mm respectively table 2 significant effect p 0 05 of climate was observed on crop et in both years of study table 3 however the effect of n was significant only during 2016 crop season the interaction effect was not significant at 95 probability in both the years significantly higher et was observed under ac than ec or ecet with the latter two being at par in year 2016 significantly higher et was observed under n150 which was at par with n100 and both being significantly higher than n0 or n50 on an average et was lower in the 2018 crop year 3 3 profile water storage at harvest the profile water storage up to 60 cm soil depth showed a significant effect of climate in both crop years with effect of n as significant p 0 05 in 2016 crop season only and the interaction being non significant in both the years table 3 significantly lower water storage was observed under ac than ec or ecet with the latter two being at par among the n treatments only n150 showed lower profile water storage which was significantly distinct table 2 in year 2016 significantly lower profile water storage was observed under n150 which was at par with n100 and both being significantly lower than n0 or n50 in the 2018 crop season the n150 treatment showed significantly lower profile water storage than n0 3 4 water use efficiency wue the mean wue values in 2016 were 2 99 4 44 and 4 48 kg ha 1 mm 1under ac ec and ecet treatments respectively and the corresponding values for 2018 were 4 62 6 34 and 6 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 2 in the two study years significant effects of climate p 0 0001 n p 0 0001 and their interaction p 0 0001 were observed on wue table 3 among the climate treatments ecet and ec were at par in terms of wue and both showing significantly higher wue than ambient in 2016 crop season tables 2 and 3 in the 2018 crop season ecet was significantly higher than ec followed by ambient table 2 effect of n on wue also varied with crop year in the 2016 crop season the wue followed the trend of n150 n100 n50 n0 where as in 2018 the order was n150 n100 n50 n0 in absolute terms the wue was higher in 2018 crop season table 2 among all the treatment combinations the wue was significantly higher under ecet n100 in 2016 crop season and under ecet n150 in 2018 crop season significantly lower wue was observed under ac n0 in both the years of study 3 5 leaf area at 50 and 70 das there was a significant effect of climate on leaf area at 50 and 70 das in both the study years though n application showed significant effect only in 2018 crop year at 70 das table 3 fig 2 the interaction effect of climate and n was not significant in none of the years table 3 in 2018 crop year there was a conspicuous trend of ec and ecet being at par at 70 das but were significantly higher than ambient in 2016 ecet clearly showed significantly higher leaf area in 2018 crop year significantly higher leaf area was observed under n150 followed by n100 with n0 and n50 at par 3 6 stomatal conductance gs transpiration and leaf temperature a significant effect of climate on gs transpiration and leaf temperature was observed table 3 fig 3 at different crop growth stages in the 2018 crop year the only year in which these parameters were measured however n application as well as climate n interaction did not show any significant effect on these parameters in most of the observation dates the gs values were significantly lower under ec and ecet treatments than ambient fig 3 in most of the crop growth stages as compared to ambient the gs values were lower by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet climate showed a significant effect on transpiration rate at 32 71 and 85 das table 3 the measured transpiration rate showed a distinct trend at 71 das with significantly higher values under ecet than ac and ec with the latter two being at par fig 4 at the later stages difference in transpiration rates among the climate treatments did not show any specific trend effect of climate was significant on leaf temperature at all the growth stages table 3 at most parts of crop growth period leaf temperature under ecet was higher or similar to ec with both treatments showing higher leaf temperature than ac fig 5 effect of n on leaf temperature was significant only at later crop growth stages 4 discussion 4 1 elevated co2 and temperature effect on grain yield yield increase in soybean under elevated co2 has been reported from controlled studies singh et al 2016 open top chambers li et al 2017 lenka et al 2017 2019a b and also face experiments hao et al 2016 previous reports indicate 12 91 higher grain yield due to co2 fertilization li et al 2017 in soybean the results obtained from this study are in agreement with previous reports though the magnitude of increment varied this study showed 43 higher grain yield in 2016 crop season and 32 higher grain yield in 2018 crop season under elevated co2 as compared to ambient table 4 elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet did not show any adverse effect and the yield advantage over ambient was 47 and 34 in 2016 and 2018 crop seasons respectively correlating with the rainfall data fig 1 with the yield data apparently indicates the yield advantage due to co2 elevation was higher in a rainy season however this result does not mean elevated co2 had a more significant effect on yield increase in rainy years from a closer look at the rainfall distribution the rainfall in 2018 was more evenly distributed which favoured the grain yield in ambient condition also hence the relative advantage was lower the yield advantage due to elevation of co2 ec as well as elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet treatments was observed across all n application levels including at n0 however data of both the years could not conclusively indicate whether yield advantage due to co2 elevation was more at higher n application or not this implied elevated co2 in combination with elevated temperature showed a yield enhancing effect irrespective of n application however from this result it is difficult to say whether this positive effect on crop yield holds good at higher temperature elevation than the extent of elevation considered in this study in the two years of our study maximum elevation in temperature was within 2 0 c table 1 in some other experiments soybean cultivars exhibited no significant differences in seed yield at the ambient 1 5 c and ambient 3 0 c treatments compared to ambient while a significant yield reduction was observed at the ambient 5 0 c treatment choi et al 2016 4 2 elevated co2 and temperature effect on crop et profile water storage physiological attributes and water use efficiency higher co2 concentration has been shown to reduce crop et in soybean bernacchi et al 2007 kimball 2016 though not much studies are available on the combined effect of co2 and temperature on crop et and profile water storage a lowered crop et leading to higher profile soil water storage was observed in both the years in ec as well as in ecet treatments table 2 thus disproving the first hypothesis higher temperature elevation than considered in the present study may show a different result on the soil hydrology though such reports are not available averaged across n treatments soil moisture was higher by 4 5 in 2016 and by 9 in 2018 crop season under ec and ecet treatments table 4 the crop et was also significantly lower under ec and ecet treatments in both the years bernacchi et al 2007 showed elevated co2 to decrease et by 9 16 due to a decline in stomatal conductance however the relationship between crop et and co2 concentration is influenced by the growing temperature regime allen et al 2003 in a study in controlled sun lit environmental chambers allen et al 2003 reported 9 decrease in et due to doubling of co2 at a temperature combination of 28 18 c but there was a little effect at 40 30 c and 44 34 c temperature regimes results from previous studies indicated variable response of crop et to co2 enrichment in different crops for instance about 10 decrease in crop et was observed from the free air co2 enrichment face experiments in maricopa arizona in c3 crops triggs et al 2004 kimball 2016 but no change in et was observed for cotton kimball et al 1994 reduction in crop et is mostly attributed to a decrease in gs upon exposure to elevated co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 locke et al 2013 kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 through lowered plant canopy transpiration we observed a reduction in gs by 21 42 under ec and by 19 31 under ecet in the major crop growth stages fig 3 the findings are in line with the observations of ainsworth and rogers 2007 where a reduction in gs to the extent of 40 was reported in soybean upon doubling of co2 however the lowered gs did not reflect in reduced transpiration under ec or ecet as observed in our study fig 4 thus significantly higher leaf area under ec and ecet leading to a more ground cover and consequently lower soil water evaporation can be a major contributor to overall reduction in et we did not directly measure the soil water evaporation in this experiment however during the soybean crop period the maximum air temperature remained above 30 c fig 1 which is ideal for a good amount of soil water evaporation averaged across n treatments leaf area at 70 das under ec and ecet was higher by 9 25 in 2016 and by 24 29 in 2018 crop season fig 2 higher leaf area upon exposure to elevated co2 has been reported by earlier authors lenka et al 2017 jin et al 2017 hence it is quite apparent that both gs and leaf area are the crucial factors regulating the profile soil moisture and crop et as observed in this study the transpiration rate was either higher or similar under ec and ecet treatments as compared to ambient fig 4 thus considering a higher leaf area under ec and ecet the amount of water loss through transpiration is ought to be higher if this is the case the higher soil moisture storage and reduced soil et under ec and ecet treatments is explained by reduction in the soil water evaporation component of et due to a significantly higher leaf area leading to a more ground cover increase in temperature along with co2 concentration is reported to increase the leaf temperature due to physiological forcing caused by a reduction in the stomatal conductance allen et al 2003 kimball 2016 increase in foliage temperature by 0 72 and 0 77 c per 1 0 c increase in chamber temperature at 350 and 700 μmol co2 mol 1 has been reported in soybean allen et al 2003 the same study showed an increase of foliage temperature by 0 7 1 4 c with doubling of co2 in the chambers having mid day air temperature in the range of 25 37 c significantly higher temperature under ec and ecet is in line with the reports of earlier workers averaged over the measurement dates leaf temperature in this study was higher by 2 65 c under ec and by 2 72 c under ecet fig 5 in most cases the leaf temperature was similar for ec and ecet but both showed higher leaf temperature than ambient this was because co2 elevation was done in both ec and ecet leaf temperature is primarily decided by transpiration the data indicates similar stomatal behaviour in terms of transpiration under both ec and ecet the additional temperature increase under ecet to by about 1 5 c was probably not high enough to show a difference in leaf temperature a reduced crop et and higher grain yield resulted in significantly higher wue under ec and ecet treatments over ambient table 2 the higher wue values in 2018 crop season as compared to 2016 was because of a higher grain yield and lower et in the former the 2018 crop season received less rainfall but was well distributed over the growing season and also the thermal regime was better fig 1 which led to a better soybean growth and yield li et al 2013 from a pot study reported 26 2 increase in wue due to elevated co2 in soybean on the contrary our field study showed 48 50 higher wue in 2016 and 37 39 higher wue in 2018 under ec and ecet treatments the significant interaction between climate and n indicated requirement of optimum n availability for achieving higher wue thus proving the second hypothesis the enhanced wue under ec and ecet treatments was because of a higher grain yield and lower crop et in these treatments as compared to ambient which was mostly attributed to higher grain yield upon exposure to elevated co2 however from the data it is quite clear that higher wue in these treatments is more attributed to increased grain yield rather than crop water use it was because the savings in crop water use was lower as compared to the gain in yield the crop et was lower under ec and ecet treatments maximum to the extent of 4 5 whereas the grain yield advantage over ambient was recorded to the extent of 32 47 5 conclusions the two years field study indicated effect of co2 and or temperature elevation to be favourable for soybean crop with yield advantage to the extent of 32 47 over ambient the study clearly showed elevation of co2 alone or in conjunction with elevated temperature to significantly reduce crop et enhance soil water profile and improve wue in soybean under sub tropical climate of central india declaration of

10746,accurate estimation of infiltration coefficients in surface irrigation is essential for proper design reducing water losses preventing erosion and increasing water use efficiency this study was conducted to evaluate various methods for estimating the coefficients of infiltration equations we have selected 17 different methods with better performance based on previous studies out of many methods which have been introduced for infiltration estimation in order to compare the methods 50 furrow data sets were selected which are different based on field and irrigation conditions the results indicated that the performance of the infiltration estimation methods is variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements amongst the two point methods the elliott and walker method with an average relative error re of 16 the vatankhah et al method re 16 between one point methods and the multilevel calibration method re 18 as compared with other computer based models were concluded as the most accurate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients the sensitivity analyses indicated that variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length inflow discharge and field slope keywords estimation evaluation infiltration equation surface irrigation 1 introduction water infiltration into the soil is a significant component considering in the design evaluation and simulation of an irrigation system it directly affects irrigation scheduling and water use efficiency hence the performance of an irrigation system is strongly influenced by infiltration essentially infiltration is a spatio temporal variation it requires a fairly large number of in field measurements and sampling that is time consuming and cost effective consequently the estimation of infiltration would be advantageous as an optimum various methods have been proposed to the approximate estimation of the infiltration coefficients holzapfel et al 1988 ebrahimian et al 2010 each of these methods has specific features and data requirements that are appropriate for particular circumstances and altered irrigation systems dialameh et al 2017 in this regard assessment of the different estimation methods is required for proper application in different field conditions dialameh et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the simplest way to determine water infiltration into the soil establishes based on a volume balance model that can supply proper outcomes for most of the problems all of the infiltration estimation methods were divided into three comprehensive groups on the basis of the structure and properties of models physical empirical and semi empirical models mishra et al 2003 sihag et al 2017 physical models are generally derived based on both mass conservation law and darcy s law the methods of richards 1931 and philip 1957 are classified as physical models empirical models are based on data collected from field and laboratory investigations the kostiakov 1932 equation is the most famous empirical model for determining infiltration lastly the semi empirical models are a synthesis of both empirical and physical models they contain a simple form of the continuity equation on the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration relation for instance the methods of holtan 1961 and grigorjev and iritz 1991 categorized as semi empirical models linking these three groups of infiltration models with volume balance theory various methods settled to estimate infiltration characteristics e g the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 the one point method of shepard et al 1993 and valiantzas et al 2001 several studies have been conducted to evaluate the various methods for estimating infiltration coefficients holzapfel et al 2004 investigated four methods the one point method shepard et al 1993 two point method elliott and walker 1982 advance method benami and ofen 1984 and furrow infiltrometer method walker 1989 for determining the infiltration constants of the kostiakov equation for two furrows with sizes 40 and 60 cm at the top based on data sets in chile the results showed that the index of soil structural stability of the kostiakov equation and the cumulative infiltration curve for a narrow furrow 40 cm did not depend on the type of method for determining the infiltration characteristics while for a wide furrow 60 cm the two point method indicates the best fit according to their results the one point method poorly determined the kostiakov constants mohammad 2006 evaluated three infiltration equations including horton kostiakov and philip in the northwest of iran the results showed that in order to determine the infiltration rate the horton equation is the highly recommended model for the studied region mailapalli et al 2008 provided a quick method using one point along water advance phase based on the volume balance equation and compared it to other methods such as shepard et al 1993 and the us soil conservation service scs focused method of valiantzas et al 2001 the results indicated that the proposed method estimated cumulative infiltration closer to the observed values the valiantzas et al 2001 method also concludes highly accurate the algorithm and the results of the proposed method showed that the proposed method used to estimate quickly and robustly the furrow infiltration parameters by using a single point along the water advance phase ebrahimian et al 2010 developed one point and two point methods as a quick way for estimating infiltration characteristics these two proposed methods also perused by two groups of data sets of furrow and border systems in comparison to some other quick developed methods by elliott and walker 1982 shepard et al 1993 valiantzas et al 2001 and mailapalli et al 2008 according to the results the elliott and walker method estimated advanced phase times with the greatest precision there was a minor difference between the shepard and new proposed one point methods the performance of the elliott and walker method and new proposed two point methods were better for furrows and borders respectively as compared to other estimation methods sihag et al 2017 compared the accuracy of three infiltration equations scs kostiakov and kostiakov lewis modified kostiakov under conditions of kurukshetra india their results indicated that the performance the kostiakov lewis equation was better than two other infiltration equation mattar et al 2015 reported that the empirical and infiltration equation based methods will entail as many equations under different field conditions their proposed way of estimating the infiltration is to use an artificial neural network ann model and they compared it with the two point method as described by elliott and walker 1982 the ann model which was developed is based on a back propagation algorithm and was validated for different furrow irrigation conditions as mentioned above infiltration is a significant and sensitive parameter in on farm water management if infiltration characteristics are not determined well irrigation performance would be overestimated mateos and oyonarte 2005 and nie et al 2019 although many methods have been developed to estimate soil infiltration characteristics it is necessary to conduct extensive and accurate studies to evaluate the wide range of various methods of estimating infiltration coefficients thus the aim of this paper was to evaluate different methods of estimating infiltration coefficients in particular we were interested in investigating the effect of slope soil texture and furrow length and irrigation parameters such as inflow discharge and cutoff time on the accuracies of seventeen methods 2 material and methods 2 1 theory one of the main issues to measure infiltration is evaluating infiltration parameters the prevalent equation combined with the infiltration equations is volume balance equation this technique assumes that the input volume of water in a specific time is equal to the sum of the infiltrated volume of water into the soil and storage volume on the soil surface lewis and milne 1938 the volume balance equation expressed as 1 q 0 t σ y a 0 x 0 x i d s where q 0 is the inflow discharge m3 min t is the time from the start of inflow min x is the waterfront advance m s is the distance reached by the advance in time t m a 0 is the cross section area of inflow m2 σ y is surface profile shape factor 0 77 and i is the cumulative infiltration per unit length m3 m we consider the main infiltration equations including kostiakov kostiakov lewis philip scs horton and linear infiltration function collis george 1977 in this study see table 1 most of these models use the assumption that advance curve can be approximated by a power law function as follows 2 x p t r where t is the opportunity time taken for wetting front to reach advance distance x and p and r are the constants that can be specified from logarithmic transformation of eq 2 and two measured points of advance curve table 2 shows the twelve general methods used for estimating infiltration volume elliott and walker 1982 benami and ofen 1984 shepard et al 1993 austin and prendergast 1997 upadhyaya and raghuwanshi 1999 valiantzas et al 2001

from hf1 to hf10 these data sets are different in terms of the measured data type such as advance and recession times and runoff discharge more details about the characteristics of the data sets can be obtained from the associated references infiltration characteristics related to each method were estimated by the 12 considered methods mentioned in tables 2 and 3 moreover in each furrow the infiltration volume v t approximated by the trapezoidal rule using the following equation walker and skogerboe 1987 ebrahimian et al 2010 3 v t i 1 n 1 l i z i z i 1 2 where n is the number of

are average of estimated and measured infiltration volume at total n furrows respectively 2 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis procedures detect whether parameters altered have a substantial impact on performance of the model or not if there is a little impact the model was simplified either by exchanging the related parameters to constants or removing them demaria et al 2007 the sensitivity analyses were accomplished to assess the effects of the infiltration equations and their coefficients with respect to the input parameters by two indices including relative sensitive and absolute sensitive s i r and s i a respectively calculated as follows 9 s i r 1 n i 1 n a i 10 s i a 1 n i 1 n a i where 10 a i x i x i 1 p i p i 1 x i x i 1 p i p i 1 consider that x i 1 is the value of the output parameter as input parameter is p i 1 by changing the input parameter from p i 1 to p i x i will be obtained moreover n is the number of output parameters in any equation or coefficient which the sensitivity is closer to zero is less sensitive liu et al 2007 according to the previous studies etedali et al 2011 ebrahimian 2014 furrow length inflow discharge and field slope are the most influential input parameters in the volume of infiltrated water as the output parameter therefore we keep other input parameters constant and steady except the advance time that changes with three different input parameters and caused indirect change in the output parameter obviously in comparison to the advance time determination of the equation between discharge and slope is uncertain and difficult hence we have decided to implement the sensitivity analysis of the above methods just in the furrow length parameter thus by increasing and decreasing the length by 25 followed by the advance time shifts according to the exponential equation of the advance phase we measured sensitivity of the volume of infiltration as the output parameter for three methods that have the lowest error 3 results 3 1 evaluation of models the values of indices to evaluate the estimation methods are presented in tables 5 and 6 the consequences indicate that the worst results of estimation were mostly obtained by upadhyaya and raghuwanshi 1999 method so that its re values are in the range of 41 178 and the average re is 58 describing the high amounts of error for this method among all other methods table 5 it is noteworthy that the sirmod and winsrfr models could not be used in combination with about half of the studied datasets which are marked by dash symbol in table 5 due to the required data limitation according to the average values of re presented in table 6 the best results for estimation of infiltration volume were achieved by both elliott and walker 1982 two point method and vatankhah et al 2009 one point method with the average amount of re equals to 16 according to table 6 the two point method of ebrahimian et al 2010 had the lowest values of rmse 4 5 m3 and nrmse 26 9 however the one point method of valiantzas et al 2001 had the highest value of rmse 18 3 m3 and nrmse 91 9 the highest value of the nse are related to the two point method of ebrahimian et al 2010 method of bautista et al 2009a and winsrfr model with values of 0 99 1 00 and 0 98 respectively while the one point method of valiantzas et al 2001 and the sipar id model had the lowest values of nse 3 2 comparison of measured and estimated values of infiltration volume after estimating the water infiltrated volume by the studied methods the linear plot of the measured water infiltrated volume against the estimated values is presented in fig 1 the comparison between measured and estimated two values is illustrated with the 1 1 line methods that make a reliable estimation of the volume of infiltrated water compared to its measured value have a small line spacing of 1 1 lines additionally if these values are exactly equal this line is on the matching graph according to fig 1 the two point method of ebrahimian et al 2010 and elliott and walker 1982 the second mohammadi s method mohammadi et al 2014 and the winsrfr computer model have the closest graph to the 1 1 line in addition the method of ebrahimian et al 2010 and the winsrfr computer model and the multilevel calibration method acquired the highest coefficient of determination with value of 0 993 0 980 and 0 978 respectively according the results of the current study the multilevel calibration method had higher accuracy for estimating of the infiltration volume as compared with other computer models 3 3 sensitivity analysis the average values of sia and sir corresponded to the absolute and relative sensitivity index respectively for two variations in furrow length with 25 increasing 25 and decreasing 25 are presented in table 7 for the 17 studied methods according to the results one point methods of shepard et al 1993 and mailapalli et al 2008 had the most sensitivity and linear method of austin and prendergast 1997 and the first mohammadi s proposed method mohammadi et al 2014 had the least sensitivity to the length changes in the furrows the reason for the negative amounts of the sir index for 25 reduction of the furrows length is getting negative of the numerator of the fraction eq 9 due to the lower amount of the first expression than the second term and the positive of the denominator in other words the numerator is equal to the difference of the output parameter that obtains by changing the input parameter and the output parameter without changing the value of the input parameter this output parameter is the infiltrated volume of water which is lower in the second case due to the length reduction the graph of the input variables and the re index is plotted in order to determine the relationship among the variables and re the three dimensional diagrams among the input variables and the re percentage were plotted by minitab software meyer and krueger 2001 to do this the two point method of ebrahimian et al 2010 and the multilevel calibration with relatively acceptable results were selected along with the elliott and walker 1982 method that is an important method for estimating infiltration coefficients input parameters such as length inflow discharge and field slope were chosen as the most important input parameters and the three dimensional diagram is drawn among them the relevance between soil texture and re is also plotted according to fig 2 for the ebrahimian et al 2010 method it concluded that if the length range is 300 400 m the inflow discharge is between 1 7 2 2 l s and slope is between 0 0075 0 009 then there will be the less re in estimating of the infiltration coefficients this method is also appropriate for the length between 870 950 m the inflow discharge between 2 0 2 2 l s and slope between 0 001 0 003 besides for this method the soil type analysis against the values of re showed that the average value of re was obtained 23 40 and 24 for soil textures classified as light sandy and sandy loam medium loam and sandy clay loam and heavy clay and silty clay loam types respectively according to fig 3 for the elliott and walker 1982 method it concluded that in furrow length between 870 950 m as well as 100 200 m and inflow discharge between 2 0 2 5 l s will have lower re values for the estimated infiltration coefficients furthermore this method is appropriate for the length between 200 300 m and slope between 0 005 and 0 007 furthermore the average value of re for light medium and heavy soil textures was 14 16 and 17 respectively for this method according to fig 4 for the multilevel calibration sirmod method it concluded that the low value of re was obtained for the length between 100 and 130 m with the inflow discharge between 0 2 0 4 l s and slope between 0 009 0 013 also in the length range of 180 220 m with an inflow discharge between 0 9 1 1 l s and slope of 0 008 0 010 there would be a proper estimation of the coefficients of the infiltration equation in addition the average value of re was 13 16 and 25 for light medium and heavy soil types respectively 4 discussion amongst the two point methods the elliott and walker method re 16 the vatankhah et al method re 16 between one point methods and the multilevel calibration method re 18 as compared with other computer based models were concluded as the most accurate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients in overall the one point method of valiantzas et al 2001 attends a poor performance this is perhaps due to the use of trial and error process in estimating the infiltration coefficients moreover the equation presented for this method is sensitive to the initial value of the exponent of the scs infiltration equation a in the trial and error process in this way if the initial value a is changed then infiltration coefficients will be also changed additionally the method presented by mailapalli et al 2008 yields less accurate estimation for infiltration coefficients the reason for this is related to sensitivity of this method to the initial values of the exponent of the kostiakov lewis equation a and the exponent of power advance equation r as reported by vatankhah et al 2009 the method of benami and ofen 1984 totally provides a satisfactory outcome the slight error in this method is due to the low accuracy fitted discharge data and the advance time of water along the furrow similarly the method of bautista et al 2009a presented satisfactory results perhaps the trial and error process in determining the infiltration coefficients using the equations presented in this method is the reason of error occurrence although the linear method austin and prendergast 1997 has a simple infiltration equation and generally possesses fine performance in cracking clay soils it underestimated water infiltrated volume in most of the cases holzapfel et al 1988 conducted a study to obtain the parameters of the infiltration equation by four different methods their results showed that the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 is more appropriate and capable in comparison to the one point method of shepard et al 1993 for estimating the infiltration coefficients furthermore six different methods for estimating the infiltration coefficients were evaluated and compared in a study by khatri and smith 2005 their results showed that the infilt model was the most accurate method and the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 had also a good performance moravejalahkami et al 2012 concluded that multilevel optimization method estimated the infiltration equation parameters better than elliott and walker 1982 two point method methods such as a valiantzas et al 2001 mailapalli et al 2008 and the sipar id model had poor performance in estimating the water infiltrated volume because they do not estimate the steady infiltration rate therefore the amount of the estimated infiltrated water is less than its observed amount fig 1 etedali et al 2011 compared three models of evalue sipar id and infilt to estimate the infiltration coefficients the results showed that the evalue and sipar id models had the least re in estimating the volume of water infiltrated into the soil under the end closed condition in the end open mode the sipar id model was highly accurate moreover the results showed that the accuracy of all three models especially the infilt model in the cutback flow regime was lower than in the constant inflow regime ebrahimian 2014 investigated iparm infilt and elliott and walker s two point method for estimating the parameters of the kostiakov lewis equation the results showed that the iparm model is the most accurate and reliable method the sensitivity analyses indicated that variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length inflow discharge and field slope in general each three studied method had better performance for light soil textures as compared to other soil textures 5 conclusion in this study we evaluated 17 different methods for estimating infiltration parameters in furrow irrigation according to the various evaluation indicators i e re r2 rmse nrmse and nse the two point methods of elliott and walker 1982 and ebrahimian et al 2010 and the multilevel calibration sirmod were introduced as appropriate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients however the upadhyaya and raghuwanshi 1999 method with an average re of 58 had the poorest performance among all methods moreover the sipar id computer model with an average re of 31 had the poorest performance among all computer models the results of the sensitivity analysis of the estimation methods showed that the one point method of mailapalli et al 2008 and shepard et al 1993 had the most sensitivity to the length of furrow however the linear method of austin and prendergast 1997 and the mohammadi s first proposed method had the least sensitivity to the furrow length changes based on the results of this study it concluded that in the areas where the irrigation cutoff time and the furrow length is low the use of volume based methods is not appropriate the volume based methods usually use last constant infiltration rate f 0 consequently the error is expected by increasing f 0 similarly in the methods using exponential equation in advance phase the error would be expected where there is the high slope low length of the furrow and heavy soil texture because advance equation will be more linear this study indicated that the performance of the infiltration estimation methods is variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements as a consequence it is necessary to find the best estimation method s for each specific field in order to optimal design and management of surface irrigation systems to prevent over irrigation or under irrigation deficit irrigation of crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10746,accurate estimation of infiltration coefficients in surface irrigation is essential for proper design reducing water losses preventing erosion and increasing water use efficiency this study was conducted to evaluate various methods for estimating the coefficients of infiltration equations we have selected 17 different methods with better performance based on previous studies out of many methods which have been introduced for infiltration estimation in order to compare the methods 50 furrow data sets were selected which are different based on field and irrigation conditions the results indicated that the performance of the infiltration estimation methods is variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements amongst the two point methods the elliott and walker method with an average relative error re of 16 the vatankhah et al method re 16 between one point methods and the multilevel calibration method re 18 as compared with other computer based models were concluded as the most accurate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients the sensitivity analyses indicated that variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length inflow discharge and field slope keywords estimation evaluation infiltration equation surface irrigation 1 introduction water infiltration into the soil is a significant component considering in the design evaluation and simulation of an irrigation system it directly affects irrigation scheduling and water use efficiency hence the performance of an irrigation system is strongly influenced by infiltration essentially infiltration is a spatio temporal variation it requires a fairly large number of in field measurements and sampling that is time consuming and cost effective consequently the estimation of infiltration would be advantageous as an optimum various methods have been proposed to the approximate estimation of the infiltration coefficients holzapfel et al 1988 ebrahimian et al 2010 each of these methods has specific features and data requirements that are appropriate for particular circumstances and altered irrigation systems dialameh et al 2017 in this regard assessment of the different estimation methods is required for proper application in different field conditions dialameh et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the simplest way to determine water infiltration into the soil establishes based on a volume balance model that can supply proper outcomes for most of the problems all of the infiltration estimation methods were divided into three comprehensive groups on the basis of the structure and properties of models physical empirical and semi empirical models mishra et al 2003 sihag et al 2017 physical models are generally derived based on both mass conservation law and darcy s law the methods of richards 1931 and philip 1957 are classified as physical models empirical models are based on data collected from field and laboratory investigations the kostiakov 1932 equation is the most famous empirical model for determining infiltration lastly the semi empirical models are a synthesis of both empirical and physical models they contain a simple form of the continuity equation on the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration relation for instance the methods of holtan 1961 and grigorjev and iritz 1991 categorized as semi empirical models linking these three groups of infiltration models with volume balance theory various methods settled to estimate infiltration characteristics e g the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 the one point method of shepard et al 1993 and valiantzas et al 2001 several studies have been conducted to evaluate the various methods for estimating infiltration coefficients holzapfel et al 2004 investigated four methods the one point method shepard et al 1993 two point method elliott and walker 1982 advance method benami and ofen 1984 and furrow infiltrometer method walker 1989 for determining the infiltration constants of the kostiakov equation for two furrows with sizes 40 and 60 cm at the top based on data sets in chile the results showed that the index of soil structural stability of the kostiakov equation and the cumulative infiltration curve for a narrow furrow 40 cm did not depend on the type of method for determining the infiltration characteristics while for a wide furrow 60 cm the two point method indicates the best fit according to their results the one point method poorly determined the kostiakov constants mohammad 2006 evaluated three infiltration equations including horton kostiakov and philip in the northwest of iran the results showed that in order to determine the infiltration rate the horton equation is the highly recommended model for the studied region mailapalli et al 2008 provided a quick method using one point along water advance phase based on the volume balance equation and compared it to other methods such as shepard et al 1993 and the us soil conservation service scs focused method of valiantzas et al 2001 the results indicated that the proposed method estimated cumulative infiltration closer to the observed values the valiantzas et al 2001 method also concludes highly accurate the algorithm and the results of the proposed method showed that the proposed method used to estimate quickly and robustly the furrow infiltration parameters by using a single point along the water advance phase ebrahimian et al 2010 developed one point and two point methods as a quick way for estimating infiltration characteristics these two proposed methods also perused by two groups of data sets of furrow and border systems in comparison to some other quick developed methods by elliott and walker 1982 shepard et al 1993 valiantzas et al 2001 and mailapalli et al 2008 according to the results the elliott and walker method estimated advanced phase times with the greatest precision there was a minor difference between the shepard and new proposed one point methods the performance of the elliott and walker method and new proposed two point methods were better for furrows and borders respectively as compared to other estimation methods sihag et al 2017 compared the accuracy of three infiltration equations scs kostiakov and kostiakov lewis modified kostiakov under conditions of kurukshetra india their results indicated that the performance the kostiakov lewis equation was better than two other infiltration equation mattar et al 2015 reported that the empirical and infiltration equation based methods will entail as many equations under different field conditions their proposed way of estimating the infiltration is to use an artificial neural network ann model and they compared it with the two point method as described by elliott and walker 1982 the ann model which was developed is based on a back propagation algorithm and was validated for different furrow irrigation conditions as mentioned above infiltration is a significant and sensitive parameter in on farm water management if infiltration characteristics are not determined well irrigation performance would be overestimated mateos and oyonarte 2005 and nie et al 2019 although many methods have been developed to estimate soil infiltration characteristics it is necessary to conduct extensive and accurate studies to evaluate the wide range of various methods of estimating infiltration coefficients thus the aim of this paper was to evaluate different methods of estimating infiltration coefficients in particular we were interested in investigating the effect of slope soil texture and furrow length and irrigation parameters such as inflow discharge and cutoff time on the accuracies of seventeen methods 2 material and methods 2 1 theory one of the main issues to measure infiltration is evaluating infiltration parameters the prevalent equation combined with the infiltration equations is volume balance equation this technique assumes that the input volume of water in a specific time is equal to the sum of the infiltrated volume of water into the soil and storage volume on the soil surface lewis and milne 1938 the volume balance equation expressed as 1 q 0 t σ y a 0 x 0 x i d s where q 0 is the inflow discharge m3 min t is the time from the start of inflow min x is the waterfront advance m s is the distance reached by the advance in time t m a 0 is the cross section area of inflow m2 σ y is surface profile shape factor 0 77 and i is the cumulative infiltration per unit length m3 m we consider the main infiltration equations including kostiakov kostiakov lewis philip scs horton and linear infiltration function collis george 1977 in this study see table 1 most of these models use the assumption that advance curve can be approximated by a power law function as follows 2 x p t r where t is the opportunity time taken for wetting front to reach advance distance x and p and r are the constants that can be specified from logarithmic transformation of eq 2 and two measured points of advance curve table 2 shows the twelve general methods used for estimating infiltration volume elliott and walker 1982 benami and ofen 1984 shepard et al 1993 austin and prendergast 1997 upadhyaya and raghuwanshi 1999 valiantzas et al 2001

be obtained from the associated references infiltration characteristics related to each method were estimated by the 12 considered methods mentioned in tables 2 and 3 moreover in each furrow the infiltration volume v t approximated by the trapezoidal rule using the following equation walker and skogerboe 1987 ebrahimian et al 2010 3 v t i 1 n 1 l i z i z i 1 2 where n is the number of stations l i is the distance between two sequential stations m and z i and z i 1 are the cumulative infiltration m3 m for i and i 1 stations respectively for evaluating the aforementioned methods the

infiltration coefficients furthermore this method is appropriate for the length between 200 300 m and slope between 0 005 and 0 007 furthermore the average value of re for light medium and heavy soil textures was 14 16 and 17 respectively for this method according to fig 4 for the multilevel calibration sirmod method it concluded that the low value of re was obtained for the length between 100 and 130 m with the inflow discharge between 0 2 0 4 l s and slope between 0 009 0 013 also in the length range of 180 220 m with an inflow discharge between 0 9 1 1 l s and slope of 0 008 0 010 there would be a proper estimation of the coefficients of the infiltration equation in addition the average value of re was 13 16 and 25 for light medium and heavy soil types respectively 4 discussion amongst the two point methods the elliott and walker method re 16 the vatankhah et al method re 16 between one point methods and the multilevel calibration method re 18 as compared with other computer based models were concluded as the most accurate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients in overall the one point method of valiantzas et al 2001 attends a poor performance this is perhaps due to the use of trial and error process in estimating the infiltration coefficients moreover the equation presented for this method is sensitive to the initial value of the exponent of the scs infiltration equation a in the trial and error process in this way if the initial value a is changed then infiltration coefficients will be also changed additionally the method presented by mailapalli et al 2008 yields less accurate estimation for infiltration coefficients the reason for this is related to sensitivity of this method to the initial values of the exponent of the kostiakov lewis equation a and the exponent of power advance equation r as reported by vatankhah et al 2009 the method of benami and ofen 1984 totally provides a satisfactory outcome the slight error in this method is due to the low accuracy fitted discharge data and the advance time of water along the furrow similarly the method of bautista et al 2009a presented satisfactory results perhaps the trial and error process in determining the infiltration coefficients using the equations presented in this method is the reason of error occurrence although the linear method austin and prendergast 1997 has a simple infiltration equation and generally possesses fine performance in cracking clay soils it underestimated water infiltrated volume in most of the cases holzapfel et al 1988 conducted a study to obtain the parameters of the infiltration equation by four different methods their results showed that the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 is more appropriate and capable in comparison to the one point method of shepard et al 1993 for estimating the infiltration coefficients furthermore six different methods for estimating the infiltration coefficients were evaluated and compared in a study by khatri and smith 2005 their results showed that the infilt model was the most accurate method and the two point method of elliott and walker 1982 had also a good performance moravejalahkami et al 2012 concluded that multilevel optimization method estimated the infiltration equation parameters better than elliott and walker 1982 two point method methods such as a valiantzas et al 2001 mailapalli et al 2008 and the sipar id model had poor performance in estimating the water infiltrated volume because they do not estimate the steady infiltration rate therefore the amount of the estimated infiltrated water is less than its observed amount fig 1 etedali et al 2011 compared three models of evalue sipar id and infilt to estimate the infiltration coefficients the results showed that the evalue and sipar id models had the least re in estimating the volume of water infiltrated into the soil under the end closed condition in the end open mode the sipar id model was highly accurate moreover the results showed that the accuracy of all three models especially the infilt model in the cutback flow regime was lower than in the constant inflow regime ebrahimian 2014 investigated iparm infilt and elliott and walker s two point method for estimating the parameters of the kostiakov lewis equation the results showed that the iparm model is the most accurate and reliable method the sensitivity analyses indicated that variations in relative error for estimating infiltration parameters are a function of soil texture furrow length inflow discharge and field slope in general each three studied method had better performance for light soil textures as compared to other soil textures 5 conclusion in this study we evaluated 17 different methods for estimating infiltration parameters in furrow irrigation according to the various evaluation indicators i e re r2 rmse nrmse and nse the two point methods of elliott and walker 1982 and ebrahimian et al 2010 and the multilevel calibration sirmod were introduced as appropriate methods for estimating infiltration coefficients however the upadhyaya and raghuwanshi 1999 method with an average re of 58 had the poorest performance among all methods moreover the sipar id computer model with an average re of 31 had the poorest performance among all computer models the results of the sensitivity analysis of the estimation methods showed that the one point method of mailapalli et al 2008 and shepard et al 1993 had the most sensitivity to the length of furrow however the linear method of austin and prendergast 1997 and the mohammadi s first proposed method had the least sensitivity to the furrow length changes based on the results of this study it concluded that in the areas where the irrigation cutoff time and the furrow length is low the use of volume based methods is not appropriate the volume based methods usually use last constant infiltration rate f 0 consequently the error is expected by increasing f 0 similarly in the methods using exponential equation in advance phase the error would be expected where there is the high slope low length of the furrow and heavy soil texture because advance equation will be more linear this study indicated that the performance of the infiltration estimation methods is variable because of various field conditions and required data requirements as a consequence it is necessary to find the best estimation method s for each specific field in order to optimal design and management of surface irrigation systems to prevent over irrigation or under irrigation deficit irrigation of crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10747,in this paper a first evidence is provided that the targeted control of adaptive plant behavior for irrigation purposes is possible the objective is aligning plant growth to water availability and not vice versa and utilizing training mechanisms to affect the relation between water use and plant growth the approach is based on the experimental specification of two water deficit related behavioral patterns memory of stress and point of no return damage mild stress duration has to be shorter than 2 7 days to avoid irreversible growth rate reduction maximum stress duration time water stress information is stored memorized by the plant for three days at most maximum water stress memory time therefore adequate stress stimuli have to be repeated within this period to maintain training effect exceeding maximum memory time without stimulus results in a drop of water based growth performance g r o w t h c m w a t e r g back to the level of untrained plants in control experiments two different plant growth performance ranges were identified hydrological time performance range without activated memory and usage bound performance range in memorized states usage bound growth performance range shows 47 higher water based growth performance than hydrological time based an open loop control approach is developed to control growth and water consumption using the intended alternation between the two performance ranges the plant behavior due to water stress is modelled as a state machine method of a conditioned automaton control engineering representing directly the control algorithm based on the statistical validation results it can be concluded that training plants with intended stress sequences allows the control of plant growth and water use keywords water stress maize zea mays stress memory state machine modeling deficit irrigation water use 1 introduction the increasing number and dimension of drought events threaten food security for an increasing world population sivakumar et al 2014 flörke et al 2018 the development of new water saving technologies and procedures is required to reduce freshwater consumption in irrigated agriculture greenland et al 2018 malek and verburg 2018 one option to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is to improve plant water consumption exploiting the plants natural capabilities to adapt to unfavorable conditions araus et al 2012 ruggiero et al 2017 1 1 aim of the study in this contribution an approach is presented allowing in the final stage the control of plant growth using specific irrigation sequences core of the control approach is the knowledge about the precise plant growth behavior caused by varying water supplies this model is the basis for formulating the control algorithm providing all alternative irrigation sequences the latter can then be used to optimize or to control the output here growth or water use the aim of this approach is to directly control growth yield instead of controlling e g the water availability in the soil this approach provides the missing link to model plant dynamic growth behavior for a controlled deficit irrigation 1 2 deficit irrigation method deficit irrigation is a cultivation method irrigating crops below maximum plant water demand level fereres and soriano 2007 davies et al 2011 this is implemented by applying less irrigating events reduced water quantities or by methods like partial root zone drying kögler and söffker 2017 deficit irrigation experiments with different crops have shown that agricultural irrigation water savings of up to 40 are possible at yield reductions of 5 7 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 geerts and raes 2009 ahmadi et al 2014 extrapolating the experimentally measured water savings due to deficit irrigation instead of full irrigation in citrus orchards tejero et al 2011 the water saving potential for e g just half of the european citrus production could sum up to 0 16 km3 year kögler and söffker 2017 at a fresh water per capita consumption of 120 l water person day germany 2013 destatis statistisches bundesamt 2017 these water savings could supply about 1 3 million people per year with fresh water water saving potentials differ of course substantially between species and cultivars relativizing these numbers in daryanto et al 2016 for instance the evaluation of data from peer reviewed publications of the years 1980 2015 showed a higher sensitivity of maize to water deficits compared to wheat with approximately double yield reduction as a result of a 40 water reduction however any water saving potential is worth using considering climate change and fresh water scarcity 1 3 irrigation control problem major challenge for sustainable application of deficit irrigation methods is to control the plants related to their individually optimal water supply state s this control problem requires establishing a feedback structure including the plant system model instead of e g only soil based water availability control for instance with tensiometer generally models describing yield formation subject to water inputs are available e g aquacrop crop water productivity model fao steduto et al 2008 in these models plants response to water deficits is given with a set of linear yield reduction functions for the different developmental stages reflecting the effects of water stress on yield changes in time dynamics of environmental factors e g evaporative conditions are considered in the models by iterative steps one to few days per step brisson et al 2006 however the application of these crop models for deficit irrigation optimization purposes are limited because of the very small number of plant based parameters describing the relation between water input and growth yield response kloss et al 2012 linker et al 2016 the parameter used in these crop models are soil or evapotranspiration based neglecting the dynamics time behavior of plants like compensation effects or training using an adequate model of dynamic plant behavior the introduction of the plant system into the control loop would provide the opportunity to pursue different water based optimization strategies e g alignment of growth to predicted precipitation irrigation events included into a control loop input water output growth yield the water supply state determination must relate directly to growth yield factors so that the commonly used water supply states full irrigation mild stress and high stress can be determined by plant based variables representing growth or yield formation the distinction of the different states must be defined by relevant thresholds to date most stress related thresholds for plant based output variables described in literature refer to stress initiation i e transition of well watered state to a state of first stress symptoms williams and araujo 2002 jones 2004 2007 plant based thresholds for the transition of a mild stress state to a high stress state or an evaluation whether the detected symptom still belongs to a mild stress state or already to a high stress state are described in few cases as e g in ben gal et al 2010 if plants are able to cope with certain suboptimal environmental conditions and to recover from deficit situations the pure identification of a stress initiation is not sufficient to develop control approaches comprising adaptive behavior as the behavior beyond stress initiation is not covered 1 4 background water stress memory acclimation training during ontogeny plants adapt to environmental stress stimuli of a water deficit by different response and memory mechanisms meyer et al 2014 martinez medina et al 2016 lämke and bäurle 2017 in periods of mild water deficits the plant reduces growth and compensates the reduced growth after re irrigation chai et al 2016 mild stress is further assumed to accelerate growth compared to full irrigated plants whereas high stress is assumed to cause the opposite brisson and delécolle 1991 responses to water deficits occur on different levels of organization cell tissue organ whole plant the various processes involved e g sustained root growth or stomatal closure aim either at improved water uptake or at reduced water releases hsiao 1973 bray 1997 lösch 2003 steduto et al 2009 two types of memory mechanisms can be distinguished according to trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 the first type is termed habituation thompson and spencer 1966 priming conrath et al 2009 or learning thellier 2017 gagliano et al 2018 information storage time is time scaled in seconds to few days the stored information is the characteristic of the stimulus memorization is expressed by an adjusted modified stimulus transduction of a re experienced stress stimulus second type of memory is termed storage and recall information storage time is time scaled in days to months here the stored information is not the stimulus itself but the type of response to the stimulus e g the metabolic reaction memorization is expressed by a rapid re activation of an integrated response to a set of stimuli this classification of memory processes is not always distinct transitions between the forms are possible trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 acclimation processes include sensing e g of increasing negative soil water potential response e g production of abscisic acid aba memory initialization e g by priming or epigenetic modification and recall of stored information lichtenthaler 1996 trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 li and liu 2016 acclimation can decrease response time martinez medina et al 2016 desensitize overreaction or sensitize stress sensing thellier and lu 2013 reduce response intensity ding et al 2012 or increase metabolic reaction wang et al 2014 when stress is re experienced acclimated plants show higher resilience to re experienced environmental stress stimuli compared to not adapted plants also increasingly if plants are exposed to repeated stress stimuli training ding et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2014 caldeira et al 2014 wang et al 2014 established models describing non neuronal training processes are the super compensation model jakovlev 1977 or the strain stress adaptation model schnabel et al 2003 in sport science both models illustrate how acclimation processes take effect after a training sequence a stress stimulus results initially in a fatigue of the affected system e g muscle organ structure after recovery the system develops a proficiency level higher compared to the original one supercompensation this increased proficiency level can be decreasingly maintained over a certain period memory if the stress stimulus is repeated during a system specific period the proficiency level can be further increased training otherwise it drops back to the original level these models are used to optimize the sequence of strain and recovery to control performance parameter like endurance or resilience jakovlev 1977 schnabel et al 2003 1 5 approach and structure of the contribution in this contribution the described ability of plants to increase proficiency level after experienced stress training is tested and quantified in different experiments based on experimental results the controllability of plant growth by means of irrigation sequencing is demonstrated and the use of specific training sequences for different control targets is shown in this novel approach control engineering methodology is applied to the water input growth output relation of plants demonstrating for the first time the potential to control growth by water input variations to improve water efficiency in irrigated agriculture the results of the study contribute to the formulation of new irrigation control strategies reducing water dissipation in irrigated agriculture this contribution is structured as follows in section 2 the experimental set up 2 1 the measurements 2 2 and the data processing procedure 2 3 are specified in section 3 the model for adaptive plant behavior is presented 3 1 the model parametrization is given 3 2 and based on that the open loop water based growth control approach is described 3 3 the investigated control strategies refer to the output variables growth and water use in section 4 the control results are presented first a comparison of state based growth behavior scatterplots is shown 4 1 second hypothesis testing results are given 4 2 and third control results for different control sequences are presented 4 3 in section 5 the approach is discussed regarding potential field application and future work finally in section 6 a brief conclusion for the presented study is given 2 methods 2 1 concept of positive stress training based on the described physiological relations cf section 1 1 following conceptual understanding of the physiological relations due to soil substrate desiccation is used to model adaptive plant behavior due to water stress fig 1 soil water content is considered to represent the sensed signal by the plant minor variations in water availability in the soil in terms of water deficit duration or severity are assumed to be unacknowledged by plants as long as the signal value e g soil water potential remains below a certain response threshold a signal value exceeding this response threshold is supposed to lead to the sensing of a reduced water availability which requires acclimation in behavior to perpetuate operativeness acclimation includes reactions like stomatal closure acclimation to immediate stimuli as well as memory initiation acclimation to future stimuli this acclimation to water deficits is assumed to be possible and growth limitations are reversible as long as a certain recuperation threshold for physiological processes is not reached here recuperation denotes the ability of the plant to perpetuate operativeness despite reduced input quantities beyond this recuperation threshold the plant is expected to experience injuries which are not reversible and leading to a sustained limitation in growth and development point of no return therefore three aspects of the described physiological relations are relevant for the presented approach model the specific sensitivity of the growth process to water deficits the ability of plants to memorize stress events for training purposes and the reversibility or not of experienced growth effects based on this conceptual understanding the desiccation of soil can be distinguished into three discrete water content levels regarding the resulting water stress for plants stress levels first stress level no stress below response threshold second stress level mild stress between response and recuperation threshold representing a positive stress and third stress level high stress above recuperation threshold therefore the model of plant dynamic behavior is based on the experimental parametrization of these two thresholds response and recuperation threshold 2 2 experimental set up the presented experiments were implemented under laboratory conditions and concentrate on modelling parametrization and validation of the control approach the test rig consists of four growth stations blocks placed in a rectangle and consisting of tables with superstructures for illumination irrigation measurements and plant positioning each block is illuminated with a bank of lights 2x phillips tc l 75 w and illumination is automated with a clock timer 14 h per day light conditions in the experiments are at a lower level comparable to cloudy days in early spring in norther regions but sufficient to grow seedlings for the proposed duration the blocks groups of plants were randomly chosen for the different irrigation treatments and randomly selected from the four different positions to avoid systematic errors due to the block location air temperature air humidity and ventilation are managed by university building equipment pre controlled ambient temperature and ventilation system environmental parameters were maintained fixed within certain ranges c f table 1 and apply equally to all plants despite certain variability of air humidity in the laboratory the daily evapotranspiration rate etr plant plus substrate remained similar among the different experiments seven irrigation experiments were implemented with maize plants zea mays ronaldinio kws vegetative stage ec11 ec15 v1 v5 each experiment had a duration of 15 20 days maize was chosen for the presented study as deficit irrigation of maize is in scientific focus comas et al 2019 rudnick et al 2019 although being an annual and not particularly a cash crop like e g vegetables or a woody crop maize is generally adopted to dry environments although the dimension of growth yield reductions due to water stress is different depending on drought tolerance of the specific cultivar the experiments were performed at early vegetative stages ec11 ec15 v1 v5 and the transfer of the results to subsequent phenological stages should be included in further studies the vegetative stage in total is considered to be largely uncritical for yield formation grant et al 1989 recent deficit irrigation studies for maize investigate more in detail the stage based water use behavior comas et al 2019 at the beginning of the experiments the seeds were sown 4 cm deep into pots filled with 65 g seramis clay granulate maximum water holding capacity of a pot with 65 g seramis clay granulate is about 60 65 g water no free water at the bottom of the pots therefore substrate water content wc for full irrigation no water stress is set at a substrate water content of 60 g ml the sample per experiment comprises 20 individual plants divided into four groups a b c d of 5 plants each in each experiment one or two groups of plants were fully irrigated daily refill of et up to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate of 60 g and considered to serve as comparison groups the other groups were exposed to different water deficit schedules irrigation water was applied manually and accurate to one gram with an injection 2 3 measurements substrate water content wc in g input variable was determined gravimetrically sauter precision balance by subtracting dry weight of the potted systems before first irrigation from total weight in the particular point in time leaf lengths of all leaves tll in cm output variable were measured manually with a ruler these measurements were done once to three times per day and summated to daily values where appropriate air temperature and humidity were regularly measured by a standard digital hygro thermometer additionally time of leaf appearance was noted additional variables are calculated for analytical purposes based on the measured input variable substrate water content the cumulative water content cwc in g and the evapotranspiration rate etr in g d are determined here cwc denotes the initially measured water content at experiment start initial water supply at instant of time t0 plus total water applications up to the specific point in time total water supply at instant of time ti and etr denotes the substrate water content differential per day 24 h water content in instant of time ti minus water content in instant of time ti 1 without water application based on the measured output variable total leaf length the total leaf elongation rate tler in cm d can be determined denoted as the total leaf length differential per day 24 h further the quotient of total leaf elongation rate per evapotranspiration rate t l e r e t r in cm g was determined which denote growth performance i e water use efficiency 2 4 data processing in fig 2 examples of four different time series of irrigation sequences and corresponding growth behaviors are shown to explain the basic principle of the implemented data processing procedure target of this procedure is the distinction and definition of the plants water supply states based on the specific growth behavior the states are defined by the state variables stress memory and damage level distinguishing each state from the others here states are discrete entities the plant is always in exactly one state states can be figuratively circumscribed as a physiological shape of the plant e g stressed or not trained or not as an example this procedure can be compared to the definition of states for an elevator visible at the floor level display state variables would be the level ground 1st or 2nd floor and the door condition open or closed as the variable floor can take three values and the door opening can take two values this sums up to a total of 3 2 6 potential states for the elevator the discretization of the continuous process of an elevator going up or down or a door opening or closing is defined by conditions thresholds for instance by the distances between the elevator and the two successive floors or by the degree of aperture step 1 definition of state variables a stress level as described above the response threshold is defined by the onset of growth reduction due to a water deficit therefore the response threshold is determined at the water content level at which test plants showed initially a reduced growth rate leaf elongation rate after water withdrawal compared to reference plants the response threshold was determined experimentally at approximately 40 g 45 g substrate water content fig 2 top point a in fig 2 bottom the growth reduction can be seen at point a where leaf elongation rate of all stressed plants all broken lines is constantly decreasing compared to the leaf elongation rate of unstressed plants solid line the recuperation threshold is defined as point of no return at which the progressed water deficit leads to an irreversible growth reduction because of a damage the recuperation threshold is determined experimentally at approximately 20 g 25 g substrate water content fig 2 top point b this point in time is located at an approximated period one to two days before re irrigation of these plants as the point of no return has to be prior to this specific time of re irrigation otherwise the plants would have recovered in this case in fig 2 bottom this irreversibility in growth behavior can be seen at point b where plants exposed to high stress did not show a recovery of growth rate after re irrigation dotted line plants of this group do even not show substantially higher leaf elongation rates than plants experiencing maximum stress with zero g substrate water content fig 2 points c the two thresholds divide the water content scale fig 2 top into three ranges defined as stress level l 0 l0 for no stress stress level l 1 l1 for mild stress and stress level l 2 l2 for high stress the state variable stress level l can therefore take the values 0 1 or 2 these numbers are used to define irrigation sequences a sequence of l 0 1 2 0 for instance describes a sequence starting in stress level l0 above response threshold full irrigated followed by substrate desiccation till initially the response threshold is passed stress level l1 and further till recuperation threshold is passed stress level l2 re irrigation results in a switch back to stress level l0 an overview about the performed irrigation strategies which denote stress level trajectories for the seven experiments is given in table 1 a memory level this parameter represents the plant s capacity for remembering memory after experiencing mild stress and is based on the physiological processes of stress memory described above during the presented experiments it was observed that plants re experiencing a mild stress shortly after an initial mild stress reacted later and less to an anew mild stress compared to plants without this pretreatment training it was also observed that if the stress stimulus was not repeated within a certain period the plants behaved like untrained control plants the parameter memory is correspondingly defined as follows memory is activated in stress level l1 mild stress and deactivated in stress level l0 no stress if a re activation training does not take place in due time maximum memory time tm this means if the time period between successive stress levels l1 denoted as tl1i l1j is longer than memory time tm the capacity for remembering is deactivated reversible the parameter denotes the adaptive behavior of growth recuperation after a mild stress recovery and can take the values memory off m0 memory level m 0 or memory on m1 memory level m 1 c f fig 2 test plants mild stress dashed line recovery after day 8 b damage level this parameter represents the existence of a plant s dysfunction damage after experiencing high stress in the presented experiments it was observed that plants experiencing high stress stress level l 2 did not recover in terms of leaf elongation rate even after several days of full irrigation it was further monitored that a mild stress stress level l 1 lasting for several days also lead to irreversible decreases in leaf elongation rates the parameter damage is therefore defined as follows damage is activated either in stress level l2 high stress or in stress level l1 mild stress lasting for more than a critical time duration the latter means if the time duration of an experienced mild stress stress duration time tl1 is longer than a maximum affordable stress duration time td a dysfunction is eventuated once activated this parameter cannot be deactivated not reversible the parameter denotes the physiological injury caused by a stress beyond recuperation threshold resulting in a sustained growth reduction after re irrigation no recovery and can take the values no damage d0 damage level d 0 or damage d1 damage level d 1 c f fig 2 test plants high stress dotted line no recovery after day 10 step 2 labeling of measurement data depending on the irrigation sequence the values of the state variables change every time when a threshold or time limit has been passed or the sequence of states has been altered this results in a segmentation of the measurement time series according to the corresponding values of the state variables for example at the beginning of the experiment all plants were fully irrigated up to the point where the water content of the test plants reached response threshold cf fig 2 day 5 up to this point all measurement points are labeled with the vector 0 0 0 for no stress memory off damage off as soon as the test plants passed the response threshold and as long as no other limit has been passed cf fig 2 day 5 8 the measurement data for these test plants are labeled with the vector 1 1 0 for mild stress memory on damage off by this procedure all data were labeled resulting in a segmentation of the time series step 3 definition of states the measurement time series of all plants were split into the data segments resulting from the labeling procedure and then grouped according to the labels irrespective of individual plant or time each data group is defined as a state hence the plant states s are described by the vector s l m d t with l stress level as a function of water demand and water availability m memory level as a function of l1 and tl1i l1j d damage level as a function of l2 and tl1 tl1i l1j time between the successive stress levels l1i and l1j and tl1 time duration of stress level l1 at this point of data processing a change in analytical perspective takes place the original measurements are plant based time series the resulting data are state based plant and time independent representations of the specific physiological shape 3 control approach 3 1 deficit irrigation state machine model in fig 3 the state machine model method of a conditioned automaton control engineering describing plant growth subject to irrigation treatments is shown this model represents the basis for the growth control approach starting point for the state machine model is state s1 representing a plant which did not experience any water stress before state s1 is denoted as 0 0 0 for no stress memory off damage off withdrawal of water resulting in an exceedance of the response threshold stress level l1 l 1 leads initially to a transition from state s1 to the memory initiating state s2 denoted as 1 1 0 for mild stress memory on damage off henceforward the state transitions depend on irrigation schedule re irrigation return to stress level l0 l 0 initiates the transition to state s1a 0 1 0 alternatively further water withdrawal resulting in an exceedance of the recuperation threshold advance to stress level l2 l 2 initiates the transition to the damage initiating state s3 2 1 1 or constant mild stress continuation in stress level l1 l 1 results in transition to the damage initiating state s2a 1 1 1 further transitions along the depicted model states operate correspondingly end point for the state machine model is not defined as model target is an intended deficit irrigation till harvest model characteristics and assumed growth behavior of the different states are s1 vector 0 0 0 reference growth behavior comparison values s2 vector 1 1 0 reversibly reduced growth s3 vector 2 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth s1a vector 0 1 0 increased growth s1b vector 0 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth s1c vector 0 0 1 irreversibly reduced growth s2a vector 1 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth here the states s1 s2 and s1a are the desirable states for deficit irrigation purposes as growth is not irreversibly affected due to immoderate water stress transitions between the different states are illustrated by arrows and denote the conditioned change from one state to another if defined conditions are fulfilled the task specific definition of states and the definition of transition conditions are part of the modeling procedure here the transition conditions are defined using the actual stress level the stress level experienced in the previous instance the time between successive stresses and the actual stress time duration as variables used in suitably designed conditions 3 2 data driven model parametrization modeling and data driven based identification of related parameters is realized using a state machine approach assuming unknown but constant state descriptions and unknown but constant transition conditions the unknown parameters are defined by applying nsga ii optimization used for a training and test procedure introduction and details are given in beganovic and söffker 2017 assuming a known given topology about the qualitatively distinguishable behavior of plant growth cf fig 3 related mathematical equations can be applied to describe the state dependent leaf elongation l for the different states depending on the lifetime increment δlt here the structural behavior is assumed as similar the details are assumed as different different parameter setting related state depending parameters as well as the parameters of the given transitions conditions are calculated via optimization using nsga ii standard software model parametrization is implemented based on the equations for state s1 δ l t a 10 a 11 1 e a 12 l a 13 a 14 l a 15 l a 16 a 17 1 e a 18 l state s1a δ l t a 20 a 21 1 e a 22 l a 23 a 24 1 e a 25 l a 26 a 27 e a 28 1 l state s1b δ l t a 30 a 31 1 e a 32 l a 33 a 34 1 e a 35 l 2 a 36 a 37 e a 38 1 l state s1c δ l t a 40 a 41 1 e a 42 l a 43 a 44 1 e a 45 l a 46 a 47 e a 48 1 l state s2 δ l t a 50 a 51 1 e a 52 l a 53 a 54 1 e a 55 l a 56 a 57 e a 58 1 l state s2a δ l t a 60 a 61 1 e a 62 l a 63 a 64 1 e a 65 l a 66 a 67 e a 68 1 l state s3 δ l t a 70 a 71 1 e a 72 l a 73 a 74 1 e a 75 l a 76 a 77 1 e a 78 l with δlt denoting lifetime increment and l denoting leaf elongation based on the measured growth data and the described state machine approach the model parameters are numerically determined as follows response threshold transition of stress level l0 l1 is at 42 9 45 19 g substrate water content this means that plants are in stress level l0 as long as water availability is higher than 45 19 g 70 75 substrate water holding capacity recuperation threshold transition of stress level l1 l2 is at 19 2 28 1 g substrate water content this means that plants are in stress level l1 as long as water availability is below 42 9 g but higher than 28 1 g further plants are in stress level l2 as soon as water availability drops below 19 2 g memory time tm maximum memory storage time is at 2 77 days period between successive stress levels l1 stress events this means that plants lose memory of experienced stress levels l1 training effect if a subsequent stress level l1 occurs later than 2 77 days after the previously experienced stress level l1 maximum stress duration time td maximum duration of a stress level l1 stress event till appearance of a dysfunction is at 2 74 days period duration of a stress level l1 this means that plants also exceed the recuperation threshold if the time duration of stress level l1 exceeds the period of 2 74 days 3 3 open loop control the novel results examined in this contribution are based on the consequent use of the different stress levels sequenced so that the plant growth can be controlled with respect to given targets this approach is based on the assumption also to be proved that growth behavior of plants is significantly different in the different states based on this assumption following control targets can be formulated growth if a mild stress l1 tends to reduce plant growth a targeted irrigation can be used to control this variable e g targeted to reduced biomass production in vegetative stages water use if training of plants with periods of mild stress l1 can be used to minimize plant water consumption in specific periods without substantial yield reductions a targeted irrigation can be used to control plant water demands e g targeted to irrigation events an overview about all resulting open loop control options based on the potential alternative state trajectories are depicted in the trellis diagram fig 4 all potential states s circles and state transitions arrows are shown in the sequence of instances k similar to approaches in sport science these state trajectories training sequences can be differentiated according to targets e g endurance susceptibility by varying input trajectories e g number of repetitions number of series and thresholds e g stress severity duration however these options are only valid within physiological constraints of the species and individual plant every athlete is limited by its physiological capabilities set by the genome bouchard 2012 and trainability is limited by the natural processing speed and the limits of the characteristic features sarzynski et al 2017 therefore growth follows a natural plan of developmental stages and is bound to restrictions in time and direction 4 results 4 1 comparison of state based behavior plant growth in fig 5 plant growth tll related to the aggregated cumulative substrate water content cwc is shown for each stress state increasing stress s1 s2 s3 results in decreasing growth rates experience of a first mild stress in s2 results after re irrigation in s1a in recovery of growth rate at re experienced mild stresses within memory time in successive states s2i growth rate is not reduced but instead slightly increased compared to the initial mild stress in s2 as well as compared to full irrigated state s1 the latter behavior is defined as memory in the model after the experience of a high stress in s3 a re irrigation does not result in a recovery of growth rate in s2a this is defined as damage in the model growth performance in fig 6 leaf elongation rate tler related to the evapotranspiration rate etr is shown for each stress state increasing stress s1 s2 s3 results initially in substantially decreased growth performance in s2 as stress proceeds s2 s3 growth performance increases again in s3 and even outperforms the fully irrigated state s1 this is attributed to the activated memory acclimation which is initiated in state s2 experience of a first mild stress in s2 results after re irrigation in s1a in a recovery of growth performance which is highest of all states at re experienced mild stresses within memory time in successive states s2i growth performance is also increased compared to the initial mild stress in s2 as well as compared to full irrigated state s1 the latter is as well attributed to the defined memory after the experience of a high stress in s3 a re irrigation does not result in an increased growth performance in s2a as performance is already high in s3 phyllochron in table 2 the effect of a water stress event on the period in time days or cumulative water content g between the appearance of successive leaves is shown here stress event is denoted as an experienced stress level l1 or l2 in the time period up to the appearance of the respective leaves in this experiment the repeated experience of mild stress events accelerates by trend the appearance of successive leaves in terms of time median minus 0 5 days 7 for leaf 5 compared to non stressed plants and in terms of cumulative water content minus 10 g 5 for leaf 5 compared to non stressed plants the experience of a high stress delays immediately and significantly the appearance of successive leaves in terms of time median plus 2 days 50 for leaf 4 compared to non stressed plants leaf 5 only appeared at two of all highly stressed plants within experiment duration further research is recommended to investigate whether the intended setting of stress stimuli has influence on the duration of vegetative developmental stages 4 2 statistical validation the statistical validation of the presented model is based on two hypotheses first there is a significant relation between state based water input and leaf elongation output hypothesis 1 second the defined states are significantly different in growth behavior hypothesis 2 if both hypotheses can be confirmed the defined states can be used to implement different water stress training sequences validation is implemented using standard hypothesis testing methods for gaussian distribution for test selection correlation and regression hypothesis 1 and for mean and variance homogeneity hypothesis 2 benesch 2012 howell 2016 confidence level for all tests is set to 95 minimum sample size is calculated based on statistical power analysis the stronger the relation the smaller the required sample size to evidence the connection test power is set to 80 to calculate minimum sample size effect size is measured using cohen s d mean differences cohen s f2 regression cohen 1988 and variance quotient var1 var2 variance homogeneity the presented approach of statistical validation is in accordance with well known standards as reported in the best practice guide of the university of zürich switzerland www methodenberatung uzh ch 4 2 1 hypothesis testing methods test for gaussian distribution was performed for all plants for the growth variable total leaf length tll on a daily basis the used tests are shapiro wilk shapiro and wilk 1965 and anderson darling test anderson and darling 1952 gaussian distribution was expected but could not be shown for all days by both tests therefore parallel testing with hypothesis tests requiring gaussian distribution and distribution free tests was implemented the test for correlation was performed for all variable combinations for all groups and states the used tests are bravais pearson test gaussian galton 1889 and spearman test distribution free spearman 1910 the test for linear regression is performed for all variable combinations for all groups and states galton 1894 the relevant results of the correlation and regression analysis are shown in tables 3 and 4 the test for mean differences is performed for the state combinations s1 s1a s2 s2i and s3 s2a for the variable combinations total leaf length aggregated cumulated water content tll cwc total leaf elongation rate evapotranspiration rate tler etr and total leaf elongation rate per evapotranspiration rate aggregated cumulated water content tler etr cwc the used tests are the t test gaussian paired and unpaired student 1908 the mann whitney u test distribution free unpaired mann and whitney 1947 and the wilcoxon test distribution free paired wilcoxon 1945 the test for variance homogeneity is performed for the state combinations s1 s1a s2 s2i and s3 s2a for the same variable combinations as for the mean differences tll cwc tler etr and tler etr cwc the used tests are the f test gaussian unpaired fisher 1960 the leneve test gaussian unpaired levene et al 1960 and the conover test distribution free unpaired conover et al 1981 4 2 2 samples total sample consists of 135 individual plants from 7 experiments measurement time series are discretized according to the a m schematic procedure and then grouped according to the affiliation to different states the samples for state based comparison of growth behaviors are structured as follows s1 no stress prior to first stress 135 individuals with 975 measurement point s1a no stress after mild stress 55 individuals with 470 measurement point s2 first mild stress 90 individuals with 210 measurement point s2i successive mild stresses 55 individuals with 125 measurement point s3 high stress 35 individuals with 275 measurement point s2ai no stress after high stress 30 individuals with 180 measurement point measurement data for the states are unpaired for data from different plants but paired for data of the same plant before and after a stress event therefore this data set is mixed partially paired data related to dependency according to guo and yuan 2017 these data sets should be analyzed with tests for paired data parallel testing with tests for unpaired data support the findings to a large extend not shown here 4 2 3 test results hypothesis 1 a correlation and regression analysis was implemented to conclude the directed state based relation between the input variable water and the output variable growth the results of the analysis are shown for the parameter combination growth tll with aggregated water content cwc in table 3 and for total leaf elongation rate tler with evapotranspiration rate etr in table 4 growth is naturally related to water supply in time relation of cumulative totals per plant in time considering complete time series of growing plants this high correlation regression is also confirmed for all plant and time independent states for the variable combination total leaf length tll and aggregated water content cwc in table 3 standard deviation as related parameter root of correlation is not declared separately it can be concluded that hypothesis 1 relation water input growth output is generally valid also for state based considerations cf also scatterplots in fig 5 regarding the same states total leaf elongation rate tler shows very weak correlation to water consumption etr for not yet fully memory initialized states s1 and s2 table 4 state based relation of growth rate and water consumption rate this behavior changes abruptly to a high to very high correlation in all states after experiencing the first mild stress states s1a s2i s3 s2a in table 4 and it is combined with a reduced correlation between growth tll and cumulative water content cwc states s1a s2i s3 s2a in table 3 cf also scatterplots in fig 6 the behavior in the states s1 and s2 was not expected as it represents a lose connection between the parameters under untrained full supply conditions the change in behavior at a first mild stress states s1a s2i s3 s2a is then interpreted as a switch from a hydrological time based growth towards a usage bound growth at the moment of memory initialization hydrological time based behavior denotes the plant growth performance under unstressed conditions where growth is rather plant individual high variation than input output oriented usage bound behavior denotes the acclimation of growth performance due to stress stimuli resulting in a more efficient input output relation compared to unstressed conditions training also in combination with a reduced variation between the individual plants these differences in behavior are the basis for the utilization of stress training sequences for control purposes hypothesis 2 hypothesis tests for differences in mean and variance were implemented to conclude statistical significance of the differences between the relevant states the results of the analysis are shown for the performance parameter tler per etr in cm g in table 5 variance homogeneity and 6 mean differences the continuous substrate desiccation during the experiments results in a transition from state s1 to s2 to s3 which is characterized by a continuous reduction in growth performance variance table 5 this indicates that plants behave more similar regarding water disposition within the growth process as stress increases this variance reduction is not yet significant between the directly successive states s1 to s2 and s2 to s3 but it is significant comparing directly state s1 with s3 cf also scatterplots in fig 6 this means that the stress initiated change in water disposition is slow acting at the same state comparisons the means are changing significantly cf table 6 this change is minimal between s1 and s2 effect size reflecting the restricted effect of mild stress on growth performance on the other hand the change is maximal between s2 and s3 this behavior can be interpreted as damage due to high water stress differences in mean and variance between state s1 and s1a comparison of full irrigated state without and with memory are significant confirming the assumed effect of growth performance increase usage bound after re irrigation differences in mean and variance between state s2 and s2i comparison of mildly stressed states at memory initiation and with existing memory are only significant for the variance means are more similar this finding supports the assumption that memory is initialized in the first mild stress leading already to a certain increase in growth performance despite decreasing growth tll full increase in mean growth performance is then reached after a certain time differences in mean and variance between state s3 and s2a comparison of highly stressed state with re irrigated states after high stress are again significant although in a negative sense the mean after re irrigation is even smaller than in high stress and variance is additionally reduced this is interpreted as damage summarizing the detected differences in plant growth behavior are statistically significant for the defined states and variables further sample sizes are generally representative for the relevant connections with few reservations underlined numbers in tables 3 6 the sample size required to evidence statistical significance depends on the strength of the considered relation for example the very low correlation of growth rate and evapotranspiration rate in state s2 cf table 4 requires a larger sample n 215 than available sample size s2 210 to ensure a relation within the predefined statistical frames further a small effect size referring e g to the difference in median for leaf appearance cf table 2 or to the mean difference between states s2 and s2i cf table 6 also requires a larger sample to support a significant effect of mild water stress on these variables according to the presented results the states and state transitions relevant for the presented training sequences are statistically ascertained it can therefore be concluded that discretization and sequencing of stress states for growth control purposes are productive 4 3 growth results in fig 7 the plant growth results due to different irrigation schedules are shown overall performance of all plants never experiencing any water stress reference plants group fi 45 plants are compared to all plants experiencing a mild stress test plants group ms 55 plants and to all plants experiencing a high stress test plants group hs 37 plants the following statements refer therefore to plants and not to states the group membership of each plant is defined based on state sequences plants in group fi experience the state sequence s1 s1 s1 s1 s1 s1 control objective maximize growth plants in group ms experience the state sequence s1 s2 s1a s2 s1a s2 control objective minimize water use and plants in group hs experience the state sequence s1 s2 s3 s2a s1b s1c undesired total leaf length of plants in group fi is marginally higher mean 6 compared to plants in group ms and distinctly higher mean 15 compared to plants in group hs fig 7 top the state sequence of group fi is therefore considered to maximize growth in terms of leaf length on the other hand water consumption of plants in group fi is maximized as well the mean is 16 higher compared to plants in group ms and 35 higher compared to plants in group hs fig 7 middle the growth performance indicator m e a n l e a f e l o n g a t i o n r a t e c m m e a n e v a p o t r a n s p i r a t i o n r a t e g fig 7 bottom combines the two parameter growth and water use and shows the differences in overall growth behavior due to different state sequences the plants in group ms show a higher growth performance compared to the plants of group fi mean 10 and to the plants in group hs mean 28 the state sequence of group ms is therefore considered to minimize water use at an acceptable minor growth reduction the state sequence of group hs instead is considered to be undesired as growth and performance indicator are considerably reduced damage the increased growth performance of plants in group ms result from the intended alternation between the two growth performance ranges described above hydrological time based growth in non memorized states and usage bound growth in states with initialized memory in memorized states growth ineffective water use is reduced particularly in state s1a here the mean growth performance is 47 higher than the mean value of plants in state s1 this performance value drops back to the level of unmemorized plants if the mild stress stimulus is not repeated within 3 days maximum stress memory time this result is interpreted as reversibility of the proposed memory level and as evidence for the return from a usage bound growth performance to a hydrological time based concluding the implementation of different state trajectories training sequences allows to control growth and water use of plants periods of hydrological time performance range non memorized full irrigation state s1 are used for maximum total growth by trend reduced growth speed vegetative stage changeover and minimum water based growth performance periods of usage bound performance range memorized states s2 s1a s2i are used for similar or intendedly reduced total growth by trend accelerated growth speed vegetative stage changeover and maximum water use efficiency 5 discussion the presented interdisciplinary approach is a first evidence for the model based control of adaptive plant behavior for irrigation purposes objective is the alignment of plant growth behavior to water availability and not vice versa and the targeted utilization of training mechanisms the proposed model is based on experimental observations laboratory conditions and describes the water based growth behavior of maize plants vegetative stage ec13 15 v3 5 by using this growth model different sequences of water stress levels were used to control growth and water consumption the approach applied in this study differs strongly from traditional procedures the commonly known water availability thresholds field capacity permanent wilting point differ from the determined response and recuperation thresholds field capacity denotes the drained soil state after total soil water saturation practical guides mention 80 to 100 of field capacity to be optimal for plant growth and 50 of field capacity as a benchmark for stress initiation allen et al 1998 bcma ministry of agriculture british columbia 2015 this benchmark of 50 field capacity is defined similarly to the determined plant based response threshold in the proposed approach stress initiation although at a lower water content value as the response threshold is determined at 70 75 of substrate water holding capacity permanent wilting point denotes the soil water content at which plants are not any more able to extract water from the soil as a result plants wilt and die the introduced recuperation threshold is not represented by the common water availability concept implying that water stress is generally not showing positive effects here the new method can unclose new perspectives regarding irrigation scheduling on the other hand the consideration of plants system internal variables to determine stress requires precise irrigation and sensing techniques the presented response and recuperation thresholds are both determined to be reached at an early stage of soil water depletion under the presented experimental conditions the initiation of an adaptive response occurs when water availability is just shortly 24 h about 15 20 g lower than total substrate water holding capacity this represents a response threshold at a water availability of about 70 75 of total substrate water holding capacity the recuperation threshold is reached at a water availability between 40 30 of total substrate water holding capacity the initiation of adaptive behavior for training purposes without producing damages requires therefore the precise control of water deficits between these two thresholds this requires an adequate water stress detection method and sampling rate which is precise enough to detect deficits already at an early stage of soil water depletion moreover the exact plants response and recuperation thresholds are stochastic variables this requires precise methods to detect the water deficit state plant individually restrictively the remote sensing of plant growth parameters in the field is still limited mainly because of actual limitations of image based methods for detection of e g object overlapping light reflectance or 3d growth a number of remote sensing approaches for the detection of water stress in plants are investigated matese et al 2018 khanal et al 2017 steele dunne et al 2017 but those measure other variables than growth for example plant water content by e g reflectance or consumption by e g leaf temperature here the clear relation between output variable e g leaf temperature and growth yield still has to be evaluated in order to confirm and to specify the observability of growth yield by the selected measurement signal constraints of the novel model are the consideration of solely leaf growth parameter and the restrictions regarding transferability of laboratory results to field conditions stress avoidance mechanisms of plants become as well evident in a displacement of biomass partitioning transient water deficit events are known to influence root growth e g depth density distribution allowing plants under field conditions to activate additional water resources and to maintain water supply despite reduced soil water content berger et al 2016 here different soil water availabilities in terms of irrigation intervals and irrigation depth can result in differing root shoot ratio and leaf area chai et al 2016 gheysari et al 2017 further under field conditions different soil textures and compositions can lead to different soil desiccation speed and distributions this can have an effect on the specific plant behavior as e g very slow soil desiccation provides plants with more time to adopt than fast soil desiccation moreover the trade off between yield potential and drought resistance mechanisms is known e g the redirection of sources from reproductive sink tissues berger et al 2016 an intended water deficit treatment should therefore consider the specific stress strategy of the plants and should differentiate the values for the response and recuperation thresholds regarding at least three developmental periods vegetative growth silking and blister period and post blister period experiments based on different species and cultivars are therefore proposed to compare the results concerning quantification of thresholds and growth performance behavior specific consideration should be given to training effects as stress training before reproductive stages can have positive effect on stress tolerance in further stages wang et al 2014 extending the experiments also to field conditions are recommended to test the model also under more intense light conditions and diverging evaporative demands despite the mentioned constraints the presented state machine model and open loop control approach can directly be used to test similar sequences for other substrates e g regarding quantification of thresholds or for other cultivars e g regarding trainability similar experiments regarding the training of plants could potentially also be applicable for other inputs e g chemicals for example the study on plant vaccination luna 2016 can be considered as a related approach finally the trainability of plants can potentially be considered as breeding target provided that the ability of memorization and or the stress triggered increase in proficiency level are a result of gene

10747,in this paper a first evidence is provided that the targeted control of adaptive plant behavior for irrigation purposes is possible the objective is aligning plant growth to water availability and not vice versa and utilizing training mechanisms to affect the relation between water use and plant growth the approach is based on the experimental specification of two water deficit related behavioral patterns memory of stress and point of no return damage mild stress duration has to be shorter than 2 7 days to avoid irreversible growth rate reduction maximum stress duration time water stress information is stored memorized by the plant for three days at most maximum water stress memory time therefore adequate stress stimuli have to be repeated within this period to maintain training effect exceeding maximum memory time without stimulus results in a drop of water based growth performance g r o w t h c m w a t e r g back to the level of untrained plants in control experiments two different plant growth performance ranges were identified hydrological time performance range without activated memory and usage bound performance range in memorized states usage bound growth performance range shows 47 higher water based growth performance than hydrological time based an open loop control approach is developed to control growth and water consumption using the intended alternation between the two performance ranges the plant behavior due to water stress is modelled as a state machine method of a conditioned automaton control engineering representing directly the control algorithm based on the statistical validation results it can be concluded that training plants with intended stress sequences allows the control of plant growth and water use

an increasing world population sivakumar et al 2014 flörke et al 2018 the development of new water saving technologies and procedures is required to reduce freshwater consumption in irrigated agriculture greenland et al 2018 malek and verburg 2018 one option to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is to improve plant water consumption exploiting the plants natural capabilities to adapt to unfavorable conditions araus et al 2012 ruggiero et al 2017 1 1 aim of the study in this contribution an approach is presented allowing in the final stage the control of plant growth using specific irrigation sequences core of the control approach is the knowledge about the precise plant growth behavior caused by varying water supplies this model is the basis for formulating the control algorithm providing all alternative irrigation sequences the latter can then be used to optimize or to control the output here growth or water use the aim of this approach is to directly control growth yield instead of controlling e g the water availability in the soil this approach provides the missing link to model plant dynamic growth behavior for a controlled deficit irrigation 1 2 deficit irrigation method deficit irrigation is a cultivation method irrigating crops below maximum plant water demand level fereres and soriano 2007 davies et al 2011 this is implemented by applying less irrigating events reduced water quantities or by methods like partial root zone drying kögler and söffker 2017 deficit irrigation experiments with different crops have shown that agricultural irrigation water savings of up to 40 are possible at yield reductions of 5 7 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 geerts and raes 2009 ahmadi et al 2014 extrapolating the experimentally measured water savings due to deficit irrigation instead of full irrigation in citrus orchards tejero et al 2011 the water saving potential for e g just half of the european citrus production could sum up to 0 16 km3 year kögler and söffker 2017 at a fresh water per capita consumption of 120 l water person day germany 2013 destatis statistisches bundesamt 2017 these water savings could supply about 1 3 million people per year with fresh water water saving potentials differ of course substantially between species and cultivars relativizing these numbers in daryanto et al 2016 for instance the evaluation of data from peer reviewed publications of the years 1980 2015 showed a higher sensitivity of maize to water deficits compared to wheat with approximately double yield reduction as a result of a 40 water reduction however any water saving potential is worth using considering climate change and fresh water scarcity 1 3 irrigation control problem major challenge for sustainable application of deficit irrigation methods is to control the plants related to their individually optimal water supply state s this control problem requires establishing a feedback structure including the plant system model instead of e g only soil based water availability control for instance with tensiometer generally models describing yield formation subject to water inputs are available e g aquacrop crop water productivity model fao steduto et al 2008 in these models plants response to water deficits is given with a set of linear yield reduction functions for the different developmental stages reflecting the effects of water stress on yield changes in time dynamics of environmental factors e g evaporative conditions are considered in the models by iterative steps one to few days per step brisson et al 2006 however the application of these crop models for deficit irrigation optimization purposes are limited because of the very small number of plant based parameters describing the relation between water input and growth yield response kloss et al 2012 linker et al 2016 the parameter used in these crop models are soil or evapotranspiration based neglecting the dynamics time behavior of plants like compensation effects or training using an adequate model of dynamic plant behavior the introduction of the plant system into the control loop would provide the opportunity to pursue different water based optimization strategies e g alignment of growth to predicted precipitation irrigation events included into a control loop input water output growth yield the water supply state determination must relate directly to growth yield factors so that the commonly used water supply states full irrigation mild stress and high stress can be determined by plant based variables representing growth or yield formation the distinction of the different states must be defined by relevant thresholds to date most stress related thresholds for plant based output variables described in literature refer to stress initiation i e transition of well watered state to a state of first stress symptoms williams and araujo 2002 jones 2004 2007 plant based thresholds for the transition of a mild stress state to a high stress state or an evaluation whether the detected symptom still belongs to a mild stress state or already to a high stress state are described in few cases as e g in ben gal et al 2010 if plants are able to cope with certain suboptimal environmental conditions and to recover from deficit situations the pure identification of a stress initiation is not sufficient to develop control approaches comprising adaptive behavior as the behavior beyond stress initiation is not covered 1 4 background water stress memory acclimation training during ontogeny plants adapt to environmental stress stimuli of a water deficit by different response and memory mechanisms meyer et al 2014 martinez medina et al 2016 lämke and bäurle 2017 in periods of mild water deficits the plant reduces growth and compensates the reduced growth after re irrigation chai et al 2016 mild stress is further assumed to accelerate growth compared to full irrigated plants whereas high stress is assumed to cause the opposite brisson and delécolle 1991 responses to water deficits occur on different levels of organization cell tissue organ whole plant the various processes involved e g sustained root growth or stomatal closure aim either at improved water uptake or at reduced water releases hsiao 1973 bray 1997 lösch 2003 steduto et al 2009 two types of memory mechanisms can be distinguished according to trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 the first type is termed habituation thompson and spencer 1966 priming conrath et al 2009 or learning thellier 2017 gagliano et al 2018 information storage time is time scaled in seconds to few days the stored information is the characteristic of the stimulus memorization is expressed by an adjusted modified stimulus transduction of a re experienced stress stimulus second type of memory is termed storage and recall information storage time is time scaled in days to months here the stored information is not the stimulus itself but the type of response to the stimulus e g the metabolic reaction memorization is expressed by a rapid re activation of an integrated response to a set of stimuli this classification of memory processes is not always distinct transitions between the forms are possible trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 acclimation processes include sensing e g of increasing negative soil water potential response e g production of abscisic acid aba memory initialization e g by priming or epigenetic modification and recall of stored information lichtenthaler 1996 trewavas 2003 thellier and lu 2013 li and liu 2016 acclimation can decrease response time martinez medina et al 2016 desensitize overreaction or sensitize stress sensing thellier and lu 2013 reduce response intensity ding et al 2012 or increase metabolic reaction wang et al 2014 when stress is re experienced acclimated plants show higher resilience to re experienced environmental stress stimuli compared to not adapted plants also increasingly if plants are exposed to repeated stress stimuli training ding et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2014 caldeira et al 2014 wang et al 2014 established models describing non neuronal training processes are the super compensation model jakovlev 1977 or the strain stress adaptation model schnabel et al 2003 in sport science both models illustrate how acclimation processes take effect after a training sequence a stress stimulus results initially in a fatigue of the affected system e g muscle organ structure after recovery the system develops a proficiency level higher compared to the original one supercompensation this increased proficiency level can be decreasingly maintained over a certain period memory if the stress stimulus is repeated during a system specific period the proficiency level can be further increased training otherwise it drops back to the original level these models are used to optimize the sequence of strain and recovery to control performance parameter like endurance or resilience jakovlev 1977 schnabel et al 2003 1 5 approach and structure of the contribution in this contribution the described ability of plants to increase proficiency level after experienced stress training is tested and quantified in different experiments based on experimental results the controllability of plant growth by means of irrigation sequencing is demonstrated and the use of specific training sequences for different control targets is shown in this novel approach control engineering methodology is applied to the water input growth output relation of plants demonstrating for the first time the potential to control growth by water input variations to improve water efficiency in irrigated agriculture the results of the study contribute to the formulation of new irrigation control strategies reducing water dissipation in irrigated agriculture this contribution is structured as follows in section 2 the experimental set up 2 1 the measurements 2 2 and the data processing procedure 2 3 are specified in section 3 the model for adaptive plant behavior is presented 3 1 the model parametrization is given 3 2 and based on that the open loop water based growth control approach is described 3 3 the investigated control strategies refer to the output variables growth and water use in section 4 the control results are presented first a comparison of state based growth behavior scatterplots is shown 4 1 second hypothesis testing results are given 4 2 and third control results for different control sequences are presented 4 3 in section 5 the approach is discussed regarding potential field application and future work finally in section 6 a brief conclusion for the presented study is given 2 methods 2 1 concept of positive stress training based on the described physiological relations cf section 1 1 following conceptual understanding of the physiological relations due to soil substrate desiccation is used to model adaptive plant behavior due to water stress fig 1 soil water content is considered to represent the sensed signal by the plant minor variations in water availability in the soil in terms of water deficit duration or severity are assumed to be unacknowledged by plants as long as the signal value e g soil water potential remains below a certain response threshold a signal value exceeding this response threshold is supposed to lead to the sensing of a reduced water availability which requires acclimation in behavior to perpetuate operativeness acclimation includes reactions like stomatal closure acclimation to immediate stimuli as well as memory initiation acclimation to future stimuli this acclimation to water deficits is assumed to be possible and growth limitations are reversible as long as a certain recuperation threshold for physiological processes is not reached here recuperation denotes the ability of the plant to perpetuate operativeness despite reduced input quantities beyond this recuperation threshold the plant is expected to experience injuries which are not reversible and leading to a sustained limitation in growth and development point of no return therefore three aspects of the described physiological relations are relevant for the presented approach model the specific sensitivity of the growth process to water deficits the ability of plants to memorize stress events for training purposes and the reversibility or not of experienced growth effects based on this conceptual understanding the desiccation of soil can be distinguished into three discrete water content levels regarding the resulting water stress for plants stress levels first stress level no stress below response threshold second stress level mild stress between response and recuperation threshold representing a positive stress and third stress level high stress above recuperation threshold therefore the model of plant dynamic behavior is based on the experimental parametrization of these two thresholds response and recuperation threshold 2 2 experimental set up the presented experiments were implemented under laboratory conditions and concentrate on modelling parametrization and validation of the control approach the test rig consists of four growth stations blocks placed in a rectangle and consisting of tables with superstructures for illumination irrigation measurements and plant positioning each block is illuminated with a bank of lights 2x phillips tc l 75 w and illumination is automated with a clock timer 14 h per day light conditions in the experiments are at a lower level comparable to cloudy days in early spring in norther regions but sufficient to grow seedlings for the proposed duration the blocks groups of plants were randomly chosen for the different irrigation treatments and randomly selected from the four different positions to avoid systematic errors due to the block location air temperature air humidity and ventilation are managed by university building equipment pre controlled ambient temperature and ventilation system environmental parameters were maintained fixed within certain ranges c f table 1 and apply equally to all plants despite certain variability of air humidity in the laboratory the daily evapotranspiration rate etr plant plus substrate remained similar among the different experiments seven irrigation experiments were implemented with maize plants zea mays ronaldinio kws vegetative stage ec11 ec15 v1 v5 each experiment had a duration of 15 20 days maize was chosen for the presented study as deficit irrigation of maize is in scientific focus comas et al 2019 rudnick et al 2019 although being an annual and not particularly a cash crop like e g vegetables or a woody crop maize is generally adopted to dry environments although the dimension of growth yield reductions due to water stress is different depending on drought tolerance of the specific cultivar the experiments were performed at early vegetative stages ec11 ec15 v1 v5 and the transfer of the results to subsequent phenological stages should be included in further studies the vegetative stage in total is considered to be largely uncritical for yield formation grant et al 1989 recent deficit irrigation studies for maize investigate more in detail the stage based water use behavior comas et al 2019 at the beginning of the experiments the seeds were sown 4 cm deep into pots filled with 65 g seramis clay granulate maximum water holding capacity of a pot with 65 g seramis clay granulate is about 60 65 g water no free water at the bottom of the pots therefore substrate water content wc for full irrigation no water stress is set at a substrate water content of 60 g ml the sample per experiment comprises 20 individual plants divided into four groups a b c d of 5 plants each in each experiment one or two groups of plants were fully irrigated daily refill of et up to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate of 60 g and considered to serve as comparison groups the other groups were exposed to different water deficit schedules irrigation water was applied manually and accurate to one gram with an injection 2 3 measurements substrate water content wc in g input variable was determined gravimetrically sauter precision balance by subtracting dry weight of the potted systems before first irrigation from total weight in the particular point in time leaf lengths of all leaves tll in cm output variable were measured manually with a ruler these measurements were done once to three times per day and summated to daily values where appropriate air temperature and humidity were regularly measured by a standard digital hygro thermometer additionally time of leaf appearance was noted additional variables are calculated for analytical purposes based on the measured input variable substrate water content the cumulative water content cwc in g and the evapotranspiration rate etr in g d are determined here cwc denotes the initially measured water content at experiment start initial water supply at instant of time t0 plus total water applications up to the specific point in time total water supply at instant of time ti and etr denotes the substrate water content differential per day 24 h water content in instant of time ti minus water content in instant of time ti 1 without water application based on the measured output variable total leaf length the total leaf elongation rate tler in cm d can be determined denoted as the total leaf length differential per day 24 h further the quotient of total leaf elongation rate per evapotranspiration rate t l e r e t r in cm g was determined which denote growth performance i e water use efficiency 2 4 data processing in fig 2 examples of four different time series of irrigation sequences and corresponding growth behaviors are shown to explain the basic principle of the implemented data processing procedure target of this procedure is the distinction and definition of the plants water supply states based on the specific growth behavior the states are defined by the state variables stress memory and damage level distinguishing each state from the others here states are discrete entities the plant is always in exactly one state states can be figuratively circumscribed as a physiological shape of the plant e g stressed or not trained or not as an example this procedure can be compared to the definition of states for an elevator visible at the floor level display state variables would be the level ground 1st or 2nd floor and the door condition open or closed as the variable floor can take three values and the door opening can take two values this sums up to a total of 3 2 6 potential states for the elevator the discretization of the continuous process of an elevator going up or down or a door opening or closing is defined by conditions thresholds for instance by the distances between the elevator and the two successive floors or by the degree of aperture step 1 definition of state variables a stress level as described above the response threshold is defined by the onset of growth reduction due to a water deficit therefore the response threshold is determined at the water content level at which test plants showed initially a reduced growth rate leaf elongation rate after water withdrawal compared to reference plants the response threshold was determined experimentally at approximately 40 g 45 g substrate water content fig 2 top point a in fig 2 bottom the growth reduction can be seen at point a where leaf elongation rate of all stressed plants all broken lines is constantly decreasing compared to the leaf elongation rate of unstressed plants solid line the recuperation threshold is defined as point of no return at which the progressed water deficit leads to an irreversible growth reduction because of a damage the recuperation threshold is determined experimentally at approximately 20 g 25 g substrate water content fig 2 top point b this point in time is located at an approximated period one to two days before re irrigation of these plants as the point of no return has to be prior to this specific time of re irrigation otherwise the plants would have recovered in this case in fig 2 bottom this irreversibility in growth behavior can be seen at point b where plants exposed to high stress did not show a recovery of growth rate after re irrigation dotted line plants of this group do even not show substantially higher leaf elongation rates than plants experiencing maximum stress with zero g substrate water content fig 2 points c the two thresholds divide the water content scale fig 2 top into three ranges defined as stress level l 0 l0 for no stress stress level l 1 l1 for mild stress and stress level l 2 l2 for high stress the state variable stress level l can therefore take the values 0 1 or 2 these numbers are used to define irrigation sequences a sequence of l 0 1 2 0 for instance describes a sequence starting in stress level l0 above response threshold full irrigated followed by substrate desiccation till initially the response threshold is passed stress level l1 and further till recuperation threshold is passed stress level l2 re irrigation results in a switch back to stress level l0 an overview about the performed irrigation strategies which denote stress level trajectories for the seven experiments is given in table 1 a memory level this parameter represents the plant s capacity for remembering memory after experiencing mild stress and is based on the physiological processes of stress memory described above during the presented experiments it was observed that plants re experiencing a mild stress shortly after an initial mild stress reacted later and less to an anew mild stress compared to plants without this pretreatment training it was also observed that if the stress stimulus was not repeated within a certain period the plants behaved like untrained control plants the parameter memory is correspondingly defined as follows memory is activated in stress level l1 mild stress and deactivated in stress level l0 no stress if a re activation training does not take place in due time maximum memory time tm this means if the time period between successive stress levels l1 denoted as tl1i l1j is longer than memory time tm the capacity for remembering is deactivated reversible the parameter denotes the adaptive behavior of growth recuperation after a mild stress recovery and can take the values memory off m0 memory level m 0 or memory on m1 memory level m 1 c f fig 2 test plants mild stress dashed line recovery after day 8 b damage level this parameter represents the existence of a plant s dysfunction damage after experiencing high stress in the presented experiments it was observed that plants experiencing high stress stress level l 2 did not recover in terms of leaf elongation rate even after several days of full irrigation it was further monitored that a mild stress stress level l 1 lasting for several days also lead to irreversible decreases in leaf elongation rates the parameter damage is therefore defined as follows damage is activated either in stress level l2 high stress or in stress level l1 mild stress lasting for more than a critical time duration the latter means if the time duration of an experienced mild stress stress duration time tl1 is longer than a maximum affordable stress duration time td a dysfunction is eventuated once activated this parameter cannot be deactivated not reversible the parameter denotes the physiological injury caused by a stress beyond recuperation threshold resulting in a sustained growth reduction after re irrigation no recovery and can take the values no damage d0 damage level d 0 or damage d1 damage level d 1 c f fig 2 test plants high stress dotted line no recovery after day 10 step 2 labeling of measurement data depending on the irrigation sequence the values of the state variables change every time when a threshold or time limit has been passed or the sequence of states has been altered this results in a segmentation of the measurement time series according to the corresponding values of the state variables for example at the beginning of the experiment all plants were fully irrigated up to the point where the water content of the test plants reached response threshold cf fig 2 day 5 up to this point all measurement points are labeled with the vector 0 0 0 for no stress memory off damage off as soon as the test plants passed the response threshold and as long as no other limit has been passed cf fig 2 day 5 8 the measurement data for these test plants are labeled with the vector 1 1 0 for mild stress memory on damage off by this procedure all data were labeled resulting in a segmentation of the time series step 3 definition of states the measurement time series of all plants were split into the data segments resulting from the labeling procedure and then grouped according to the labels irrespective of individual plant or time each data group is defined as a state hence the plant states s are described by the vector s l m d t with l stress level as a function of water demand and water availability m memory level as a function of l1 and tl1i l1j d damage level as a function of l2 and tl1 tl1i l1j time between the successive stress levels l1i and l1j and tl1 time duration of stress level l1 at this point of data processing a change in analytical perspective takes place the original measurements are plant based time series the resulting data are state based plant and time independent representations of the specific physiological shape 3 control approach 3 1 deficit irrigation state machine model in fig 3 the state machine model method of a conditioned automaton control engineering describing plant growth subject to irrigation treatments is shown this model represents the basis for the growth control approach starting point for the state machine model is state s1 representing a plant which did not experience any water stress before state s1 is denoted as 0 0 0 for no stress memory off damage off withdrawal of water resulting in an exceedance of the response threshold stress level l1 l 1 leads initially to a transition from state s1 to the memory initiating state s2 denoted as 1 1 0 for mild stress memory on damage off henceforward the state transitions depend on irrigation schedule re irrigation return to stress level l0 l 0 initiates the transition to state s1a 0 1 0 alternatively further water withdrawal resulting in an exceedance of the recuperation threshold advance to stress level l2 l 2 initiates the transition to the damage initiating state s3 2 1 1 or constant mild stress continuation in stress level l1 l 1 results in transition to the damage initiating state s2a 1 1 1 further transitions along the depicted model states operate correspondingly end point for the state machine model is not defined as model target is an intended deficit irrigation till harvest model characteristics and assumed growth behavior of the different states are s1 vector 0 0 0 reference growth behavior comparison values s2 vector 1 1 0 reversibly reduced growth s3 vector 2 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth s1a vector 0 1 0 increased growth s1b vector 0 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth s1c vector 0 0 1 irreversibly reduced growth s2a vector 1 1 1 irreversibly reduced growth here the states s1 s2 and s1a are the desirable states for deficit irrigation purposes as growth is not irreversibly affected due to immoderate water stress transitions between the different states are illustrated by arrows and denote the conditioned change from one state to another if defined conditions are fulfilled the task specific definition of states and the definition of transition conditions are part of the modeling procedure here the transition conditions are defined using the actual stress level the stress level experienced in the previous instance the time between successive stresses and the actual stress time duration as variables used in suitably designed conditions 3 2 data driven model parametrization modeling and data driven based identification of related parameters is realized using a state machine approach assuming unknown but constant state descriptions and unknown but constant transition conditions the unknown parameters are defined by applying nsga ii optimization used for a training and test procedure introduction and details are given in beganovic and söffker 2017 assuming a known given topology about the qualitatively distinguishable behavior of plant growth cf fig 3 related mathematical equations can be applied to describe the state dependent leaf elongation l for the different states depending on the lifetime increment δlt here the structural behavior is assumed as similar the details are assumed as different different parameter setting related state depending parameters as well as the parameters of the given transitions conditions are calculated via optimization using nsga ii standard software model parametrization is implemented based on the equations for state s1 δ l t a 10 a 11 1 e a 12 l a 13 a 14 l a 15 l a 16 a 17 1 e a 18 l state s1a δ l t a 20 a 21 1 e a 22 l a 23 a 24 1 e a 25 l a 26 a 27 e a 28 1 l state s1b δ l t a 30 a 31 1 e a 32 l a 33 a 34 1 e a 35 l 2 a 36 a 37 e a 38 1 l state s1c δ l t a 40 a 41 1 e a 42 l a 43 a 44 1 e a 45 l a 46 a 47 e a 48 1 l state s2 δ l t a 50 a 51 1 e a 52 l a 53 a 54 1 e a 55 l a 56 a 57 e a 58 1 l state s2a δ l t a 60 a 61 1 e a 62 l a 63 a 64 1 e a 65 l a 66 a 67 e a 68 1 l state s3 δ l t a 70 a 71 1 e a 72 l a 73 a 74 1 e a 75 l a 76 a 77 1 e a 78 l with δlt denoting lifetime increment and l denoting leaf elongation based on the measured growth data and the described state machine approach the model parameters are numerically determined as follows response threshold transition of stress level l0 l1 is at 42 9 45 19 g substrate water content this means that plants are in stress level l0 as long as water availability is higher than 45 19 g 70 75 substrate water holding capacity recuperation threshold transition of stress level l1 l2 is at 19 2 28 1 g substrate water content this means that plants are in stress level l1 as long as water availability is below 42 9 g but higher than 28 1 g further plants are in stress level l2 as soon as water availability drops below 19 2 g memory time tm maximum memory storage time is at 2 77 days period between successive stress levels l1 stress events this means that plants lose memory of experienced stress levels l1 training effect if a subsequent stress level l1 occurs later than 2 77 days after the previously experienced stress level l1 maximum stress duration time td maximum duration of a stress level l1 stress event till appearance of a dysfunction is at 2 74 days period duration of a stress level l1 this means that plants also exceed the recuperation threshold if the time duration of stress level l1 exceeds the period of 2 74 days 3 3 open loop control the novel results examined in this contribution are based on the consequent use of the different stress levels sequenced so that the plant growth can be controlled with respect to given targets this approach is based on the assumption also to be proved that growth behavior of plants is significantly different in the different states based on this assumption following control targets can be formulated growth if a mild stress l1 tends to reduce plant growth a targeted irrigation can be used to control this variable e g targeted to reduced biomass production in vegetative stages water use if training of plants with periods of mild stress l1 can be used to minimize plant water consumption in specific periods without substantial yield reductions a targeted irrigation can be used to control plant water demands e g targeted to irrigation events an overview about all resulting open loop control options based on the potential alternative state trajectories are depicted in the trellis diagram fig 4 all potential states s circles and state transitions arrows are shown in the sequence of instances k similar to approaches in sport science these state trajectories training sequences can be differentiated according to targets e g endurance susceptibility by varying input trajectories e g number of repetitions number of series and thresholds e g stress severity duration however these options are only valid within physiological constraints of the species and individual plant every athlete is limited by its physiological capabilities set by the genome bouchard 2012 and trainability is limited by the natural processing speed and the limits of the characteristic features sarzynski et al 2017 therefore growth follows a natural plan of developmental stages and is bound to restrictions in time and direction 4 results 4 1 comparison of state based behavior plant growth in fig 5 plant growth tll related to the aggregated cumulative substrate water content cwc is shown for each stress state increasing stress s1 s2 s3 results in decreasing growth rates experience of a first mild stress in s2 results after re irrigation in s1a in recovery of growth rate at re experienced mild stresses within memory time in successive states s2i growth rate is not reduced but instead slightly increased compared to the initial mild stress in s2 as well as compared to full irrigated state s1 the latter behavior is defined as memory in the model after the experience of a high stress in s3 a re irrigation does not result in a recovery of growth rate in s2a this is defined as damage in the model growth performance in fig 6 leaf elongation rate tler related to the evapotranspiration rate etr is shown for each stress state increasing stress s1 s2 s3 results initially in substantially decreased growth performance in s2 as stress proceeds s2 s3 growth performance increases again in s3 and even outperforms the fully irrigated state s1 this is attributed to the activated memory acclimation which is initiated in state s2 experience of a first mild stress in s2 results after re irrigation in s1a in a recovery of growth performance which is highest of all states at re experienced mild stresses within memory time in successive states s2i growth performance is also increased compared to the initial mild stress in s2 as well as compared to full irrigated state s1 the latter is as well attributed to the defined memory after the experience of a high stress in s3 a re irrigation does not result in an increased growth performance in s2a as performance is already high in s3 phyllochron in table 2 the effect of a water stress event on the period in time days or cumulative water content g between the appearance of successive leaves is shown here stress event is denoted as an experienced stress level l1 or l2 in the time period up to the appearance of the respective leaves in this experiment the repeated experience of mild stress events accelerates by trend the appearance of successive leaves in terms of time median minus 0 5 days 7 for leaf 5 compared to non stressed plants and in terms of cumulative water content minus 10 g 5 for leaf 5 compared to non stressed plants the experience of a high stress delays immediately and significantly the appearance of successive leaves in terms of time median plus 2 days 50 for leaf 4 compared to non stressed plants leaf 5 only appeared at two of all highly stressed plants within experiment duration further research is recommended to investigate whether the intended setting of stress stimuli has influence on the duration of vegetative developmental stages 4 2 statistical validation the statistical validation of the presented model is based on two hypotheses first there is a significant relation between state based water input and leaf elongation output hypothesis 1 second the defined states are significantly different in growth behavior hypothesis 2 if both hypotheses can be confirmed the defined states can be used to implement different water stress training sequences validation is implemented using standard hypothesis testing methods for gaussian distribution for test selection correlation and regression hypothesis 1 and for mean and variance homogeneity hypothesis 2 benesch 2012 howell 2016 confidence level for all tests is set to 95 minimum sample size is calculated based on statistical power analysis the stronger the relation the smaller the required sample size to evidence the connection test power is set to 80 to calculate minimum sample size effect size is measured using cohen s d mean differences cohen s f2 regression cohen 1988 and variance quotient var1 var2 variance homogeneity the presented approach of statistical validation is in accordance with well known standards as reported in the best practice guide of the university of zürich switzerland www methodenberatung uzh ch 4 2 1 hypothesis testing methods test for gaussian distribution was performed for all plants for the growth variable total leaf length tll on a daily basis the used tests are shapiro wilk shapiro and wilk 1965 and anderson darling test anderson and darling 1952 gaussian distribution was expected but could not be shown for all days by both tests therefore parallel testing with hypothesis tests requiring gaussian distribution and distribution free tests was implemented the test for correlation was performed for all variable combinations for all groups and states the used tests are bravais pearson test gaussian galton 1889 and spearman test distribution free spearman 1910 the test for linear regression is performed for all variable combinations for all groups and states galton 1894 the relevant results of the correlation and regression analysis are shown in tables 3 and 4 the test for mean differences is performed for the state combinations s1 s1a s2 s2i and s3 s2a for the variable combinations total leaf length aggregated cumulated water content tll cwc total leaf elongation rate evapotranspiration rate tler etr and total leaf elongation rate per evapotranspiration rate aggregated cumulated water content tler etr cwc the used tests are the t test gaussian paired and unpaired student 1908 the mann whitney u test distribution free unpaired mann and whitney 1947 and the wilcoxon test distribution free paired wilcoxon 1945 the test for variance homogeneity is performed for the state combinations s1 s1a s2 s2i and s3 s2a for the same variable combinations as for the mean differences tll cwc tler etr and tler etr cwc the used tests are the f test gaussian unpaired fisher 1960 the leneve test gaussian unpaired levene et al 1960 and the conover test distribution free unpaired conover et al 1981 4 2 2 samples total sample consists of 135 individual plants from 7 experiments measurement time series are discretized according to the a m schematic procedure and then grouped according to the affiliation to different states the samples for state based comparison of growth behaviors are structured as follows s1 no stress prior to first stress 135 individuals with 975 measurement point s1a no stress after mild stress 55 individuals with 470 measurement point s2 first mild stress 90 individuals with 210 measurement point s2i successive mild stresses 55 individuals with 125 measurement point s3 high stress 35 individuals with 275 measurement point s2ai no stress after high stress 30 individuals with 180 measurement point measurement data for the states are unpaired for data from different plants but paired for data of the same plant before and after a stress event therefore this data set is mixed partially paired data related to dependency according to guo and yuan 2017 these data sets should be analyzed with tests for paired data parallel testing with tests for unpaired data support the findings to a large extend not shown here 4 2 3 test results hypothesis 1 a correlation and regression analysis was implemented to conclude the directed state based relation between the input variable water and the output variable growth the results of the analysis are shown for the parameter combination growth tll with aggregated water content cwc in table 3 and for total leaf elongation rate tler with evapotranspiration rate etr in table 4 growth is naturally related to water supply in time relation of cumulative totals per plant in time considering complete time series of growing plants this high correlation regression is also confirmed for all plant and time independent states for the variable combination total leaf length tll and aggregated water content cwc in table 3 standard deviation as related parameter root of correlation is not declared separately it can be concluded that hypothesis 1 relation water input growth output is generally valid also for state based considerations cf also scatterplots in fig 5 regarding the same states total leaf elongation rate tler shows very weak correlation to water consumption etr for not yet fully memory initialized states s1 and s2 table 4 state based relation of growth rate and water consumption rate this behavior changes abruptly to a high to very high correlation in all states after experiencing the first mild stress states s1a s2i s3 s2a in table 4 and it is combined with a reduced correlation between growth tll and cumulative water content cwc states s1a s2i s3 s2a in table 3 cf also scatterplots in fig 6 the behavior in the states s1 and s2 was not expected as it represents a lose connection between the parameters under untrained full supply conditions the change in behavior at a first mild stress states s1a s2i s3 s2a is then interpreted as a switch from a hydrological time based growth towards a usage bound growth at the moment of memory initialization hydrological time based behavior denotes the plant growth performance under unstressed conditions where growth is rather plant individual high variation than input output oriented usage bound behavior denotes the acclimation of growth performance due to stress stimuli resulting in a more efficient input output relation compared to unstressed conditions training also in combination with a reduced variation between the individual plants these differences in behavior are the basis for the utilization of stress training sequences for control purposes hypothesis 2 hypothesis tests for differences in mean and variance were implemented to conclude statistical significance of the differences between the relevant states the results of the analysis are shown for the performance parameter tler per etr in cm g in table 5 variance homogeneity and 6 mean differences the continuous substrate desiccation during the experiments results in a transition from state s1 to s2 to s3 which is characterized by a continuous reduction in growth performance variance table 5 this indicates that plants behave more similar regarding water disposition within the growth process as stress increases this variance reduction is not yet significant between the directly successive states s1 to s2 and s2 to s3 but it is significant comparing directly state s1 with s3 cf also scatterplots in fig 6 this means that the stress initiated change in water disposition is slow acting at the same state comparisons the means are changing significantly cf table 6 this change is minimal between s1 and s2 effect size reflecting the restricted effect of mild stress on growth performance on the other hand the change is maximal between s2 and s3 this behavior can be interpreted as damage due to high water stress differences in mean and variance between state s1 and s1a comparison of full irrigated state without and with memory are significant confirming the assumed effect of growth performance increase usage bound after re irrigation differences in mean and variance between state s2 and s2i comparison of mildly stressed states at memory initiation and with existing memory are only significant for the variance means are more similar this finding supports the assumption that memory is initialized in the first mild stress leading already to a certain increase in growth performance despite decreasing growth tll full increase in mean growth performance is then reached after a certain time differences in mean and variance between state s3 and s2a comparison of highly stressed state with re irrigated states after high stress are again significant although in a negative sense the mean after re irrigation is even smaller than in high stress and variance is additionally reduced this is interpreted as damage summarizing the detected differences in plant growth behavior are statistically significant for the defined states and variables further sample sizes are generally representative for the relevant connections with few reservations underlined numbers in tables 3 6 the sample size required to evidence statistical significance depends on the strength of the considered relation for example the very low correlation of growth rate and evapotranspiration rate in state s2 cf table 4 requires a larger sample n 215 than available sample size s2 210 to ensure a relation within the predefined statistical frames further a small effect size referring e g to the difference in median for leaf appearance cf table 2 or to the mean difference between states s2 and s2i cf table 6 also requires a larger sample to support a significant effect of mild water stress on these variables according to the presented results the states and state transitions relevant for the presented training sequences are statistically ascertained it can therefore be concluded that discretization and sequencing of stress states for growth control purposes are productive 4 3 growth results in fig 7 the plant growth results due to different irrigation schedules are shown overall performance of all plants never experiencing any water stress reference plants group fi 45 plants are compared to all plants experiencing a mild stress test plants group ms 55 plants and to all plants experiencing a high stress test plants group hs 37 plants the following statements refer therefore to plants and not to states the group membership of each plant is defined based on state sequences plants in group fi experience the state sequence s1 s1 s1 s1 s1 s1 control objective maximize growth plants in group ms experience the state sequence s1 s2 s1a s2 s1a s2 control objective minimize water use and plants in group hs experience the state sequence s1 s2 s3 s2a s1b s1c undesired total leaf length of plants in group fi is marginally higher mean 6 compared to plants in group ms and distinctly higher mean 15 compared to plants in group hs fig 7 top the state sequence of group fi is therefore considered to maximize growth in terms of leaf length on the other hand water consumption of plants in group fi is maximized as well the mean is 16 higher compared to plants in group ms and 35 higher compared to plants in group hs fig 7 middle the growth performance indicator m e a n l e a f e l o n g a t i o n r a t e c m m e a n e v a p o t r a n s p i r a t i o n r a t e g fig 7 bottom combines the two parameter growth and water use and shows the differences in overall growth behavior due to different state sequences the plants in group ms show a higher growth performance compared to the plants of group fi mean 10 and to the plants in group hs mean 28 the state sequence of group ms is therefore considered to minimize water use at an acceptable minor growth reduction the state sequence of group hs instead is considered to be undesired as growth and performance indicator are considerably reduced damage the increased growth performance of plants in group ms result from the intended alternation between the two growth performance ranges described above hydrological time based growth in non memorized states and usage bound growth in states with initialized memory in memorized states growth ineffective water use is reduced particularly in state s1a here the mean growth performance is 47 higher than the mean value of plants in state s1 this performance value drops back to the level of unmemorized plants if the mild stress stimulus is not repeated within 3 days maximum stress memory time this result is interpreted as reversibility of the proposed memory level and as evidence for the return from a usage bound growth performance to a hydrological time based concluding the implementation of different state trajectories training sequences allows to control growth and water use of plants periods of hydrological time performance range non memorized full irrigation state s1 are used for maximum total growth by trend reduced growth speed vegetative stage changeover and minimum water based growth performance periods of usage bound performance range memorized states s2 s1a s2i are used for similar or intendedly reduced total growth by trend accelerated growth speed vegetative stage changeover and maximum water use efficiency 5 discussion the presented interdisciplinary approach is a first evidence for the model based control of adaptive plant behavior for irrigation purposes objective is the alignment of plant growth behavior to water availability and not vice versa and the targeted utilization of training mechanisms the proposed model is based on experimental observations laboratory conditions and describes the water based growth behavior of maize plants vegetative stage ec13 15 v3 5 by using this growth model different sequences of water stress levels were used to control growth and water consumption the approach applied in this study differs strongly from traditional procedures the commonly known water availability thresholds field capacity permanent wilting point differ from the determined response and recuperation thresholds field capacity denotes the drained soil state after total soil water saturation practical guides mention 80 to 100 of field capacity to be optimal for plant growth and 50 of field capacity as a benchmark for stress initiation allen et al 1998 bcma ministry of agriculture british columbia 2015 this benchmark of 50 field capacity is defined similarly to the determined plant based response threshold in the proposed approach stress initiation although at a lower water content value as the response threshold is determined at 70 75 of substrate water holding capacity permanent wilting point denotes the soil water content at which plants are not any more able to extract water from the soil as a result plants wilt and die the introduced recuperation threshold is not represented by the common water availability concept implying that water stress is generally not showing positive effects here the new method can unclose new perspectives regarding irrigation scheduling on the other hand the consideration of plants system internal variables to determine stress requires precise irrigation and sensing techniques the presented response and recuperation thresholds are both determined to be reached at an early stage of soil water depletion under the presented experimental conditions the initiation of an adaptive response occurs when water availability is just shortly 24 h about 15 20 g lower than total substrate water holding capacity this represents a response threshold at a water availability of about 70 75 of total substrate water holding capacity the recuperation threshold is reached at a water availability between 40 30 of total substrate water holding capacity the initiation of adaptive behavior for training purposes without producing damages requires therefore the precise control of water deficits between these two thresholds this requires an adequate water stress detection method and sampling rate which is precise enough to detect deficits already at an early stage of soil water depletion moreover the exact plants response and recuperation thresholds are stochastic variables this requires precise methods to detect the water deficit state plant individually restrictively the remote sensing of plant growth parameters in the field is still limited mainly because of actual limitations of image based methods for detection of e g object overlapping light reflectance or 3d growth a number of remote sensing approaches for the detection of water stress in plants are investigated matese et al 2018 khanal et al 2017 steele dunne et al 2017 but those measure other variables than growth for example plant water content by e g reflectance or consumption by e g leaf temperature here the clear relation between output variable e g leaf temperature and growth yield still has to be evaluated in order to confirm and to specify the observability of growth yield by the selected measurement signal constraints of the novel model are the consideration of solely leaf growth parameter and the restrictions

10748,two thirds of human water use is linked to agricultural practices including crop irrigation furthermore excess irrigation leads to drainage problems for this reason reduced irrigation strategies need to be implemented to protect water resources however low irrigation may lead to crop water stress a fast and inexpensive way to predict the necessary amount of irrigation required is by a model based approach with this approach it is possible to explore the relation between irrigation crop water stress and drainage however parameter uncertainty can reduce prediction accuracy therefore the aims of this research were 1 to develop and test a methodology that allows the analysis of uncertainty sources in irrigation strategies 2 to identify how much irrigation can be reduced while maintaining a low risk of crop stress and 3 to explore the influence of uncertainty in soil parameters and evapotranspiration on model predictions results from a realistic case considered in this study indicated that while maintaining a low risk of crop stress 1 it is possible to reduce drainage by 88 and water use 22 for a conventional irrigation strategy this reduction is dependent on the type of risk aversion strategy and is specific for a case scenario where variations are certain keywords hydraulic conductivity monte carlo uncertainty richards equation evapotranspiration 1 introduction efficient water use is one of the main issues within agriculture agriculture is the largest single user of fresh water accounting for nearly 75 of current human water use fao 2016 often water has a low cost and as a form of risk aversion growers tend to over irrigate to prevent crop water stress hence the irrigation strategies followed by growers are usually not very water efficient an important consequence of over irrigation is drainage irrigation water that drains to the groundwater can transport pesticides and nutrients e g nitratehers which may harm the environment the high consumption of fresh water and groundwater contamination has sparked a growing interest from policy makers in irrigation management to minimize water use and to protect water sources from agricultural pollution gholamhoseini et al 2013 the european union established a regulatory framework for groundwater protection against pollution and deterioration in europe council of the european union 2000 the aim of this regulatory framework is to institute actions to prevent and control groundwater pollution defined as a direct or indirect introduction of contaminants into the groundwater as a result of human activities the desired situation according to this regulatory framework would be to have zero drainage from agricultural practices however this is a bit short sighted since reducing too much drainage can have negative effects the absence of drainage can lead to an increase in soluble salts in the soil profile a case study of drainage and salt leaching in southeast turkey concluded that there was a statistically significant relationship between the amount of drained water and salt leaching bahçeci and nacar 2009 another case study focused on the aksu river basin in northwest china indicated that drainage should be maintained at 186 mm per year in that region to prevent ecological consequences hu et al 2017 from a grower s point of view the desired situation is predominantly to prevent crop water stress as much as possible so the overall desired situation that can be formulated from the above is to reduce water use from irrigation and to reduce drainage as much as possible without affecting the salt dynamics in farmlands while maintaining a low risk of crop stress reducing drainage and avoiding crop water stress are two conflicting objectives from a management point of view the former is achieved by reducing the amount of irrigation the latter by increasing it consequently growers struggle to reduce the amount of drainage even policy makers are aware of this struggle and included a key change in a revision of the eu regulatory framework in 2006 stating that the protection of groundwater may in some areas require a change in farming or forestry practices which could entail a loss of income council of the european union 2006 hence reducing drainage via irrigation reduction is a pressing issue in farming unfortunately it is not easily solved this has multiple reasons first it is hard to measure drainage growers can measure soil water content to get an idea of the soil water status and adapt their irrigation scheduling accordingly however the unpredictable behaviour of soil sensors on wetter soils makes drainage predictions difficult to estimate with water measurements alone whalley et al 2001 the most common way to measure drainage is by using underground devices for water catchment called lysimeters the use of lysimeters however is not very practical installation is usually expensive and may require considerable maintenance allen et al 1998 second drainage is also hard to predict evapotranspiration is an important factor underlying drainage and can vary daily due to changing weather conditions such as radiation temperature and air humidity malone et al 2007 additionally water transport rates vary with soil type and crop growth stages molz 1981 these varying and uncertain circumstances make it hard to predict how much water will drain and consequently to what extent the crop will endure water stress this uncertainty leads to risk avoiding strategies in the form of high dosage irrigation third crop stress is hard to monitor timely visual cues like dropping leaves plant coloration change in leaf area and change in turgor pressure may indeed indicate water stress however by the time these visual cues appear crop production may already be irreversibly affected netzer et al 2009 an approach to reduce water use and drainage is via model based scenario studies plant soil atmosphere models describe water flow dynamics to predict soil water drainage and crop status an extensive array of models has been developed for simulation studies on soil water flow drainage and yield predictions for example saltmed ragab 2002 swap kroes et al 2017 and daisy jensen et al 1997 simulate plant growth yield and soil water dynamics these models have been used in scenario studies on yield and dry matter under deficit irrigation jensen et al 1997 kaoutar et al 2017 for drought risk assessments sun et al 2017 for nitrate leaching management in grasslands hack ten broeke 2001 for deep drainage simulations in coffee plantations pinto et al 2015 and for exploring optimal fertigation strategies for orange production using fussim3d qin et al 2016 uncertainty has also been included in water management mun et al 2015 applied an uncertainty analysis for the mississippi irrigation scheduling tool mist model showing that the margin of error uncertainty in the water balance value from mist was shown to be around 9 of that value which was deemed acceptable for agronomic systems a similar uncertainty analysis was performed by prats and picó 2010 where the performance and uncertainty of an irrigation scheduling method based on soil water balance was studied findings showed that the amount of water held by the soil is the most important hydraulic property of the soil these studies show how uncertainty in a model and parameters can lead to variation in results as well as to identify sensitive parameters nonetheless the interaction between different sources of uncertainty and the effect on drainage and crop stress predictions simultaneously and subsequently how uncertainty can influence the decision making of irrigation strategies is still missing in conclusion mathematical models are commonly used tools in agriculture and water management as a way to examine plant soil atmosphere systems without the need of sensors however there is still a need for a methodological framework to study the effect of different sources of uncertainty on drainage risk of crop stress and total amount of irrigation the aim of this study was to develop a method which considers different sources of uncertainty to explore the possibility to reduce irrigation and drainage while keeping the risk of a water stress event low more specifically the focus was on the following research questions to what extent can water use and drainage be reduced by adjusting the irrigation dosage while keeping the risk of crop stress acceptable what effects do uncertainty in type of soil profiles and evapotranspiration have on the prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress 2 materials and methods the methodology was divided into the following steps 1 a two module model framework was developed to explore the relation between drainage irrigation and risk of crop stress under uncertain evapotranspiration and uncertain soil properties the framework included a water flow module using the emman3g model which is a one dimensional version of the fussim2d heinen 2001 model and an evapotranspiration module based on the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 2 a verification of the emman3g model was done by comparing the numerical simulated output on infiltration of the model against analytical solutions 3 the model predictions on drainage were evaluated with an experimental data set of drainage values from a lysimeter in a chrysanthemum soil greenhouse in the netherlands 4 predictions of risk of crop stress were based on a soil pressure head threshold value depending on the amount of hours the soil pressure head was below the threshold of 5 kpa the ratio of risk of crop stress increased 5 a monte carlo approach was used to assess the uncertainty in drainage and risk of crop stress predictions based on uncertainties in soil properties and evapotranspiration 6 the relation between amount of irrigation drainage and likelihood of crop stress occurrence was visualized the influences of uncertainty in daily evapotranspiration as well as uncertainty in soil parameters were simulated simultaneously as well as separately 2 1 the emman3g model the emman3g model based on the fussim2d heinen 2001 model describes a one dimensional vertical water transport through different soil layers the emman3g model uses the richards equation richards 1931 the richards equation combines the continuity equation and darcy s law darcy 1856 to obtain the general governing flow equation for incompressible water movement in non deformable porous media in one dimension the richards equation is given as 1 θ d t z k θ h θ z k θ z s r m l c m 3 d 1 here θ is the volumetric water content ml cm 3 t is the time d z is the vertical coordinate plane oriented positive downwards cm k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 h is the pressure head cm and s r is the root water uptake sink term for crop water uptake uniformly distributed over the crop area and uniformly distributed within the first 30 cm of soil layer ml cm 3 d 1 eq 1 is non linear due to the non linear constitutive relationships between h θ and k for this reason the water retention characteristic θ h is given by the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 2 s h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 1 h 0 here s is the effective saturation dimensionless θ r is the residual water content θ s is the water content at saturation and α cm 1 n dimensionless and m dimensionless are curve shape parameters the hydraulic conductivity characteristics are given by mualem mualem 1976 with m 1 1 n 3 k r s k s k s s λ 1 1 s 1 m m 2 here k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity dimensionless k s is equal to k at saturation cm d 1 and λ is a curve shape parameter dimensionless eq 1 with eqs 2 and 3 is solved numerically using the control volume finite element method heinen and willigen 1998 their numerical solution gives for any t the θ z and h z distributions from these the water flux densities q between any location can be computed from darcy s law the water results are then being used to solve the solute transport eq 1 the emman3g model solution of the richards equation was verified by an analytical solution for the transient vertical infiltration in a layered soil by observing the hydraulic behaviour of the soil subject to the constant infiltration rate during wetting and drying processes srivastava and yeh 1991 the model was also compared with the analytical solution of basha 1999 to determine if the model behaves well to predict time of ponding in this study the emman3g model was used to simulate 20 z soil compartments the z compartments 8 14 and 20 were used to represent the number of layers for which cumulative fluxes at bottom are considered this means compartments 8 14 and 20 represents 3 soil layers with a depth of 30 60 and 90 cm respectively drainage is considered as the water flow downward in soil compartment 20 90 cm 2 2 the de graaf model the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 was used to calculate the evapotranspiration required by the emman3g model for crop water uptake the evaporation is a function of the global radiation greenhouse temperature heating pipes temperature and the crop stage 4 e t a r b t t u b e t g h l l m a x m m here e t mm is the evapotranspiration which represents the evaporation of water at soil surface and the transpiration as the demand for root water uptake r j cm 2 is the global radiation outside the greenhouse and radiation from supplementary light t t u b e c is the temperature from heating pipes t g h c is the greenhouse temperature a mm cm2 j 1 is an empirical crop factor for the effect of radiation b mm c 1 is an empirical crop factor of the heating influence l is the current crop length and l m a x is the maximum crop length in this study the crop was considered to be full grown this means that the current crop length l is equal to the maximum crop length l m a x with a full grown crop the evaporation at soil surface is neglected and the evapotranspiration is considered as the demand for root water uptake the temperature of the pipes t t u b e was considered to be equal to the temperature of the greenhouse as there was no heating from the heating pipes the de graaf model has been applied to commercial nurseries of chrysanthemum grown in greenhouse soils voogt et al 2006 reducing the amount of irrigation used by growers 2 3 experimental data for the evaluation of the numerical model we compared the measured drainage from a lysimeter with model predictions the experimental data set consisted of time series data of daily measurements on drainage as well as time and dosage of irrigation the data set also held hourly climate measurements of air temperature air relative humidity and solar radiation the measurements were carried out in a chrysanthemum greenhouse in the wageningen ur greenhouse horticulture experimental field at bleiswijk netherlands 52 1 59 n 4 53 56 e altitude 2 m where a cut flower chrysanthemum cultivar was grown from june 26th to september 6th the data set was logged and uploaded to the letsgrow com company servers and was provided to us the soil type was a light clay soil the soil parameters for this soil were obtained from heinen et al 2012 the data used for this study was taken from 32 consecutive days starting date was july 31st 2016 representing the full grown stage previous to cutting in the chrysanthemum development period the lysimeter data used came from a lysimeter created by wageningen ur glastuinbouw the lysimeter was set up for drainage measurements and was equipped with soil moisture probes and a drain meter the lysimeter had a depth of 90 cm a length of 2 m and a width of 1 m in the lowest part of the lysimeter a layer of clay beads was placed to create 1d free outflow of the drained water the drain meter recorded daily the amount of water drained at 90 cm depth voogt et al 2012 2 4 model evaluation to assess the accuracy of the model predictions the predicted drainage was compared to measured drainage for this assessment the data set described in section 2 3 was used the following goodness of fit statistical variables were considered the root mean squared error rmse the mean relative error mre the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the index of agreement ioa given by 1 root mean square error 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i

all four measurements compare the prediction p i and observations o i at the individual level and express the difference between predictions and observations used to objectively assess the agreement between model and data rmse and mre were selected as they are standard statistical assessments that measure the error in deviation and the relative error to the general variation between the experimental data and predictions ioa and nse were selected because these statistical assessments are widely used in hydrologic modelling studies jain and sudheer 2008 krause et al 2005 nse ranges between 1 and where nse 1 means a complete model fit and for nse 0 the average of the observations would be a better predictor than the model ioa has limits 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement 2 5 model based analysis of the relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage predictions a model based analysis was performed to predict the relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage the model was evaluated in discrete time the irrigation strategy followed in this study is a common one for growers in the netherlands this strategy consists of one application every 72 h the average irrigation time was 35 min with a dosage of 11 mm 1 1 cm3 cm 2 eight fixed irrigation values were chosen representing the total amounts of water used over 32 days the lowest irrigation was 100 mm and the highest value was 170 mm these values were chosen based on the calculated total evapotranspiration 115 mm and the actual irrigation value from the experimental data 154 mm chrysanthemums are very sensitive to drought which means that a threshold pressure head would be relative high according to leith and burger 1989 kiehl et al 1992 this stress threshold is between 3 5 and 7 5 kpa 35 to 75 cm soil moisture pressures below 7 5 kpa caused significant reductions in fresh and dry weights of leaves stems and inflorescence based on this a threshold pressure head of 5 kpa 50 cm was chosen to indicate crop stress in this study the risk or likelihood of crop stress was defined as the ratio of hours in which the soil pressure head was below the threshold level compared to the total amount of hours of the model prediction drainage over a period of 32 days was defined as the cumulative sum of water flow moving downward at a depth of 90 cm the relation between the amount of drainage and risk of crop stress occurrence was visualized by plotting the different irrigation values on the x axis against the corresponding values of drainage and risk of crop stress y axis 2 6 uncertainty case studies four study cases were simulated to identify the effects of uncertainty in evapotranspiration and soil parameters on prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress based on a monte carlo algorithm in each case different irrigation decisions corresponding to low and high risk aversion of growers towards crop water stress are shown case 1 represents the relation between irrigation drainage and the risk of crop stress event in a light clay soil in this case study the evapotranspiration is assumed to be exactly known this case represents an ideal scenario where weather and consequently evapotranspiration can be predicted accurately and where there is no uncertainty in soil parameters case 2 represents a general case in the netherlands in which the parameters of a specific soil type are not precisely known this case considered the variation in the soil profile of the first layer 0 30 cm from two different types of greenhouse soils sandy and clay greenhouse soils in case 3 the evapotranspiration is uncertain while the type of soil and the soil parameters are precisely known this means there is no uncertainty in soil parameters case study 4 considers the combined uncertainty in evapotranspiration and uncertainty in a clay soil profile a clay soil profile was selected as the result from case study 2 revealed that this soil presented the most uncertain predictions both types of uncertainty were selected as it is likely that these sources of uncertainty will be present simultaneously in real cases in this study the average root length of a grown chrysanthemum crop was considered to be 30 cm for this reason soil parameter values from the report heinen et al 2012 were sorted by soil depth and layer 1 0 30 cm to study the uncertainty in the root stock layer more specifically the values from 13 soil profiles divided in clay soils 5 soil profiles and sandy soils 8 soil profiles were selected the parameter ranges per soil profile are presented in table 1 two different risk aversion strategies are included in each case study the first one represents the decision making of a grower with high risk aversion and accepts low risk of crop stress mean risk and standard deviation 1 the second one represents the strategy of a grower with low risk aversion who only accepts a high risk of crop stress mean risk and standard deviation 10 risk of crop stress also includes the standard deviation created by uncertainties 2 6 1 monte carlo algorithm a discrete probability density function was used to sample one soil type out multiple possible soil types table 1 the sampling was done randomly and each soil type had the same probability of being chosen this uniform probability was selected as every single type of soil is from a netherlands greenhouse soil this means that at least in the netherlands you can expect to encounter any of these soil types the sampling was done per soil type not per single parameter each soil type in table 1 was considered as a vector variable that includes the specific soil parameters for each individual soil type this sampling was done because it is known these parameters can be correlated therefore random sampling per parameter may give unrealistic combinations a discrete probability density function was also used to calculate the uncertainty in evapotranspiration each daily evapotranspiration was sampled in a similar fashion but now using 32 daily evapotranspiration measurements starting from 31 july 2016 the sampling was done randomly each random daily evapotranspiration sample had the same probability of being chosen after choosing the soil parameters and evapotranspiration values for a simulation the model was computed for 8 different irrigation values the model computations were done 1000 times the differences between 500 and 1000 simulations were very small therefore 1000 simulations was deemed a sufficiently large sample size a schematic representation on how the study cases were simulated is presented in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification the numerical solution of the richards equation and the handling of irrigation flux top boundary condition was verified against two analytical solutions the analytical solution of srivastava and yeh 1991 refers to transient infiltration in a layered soil with a constant groundwater level at the bottom the analytical solution is valid for exponential relationships for the water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics so that this was also temporarily implemented in the numerical model the srivastava and yeh 1991 solution also provides an expression for the cumulative outflow at the bottom both the pressure head depth profiles and cumulative outflow as a function of time were very well predicted by the model fig 2 a b in order to determine whether the model behaves well until ponding occurs at the soil surface the model was also compared to the analytical solution of basha 1999 who provided a solution for the volumetric water content as a function of depth and time as well as an expression for when ponding starts fig 2c shows the good prediction of the model also the basha 1999 analytical solution required exponential soil physical relationships the parameters were chosen such that the analytical solution yielded a time of ponding to occur at 2 5 h 3 2 model evaluation fig 3 shows that the simulated drainage agrees well with the measured data in trend as well as end value note that drainage water was first collected in the bottom of the lysimeter and was periodically pumped out and measured explaining the stepwise pattern in measured values this was not simulated in that way the mre was 8 9 which is comparable to the 8 observed in another study using the richards equation for drainage predictions ma et al 2011 prediction uncertainty computed by the model runs had an rmse of 2 3 mm and the ioa value was 0 980 while nse was 0 918 which means that the model agrees with the measured lysimeter data we assumed ioa and nse values above 0 9 as accurate krause et al 2005 3 3 relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage the methodology developed was able to predict the relation between risk of crop stress drainage and water use and their uncertainties under soil and evapotranspiration uncertainty in the case of a chrysanthemum crop four different case studies with different levels of uncertainty were explored each case included two risk aversion irrigation strategies the results on total irrigation and drainage from these irrigation strategies are presented in the table below table 2 3 3 1 case study 1 certain evapotranspiration and soil parameters the risk of crop stress evapotranspiration and drainage have a noticeable relation when irrigation is increased beyond the cumulative evapotranspiration drainage increases and risk is reduced on the other hand when irrigation is lower than the cumulative evapotranspiration there is no drainage but the risk of crop stress increases fig 4 fig 4 shows that reducing the amount of irrigation from 154 mm down to values close to 120 mm does not considerably increase the risk of crop stress at an irrigation below 105 mm crop stress risk increases with a reduction in irrigation this makes sense as reducing irrigation below the cumulative evapotranspiration 115 mm will create a total deficit of water intake needed by the crop a similar but reversed pattern is observed for drainage below 120 mm irrigation drainage is almost zero however increasing irrigation above this value increases drainage in a linear fashion this means that the value above the cumulative evapotranspiration of 115 mm seems to be a critical point for the risk of crop stress and drainage that should ideally be approached from above but not passed the grower s strategy resulted in a total irrigation of 154 mm over a 32 day period fig 4 shows that an irrigation between 150 and 160 mm does not induce a risk of crop stress however this safety comes at a price the predicted drainage is 25 mm the irrigation amount used by the grower is not exceptional for example jawaharlal et al 2017 used an irrigation of 360 mm for a 10 week season meaning 144 mm irrigation over 32 days this shows that common irrigation strategies can still be improved to reduce water use and drainage now comparing the two risk aversion strategies low and high aversion with the grower s strategy these strategies show a considerable reduction in irrigation and cumulative drainage a reduction of irrigation from 154 mm to 130 mm can still be considered a high risk aversion strategy 1 risk of crop stress according to the risk of crop stress prediction and a reduction from 154 mm to 120 mm can be considered a low risk aversion strategy 10 risk of crop stress the irrigation difference between a high and low risk decision is 10 mm this means there is still a possibility of improving the grower s irrigation strategy without a need to modify the strategy constrain of irrigation every third day summarizing in case of certain soil parameters and completely certain evapotranspiration a high risk aversion strategy 1 can safely reduce irrigation by 24 mm out of 154 mm this is a 16 reduction in water use drainage is reduced by 16 mm out of 25 mm this is a 64 reduction taking a low risk aversion strategy 10 can reduce an additional 10 mm in irrigation resulting in an additional 6 mm drainage reduction this is an additional 24 reduction in drainage for a total drainage reduction of 88 and a water use reduction of 22 3 3 2 case study 2 certain evapotranspiration uncertain soil profiles fig 5 shows the relation between drainage irrigation and crop stress compared with fig 4 there is not a large increase in prediction uncertainty however there is a notable change in the risk of crop stress fig 4 shows nearly zero risk at an irrigation of 130 mm whereas in fig 5 the risk is 9 additionally drainage is higher in this case study these differences can be explained as in this case the soil is a sandy soil the previous case had a light clay soil which has different hydraulic conductivity values in particular water infiltration is faster in a sandy soil resulting in a higher drainage and consequently less available water within the root zone layer in between irrigation events both risk averse strategies require more irrigation in a sandy soil a high risk aversion strategy would require an irrigation of 140 mm for a risk of crop stress below 1 and the irrigation in a low risk aversion strategy need to be at least 130 mm to maintain a risk of crop stress below 10 also drainage reduction turned out to be lower in a sandy soil an irrigation of 140 mm will have a drainage of 22 mm while an irrigation of 130 mm will have a drainage of 15 mm just as case 1 the difference in irrigation between high and low risk aversion strategies is 10 mm fig 6 shows the effect of uncertainty in clay soil parameters on the prediction uncertainty the prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress in the clay soil profile is much larger compared to the sandy soil the increase in risk of crop stress starts to be noticeable at irrigation values below 150 mm the mean risk is already above 2 7 with a standard deviation of 4 it is hard to implement the risk aversion strategies based on fig 6 for risk aversion it is necessary to know the potential risk however fig 6 shows that the risk itself is uncertain an irrigation of 170 mm yields a small risk of crop stress of 1 an irrigation of 150 mm already has a risk of crop stress of 2 7 with a standard deviation of 4 therefore according to fig 6 a high risk aversion strategy requires an irrigation of more than 170 mm this means it is no longer possible to improve the grower s strategy with a high risk aversion strategy as the grower s strategy has a total irrigation of 154 mm it is still possible to have a low risk aversion strategy but now the strategy requires an irrigation of at least 150 mm which is close to the grower s strategy making this strategy marginally better 3 3 3 case study 3 uncertain evapotranspiration and certain soil parameters fig 7 shows a large uncertainty in drainage as well as a large uncertainty in risk of crop stress on lower irrigation values thus the model prediction of drainage and risk of crop stress are heavily influenced by uncertainty in crop evapotranspiration however the influence of evapotranspiration uncertainty on drainage and crop stress predictions is specific to certain irrigation ranges fig 7 shows the uncertainty in drainage starts to increase when irrigation is above the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty 130 mm on the other hand the uncertainty in crop stress risk increases when irrigation is below the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty 120 mm it is possible to select low and high risk aversion strategies under uncertain evapotranspiration an irrigation of 140 mm has a risk of crop stress below 1 with negligible uncertainty this means an irrigation of 140 mm is a highly risk averse strategy the risk of crop stress at an irrigation of 130 mm has a risk of crop stress of 1 3 with an uncertainty of 2 this means an irrigation of 130 mm is a low risk averse strategy it is clear that an uncertain evapotranspiration has a low uncertainty effect on risk of crop stress for irrigation values higher than the uncertain evapotranspiration however its effect on uncertainty of drainage predictions is considerable at an irrigation of 140 mm the drainage is 17 4 6 mm the drainage prediction at an irrigation value of 130 mm is of 10 5 mm due to their uncertainties the effect of high and low risk irrigation strategies on drainage predictions will hardly be distinguishable statistically 3 3 4 case study 4 uncertain evapotranspiration and uncertain soil profiles fig 8 shows the combined effect of the evapotranspiration uncertainty and the clay soil profile uncertainty on drainage and risk of crop stress predictions with an average standard deviation of 6 mm drainage uncertainty is slightly larger than case study 3 this means that the combined uncertainty of evapotranspiration and clay soil profile exacerbate the uncertainty in drainage by 1 mm the risk of crop stress predictions as influenced by the combination of evapotranspiration uncertainty and soil profile uncertainty the mean of the risk of crop stress increased in a similar fashion to fig 6 in the study case 2 where irrigation values lower than 160 mm showed an increase in risk of crop stress additionally the standard deviation of the risk of crop stress was higher compared to fig 6 and displayed the same exponential increase similar to fig 7 in the case study 3 this means the sources of uncertainty aggravated the uncertainty in the risk of crop stress predictions it is not possible to give a high risk aversion strategy as the risk of crop stress is always higher than 1 a low risk aversion strategy would require an irrigation of at least 150 mm with a maximum predicted risk of 8 including the standard deviation 3 4 irrigation predictions the predictions with respect to irrigation are in agreement with the experimental results presented by turan et al 2015 where three irrigation strategies irrigation every 2 4 and 6 days and four different amounts of irrigation per strategy 357 6 268 2 178 8 89 4 mm for a 65 days period were used scaling these values to 32 days this comes down to 175 2 131 4 87 6 and 43 8 mm conclusions from turan et al 2015 state that an interval of 2 or 4 days irrigation with an irrigation amount of 131 4 mm can be used to save water without affecting crop quality an irrigation of 87 6 mm reduced crop quality stem length stem weight and number of flowers per plant this is in line with our predictions as an irrigation of at least 130 mm has a risk of crop stress below 10 with the exception of uncertain clay soil profiles the balance between irrigation drainage and risk of crop stress can help growers to select an irrigation strategy suitable to their interest while taking into account uncertainty caused by unforeseen variations in soil and climatic environment for general applicability of the methodology developed the case study should be extended to different types of soils and crops as well as their climatic environments for example an important factor for water stress is the water uptake rate of the crop water uptake depends on growth stage and climatic variables such as temperature and humidity the results of this case study imply that a large reduction of drainage and water use can be established by adjusting the amount of water applied following a standard irrigation strategy for the example case in this study it was possible to reduce drainage by 88 and water use by 22 while having a negligible risk of crop stress without a need to change the frequency of irrigations fig 4 however these results should be interpreted with caution since drainage and risk of stress predictions change considerably when the effect of uncertainties in the evapotranspiration and soil profile are included fig 8 3 5 uncertainty in evapotranspiration unpredictable variation in weather specifically solar radiation constitutes uncertainty in evapotranspiration nowadays weather predictions are more accurate however it is still impossible to consider weather predictions deterministically as a consequence uncertainty in weather and its effects on model processes like crop evapotranspiration need to be taken into account nonetheless the uncertainty in risk of crop stress only increases as the total irrigation approaches the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty from above fig 7 this means that as long as the crop has enough irrigation to compensate for the unpredicted variation in weather evapotranspiration the risk of crop stress will not increase if the evapotranspiration is uncertain and irrigation is near the point where evapotranspiration demand cannot be completely fulfilled the uncertainty in risk of crop stress prediction increases thus it is possible to have low risk irrigation strategies under uncertain evapotranspiration at the expense of higher irrigation values 3 6 uncertainty in soil profiles there are two main points of attention in how soil profiles influence an irrigation strategy first it is important to understand how different soil types perform to accommodate a better irrigation strategy the infiltration rate for sandy soils is higher than for clay soils this means the same irrigation strategy will perform differently on a different type of soil second the difference between a certain and uncertain irrigation strategy prediction lies in the certainty of soil parameters therefore it is important to consider the uncertainty in soil parameters in other words it is not enough just to know the soil type but to be sure of the soil parameters the difference between the larger uncertainty in fig 6 compared to fig 5 is due to the variation in parameters between soil types there is a high variation in the soil profile hydraulic conductivity at saturation point k s in sandy soils the standard deviation of k s was 7 8 cm d 1 the standard deviation of k s in clay soils was much higher namely 797 1 cm d 1 3 7 improving irrigation predictions in this study only the amount of water application was adjusted the dosages were equal per application as were the time intervals between applications in principle an irrigation strategy can be modified for future studies it would be worthwhile to include the effect of different irrigation strategies based on dosage frequency and time of the day on drainage and crop stress predictions also a promising method to further improve drainage reduction while maintaining a low risk of water stress lies in moisture sensing and feedback control that enable application of water only at times and locations when and where needed and with appropriate dosages accordingly to the principles of precision agriculture for example frequent low volume dosages on sandy soils where infiltration occurs faster such a solution does require investments in technology as well as in machine intelligence to enable feedback control that balances crop stress risk against drainage via model predictions 4 conclusions the methodology developed in this study can be applied to case studies to provide advice on water and drainage reduction by adapting existing irrigation strategies additionally this methodology included the uncertainty in water and drainage predictions as well as the risk of crop stress events results showed that a large amount of water and drainage can be reduced by only adjusting the irrigation dosage for the case study at hand it was possible to reduce drainage by 88 and total water use by 22 while maintaining a low 1 risk of a crop stress event however these results only hold in an idealized scenario including uncertainty in the parameters of soil profiles and the evapotranspiration increased the uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress predictions in the case where evapotranspiration and clay soil profile uncertainty were combined the uncertainty in risk of crop stress reached to a point where no water could be saved without a considerable risk nevertheless results point out that uncertainty in evapotranspiration only provide significant uncertainty in crop stress risk when total irrigation approaches the cumulative uncertain evapotranspiration making it possible to have low risk irrigation strategies even under uncertain evapotranspiration results also indicate that certainty in soil transport predictions provide certainty in crop stress risk which will be required to achieve water savings under acceptable risk levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

10748,two thirds of human water use is linked to agricultural practices including crop irrigation furthermore excess irrigation leads to drainage problems for this reason reduced irrigation strategies need to be implemented to protect water resources however low irrigation may lead to crop water stress a fast and inexpensive way to predict the necessary amount of irrigation required is by a model based approach with this approach it is possible to explore the relation between irrigation crop water stress and drainage however parameter uncertainty can reduce prediction accuracy therefore the aims of this research were 1 to develop and test a methodology that allows the analysis of uncertainty sources in irrigation strategies 2 to identify how much irrigation can be reduced while maintaining a low risk of crop stress and 3 to explore the influence of uncertainty in soil parameters and evapotranspiration on model predictions results from a realistic case considered in this study indicated that while maintaining a low risk of crop stress 1 it is possible to reduce drainage by 88 and water use 22 for a conventional irrigation strategy this reduction is dependent on the type of risk aversion strategy and is specific for a case scenario where variations are certain keywords hydraulic conductivity monte carlo uncertainty richards equation evapotranspiration 1 introduction efficient water use is one of the main issues within agriculture agriculture is the largest single user of fresh water accounting for nearly 75 of current human water use fao 2016 often water has a low cost and as a form of risk aversion growers tend to over irrigate to prevent crop water stress hence the irrigation strategies followed by growers are usually not very water efficient an important consequence of over irrigation is drainage irrigation water that drains to the groundwater can transport pesticides and nutrients e g nitratehers which may harm the environment the high consumption of fresh water and groundwater contamination has sparked a growing interest from policy makers in irrigation management to minimize water use and to protect water sources from agricultural pollution gholamhoseini et al 2013 the european union established a regulatory framework for groundwater protection against pollution and deterioration in europe council of the european union 2000 the aim of this regulatory framework is to institute actions to prevent and control groundwater pollution defined as a direct or indirect introduction of contaminants into the groundwater as a result of human activities the desired situation according to this regulatory framework would be to have zero drainage from agricultural practices however this is a bit short sighted since reducing too much drainage can have negative effects the absence of drainage can lead to an increase in soluble salts in the soil profile a case study of drainage and salt leaching in southeast turkey concluded that there was a statistically significant relationship between the amount of drained water and salt leaching bahçeci and nacar 2009 another case study focused on the aksu river basin in northwest china indicated that drainage should be maintained at 186 mm per year in that region to prevent ecological consequences hu et al 2017 from a grower s point of view the desired situation is predominantly to prevent crop water stress as much as possible so the overall desired situation that can be formulated from the above is to reduce water use from irrigation and to reduce drainage as much as possible without affecting the salt dynamics in farmlands while maintaining a low risk of crop stress reducing drainage and avoiding crop water stress are two conflicting objectives from a management point of view the former is achieved by reducing the amount of irrigation the latter by increasing it consequently growers struggle to reduce the amount of drainage even policy makers are aware of this struggle and included a key change in a revision of the eu regulatory framework in 2006 stating that the protection of groundwater may in some areas require a change in farming or forestry practices which could entail a loss of income council of the european union 2006 hence reducing drainage via irrigation reduction is a pressing issue in farming unfortunately it is not easily solved this has multiple reasons first it is hard to measure drainage growers can measure soil water content to get an idea of the soil water status and adapt their irrigation scheduling accordingly however the unpredictable behaviour of soil sensors on wetter soils makes drainage predictions difficult to estimate with water measurements alone whalley et al 2001 the most common way to measure drainage is by using underground devices for water catchment called lysimeters the use of lysimeters however is not very practical installation is usually expensive and may require considerable maintenance allen et al 1998 second drainage is also hard to predict evapotranspiration is an important factor underlying drainage and can vary daily due to changing weather conditions such as radiation temperature and air humidity malone et al 2007 additionally water transport rates vary with soil type and crop growth stages molz 1981 these varying and uncertain circumstances make it hard to predict how much water will drain and consequently to what extent the crop will endure water stress this uncertainty leads to risk avoiding strategies in the form of high dosage irrigation third crop stress is hard to monitor timely visual cues like dropping leaves plant coloration change in leaf area and change in turgor pressure may indeed indicate water stress however by the time these visual cues appear crop production may already be irreversibly affected netzer et al 2009 an approach to reduce water use and drainage is via model based scenario studies plant soil atmosphere models describe water flow dynamics to predict soil water drainage and crop status an extensive array of models has been developed for simulation studies on soil water flow drainage and yield predictions for example saltmed ragab 2002 swap kroes et al 2017 and daisy jensen et al 1997 simulate plant growth yield and soil water dynamics these models have been used in scenario studies on yield and dry matter under deficit irrigation jensen et al 1997 kaoutar et al 2017 for drought risk assessments sun et al 2017 for nitrate leaching management in grasslands hack ten broeke 2001 for deep drainage simulations in coffee plantations pinto et al 2015 and for exploring optimal fertigation strategies for orange production using fussim3d qin et al 2016 uncertainty has also been included in water management mun et al 2015 applied an uncertainty analysis for the mississippi irrigation scheduling tool mist model showing that the margin of error uncertainty in the water balance value from mist was shown to be around 9 of that value which was deemed acceptable for agronomic systems a similar uncertainty analysis was performed by prats and picó 2010 where the performance and uncertainty of an irrigation scheduling method based on soil water balance was studied findings showed that the amount of water held by the soil is the most important hydraulic property of the soil these studies show how uncertainty in a model and parameters can lead to variation in results as well as to identify sensitive parameters nonetheless the interaction between different sources of uncertainty and the effect on drainage and crop stress predictions simultaneously and subsequently how uncertainty can influence the decision making of irrigation strategies is still missing in conclusion mathematical models are commonly used tools in agriculture and water management as a way to examine plant soil atmosphere systems without the need of sensors however there is still a need for a methodological framework to study the effect of different sources of uncertainty on drainage risk of crop stress and total amount of irrigation the aim of this study was to develop a method which considers different sources of uncertainty to explore the possibility to reduce irrigation and drainage while keeping the risk of a water stress event low more specifically the focus was on the following research questions to what extent can water use and drainage be reduced by adjusting the irrigation dosage while keeping the risk of crop stress acceptable what effects do uncertainty in type of soil profiles and evapotranspiration have on the prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress 2 materials and methods the methodology was divided into the following steps 1 a two module model framework was developed to explore the relation between drainage irrigation and risk of crop stress under uncertain evapotranspiration and uncertain soil properties the framework included a water flow module using the emman3g model which is a one dimensional version of the fussim2d heinen 2001 model and an evapotranspiration module based on the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 2 a verification of the emman3g model was done by comparing the numerical simulated output on infiltration of the model against analytical solutions 3 the model predictions on drainage were evaluated with an experimental data set of drainage values from a lysimeter in a chrysanthemum soil greenhouse in the netherlands 4 predictions of risk of crop stress were based on a soil pressure head threshold value depending on the amount of hours the soil pressure head was below the threshold of 5 kpa the ratio of risk of crop stress increased 5 a monte carlo approach was used to assess the uncertainty in drainage and risk of crop stress predictions based on uncertainties in soil properties and evapotranspiration 6 the relation between amount of irrigation drainage and likelihood of crop stress occurrence was visualized the influences of uncertainty in daily evapotranspiration as well as uncertainty in soil parameters were simulated simultaneously as well as separately 2 1 the emman3g model the emman3g model based on the fussim2d heinen 2001 model describes a one dimensional vertical water transport through different soil layers the emman3g model uses the richards equation richards 1931 the richards equation combines the continuity equation and darcy s law darcy 1856 to obtain the general governing flow equation for incompressible water movement in non deformable porous media in one dimension the richards equation is given as 1 θ d t z k θ h θ z k θ z s r m l c m 3 d 1 here θ is the volumetric water content ml cm 3 t is the time d z is the vertical coordinate plane oriented positive downwards cm k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 h is the pressure head cm and s r is the root water uptake sink term for crop water uptake uniformly distributed over the crop area and uniformly distributed within the first 30 cm of soil layer ml cm 3 d 1 eq 1 is non linear due to the non linear constitutive relationships between h θ and k for this reason the water retention characteristic θ h is given by the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 2 s h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 1 h 0 here s is the effective saturation dimensionless θ r is the residual water content θ s is the water content at saturation and α cm 1 n dimensionless and m dimensionless are curve shape parameters the hydraulic conductivity characteristics are given by mualem mualem 1976 with m 1 1 n 3 k r s k s k s s λ 1 1 s 1 m m 2 here k r is the relative hydraulic conductivity dimensionless k s is equal to k at saturation cm d 1 and λ is a curve shape parameter dimensionless eq 1 with eqs 2 and 3 is solved numerically using the control volume finite element method heinen and willigen 1998 their numerical solution gives for any t the θ z and h z distributions from these the water flux densities q between any location can be computed from darcy s law the water results are then being used to solve the solute transport eq 1 the emman3g model solution of the richards equation was verified by an analytical solution for the transient vertical infiltration in a layered soil by observing the hydraulic behaviour of the soil subject to the constant infiltration rate during wetting and drying processes srivastava and yeh 1991 the model was also compared with the analytical solution of basha 1999 to determine if the model behaves well to predict time of ponding in this study the emman3g model was used to simulate 20 z soil compartments the z compartments 8 14 and 20 were used to represent the number of layers for which cumulative fluxes at bottom are considered this means compartments 8 14 and 20 represents 3 soil layers with a depth of 30 60 and 90 cm respectively drainage is considered as the water flow downward in soil compartment 20 90 cm 2 2 the de graaf model the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 was used to calculate the evapotranspiration required by the emman3g model for crop water uptake the evaporation is a function of the global radiation greenhouse temperature heating pipes temperature and the crop stage 4 e t a r b t t u b e t g h l l m a x m m here e t mm is the evapotranspiration which represents the evaporation of water at soil surface and the transpiration as the demand for root water uptake r j cm 2 is the global radiation outside the greenhouse and radiation from supplementary light t t u b e c is the temperature from heating pipes t g h c is the greenhouse temperature a mm cm2 j 1 is an empirical crop factor for the effect of radiation b mm c 1 is an empirical crop factor of the heating influence l is the current crop length and l m a x is the maximum crop length in this study the crop was considered to be full grown this means that the current crop length l is equal to the maximum crop length l m a x with a full grown crop the evaporation at soil surface is neglected and the evapotranspiration is considered as the demand for root water uptake the temperature of the pipes t t u b e was considered to be equal to the temperature of the greenhouse as there was no heating from the heating pipes the de graaf model has been applied to commercial nurseries of chrysanthemum grown in greenhouse soils voogt et al 2006 reducing the amount of irrigation used by growers 2 3 experimental data for the evaluation of the numerical model we compared the measured drainage from a lysimeter with model predictions the experimental data set consisted of time series data of daily measurements on drainage as well as time and dosage of irrigation the data set also held hourly climate measurements of air temperature air relative humidity and solar radiation the measurements were carried out in a chrysanthemum greenhouse in the wageningen ur greenhouse horticulture experimental field at bleiswijk netherlands 52 1 59 n 4 53 56 e altitude 2 m where a cut flower chrysanthemum cultivar was grown from june 26th to september 6th the data set was logged and uploaded to the letsgrow com company servers and was provided to us the soil type was a light clay soil the soil parameters for this soil were obtained from heinen et al 2012 the data used for this study was taken from 32 consecutive days starting date was july 31st 2016 representing the full grown stage previous to cutting in the chrysanthemum development period the lysimeter data used came from a lysimeter created by wageningen ur glastuinbouw the lysimeter was set up for drainage measurements and was equipped with soil moisture probes and a drain meter the lysimeter had a depth of 90 cm a length of 2 m and a width of 1 m in the lowest part of the lysimeter a layer of clay beads was placed to create 1d free outflow of the drained water the drain meter recorded daily the amount of water drained at 90 cm depth voogt et al 2012 2 4 model evaluation to assess the accuracy of the model predictions the predicted drainage was compared to measured drainage for this assessment the data set described in section 2 3 was used the following goodness of fit statistical variables were considered the root mean squared error rmse the mean relative error mre the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the index of agreement ioa given by 1 root mean square error 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i

all four measurements compare the prediction p i and observations o i at the individual level and express the difference between predictions and observations used to objectively assess the agreement between model and data rmse and mre were selected as they are standard statistical assessments that measure the error in deviation and the relative error to the general variation between the experimental data and predictions ioa and nse were selected because these statistical assessments are widely used in hydrologic modelling studies jain and sudheer 2008 krause et al 2005 nse ranges between 1 and where nse 1 means a complete model fit and for nse 0 the average of the observations would be a better predictor than the model ioa has limits 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement 2 5 model based analysis of the relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage predictions a model based analysis was performed to predict the relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage the model was evaluated in discrete time the irrigation strategy followed in this study is a common one for growers in the netherlands this strategy consists of one application every 72 h the average irrigation time was 35 min with a dosage of 11 mm 1 1 cm3 cm 2 eight fixed irrigation values were chosen representing the total amounts of water used over 32 days the lowest irrigation was 100 mm and the highest value was 170 mm these values were chosen based on the calculated total evapotranspiration 115 mm and the actual irrigation value from the experimental data 154 mm chrysanthemums are very sensitive to drought which means that a threshold pressure head would be relative high according to leith and burger 1989 kiehl et al 1992 this stress threshold is between 3 5 and 7 5 kpa 35 to 75 cm soil moisture pressures below 7 5 kpa caused significant reductions in fresh and dry weights of leaves stems and inflorescence based on this a threshold pressure head of 5 kpa 50 cm was chosen to indicate crop stress in this study the risk or likelihood of crop stress was defined as the ratio of hours in which the soil pressure head was below the threshold level compared to the total amount of hours of the model prediction drainage over a period of 32 days was defined as the cumulative sum of water flow moving downward at a depth of 90 cm the relation between the amount of drainage and risk of crop stress occurrence was visualized by plotting the different irrigation values on the x axis against the corresponding values of drainage and risk of crop stress y axis 2 6 uncertainty case studies four study cases were simulated to identify the effects of uncertainty in evapotranspiration and soil parameters on prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress based on a monte carlo algorithm in each case different irrigation decisions corresponding to low and high risk aversion of growers towards crop water stress are shown case 1 represents the relation between irrigation drainage and the risk of crop stress event in a light clay soil in this case study the evapotranspiration is assumed to be exactly known this case represents an ideal scenario where weather and consequently evapotranspiration can be predicted accurately and where there is no uncertainty in soil parameters case 2 represents a general case in the netherlands in which the parameters of a specific soil type are not precisely known this case considered the variation in the soil profile of the first layer 0 30 cm from two different types of greenhouse soils sandy and clay greenhouse soils in case 3 the evapotranspiration is uncertain while the type of soil and the soil parameters are precisely known this means there is no uncertainty in soil parameters case study 4 considers the combined uncertainty in evapotranspiration and uncertainty in a clay soil profile a clay soil profile was selected as the result from case study 2 revealed that this soil presented the most uncertain predictions both types of uncertainty were selected as it is likely that these sources of uncertainty will be present simultaneously in real cases in this study the average root length of a grown chrysanthemum crop was considered to be 30 cm for this reason soil parameter values from the report heinen et al 2012 were sorted by soil depth and layer 1 0 30 cm to study the uncertainty in the root stock layer more specifically the values from 13 soil profiles divided in clay soils 5 soil profiles and sandy soils 8 soil profiles were selected the parameter ranges per soil profile are presented in table 1 two different risk aversion strategies are included in each case study the first one represents the decision making of a grower with high risk aversion and accepts low risk of crop stress mean risk and standard deviation 1 the second one represents the strategy of a grower with low risk aversion who only accepts a high risk of crop stress mean risk and standard deviation 10 risk of crop stress also includes the standard deviation created by uncertainties 2 6 1 monte carlo algorithm a discrete probability density function was used to sample one soil type out multiple possible soil types table 1 the sampling was done randomly and each soil type had the same probability of being chosen this uniform probability was selected as every single type of soil is from a netherlands greenhouse soil this means that at least in the netherlands you can expect to encounter any of these soil types the sampling was done per soil type not per single parameter each soil type in table 1 was considered as a vector variable that includes the specific soil parameters for each individual soil type this sampling was done because it is known these parameters can be correlated therefore random sampling per parameter may give unrealistic combinations a discrete probability density function was also used to calculate the uncertainty in evapotranspiration each daily evapotranspiration was sampled in a similar fashion but now using 32 daily evapotranspiration measurements starting from 31 july 2016 the sampling was done randomly each random daily evapotranspiration sample had the same probability of being chosen after choosing the soil parameters and evapotranspiration values for a simulation the model was computed for 8 different irrigation values the model computations were done 1000 times the differences between 500 and 1000 simulations were very small therefore 1000 simulations was deemed a sufficiently large sample size a schematic representation on how the study cases were simulated is presented in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification the numerical solution of the richards equation and the handling of irrigation flux top boundary condition was verified against two analytical solutions the analytical solution of srivastava and yeh 1991 refers to transient infiltration in a layered soil with a constant groundwater level at the bottom the analytical solution is valid for exponential relationships for the water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics so that this was also temporarily implemented in the numerical model the srivastava and yeh 1991 solution also provides an expression for the cumulative outflow at the bottom both the pressure head depth profiles and cumulative outflow as a function of time were very well predicted by the model fig 2 a b in order to determine whether the model behaves well until ponding occurs at the soil surface the model was also compared to the analytical solution of basha 1999 who provided a solution for the volumetric water content as a function of depth and time as well as an expression for when ponding starts fig 2c shows the good prediction of the model also the basha 1999 analytical solution required exponential soil physical relationships the parameters were chosen such that the analytical solution yielded a time of ponding to occur at 2 5 h 3 2 model evaluation fig 3 shows that the simulated drainage agrees well with the measured data in trend as well as end value note that drainage water was first collected in the bottom of the lysimeter and was periodically pumped out and measured explaining the stepwise pattern in measured values this was not simulated in that way the mre was 8 9 which is comparable to the 8 observed in another study using the richards equation for drainage predictions ma et al 2011 prediction uncertainty computed by the model runs had an rmse of 2 3 mm and the ioa value was 0 980 while nse was 0 918 which means that the model agrees with the measured lysimeter data we assumed ioa and nse values above 0 9 as accurate krause et al 2005 3 3 relation between irrigation risk of crop stress and drainage the methodology developed was able to predict the relation between risk of crop stress drainage and water use and their uncertainties under soil and evapotranspiration uncertainty in the case of a chrysanthemum crop four different case studies with different levels of uncertainty were explored each case included two risk aversion irrigation strategies the results on total irrigation and drainage from these irrigation strategies are presented in the table below table 2 3 3 1 case study 1 certain evapotranspiration and soil parameters the risk of crop stress evapotranspiration and drainage have a noticeable relation when irrigation is increased beyond the cumulative evapotranspiration drainage increases and risk is reduced on the other hand when irrigation is lower than the cumulative evapotranspiration there is no drainage but the risk of crop stress increases fig 4 fig 4 shows that reducing the amount of irrigation from 154 mm down to values close to 120 mm does not considerably increase the risk of crop stress at an irrigation below 105 mm crop stress risk increases with a reduction in irrigation this makes sense as reducing irrigation below the cumulative evapotranspiration 115 mm will create a total deficit of water intake needed by the crop a similar but reversed pattern is observed for drainage below 120 mm irrigation drainage is almost zero however increasing irrigation above this value increases drainage in a linear fashion this means that the value above the cumulative evapotranspiration of 115 mm seems to be a critical point for the risk of crop stress and drainage that should ideally be approached from above but not passed the grower s strategy resulted in a total irrigation of 154 mm over a 32 day period fig 4 shows that an irrigation between 150 and 160 mm does not induce a risk of crop stress however this safety comes at a price the predicted drainage is 25 mm the irrigation amount used by the grower is not exceptional for example jawaharlal et al 2017 used an irrigation of 360 mm for a 10 week season meaning 144 mm irrigation over 32 days this shows that common irrigation strategies can still be improved to reduce water use and drainage now comparing the two risk aversion strategies low and high aversion with the grower s strategy these strategies show a considerable reduction in irrigation and cumulative drainage a reduction of irrigation from 154 mm to 130 mm can still be considered a high risk aversion strategy 1 risk of crop stress according to the risk of crop stress prediction and a reduction from 154 mm to 120 mm can be considered a low risk aversion strategy 10 risk of crop stress the irrigation difference between a high and low risk decision is 10 mm this means there is still a possibility of improving the grower s irrigation strategy without a need to modify the strategy constrain of irrigation every third day summarizing in case of certain soil parameters and completely certain evapotranspiration a high risk aversion strategy 1 can safely reduce irrigation by 24 mm out of 154 mm this is a 16 reduction in water use drainage is reduced by 16 mm out of 25 mm this is a 64 reduction taking a low risk aversion strategy 10 can reduce an additional 10 mm in irrigation resulting in an additional 6 mm drainage reduction this is an additional 24 reduction in drainage for a total drainage reduction of 88 and a water use reduction of 22 3 3 2 case study 2 certain evapotranspiration uncertain soil profiles fig 5 shows the relation between drainage irrigation and crop stress compared with fig 4 there is not a large increase in prediction uncertainty however there is a notable change in the risk of crop stress fig 4 shows nearly zero risk at an irrigation of 130 mm whereas in fig 5 the risk is 9 additionally drainage is higher in this case study these differences can be explained as in this case the soil is a sandy soil the previous case had a light clay soil which has different hydraulic conductivity values in particular water infiltration is faster in a sandy soil resulting in a higher drainage and consequently less available water within the root zone layer in between irrigation events both risk averse strategies require more irrigation in a sandy soil a high risk aversion strategy would require an irrigation of 140 mm for a risk of crop stress below 1 and the irrigation in a low risk aversion strategy need to be at least 130 mm to maintain a risk of crop stress below 10 also drainage reduction turned out to be lower in a sandy soil an irrigation of 140 mm will have a drainage of 22 mm while an irrigation of 130 mm will have a drainage of 15 mm just as case 1 the difference in irrigation between high and low risk aversion strategies is 10 mm fig 6 shows the effect of uncertainty in clay soil parameters on the prediction uncertainty the prediction uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress in the clay soil profile is much larger compared to the sandy soil the increase in risk of crop stress starts to be noticeable at irrigation values below 150 mm the mean risk is already above 2 7 with a standard deviation of 4 it is hard to implement the risk aversion strategies based on fig 6 for risk aversion it is necessary to know the potential risk however fig 6 shows that the risk itself is uncertain an irrigation of 170 mm yields a small risk of crop stress of 1 an irrigation of 150 mm already has a risk of crop stress of 2 7 with a standard deviation of 4 therefore according to fig 6 a high risk aversion strategy requires an irrigation of more than 170 mm this means it is no longer possible to improve the grower s strategy with a high risk aversion strategy as the grower s strategy has a total irrigation of 154 mm it is still possible to have a low risk aversion strategy but now the strategy requires an irrigation of at least 150 mm which is close to the grower s strategy making this strategy marginally better 3 3 3 case study 3 uncertain evapotranspiration and certain soil parameters fig 7 shows a large uncertainty in drainage as well as a large uncertainty in risk of crop stress on lower irrigation values thus the model prediction of drainage and risk of crop stress are heavily influenced by uncertainty in crop evapotranspiration however the influence of evapotranspiration uncertainty on drainage and crop stress predictions is specific to certain irrigation ranges fig 7 shows the uncertainty in drainage starts to increase when irrigation is above the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty 130 mm on the other hand the uncertainty in crop stress risk increases when irrigation is below the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty 120 mm it is possible to select low and high risk aversion strategies under uncertain evapotranspiration an irrigation of 140 mm has a risk of crop stress below 1 with negligible uncertainty this means an irrigation of 140 mm is a highly risk averse strategy the risk of crop stress at an irrigation of 130 mm has a risk of crop stress of 1 3 with an uncertainty of 2 this means an irrigation of 130 mm is a low risk averse strategy it is clear that an uncertain evapotranspiration has a low uncertainty effect on risk of crop stress for irrigation values higher than the uncertain evapotranspiration however its effect on uncertainty of drainage predictions is considerable at an irrigation of 140 mm the drainage is 17 4 6 mm the drainage prediction at an irrigation value of 130 mm is of 10 5 mm due to their uncertainties the effect of high and low risk irrigation strategies on drainage predictions will hardly be distinguishable statistically 3 3 4 case study 4 uncertain evapotranspiration and uncertain soil profiles fig 8 shows the combined effect of the evapotranspiration uncertainty and the clay soil profile uncertainty on drainage and risk of crop stress predictions with an average standard deviation of 6 mm drainage uncertainty is slightly larger than case study 3 this means that the combined uncertainty of evapotranspiration and clay soil profile exacerbate the uncertainty in drainage by 1 mm the risk of crop stress predictions as influenced by the combination of evapotranspiration uncertainty and soil profile uncertainty the mean of the risk of crop stress increased in a similar fashion to fig 6 in the study case 2 where irrigation values lower than 160 mm showed an increase in risk of crop stress additionally the standard deviation of the risk of crop stress was higher compared to fig 6 and displayed the same exponential increase similar to fig 7 in the case study 3 this means the sources of uncertainty aggravated the uncertainty in the risk of crop stress predictions it is not possible to give a high risk aversion strategy as the risk of crop stress is always higher than 1 a low risk aversion strategy would require an irrigation of at least 150 mm with a maximum predicted risk of 8 including the standard deviation 3 4 irrigation predictions the predictions with respect to irrigation are in agreement with the experimental results presented by turan et al 2015 where three irrigation strategies irrigation every 2 4 and 6 days and four different amounts of irrigation per strategy 357 6 268 2 178 8 89 4 mm for a 65 days period were used scaling these values to 32 days this comes down to 175 2 131 4 87 6 and 43 8 mm conclusions from turan et al 2015 state that an interval of 2 or 4 days irrigation with an irrigation amount of 131 4 mm can be used to save water without affecting crop quality an irrigation of 87 6 mm reduced crop quality stem length stem weight and number of flowers per plant this is in line with our predictions as an irrigation of at least 130 mm has a risk of crop stress below 10 with the exception of uncertain clay soil profiles the balance between irrigation drainage and risk of crop stress can help growers to select an irrigation strategy suitable to their interest while taking into account uncertainty caused by unforeseen variations in soil and climatic environment for general applicability of the methodology developed the case study should be extended to different types of soils and crops as well as their climatic environments for example an important factor for water stress is the water uptake rate of the crop water uptake depends on growth stage and climatic variables such as temperature and humidity the results of this case study imply that a large reduction of drainage and water use can be established by adjusting the amount of water applied following a standard irrigation strategy for the example case in this study it was possible to reduce drainage by 88 and water use by 22 while having a negligible risk of crop stress without a need to change the frequency of irrigations fig 4 however these results should be interpreted with caution since drainage and risk of stress predictions change considerably when the effect of uncertainties in the evapotranspiration and soil profile are included fig 8 3 5 uncertainty in evapotranspiration unpredictable variation in weather specifically solar radiation constitutes uncertainty in evapotranspiration nowadays weather predictions are more accurate however it is still impossible to consider weather predictions deterministically as a consequence uncertainty in weather and its effects on model processes like crop evapotranspiration need to be taken into account nonetheless the uncertainty in risk of crop stress only increases as the total irrigation approaches the cumulative evapotranspiration uncertainty from above fig 7 this means that as long as the crop has enough irrigation to compensate for the unpredicted variation in weather evapotranspiration the risk of crop stress will not increase if the evapotranspiration is uncertain and irrigation is near the point where evapotranspiration demand cannot be completely fulfilled the uncertainty in risk of crop stress prediction increases thus it is possible to have low risk irrigation strategies under uncertain evapotranspiration at the expense of higher irrigation values 3 6 uncertainty in soil profiles there are two main points of attention in how soil profiles influence an irrigation strategy first it is important to understand how different soil types perform to accommodate a better irrigation strategy the infiltration rate for sandy soils is higher than for clay soils this means the same irrigation strategy will perform differently on a different type of soil second the difference between a certain and uncertain irrigation strategy prediction lies in the certainty of soil parameters therefore it is important to consider the uncertainty in soil parameters in other words it is not enough just to know the soil type but to be sure of the soil parameters the difference between the larger uncertainty in fig 6 compared to fig 5 is due to the variation in parameters between soil types there is a high variation in the soil profile hydraulic conductivity at saturation point k s in sandy soils the standard deviation of k s was 7 8 cm d 1 the standard deviation of k s in clay soils was much higher namely 797 1 cm d 1 3 7 improving irrigation predictions in this study only the amount of water application was adjusted the dosages were equal per application as were the time intervals between applications in principle an irrigation strategy can be modified for future studies it would be worthwhile to include the effect of different irrigation strategies based on dosage frequency and time of the day on drainage and crop stress predictions also a promising method to further improve drainage reduction while maintaining a low risk of water stress lies in moisture sensing and feedback control that enable application of water only at times and locations when and where needed and with appropriate dosages accordingly to the principles of precision agriculture for example frequent low volume dosages on sandy soils where infiltration occurs faster such a solution does require investments in technology as well as in machine intelligence to enable feedback control that balances crop stress risk against drainage via model predictions 4 conclusions the methodology developed in this study can be applied to case studies to provide advice on water and drainage reduction by adapting existing irrigation strategies additionally this methodology included the uncertainty in water and drainage predictions as well as the risk of crop stress events results showed that a large amount of water and drainage can be reduced by only adjusting the irrigation dosage for the case study at hand it was possible to reduce drainage by 88 and total water use by 22 while maintaining a low 1 risk of a crop stress event however these results only hold in an idealized scenario including uncertainty in the parameters of soil profiles and the evapotranspiration increased the uncertainty of drainage and risk of crop stress predictions in the case where evapotranspiration and clay soil profile uncertainty were combined the uncertainty in risk of crop stress reached to a point where no water could be saved without a considerable risk nevertheless results point out that uncertainty in evapotranspiration only provide significant uncertainty in crop stress risk when total irrigation approaches the cumulative uncertain evapotranspiration making it possible to have low risk irrigation strategies even under uncertain evapotranspiration results also indicate that certainty in soil transport predictions provide certainty in crop stress risk which will be required to achieve water savings under acceptable risk levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

10749,facing with the scarcity of water resource and irrational fertilizer use it is highly important to supply plants with water and fertilizer in a coordination pattern to improve yield with high water use efficiency wue a field experiment was conducted in 2012 and 2014 to investigate the effect of n supply methods on biomass accumulation and distribution yield components and wue of maize zea mays l under different partial root zone irrigations in the hexi corridor of northwest china three irrigation methods included alternate furrow irrigation ai fixed furrow irrigation fi and conventional furrow irrigation ci three n supply methods included alternate n supply an fixed n supply fn and conventional n supply cn were applied in combination with each irrigation method leaf area index lai shoot biomass and root length density at different growth stages yield components biomass distribution in different shoot organs and wue of maize were determined results showed that lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages shoot biomass at the r6 stage grain yield harvest index hi and wue of maize were significantly increased by an or cn compared to fn in each irrigation method as well as by ai compared to ci and fi in each n supply method compared to ci coupled with cn cicn ai coupled with an or cn aian or aicn significantly increased the lai shoot biomass grain yield and wue of maize the biomass distribution proportion in kernel and contribution rate of the biomass transfer from other shoot organ to grain were also increased by aian and aicn resulting in significantly higher hi these increased shoot biomass accumulation and wue were related to the enhanced lai and root growth aian and aicn also achieved a greater kernels number per cob and 1000 kernel weight compared to cicn thus ai coupled with cn or an are proposed as a better pattern of irrigation and nitrogen application with positive regulative effects on shoot biomass accumulation and distribution and wue in the hexi corridor area of northwest china and other regions with similar environments these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of biomass accumulation and growth responses to nitrogen supply methods keywords shoot biomass leaf area index harvest index nitrogen supply method partial root zone irrigation pri zea mays 1 introduction increasing freshwater scarcity has called for researchers into developing new irrigation technologies with the purpose of improving water use efficiency wue in plant wang et al 2013 deficit irrigation di and partial root zone irrigation pri are two important water saving irrigation techniques liu et al 2006 di namely the entire root zone is irrigated with an amount of water less than the potential evapotranspiration and the minor stress that develops has minimal effects on the yield english and raja 1996 pri is a further development of di which alternately let one part of the root system be exposed to soil drying while the other part being irrigated wang et al 2017 in such a way pri induces the aba based root to shoot chemical signals to regulate growth and water use and thereby increase wue liu et al 2005 there are two ways for pri application namely alternate pri apri and fixed pri fpri in fpri the irrigation water is always applied to the same part of the root system in apri the irrigation water is applied to different parts of the root system in alternating fashion kang and zhang 2004 apri could increase wue compared to conventional irrigation kang et al 1998 li et al 2010 due to the significant reduction in the amount of irrigation water and no yield compromise kang et al 2000 du et al 2008 substantial research and practices have demonstrated that pri play a significant role in agriculture practice especially in the arid regions kang et al 1998 2000 tang et al 2005 2010a b shahnazari et al 2007 du et al 2008 2015 hu et al 2009 wang et al 2017 besides irrigation water nitrogen n fertilizer is another essential resource for crop production n fertilizer is becoming expensive because of increasing demand for fossil fuels in worldwide at the same time non judicious use of n fertilizer in common have reduced n use efficiency and created numerous environmental issues ju et al 2009 moreover soil n and water availability is closely linked and mutually influenced by one another hodge and neculai 1994 interaction and complementary activities of nutrients and water play an important role in agricultural production li et al 2009 it has been shown that n fertilizer management play a vital role in improving wue ogola et al 2002 li et al 2009 ran et al 2017 therefore how to realize high use efficiency of water and n fertilizer under pri is becoming a research hotspot generally total biomass decreased under soil water stress but some part of the plant such as root or reproductive organ may even obtain more biomass mingo et al 2004 pri may inhabit the overall growth of the crop but the economic yield was maintained resulting in the improved harvest index tang et al 2005 2010b with a same irrigation water input apri is considered to be more useful in maintaining plant biomass and grain yield compared with fpri li et al 2010 kang et al 1998 also apri accelerated the maturing process of crop resulting in the improved irrigation wue and economic return tang et al 2005 in addition appropriate n management is considered an important approach to improve harvest index and thereby achieve high grain yield of crop moser et al 2006 zhan et al 2011 therefore it is speculated that increasing harvest index through manipulating n fertilization should be feasible under pri information on grain yield formation is vital for high economical return in kernel crops production grain yield is a function of ears number per unit area kernels number per ear and kernel weight zhang et al 2014 which are influenced by soil moisture nutrition temperature and light status bertheloot et al 2008 yin et al 2017 meanwhile leaf area index lai is an important agronomic parameter which is used to reflect crop growth and predict crop yield fageria et al 2006 giunta et al 2008 yin et al 2017 moreover both yield formation and lai are influenced by management of irrigation water and n fertilizer reducing quantity of irrigation water and n fertilizer significantly decreased kernel number and kernel weight of maize moser et al 2006 ran et al 2016 high n rate obtained a maximum lai under full irrigation pandey et al 2000 in addition appropriate n supply pattern increased lai at the r1 stage of maize under a well water condition wang et al 2019 thus coordinating supply of n fertilizer and irrigation water can be an effective approach to improve crop yield by regulating yield formation and lai it has been proved that the traditional n management does not favor improve water use and n uptake by rice under intermittent irrigation practice mao et al 2002 however majority of previous investigations followed the n supply is uniformly applied either as basal application or topdressing the coordination of n supply and irrigation pattern has received the limited attention skinner et al 1998 our previous works have showed that apri coupled with conventional or alternate n supplyimprove root growth and distribution of maize and maintain more soil no3 n and water within the upper soil layers 0 40 cm for a longer period during maize season compared to conventional irrigation and fertilization qi et al 2017 qi and hu 2017 however whether shoot biomass accumulation yield formation and wue of crop are influenced by n supply and irrigation patterns remain largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution lai changes and yield components in response to varying n supply methods and 2 the effects on grain yield and wue of maize under pri 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field study was carried out at the wuwei experimental station for efficient use of crop water ministry of agriculture and rural affairs p r china latitude 37 52 20

evapotranspiration of 2000 mm the groundwater level is consistently 40 m below the soil surface the average air temperature precipitation and sunshine hours during the maize growing season across the two study years measured at a weather station within the experimental site are shown in table 1 the soil texture was a light sandy loam with mean soil bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 and mean field capacity fc of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 100 cm soil depths ran et al 2016 in the cultivated layer 0 40 cm the ph was 8 15 the amounts of organic matter total n available phosphorus and available potassium were 15 90 g kg 1 0 85 g kg 1 6 22 mg kg 1 and 236 24 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 crop management furrows and ridges establishment and phosphorus fertilizer application were described in details by qi et al 2017 briefly ridges were built in a west east direction and 20 kg p ha 1 superphosphate was uniformly applied before the planting grain maize with variety of golden northwest no 22 was sown in the ridges the planted density was 73 000 plants ha 1 the crop was sown on april 19 and 20 and was harvested on september 20 and 22 in 2012 and 2014 respectively 2 3 experimental design the experiment factors comprised of irrigation method and n fertilizer supply method the irrigation methods included conventional furrow irrigation ci alternate furrow irrigation ai and fixed furrow irrigation fi in ci every furrow was evenly irrigated at each irrigation event in ai the neighboring two furrows were alternately irrigated during consecutive watering in fi irrigation was consistently fixed to one of the neighboring two furrows during consecutive watering the n supply methods included conventional n supply cn alternate n supply an and fixed n supply fn in cn n fertilizer was applied to all furrows in an n fertilizer was alternately applied to one of the neighboring two furrows in consecutive fertilizer application in fn application of n fertilizer was fixed to only one of the neighboring two furrows the experimental plan resulted in 9 treatments in 2012 as following cian cicn cifn aian aicn aifn fian ficn and fifn fifn was conducted by two approaches namely fifns n fertilizer applied to the irrigated furrow under fi and fifnd n fertilizer applied to the non irrigated furrow under fi according to the results of 2012 the cifn aifn fian ficn fifns and fifnd treatments obviously reduced the biomass accumulation and grain yield compared to other n supply or irrigation methods also our earlier study has shown that fixed n supply resulted in obvious reduction in grain yield of maize under conventional furrow irrigation qi et al 2014 moreover the negative effect of fixed pri in the arid area and its mechanism was confirmed in the previous researches kang et al 2000 tang et al 2010b thus only the aian aicn cian and cicn treatments were included in 2014 there were three replications for each treatment in the two years twice as much water and or n was applied to the irrigated fertilized furrow in the alternate and fixed treatments as that to one furrow in conventional treatments resulting in the same input in n and water for all treatments qi et al 2017 200 kg n ha 1 urea was broadcasted to the center of the furrows in 5 cm deep qi et al 2017 which is a recommended n rate in maize production in the local area yang and su 2009 n fertilizer was applied before planting 50 at the v12 25 and vt 25 stages of maize which corresponds to 1 84 and 98 days after planting dap in 2012 and 1 82 and 96 dap in 2014 respectively based on farmer s practice in the local area irrigation was applied immediately after planting and at the v6 v12 vt and r2 stages 75 mm at each irrigation which corresponds to 3 45 84 98 and 119 dap in 2012 and 3 45 82 96 and 115 dap in 2014 respectively the details of irrigation application position of localized irrigation and n application are described in details by qi and hu 2017 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution for shoot biomass determination 3 plants in each plot at the v6 v12 vt and r2 stages and 5 plants at the r6 stage were harvested the sampled plants were split into the leave stem sheath and ear ears were separated into cobs and kernels samples were then dried at 75 0c to constant mass and weighed to determine the biomass and to calculate the biomass distribution proportion of each organ in the whole shoot 2 4 2 leaf area index lai leaf area was measured at the v6 v12 vt r1 r2 and r4 stages of maize for calculating lai leaf length l and leaf width w from ten plants were measured using a ruler the total leaf area a for maize leaves was calculated as following 1 a 0 759 i 1 m l i w i where m is all number of maize leaves in certain ground area i is a single maize leaf lai was obtained by the ratio of total leaf area to per unit ground area 2 4 3 grain yield and its components according to pandey et al 2000 five plants 1 25 m row length of each plot were sampled to collect grain yield components kernels per cob 1000 kernel weight ears per plant at the r6 stage the middle 6 m length of two rows was harvested to estimate grain yield at the r6 stage 2 4 4 soil water content soil water content was measured before sowing and at the v6 v12 vt r2 and r6 stages which corresponds to 1 44 83 97 118 and 149 dap in 2012 and 1 44 81 95 114 and 152 dap in 2014 respectively the sampling dates were 1 day earlier than the corresponding irrigation dates between the v6 and r2 the soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method according to qiu et al 2001 a hand driven auger with 3 cm diameter and 1 25 m length was used for soil sampling the sampling positions and section depths are described in details by qi et al 2017 briefly soil samples were collected from north south and under the plant at 0 2 m intervals to a vertical depth of 1 0 m in five separate layers 2 4 5 root sampling the sample for root measurement were taken from three sites in the middle of the plot at the r1 r2 r4 and r6 which corresponds to 104 114 133 and 149 dap in 2012 and 105 116 134 and 152 dap in 2014 respectively a hand driven auger with diameter in 7 cm and length in 1 25 m was used for sampling the above ground of the plant was removed before the sampling the sampling position of soil core for roots biomass was exactly following that for soil water content the approach by which root sample was separated from the soil roots washing and weight and the calculation of root length density rld cm cm 3 were described in details by qi et al 2017 in short roots were washed from the soil and then scanned to measure root length and dried to a consistent biomass for dry mass determination 2 4 6 evapotranspiration et et was calculated from irrigation water input precipitation and soil water depletion with the assumption of negligible drainage surface runoff and the contribution from water table beyond the measured depth according to li et al 2008 whose research was conducted in the same experimental area 2 5 data analysis harvest index was calculated by dividing grain per plot by total biomass after adjusting for moisture content pandey et al 2000 wue kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of maize grain yield to et according to xu et al 2009 biomass transfer amount bta g plant 1 biomass transfer rate btr and contribution rate of bta from other organ to grain gcr were respectively calculated using eqs 2 3 and 4 as following 2 b t a b i o m a s s i n o r g a n a t t h e v t b i o m a s s i n o r g a n a t t h e r 6 3 b t r b t a i n o r g a n b i o m a s s a m o u n t i n o r g a n a t t h e v t 100 4 g c r b t a g r a i n d r y w e i g h t 100 taking into account the different amount of treatments the data were analyzed separately in 2012 and 2014 analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model univariate procedure from spss 12 0 software the interaction effects between irrigation method and n fertilizer supply method were evaluated by using anova and means were compared for any significant difference among different treatments using the duncan s multiple range tests at significance level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 leaf area index lai as shown in table 2 lai in all treatments increased rapidly after the v6 and reached the maximum at the r1 followed by a continuing decline until the r4 lai at the v6 and v12 stages were very similar among the different treatments in 2012 and 2014 however lai at the vt stage was greatest in aian and aicn intermediate in aifn cian and cian and lowest in other treatments in 2012 compared to ci lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages were significantly increased by ai while those were significantly reduced by fi in each n supply method compared to cn lai at the three stages were comparable in the an plants while those were significantly smaller in the fn plants in each irrigation method aian and aicn resulted in the greatest lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages lai at the vt r1 r2 and r4 stages were significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cian and cicn in 2014 3 2 shoot biomass as shown in table 3 shoot biomass at the v6 stage was not statistically significant among the different treatments in the 2012 and 2014 however shoot biomass at the v12 stage was significantly lower in fi than in ai and ci irrespective of n supply method in 2012 shoot biomass at the vt r2 and r6 stages among different treatments showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 table 2 shoot biomass at the v12 vt r2 and r6 stages for aian aicn cian and cicn in 2014 showed a very similar variation compared to those in 2012 3 3 biomass distribution proportion in each organ as shown in table 4 biomass distribution proportion in leave at the r6 stage was very similar among different treatments both in 2012 and 2014 however biomass distribution proportion in stem was significantly lower in aicn and aian than in the other treatments in 2012 and 2014 the biomass distribution proportion in cob was also significantly lower in aian aicn aifn cian and cicn than in the other treatments in 2012 in addition aian aicn cian and cicn had no significant difference of biomass distribution proportion in cob in the two years biomass distribution proportion in kernel among different treatments showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 in 2012 and 2014 3 4 biomass translocation and its contribution rate to grain as shown in table 5 biomass transfer amount bta biomass transfer rate btr and contribution rate of bta from other organ to grain gcr in all treatments were greatest in leave followed by stem and sheath in 2012 and 2014 however the bta btr and gcr varied among the different treatments the bta in stem showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 in 2012 the bta in leave was greatest in aicn and aian lowest in fifnd and intermediate in the other treatments the bta btr and gcr in sheath were greatest in aian and aicn intermediate in aifn cian and cicn and lowest in the other treatments the btr in stem was greatest in the ai plants followed by ci and fi plants irrespective of n supply method the btr in leave was significantly lower in fifnd than in the other treatments the gcr in stem and leave were greatest in aian and aicn lowest in fifnd and intermediate in the other treatments the bta btr and gcr in stem leave and sheath were all significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cicn and cian in 2014 table 5 3 5 harvest index grain yield and its components as shown in table 6 grain yield and harvest index were significantly higher in the an and cn plants than in the fn plants in each irrigation method in 2012 greatest grain yield and harvest index were found in the ai plants followed by the ci and fi plants in each n supply method grain yield harvest index and kernels per cob were significantly greater in aian and aicn than in the other treatments ears per plant were smallest in fifns and fifnd 1000 kernel weight was significantly greater in the ai plants than in the ci and fi plants irrespective of n supply method grain yield and harvest index were significantly smaller in fifns and fifnd compared to the other treatments harvest index kernels per cob 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were all significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cian and cicn in 2014 3 6 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue as shown in table 7 ai plants had a smaller et compared to ci plants irrespective of n supply method in the two years wue among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the grain yield in the two years table 7 4 discussion the greater shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield at the r6 stage in the an and cn plants than in the fn plants under ai tables 3 and 6 could be related to the enhanced root biomass table 8 it has been widely proved that shoot growth is determined by root growth and development wang et al 2014 ju et al 2015 due to the growth and development of above ground plants depending on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by roots system fan et al 2016 moreover roots growth and distribution is a function of soil water and nutrients availability skinner et al 1998 our earlier works have found that aian and aicn resulted in a better soil water and n status thereby the enhanced root growth qi and hu 2017 qi et al 2017 on the other side earlier studies have illustrated that the enhanced shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield in maize are associated with the stay green in leaves thanks to greater remobilization of the reserved carbon at the pre silking he et al 2005 yin et al 2017 moreover it has been illustrated that a larger total leaf area at the late growth stage of wheat contributed to a longer duration of photosynthesis guinta et al 2008 in the present study an and cn significantly increased lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages in each irrigation method table 2 suggesting the enhanced photosynthesis in leaves and subsequently the increased shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield most dramatically compared to cicn ai coupled with an or cn significantly increased the lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages of maize table 2 this established a solid foundation to achieve a high biomass and grain yield of maize under aian and aicn the improved rld under aian and aicn at the three stages table 8 were conducive to enhance the lai of maize dai et al 1998 liedgens and richner 2001 it has been proved that leaf area and root growth are closely related at the post growth stages of maize especially at the r2 stage liedgens and richner 2001 because of beginning with the vt stage growth metabolism n uptake and water use of maize are very vigorous pandey et al 2000 the greater root length density indicates more potential supply of nutrients and water for plant growth skinner et al 1998 earlier study has illustrated that increasing contribution rate of biomass transfer amount from other organ to grain gcr is a useful approach to improve yield of maize yin et al 2016 in the present study aian and aicn achieved a greater gcr in leave sheath and stem table 5 suggesting that ai coupled with an or cn help enhance the biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain this may be explained as following first an or cn resulted in a better plant n nutrition under conventional irrigation qi et al 2014 contributing to the increased gcr yin et al 2016 second this could be related to difference in soil water content manipulated by different irrigation methods soil water content in the 60 100 cm soil layer was lower in the ai plants than the ci plants fig 1 suggesting that the alternate drying wetting cycles enhance lateral movement of soil water thereby reducing the possibility of deep percolation under ai in this regard soil water can be better utilized by crop roots in ai than in ci resulting in ci plants are vulnerable to drought stress than ai plants it has been shown that deficit irrigation adversely affect the biomass transfer from other organ to grain of wheat luo et al 2011 however some researchers have suggested that appropriate water deficit in certain stage or period help enhance the transformation of carbohydrate from source to sink kang et al 2002 ma et al 2014 indeed the mechanism behind relation between source and sink in response to n supply methods under pri is not clear and is worthy to be further studied crop redundant growth namely there is substantial redundant growth in plant height leaf area number of branches and tillers or reproductive organs length of growth period and ratio of biological yield to economic yield zhao et al 1996 based on the theory of redundant and over compensatory growth in plant it has been found that ai could improve harvest index in soybean graterol et al 1993 tomato mingo et al 2004 cotton tang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 b and maize kang et al 1998 compared to ci in consistentcy with this compared to ci biomass distribution proportion in kernel was significantly increased by ai in each n supply method table 4 resulting in the enhanced harvest index table 6 moreover an and cn had a higher biomass proportion in kernel compared to fn in each irrigation method table 4 this was attributed to appropriate n management that could make more carbohydrate distributed to grain due to a relatively adequate n supply during the post growth stages zhang et al 2011 our earlier work has shown that an and cn had a relatively uniform and high concentration of soil nitrate n during maize growing season qi and hu 2017 most dramatically compared to cicn aian and aicn significantly increased biomass distribution proportion in kernel table 4 and gcr in stem leave and sheath table 5 resulting in the harvest index increasing significantly table 6 this might be due to ai coupled with cn or an prolonging the vigorous growth period of maize data not shown and improving the lai table 2 thus alternate furrow irrigation coupled with alternate n supply or conventional n supply is beneficial to improve harvest index of maize a large number of studies have confirmed the water saving effect of ai and some scholars have elaborated on the mechanism behind it kang and zhang 2004 wang et al 2013 however in the case of most previous reports that ai improves the wue compared to ci the irrigation amount is significantly lower in the former than in the latter for example ai maintained maize grain yield with a 50 reduction in irrigation amount compared with ci kang et al 2000 in this regard sadras 2009 critically pointed out that ai improves wue due to the reduced amount of irrigation water rather than its technology itself in this study using the same irrigation amount ai increased the grain yield table 6 while decreased the et during the whole growth period of maize table 7 compared to the other irrigation treatments resulting in the greater wue table 7 this is in line with the findings of kang et al 1998 the enhanced rld table 8 and improved lai table 2 are two responsible factors for the greater grain yield table 6 the reason for the decrease in et may be explained as follows first this experimental area is characterized with a large evapotranspiration about 2000 mm in average annually and only the half root zone of ai plants was irrigated in each time resulting in the substantial reduction in the evaporation tang et al 2010a second ai could enhance the depletion of soil water storage in initial from the 0 100 cm soil profile jia et al 2014 this was attributed to the improved root growth table 8 and the increased roots hydraulic conductivity hu et al 2011 moreover in the present study an and cn achieved a higher wue compared to fn irrespective of irrigation method table 7 the previous studies have shown that given the same rate of n fertilizer appropriate n supply was useful to improve plant n nutrition which may favor enhanced photosynthetic capacity resulting in greater grain yield zhan et al 2011 and thereby improving the wue in the present study an and cn plants accumulated significantly greater amount of n as compared to the fn plants in each irrigation method data not shown indicating an improved plant n nutrition under an and cn most dramatically aian and aicn significantly increased wue by 8 1 19 4 compared to cicn table 7 suggesting that alternate furrow irrigation coupled with alternate n supply or conventional n supply were favorable to improve the wue of maize it can t be ignored here that shoot biomass and grain yield were all greater in 2012 than 2014 across all treatments this might be the result of different weather conditions between years unexpected high temperatures during grain filling table 1 1 4 higher may have contributed to the decreased biomass and grain yield in 2014 apraku et al 1983 nevertheless the patterns of shoot biomass accumulation and distribution yield components and wue among the different n supply and irrigation methods were consistent among years suggesting that the results are robust among varying environmental condition 5 conclusions alternate pri as well as conventional and alternate n supply resulted in greater leaf area index and root length density at r1 r2 and r4 stages and shoot biomass at the r6 stage and also biomass distribution proportion in kernel harvest index grain yield and wue of maize at the same n and irrigation amount alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply achieved the greatest biomass and grain yield thank to the enhanced leaf area index and root length density the improved harvest index under alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply was resulted from the enhanced biomass distribution proportion in kernel and the increased contribution rate of biomass transfer from the vegetative organ to grain meanwhile alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply generated more kernels per cob and 1000 kernel weight compared to the other treatments therefore alternate partial root zone irrigation coupled with conventional or alternate nitrogen supply can be used as a better pattern of nitrogen application and irrigation in maize field with positive regulative effects on shoot biomass accumulation and distribution and yield formation and wue in the hexi corridor area of northwest china and other regions with similar environments

10749,facing with the scarcity of water resource and irrational fertilizer use it is highly important to supply plants with water and fertilizer in a coordination pattern to improve yield with high water use efficiency wue a field experiment was conducted in 2012 and 2014 to investigate the effect of n supply methods on biomass accumulation and distribution yield components and wue of maize zea mays l under different partial root zone irrigations in the hexi corridor of northwest china three irrigation methods included alternate furrow irrigation ai fixed furrow irrigation fi and conventional furrow irrigation ci three n supply methods included alternate n supply an fixed n supply fn and conventional n supply cn were applied in combination with each irrigation method leaf area index lai shoot biomass and root length density at different growth stages yield components biomass distribution in different shoot organs and wue of maize were determined results showed that lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages shoot biomass at the r6 stage grain yield harvest index hi and wue of maize were significantly increased by an or cn compared to fn in each irrigation method as well as by ai compared to ci and fi in each n supply method compared to ci coupled with cn cicn ai coupled with an or cn aian or aicn significantly increased the lai shoot biomass grain yield and wue of maize the biomass distribution proportion in kernel and contribution rate of the biomass transfer from other shoot organ to grain were also increased by aian and aicn resulting in significantly higher hi these increased shoot biomass accumulation and wue were related to the enhanced lai and root growth aian and aicn also achieved a greater kernels number per cob and 1000 kernel weight compared to cicn thus ai coupled with cn or an are proposed as a better pattern of irrigation and nitrogen application with positive regulative effects on shoot biomass accumulation and distribution and wue in the hexi corridor area of northwest china and other regions with similar environments these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of biomass accumulation and growth responses to nitrogen supply methods keywords shoot biomass leaf area index harvest index nitrogen supply method partial root zone irrigation pri zea mays 1 introduction increasing freshwater scarcity has called for researchers into developing new irrigation technologies with the purpose of improving water use efficiency wue in plant wang et al 2013 deficit irrigation di and partial root zone irrigation pri are two important water saving irrigation techniques liu et al 2006 di namely the entire root zone is irrigated with an amount of water less than the potential evapotranspiration and the minor stress that develops has minimal effects on the yield english and raja 1996 pri is a further development of di which alternately let one part of the root system be exposed to soil drying while the other part being irrigated wang et al 2017 in such a way pri induces the aba based root to shoot chemical signals to regulate growth and water use and thereby increase wue liu et al 2005 there are two ways for pri application namely alternate pri apri and fixed pri fpri in fpri the irrigation water is always applied to the same part of the root system in apri the irrigation water is applied to different parts of the root system in alternating fashion kang and zhang 2004 apri could increase wue compared to conventional irrigation kang et al 1998 li et al 2010 due to the significant reduction in the amount of irrigation water and no yield compromise kang et al 2000 du et al 2008 substantial research and practices have demonstrated that pri play a significant role in agriculture practice especially in the arid regions kang et al 1998 2000 tang et al 2005 2010a b shahnazari et al 2007 du et al 2008 2015 hu et al 2009 wang et al 2017 besides irrigation water nitrogen n fertilizer is another essential resource for crop production n fertilizer is becoming expensive because of increasing demand for fossil fuels in worldwide at the same time non judicious use of n fertilizer in common have reduced n use efficiency and created numerous environmental issues ju et al 2009 moreover soil n and water availability is closely linked and mutually influenced by one another hodge and neculai 1994 interaction and complementary activities of nutrients and water play an important role in agricultural production li et al 2009 it has been shown that n fertilizer management play a vital role in improving wue ogola et al 2002 li et al 2009 ran et al 2017 therefore how to realize high use efficiency of water and n fertilizer under pri is becoming a research hotspot generally total biomass decreased under soil water stress but some part of the plant such as root or reproductive organ may even obtain more biomass mingo et al 2004 pri may inhabit the overall growth of the crop but the economic yield was maintained resulting in the improved harvest index tang et al 2005 2010b with a same irrigation water input apri is considered to be more useful in maintaining plant biomass and grain yield compared with fpri li et al 2010 kang et al 1998 also apri accelerated the maturing process of crop resulting in the improved irrigation wue and economic return tang et al 2005 in addition appropriate n management is considered an important approach to improve harvest index and thereby achieve high grain yield of crop moser et al 2006 zhan et al 2011 therefore it is speculated that increasing harvest index through manipulating n fertilization should be feasible under pri information on grain yield formation is vital for high economical return in kernel crops production grain yield is a function of ears number per unit area kernels number per ear and kernel weight zhang et al 2014 which are influenced by soil moisture nutrition temperature and light status bertheloot et al 2008 yin et al 2017 meanwhile leaf area index lai is an important agronomic parameter which is used to reflect crop growth and predict crop yield fageria et al 2006 giunta et al 2008 yin et al 2017 moreover both yield formation and lai are influenced by management of irrigation water and n fertilizer reducing quantity of irrigation water and n fertilizer significantly decreased kernel number and kernel weight of maize moser et al 2006 ran et al 2016 high n rate obtained a maximum lai under full irrigation pandey et al 2000 in addition appropriate n supply pattern increased lai at the r1 stage of maize under a well water condition wang et al 2019 thus coordinating supply of n fertilizer and irrigation water can be an effective approach to improve crop yield by regulating yield formation and lai it has been proved that the traditional n management does not favor improve water use and n uptake by rice under intermittent irrigation practice mao et al 2002 however majority of previous investigations followed the n supply is uniformly applied either as basal application or topdressing the coordination of n supply and irrigation pattern has received the limited attention skinner et al 1998 our previous works have showed that apri coupled with conventional or alternate n supplyimprove root growth and distribution of maize and maintain more soil no3 n and water within the upper soil layers 0 40 cm for a longer period during maize season compared to conventional irrigation and fertilization qi et al 2017 qi and hu 2017 however whether shoot biomass accumulation yield formation and wue of crop are influenced by n supply and irrigation patterns remain largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution lai changes and yield components in response to varying n supply methods and 2 the effects on grain yield and wue of maize under pri 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field study was carried out at the wuwei experimental station for efficient use of crop water ministry of agriculture and rural affairs p r china latitude 37 52 20 n longitude 102 50 50 e altitude 1581 m during the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons the site is in a typical continental temperate climate zone with mean annual precipitation of 164 4 mm mean annual evapotranspiration of 2000 mm the groundwater level is consistently 40 m below the soil surface the average air temperature precipitation and sunshine hours during the maize growing season across the two study years measured at a weather station within the experimental site are shown in table 1 the soil texture was a light sandy loam with mean soil bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 and mean field capacity fc of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 100 cm soil depths ran et al 2016 in the cultivated layer 0 40 cm the ph was 8 15 the amounts of organic matter total n available phosphorus and available potassium were 15 90 g kg 1 0 85 g kg 1 6 22 mg kg 1 and 236 24 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 crop management furrows and ridges establishment and phosphorus fertilizer application were described in details by qi et al 2017 briefly ridges were built in a west east direction and 20 kg p ha 1 superphosphate was uniformly applied before the planting grain maize with variety of golden northwest no 22 was sown in the ridges the planted density was 73 000 plants ha 1 the crop was sown on april 19 and 20 and was harvested on september 20 and 22 in 2012 and 2014 respectively 2 3 experimental design the experiment factors comprised of irrigation method and n fertilizer supply method the irrigation methods included conventional furrow irrigation ci alternate furrow irrigation ai and fixed furrow irrigation fi in ci every furrow was evenly irrigated at each irrigation event in ai the neighboring two furrows were alternately irrigated during consecutive watering in fi irrigation was consistently fixed to one of the neighboring two furrows during consecutive watering the n supply methods included conventional n supply cn alternate n supply an and fixed n supply fn in cn n fertilizer was applied to all furrows in an n fertilizer was alternately applied to one of the neighboring two furrows in consecutive fertilizer application in fn application of n fertilizer was fixed to only one of the neighboring two furrows the experimental plan resulted in 9 treatments in 2012 as following cian cicn cifn aian aicn aifn fian ficn and fifn fifn was conducted by two approaches namely fifns n fertilizer applied to the irrigated furrow under fi and fifnd n fertilizer applied to the non irrigated furrow under fi according to the results of 2012 the cifn aifn fian ficn fifns and fifnd treatments obviously reduced the biomass accumulation and grain yield compared to other n supply or irrigation methods also our earlier study has shown that fixed n supply resulted in obvious reduction in grain yield of maize under conventional furrow irrigation qi et al 2014 moreover the negative effect of fixed pri in the arid area and its mechanism was confirmed in the previous researches kang et al 2000 tang et al 2010b thus only the aian aicn cian and cicn treatments were included in 2014 there were three replications for each treatment in the two years twice as much water and or n was applied to the irrigated fertilized furrow in the alternate and fixed treatments as that to one furrow in conventional treatments resulting in the same input in n and water for all treatments qi et al 2017 200 kg n ha 1 urea was broadcasted to the center of the furrows in 5 cm deep qi et al 2017 which is a recommended n rate in maize production in the local area yang and su 2009 n fertilizer was applied before planting 50 at the v12 25 and vt 25 stages of maize which corresponds to 1 84 and 98 days after planting dap in 2012 and 1 82 and 96 dap in 2014 respectively based on farmer s practice in the local area irrigation was applied immediately after planting and at the v6 v12 vt and r2 stages 75 mm at each irrigation which corresponds to 3 45 84 98 and 119 dap in 2012 and 3 45 82 96 and 115 dap in 2014 respectively the details of irrigation application position of localized irrigation and n application are described in details by qi and hu 2017 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution for shoot biomass determination 3 plants in each plot at the v6 v12 vt and r2 stages and 5 plants at the r6 stage were harvested the sampled plants were split into the leave stem sheath and ear ears were separated into cobs and kernels samples were then dried at 75 0c to constant mass and weighed to determine the biomass and to calculate the biomass distribution proportion of each organ in the whole shoot 2 4 2 leaf area index lai leaf area was measured at the v6 v12 vt r1 r2 and r4 stages of maize for calculating lai leaf length l and leaf width w from ten plants were measured using a ruler the total leaf area a for maize leaves was calculated as following 1 a 0 759 i 1 m l i w i where m is all number of maize leaves in certain ground area i is a single maize leaf lai was obtained by the ratio of total leaf area to per unit ground area 2 4 3 grain yield and its components according to pandey et al 2000 five plants 1 25 m row length of each plot were sampled to collect grain yield components kernels per cob 1000 kernel weight ears per plant at the r6 stage the middle 6 m length of two rows was harvested to estimate grain yield at the r6 stage 2 4 4 soil water content soil water content was measured before sowing and at the v6 v12 vt r2 and r6 stages which corresponds to 1 44 83 97 118 and 149 dap in 2012 and 1 44 81 95 114 and 152 dap in 2014 respectively the sampling dates were 1 day earlier than the corresponding irrigation dates between the v6 and r2 the soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method according to qiu et al 2001 a hand driven auger with 3 cm diameter and 1 25 m length was used for soil sampling the sampling positions and section depths are described in details by qi et al 2017 briefly soil samples were collected from north south and under the plant at 0 2 m intervals to a vertical depth of 1 0 m in five separate layers 2 4 5 root sampling the sample for root measurement were taken from three sites in the middle of the plot at the r1 r2 r4 and r6 which corresponds to 104 114 133 and 149 dap in 2012 and 105 116 134 and 152 dap in 2014 respectively a hand driven auger with diameter in 7 cm and length in 1 25 m was used for sampling the above ground of the plant was removed before the sampling the sampling position of soil core for roots biomass was exactly following that for soil water content the approach by which root sample was separated from the soil roots washing and weight and the calculation of root length density rld cm cm 3 were described in details by qi et al 2017 in short roots were washed from the soil and then scanned to measure root length and dried to a consistent biomass for dry mass determination 2 4 6 evapotranspiration et et was calculated from irrigation water input precipitation and soil water depletion with the assumption of negligible drainage surface runoff and the contribution from water table beyond the measured depth according to li et al 2008 whose research was conducted in the same experimental area 2 5 data analysis harvest index was calculated by dividing grain per plot by total biomass after adjusting for moisture content pandey et al 2000 wue kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of maize grain yield to et according to xu et al 2009 biomass transfer amount bta g plant 1 biomass transfer rate btr and contribution rate of bta from other organ to grain gcr were respectively calculated using eqs 2 3 and 4 as following 2 b t a b i o m a s s i n o r g a n a t t h e v t b i o m a s s i n o r g a n a t t h e r 6 3 b t r b t a i n o r g a n b i o m a s s a m o u n t i n o r g a n a t t h e v t 100 4 g c r b t a g r a i n d r y w e i g h t 100 taking into account the different amount of treatments the data were analyzed separately in 2012 and 2014 analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model univariate procedure from spss 12 0 software the interaction effects between irrigation method and n fertilizer supply method were evaluated by using anova and means were compared for any significant difference among different treatments using the duncan s multiple range tests at significance level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 leaf area index lai as shown in table 2 lai in all treatments increased rapidly after the v6 and reached the maximum at the r1 followed by a continuing decline until the r4 lai at the v6 and v12 stages were very similar among the different treatments in 2012 and 2014 however lai at the vt stage was greatest in aian and aicn intermediate in aifn cian and cian and lowest in other treatments in 2012 compared to ci lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages were significantly increased by ai while those were significantly reduced by fi in each n supply method compared to cn lai at the three stages were comparable in the an plants while those were significantly smaller in the fn plants in each irrigation method aian and aicn resulted in the greatest lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages lai at the vt r1 r2 and r4 stages were significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cian and cicn in 2014 3 2 shoot biomass as shown in table 3 shoot biomass at the v6 stage was not statistically significant among the different treatments in the 2012 and 2014 however shoot biomass at the v12 stage was significantly lower in fi than in ai and ci irrespective of n supply method in 2012 shoot biomass at the vt r2 and r6 stages among different treatments showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 table 2 shoot biomass at the v12 vt r2 and r6 stages for aian aicn cian and cicn in 2014 showed a very similar variation compared to those in 2012 3 3 biomass distribution proportion in each organ as shown in table 4 biomass distribution proportion in leave at the r6 stage was very similar among different treatments both in 2012 and 2014 however biomass distribution proportion in stem was significantly lower in aicn and aian than in the other treatments in 2012 and 2014 the biomass distribution proportion in cob was also significantly lower in aian aicn aifn cian and cicn than in the other treatments in 2012 in addition aian aicn cian and cicn had no significant difference of biomass distribution proportion in cob in the two years biomass distribution proportion in kernel among different treatments showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 in 2012 and 2014 3 4 biomass translocation and its contribution rate to grain as shown in table 5 biomass transfer amount bta biomass transfer rate btr and contribution rate of bta from other organ to grain gcr in all treatments were greatest in leave followed by stem and sheath in 2012 and 2014 however the bta btr and gcr varied among the different treatments the bta in stem showed a very similar variation compared with the lai at the r4 in 2012 the bta in leave was greatest in aicn and aian lowest in fifnd and intermediate in the other treatments the bta btr and gcr in sheath were greatest in aian and aicn intermediate in aifn cian and cicn and lowest in the other treatments the btr in stem was greatest in the ai plants followed by ci and fi plants irrespective of n supply method the btr in leave was significantly lower in fifnd than in the other treatments the gcr in stem and leave were greatest in aian and aicn lowest in fifnd and intermediate in the other treatments the bta btr and gcr in stem leave and sheath were all significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cicn and cian in 2014 table 5 3 5 harvest index grain yield and its components as shown in table 6 grain yield and harvest index were significantly higher in the an and cn plants than in the fn plants in each irrigation method in 2012 greatest grain yield and harvest index were found in the ai plants followed by the ci and fi plants in each n supply method grain yield harvest index and kernels per cob were significantly greater in aian and aicn than in the other treatments ears per plant were smallest in fifns and fifnd 1000 kernel weight was significantly greater in the ai plants than in the ci and fi plants irrespective of n supply method grain yield and harvest index were significantly smaller in fifns and fifnd compared to the other treatments harvest index kernels per cob 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were all significantly greater in aian and aicn than in cian and cicn in 2014 3 6 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue as shown in table 7 ai plants had a smaller et compared to ci plants irrespective of n supply method in the two years wue among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the grain yield in the two years table 7 4 discussion the greater shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield at the r6 stage in the an and cn plants than in the fn plants under ai tables 3 and 6 could be related to the enhanced root biomass table 8 it has been widely proved that shoot growth is determined by root growth and development wang et al 2014 ju et al 2015 due to the growth and development of above ground plants depending on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by roots system fan et al 2016 moreover roots growth and distribution is a function of soil water and nutrients availability skinner et al 1998 our earlier works have found that aian and aicn resulted in a better soil water and n status thereby the enhanced root growth qi and hu 2017 qi et al 2017 on the other side earlier studies have illustrated that the enhanced shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield in maize are associated with the stay green in leaves thanks to greater remobilization of the reserved carbon at the pre silking he et al 2005 yin et al 2017 moreover it has been illustrated that a larger total leaf area at the late growth stage of wheat contributed to a longer duration of photosynthesis guinta et al 2008 in the present study an and cn significantly increased lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages in each irrigation method table 2 suggesting the enhanced photosynthesis in leaves and subsequently the increased shoot biomass accumulation and grain yield most dramatically compared to cicn ai coupled with an or cn significantly increased the lai at the r1 r2 and r4 stages of maize table 2 this established a solid foundation to achieve a high biomass and grain yield of maize under aian and aicn the improved rld under aian and aicn at the three stages table 8 were conducive to enhance the lai of maize dai et al 1998 liedgens and richner 2001 it has been proved that leaf area and root growth are closely related at the post growth stages of maize especially at the r2 stage liedgens and richner 2001 because of beginning with the vt stage growth metabolism n uptake and water use of maize are very vigorous pandey et al 2000 the greater root length density indicates more potential supply of nutrients and water for plant growth skinner et al 1998 earlier study has illustrated that increasing contribution rate of biomass transfer amount from other organ to grain gcr is a useful approach to improve yield of maize yin et al 2016 in the present study aian and aicn achieved a greater gcr in leave sheath and stem table 5 suggesting that ai coupled with an or cn help enhance the biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain this may be explained as following first an or cn resulted in a better plant n nutrition under conventional irrigation qi et al 2014 contributing to the increased gcr yin et al 2016 second this could be related to difference in soil water content manipulated by different irrigation methods soil water content in the 60 100 cm soil layer was lower in the ai plants than the ci plants fig 1 suggesting that the alternate drying wetting cycles enhance lateral movement of soil water thereby reducing the possibility of deep percolation under ai in this regard soil water can be better utilized by crop roots in ai than in ci resulting in ci plants are vulnerable to drought stress than ai plants it has been shown that deficit irrigation adversely affect the biomass transfer from other organ to grain of wheat luo et al 2011 however some researchers have suggested that appropriate water deficit in certain stage or period help enhance the transformation of carbohydrate from source to sink kang et al 2002 ma et al 2014 indeed the mechanism behind relation between source and sink in response to n supply methods under pri is not clear and is worthy to be further studied crop redundant growth namely there is substantial redundant growth in plant height leaf area number of branches and tillers or reproductive organs length of growth period and ratio of biological yield to economic yield zhao et al 1996 based on the theory of redundant and over compensatory growth in plant it has been found that ai could improve harvest index in soybean graterol et al 1993 tomato mingo et al 2004 cotton tang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 b and maize kang et al 1998 compared to ci in consistentcy with this compared to ci biomass distribution proportion in kernel was significantly increased by ai in each n supply method table 4 resulting in the enhanced harvest index table 6 moreover an and cn had a higher biomass proportion in kernel compared to fn in each irrigation method table 4 this was attributed to appropriate n management that could make more carbohydrate distributed to grain due to a relatively adequate n supply during the post growth stages zhang et al 2011 our earlier work has shown that an and cn had a relatively uniform and high concentration of soil nitrate n during maize growing season qi and hu 2017 most dramatically compared to cicn aian and aicn significantly increased biomass distribution proportion in kernel table 4 and gcr in stem leave and sheath table 5 resulting in the harvest index increasing significantly table 6 this might be due to ai coupled with cn or an prolonging the vigorous growth period of maize data not shown and improving the lai table 2 thus alternate furrow irrigation coupled with alternate n supply or conventional n supply is beneficial to improve harvest index of maize a large number of studies have confirmed the water saving effect of ai and some scholars have elaborated on the mechanism behind it kang and zhang 2004 wang et al 2013 however in the case of most previous reports that ai improves the wue compared to ci the irrigation amount is significantly lower in the former than in the latter for example ai maintained maize grain yield with a 50 reduction in irrigation amount compared with ci kang et al 2000 in this regard sadras 2009 critically pointed out that ai improves wue due to the reduced amount of irrigation water rather than its technology itself in this study using the same irrigation amount ai increased the grain yield table 6 while decreased the et during the whole growth period of maize table 7 compared to the other irrigation treatments resulting in the greater wue table 7 this is in line with the findings of kang et al 1998 the enhanced rld table 8 and improved lai table 2 are two responsible factors for the greater grain yield table 6 the reason for the decrease in et may be explained as follows first this experimental area is characterized with a large evapotranspiration about 2000 mm in average annually and only the half root zone of ai plants was irrigated in each time resulting in the substantial reduction in the evaporation tang et al 2010a second ai could enhance the depletion of soil water storage in initial from the 0 100 cm soil profile jia et al 2014 this was attributed to the improved root growth table 8 and the increased roots hydraulic conductivity hu et al 2011 moreover in the present study an and cn achieved a higher wue compared to fn irrespective of irrigation method table 7 the previous studies have shown that given the same rate of n fertilizer appropriate n supply was useful to improve plant n nutrition which may favor enhanced photosynthetic capacity resulting in greater grain yield zhan et al 2011 and thereby improving the wue in the present study an and cn plants accumulated significantly greater amount of n as compared to the fn plants in each irrigation method data not shown indicating an improved plant n nutrition under an and cn most dramatically aian and aicn significantly increased wue by 8 1 19 4 compared to cicn table 7 suggesting that alternate furrow irrigation coupled with alternate n supply or conventional n supply were favorable to improve the wue of maize it can t be ignored here that shoot biomass and grain yield were all greater in 2012 than 2014 across all treatments this might be the result of different weather conditions between years unexpected high temperatures during grain filling table 1 1 4 higher may have contributed to the decreased biomass and grain yield in 2014 apraku et al 1983 nevertheless the patterns of shoot biomass accumulation and distribution yield components and wue among the different n supply and irrigation methods were consistent among years suggesting that the results are robust among varying environmental condition 5 conclusions alternate pri as well as conventional and alternate n supply resulted in greater leaf area index and root length density at r1 r2 and r4 stages and shoot biomass at the r6 stage and also biomass distribution proportion in kernel harvest index grain yield and wue of maize at the same n and irrigation amount alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply achieved the greatest biomass and grain yield thank to the enhanced leaf area index and root length density the improved harvest index under alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply was resulted from the enhanced biomass distribution proportion in kernel and the increased contribution rate of biomass transfer from the vegetative organ to grain meanwhile alternate pri coupled with conventional or alternate n supply generated more kernels per cob and 1000 kernel weight compared to the other treatments therefore alternate partial root zone irrigation coupled with conventional or alternate nitrogen supply can be used as a better pattern of nitrogen application and irrigation in maize field with positive regulative effects on shoot biomass accumulation and distribution and yield formation and wue in the hexi corridor area of northwest china and other regions with similar environments these results can also provide a basis for in depth understanding of the mechanism of biomass accumulation and growth responses to nitrogen supply methods declaration of competing interest the authors
