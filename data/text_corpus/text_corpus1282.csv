alluvial deposits which have a significant thickness and porosity generally contain abundant groundwater resources liu et al 2014 in order to meet the human agriculture industry and drinking and ecosystem needs particularly in arid regions with limited access to the surface water resources groundwater aquifers must be accurately studied and managed in this regard estimating the rate of groundwater recharge i e the rate at which the aquifer water is replenished is imperative for sustainable management of these valuable resources min et al 2015 simmers 1990 recharge is defined as the

unsaturated zone or surface water body scanlon et al 2006 estimation of groundwater aquifer recharge is important for determination of water resource availability and vulnerability assessment of the aquifer to pollutant scanlon et al 2002 although recharge is one of the most important components of the groundwater system it is one of the least understood largely due to widely spatial and temporal variabilities and so difficulties in direct measurement of the rates healy 2010 precipitation is the only source of natural recharge healy 2010 that occurs mainly through the unsaturated zone vu and merkel 2019 moreover aquifer surface recharge can also be due to the irrigation return flows deep percolation of irrigation water in some irrigated areas as various agricultural practices may significantly affect the amount of aquifer recharge séraphin et al 2016 irrigation return flows defined as the excess of irrigation water that is not evapo transpirated or evacuated by direct surface drainage and which deep percolates and returns to an aquifer dewandel et al 2008 jafari et al 2012 constitute a significant amount of groundwater recharge in arid and semi arid regions where the natural recharge rates are low healy 2010 aquifer recharge occurs through diffuse areally distributed and focused concentrated mechanisms healy 2010 diffuse recharge refers to recharge derived from precipitation or irrigation that occurs uniformly over large areas whereas focused or localized recharge refers to concentrated recharge from surface depressions in topography such as streams lakes and playas scanlon et al 2006 2002 groundwater recharge cannot be measured directly therefore it is estimated by different methods with varying degree of success bakker et al 2013 niazi et al 2017

2010 hendrickx and walker 2017 kinzelbach et al 2002 lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 zhang and walker 1998 the methods can be categorized into three groups depending on whether the focus of the

water table fluctuation wtf method and tracer techniques such as heat and historical tracers 36cl 3h and chloride mass balance cmb are found in scanlon et al 2002 and healy 2010 recharge estimates are occasionally reported as actual or potential recharge rushton 2017 the actual recharge is referred as the water that has reached the water table and is estimated from groundwater saturated zone studies while potential recharge is referred as the amount of infiltrated water that is estimated from studies of the unsaturated zone and surface water bodies it is the water that has infiltrated that may or may not reach the water table due to processes in unsaturated zone or the ability of the saturated zone to accept recharge estimating recharge is difficult in arid and semi arid regions where the water tables are deep and recharge rates are limited by availability of the water at the land surface which is controlled by climatic factors such as precipitation and evapotranspiration scanlon et al 2002 the estimation is additionally complicated by irrigation practices in some basins as the irrigation return flows create new sources of diffuse recharge jiménez martínez et al 2009

primarily on arid and semi arid regions the results provided valuable information on groundwater recharge based on the field studies as a general outcome the rainfall values below 200 mm usually result in negligible recharge scanlon et al 2006 a comprehensive synthesize of the recharge estimates for arid and semi arid regions of the world including recharge studies from africa australia china india and united states was carried out by scanlon et al 2006 some important results are summarized as 1 average natural recharge rates in arid and semi arid aquifers range from 0 2 to 35 mm year 1 which represent 0 1 to 5 of the annual precipitation 2 the chloride mass balance cmb is the most widely used technique for estimating recharge in these regions 3 recharge values in irrigated areas range from 10 to 485 mm year 1 equivalent to 1 25 of irrigation plus precipitation and 4 land use and land cover changes related to deforestation and changes from natural scrublands to cultivated ecosystems increase the rates of recharge in birjand area se iran with dry climatic conditions and minimum rainfall groundwater is the only source of water for drinking agriculture and industrial activities population growth and related increased withdrawals from groundwater resources have recently imposed more stresses on the aquifer accurate knowledge of the recharge is highly important for sustainable management and development of the valuable scarce groundwater reservoirs in this region therefore this study was aimed to estimate groundwaters recharge into arid land alluvial aquifer of birjand using various physical wbe and wtf and tracers cmb and stable isotopes methods regarding the expected complexities of recharge process induced by unmanaged irrigated agriculture as the primary use of groundwater in this arid region it was also attempted to partitioning aquifer recharge between rainfall infiltration and irrigation return flow deep percolation of irrigation water 2 study area the study area of the birjand plain with an area of about 1383 km2 is located in south khorasan province se iran birjand city with a population of about 200 000 is the main residential area in this region the alluvial deposits of the plain with a thickness ranged from 5 to 225 m contain valuable groundwater resources namely as birjand aquifer which is stretched in shape along the approximate trend of e w fig 1 covering an area about 271 2 km2 of the plain surface the aquifer is mainly recharged from southern ophiolite highlands bagheran mountain range with maximum height of 2720 m above mean sea level and the general groundwater flow direction is from east to the west zare 2016 surface waters are limited to flash floods in waterways during rainy season winter to early spring and the groundwater aquifer is the only source of water for various uses in this arid region the aquifer is being discharged by 305 deep and semi deep wells with an annual rate of 60 million cubic meters mcm more than 85 of the discharged water is used in irrigated agriculture and the rest for industrial and drinking purposes sudegi 2018 aquifer withdrawals are more than the total recharge and so depletion of the groundwater storage is being occurred it results in declining of the water table with an average rate of about 47 cm year 1 the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 148 mm 2540 mm and 16 5 c respectively the climate regime of the region is defined as arid on the basis of the ratio of the mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration unesco 1979 the ratio is about 0 06 laying into the range determined for arid climates 0 05 0 2 3 methods amount of groundwater recharge to the birjand aquifer was estimated using four techniques including water table fluctuation wtf chloride mass balance cmb stable isotopes and water budget equation wbe recharge estimates were compared and then contributions of the rainfall infiltration and agricultural return flows to recharge of the birjand aquifer were determined 3 1 water table fluctuation wtf method the technique is based on the assumption that an increase in the water level in unconfined aquifers is due to the recharge water arriving at the water table scanlon et al 2002 accordingly recharge rate r is calculated as 1 r s y δ h δ t where sy is specific yield of the aquifer and δh denotes water table rise over time interval δt the formula for estimating recharge eq 1 has been derived from a simple water budget for the groundwater system assuming that water arriving at the water table goes immediately into storage and that sum of the other components of water budget equation e g base flow evapotranspiration subsurface flow away from or into the system and pumping are zero during the period of recharge healy 2010 the values of annual water table rise i e difference between the peak of the rise and low point of the extrapolated antecedent recession curve at the time of the peak healy 2010 were measured on groundwater hydrographs of the 11 piezometers installed in birjand aquifer during a period of 12 year from 2002 to 2016 fig 2 the results of the pumping tests performed in the birjand aquifer were used to estimate appropriate values of the specific yield the estimated values of annual recharge eq 1 were multiplied by the area of the thiessen s polygons surrounding the piezometers and then integrated to calculate annual volume of recharge to the aquifer 3 2 chloride mass balance cmb method water samples including 15 groundwater and 10 rainwater samples were collected during field campaigns in march and may 2017 chloride concentrations were measured by titration with agno3 solution and potassium chromate as an indicator table 1 then aquifer recharge rate r was estimated using eq 2 healy 2010 2 r p c p c gw in which p is annual precipitation depth mm and cp and cgw are chloride concentrations mg l in precipitation and groundwater respectively annual precipitation depth measured in birjand meteorological station at the central parts of the plain was used in eq 2 to estimate the recharge rate 3 3 stable isotopes dark bottles containing 30 ml of the rain and groundwater were prepared to be analyzed for oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h isotopes in the atomic energy agency of iran the isotopes were measured by off axis integrated cavity output laser spectroscopy against carefully calibrated in house standards and controls both 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios are expressed in delta values δ in units of per mil with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow scale standard table 1 with a precision of 0 6 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o clark and fritz 2013 3 δ 18 o 1000 18 o 16 o sample 18 o 16 o standard 18 o 16 o standard 4 δ 2 h 1000 2 h 1 h sample 2 h 1 h standard 2 h 1 h standard where the sample and standard subscripts refer to the ratios in the sample water and vsmow respectively annual recharge rates mm were estimated using the measured isotopes based on the following empirical equations allison et al 1984 presented in clark and fritz 2013 5 δ 18 o shift 3 recharge mm year 1 6 δ 2 h shift 22 recharge mm year 1 where the shifts represent the displacement of groundwater samples from the local meteoric water line lmwl 3 4 water budget equation wbe method aquifer water budget is an accounting of the water movement into and out off and storage change within the groundwater system healy 2010 the most common way of estimating recharge by wbe method is the indirect or residual approach whereby all of the variables in the water budget equation except recharge r are measured or estimated and r is set equal to the residual scanlon et al 2002 the following balance equation was applied for birjand aquifer to estimating groundwater recharge 7 r q off gw q on gw q p δ s gw where r is groundwater recharge q off gw is groundwater outflow q on gw is groundwater inflow q p is groundwater withdrawal by pumping wells and δ s gw is changes in groundwater aquifer storage all the terms are expressed as the volume of water during the balance period volume year 1 groundwater inflow and outflow rates q were calculated using darcy s equation q tiw considering transmissivity t hydraulic gradient i and width of the inlet and outlet flow channels on equipotential map of the aquifer changes in aquifer storage volume δ s gw was calculated using following equation 8 δ s gw a δ h s y where a is the aquifer surface area δ h is the value of the rise or decline of the water table during balance period and sy is the specific yield of the aquifer material it must be mentioned that depth to groundwater level is more than 5 m anywhere in the aquifer sudegi 2018 therefore evapotranspiration from groundwater system was neglected in water budget equation eq 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 recharge estimates based on wtf method groundwater hydrographs in the piezometers of the birjand aquifer are shown in fig 2 a general decreasing trend in groundwater levels is observed in most piezometers as the declining rates range from 14 to 69 cm year 1 the highest values are observed mainly at the western part of the aquifer where the groundwater is locally discharged by the concentrated agricultural wells groundwater levels are fluctuating in response to changes in recharge and discharge components of the aquifer system during the year groundwater rise is occurred in rainy season winter to early spring when the aquifer recharge from different probable sources such as rainfall and irrigation return flows exceeds the discharge groundwater recharge is more diminished out of the rainy season and over exploitation i e abstractions over than recharge of the aquifer causes decline of the water table in order to calculate the groundwater recharge using wtf method groundwater rises related to recharge events in rainy season were calculated based on the hydrographs and then combined to estimate the annual rises δh temporal variations of the water table rise in different piezometers are shown in fig 3 representing values mostly in the range of 0 5 to 1 m year 1 highest values of the water table rise are observed in some piezometers at the west of the aquifer with the lowest specific yield values of the specific yield in different parts of the birjand aquifer were determined based on pumping tests results sudegi 2018 and the spatial distribution of this parameter was investigated fig 4 specific yields vary in the range of 0 005 0 07 the highest values are observed in the east where the coarse sandy gravel to gravelly sand sediments are existed decreasing toward the west with fine sediments having dominant clay textures the average value of the specific yield of the birjand aquifer was estimated at 0 06 annual rates of the groundwater recharge in the thiessen s area of the piezometers fig 4 were calculated using eq 1 multiplied by the polygon area to estimate the recharge volume and then integrated to estimate the annual recharge volume fig 5 the values range from 7 2 to 11 mcm year 1 averaging as 9 mcm year 1 temporal variations of the annual recharges fig 5 represent the nearly constant rate of the aquifer recharge during the study period 2002 2016 in general the mean value of the groundwater recharge of the birjand aquifer is estimated about 33 2 mm year 1 9 mcm year 1 based on the wtf method 4 2 recharge estimates based on cmb method chloride cl content of the groundwater samples collected from different parts of the birjand aquifer was measured in the range of 234 to 2382 mg l table 1 and the average concentration of chloride in precipitation samples was about 14 5 mg l recharge rates estimated using cmb method eq 2 vary between 0 9 and 9 17 mm year 1 which are equivalent to the aquifer recharge volume of 0 24 2 5 mcm year 1 direct relationship between cl and na fig 6 proposes the halite dissolution as the main source of cl in groundwater confirming the non conservative behavior of chloride in birjand aquifer therefore the recharge values based on the lowest concentration of chloride in groundwater samples 9 2 mm year 1 or 2 5 mcm year 1 is recommended as the minimum reliable rate of the aquifer recharge based on the cmb method 4 3 recharge estimates based on stable isotopes the values of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater samples range from 6 24 to 7 11 and 38 45 to 44 34 table 1 and the mean values are 6 7 and 41 5 respectively the average values of about 6 73 for δ2h and 30 2 for δ18o were measured in the local rainfall samples groundwater samples from birjand aquifer have an 18o 2h composition gwl in fig 7 with the equation of δ2h 6 5 δ18o 1 8 that plots below but relatively parallel to the lmwl δ2h 7 1 δ18o 15 9 proposing recharge under conditions of direct infiltration clark and fritz 2013 it shows mixing between the evaporated soil moisture and subsequent rain that infiltrates and displaces the residual soil water downward until this mixed parcel of water will reach the aquifer under relatively uniform conditions of groundwater recharge groundwater should follow a line parallel but to displaced from lmwl for high rates of recharge minimal enrichment by evaporation is occurred and low shifts are expected whereas for low rates of recharge a large displacement for groundwater will be seen clark and fritz 2013 the displacement of groundwaters from lmwl δ2h and δ18o shifts were used to estimate recharge the average values of δ2h and δ18o shifts for the groundwaters from birjand aquifer are on the order of 10 and 1 5 respectively applying eqs 5 and 6 give recharge rates of about 4 to 4 8 mm year 1 for the birjand aquifer recharge 22 δ 2 h s h i f t 2 22 10 2 4 8 mm year 1 recharge 3 δ 18 o s h i f t 2 3 1 3 2 5 3 mm year 1 the average groundwater recharge into the birjand aquifer estimated by the stable isotope technique is reported as 5 0 mm year 1 or 1 4 mcm year 1 4 4 recharge estimates based on wbe method the components of the water balance equation of birjand aquifer were considered as the groundwater subsurface inflows q on gw and outflows q off gw withdrawals by pumping wells q p total recharge r and change in aquifer storage δ s gw inflow and outflow boundaries of the aquifer were determined on iso potential map of the aquifer fig 8 and volume rates of the groundwater flow into and out of the aquifer system were calculated using darcy s equation table 2 the transmissivity values of the aquifer estimated by pumping tests range between 300 to 700 m2 day and the hydraulic gradients slope of the water table vary from 0 0001 to 0 01 m m 1 total volume of the groundwater flow through 10 inlets and 1 outlet of the birjand aquifer were estimated at 45 7 and 4 6 mcm year 1 respectively total volume of the aquifer discharge by pumping wells is estimated about 60 mcm year 1 mostly used for irrigated agriculture 85 and in minor amounts for municipal and industrial purposes over exploitation of the aquifer i e discharge more than the recharge causes water table to be declined about 0 47 m year 1 it means depletion of the aquifer storage with an annual volume rate of 7 6 mcm year 1 δ s gw a δ h s y 271 2 10 6 0 47 0 06 7 6 mcm year 1 by substituting the above components in water budget equation of birjand aquifer eq 7 total groundwater recharge is set to be equal to the residual which is assessed to be about 11 3 mcm year 1 r q off gw q on gw q p δ s gw 4 6 45 7 60 7 6 11 3 mcm year 1 the value is equivalent to the aquifer recharge rate of about 41 7 mm year 1 4 5 comparing recharge estimates and partitioning recharge between rainfall and deep percolation of irrigation water the average rates of groundwater recharge into the birjand aquifer were estimated about 5 0 9 2 33 2 and 41 7 mm year 1 using the stables isotopes cmb wtf and water budget equation techniques respectively table 3 the lowest estimates are related to tracer methods including stable isotopes and cmb while the highest values are obtained from physical techniques of wtf and water budget equation environmental tracers such as chloride are particularly useful for quantifying low recharge rates in arid and semi arid regions healy 2010 the recharge estimates based on tracers are generally relied on the precipitation quality and quantity as the main source of recharge so the values of 5 0 to 9 2 mm year 1 are characterized as the rainfall recharge to the birjand aquifer representing 3 to 6 of the long term average annual precipitation it must be mentioned that an inherent assumption in eq 2 for estimating recharge by cmb method is that all of the chloride within the aquifer is derived from atmospheric deposition therefore additional chloride sources such as halite dissolution in birjand aquifer limit application of the method in this arid aquifer and similar cases irrigation is the primary use of water in arid regions todd and mays 2005 like the study area and irrigation return flows are considered as the important source of aquifer recharge in these areas jafari et al 2012 jiménez martínez et al 2009 time series analysis of irrigation return flows measured by lysimeters in semi arid agricultural regions of iran jafari et al 2012 confirmed the variations of irrigation return flow coefficients from 30 of the applied irrigated water in rainy seasons to less than 6 5 in dry periods high values of irrigation return flows in rainy seasons are mostly related to over irrigation of the agricultural fields by traditional methods border or flooding due to low water demands in this period based on the results an average annual irrigation return flow coefficient of 15 of the annual applied water was introduced these excess irrigated waters are considered as a potential source of groundwater recharge in these areas regarding the annual volume of irrigation water in birjand plain about 51 mcm total value of irrigation return flow deep percolation of excess irrigation water is estimated to be about 8 mcm year 1 no relationship is observed between wtf annual recharges and precipitation fig 9 confirming the more impacts of irrigation returns on recharge process of birjand aquifer both rainfall infiltration and deep percolation of irrigation water that are simultaneously added to water table during the rainy season increase the water level of the aquifer therefore the recharge estimates based on wtf method 9 mcm year 1 is representative of the total recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water to the aquifer the value is more confirmed by using wbe method in which the total recharges are calculated as 11 3 mcm year 1 a similar result showing the capability of wtf method to calculate total recharge of the aquifers was also reported by diouf et al 2012 in general total value of the recharge to the birjand aquifer is estimated about 9 to 11 averaging as 10 mcm year 1 by subtracting the annual rainfall recharge range from 1 4 to 2 5 with an approximate average of 2 mcm year 1 annual deep percolation of irrigation water is calculated about 8 mcm year 1 the value is in high accordance with the amount calculated by the above mentioned irrigation flow coefficient confirming the recharge estimates of the birjand aquifer 5 conclusion average recharge rates of the birjand aquifer were estimated about 5 0 9 17 33 2 and 41 7 mm year 1 using stable isotopes cmb wtf and wbe methods respectively wtf and wbe recharge estimates represent total recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water while stable isotopes and cmb methods calculate exclusively the rainfall recharge no relationships are observed between wtf annual recharge estimates and precipitation confirming the more impact of the irrigation return flows than the direct infiltration of rainwater on recharge process of the birjand aquifer total recharge to the birjand aquifer was estimated to be about 33 2 to 41 7 mm year 1 9 to 11 3 mcm year 1 based on wtf and wbe methods averaging as 37 5 mm year 1 10 mcm year 1 it was partitioned between the rainfall recharge 7 0 mm year 1 or 2 mcm year 1 estimated using tracer methods of isotopes and cmb and deep percolation of irrigation water 30 5 mm year 1 or 8 mcm year 1 the values represent an average rainfall recharge coefficient of about 4 8 of the annual precipitation and return flow coefficient of 15 of the total annual applied water for irrigation recharge estimates are in the range of the previous researches 0 1 5 for rainfall infiltration scanlon et al 2006 and 1 25 for irrigation return flows jafari et al 2012 scanlon et al 2006 recommended as initial guesses for calculating water balance to manage valuable groundwater resources in other arid land aquifers the non conservative behavior of the chloride in the aquifer signifies the cautious application of the simple cmb method for estimating recharge in arid aquifers the capability and priority of stable isotopes in estimating low values of rainfall recharge and wtf estimates of the total groundwater recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water in arid regions

birjand using various physical wbe and wtf and tracers cmb and stable isotopes methods regarding the expected complexities of recharge process induced by unmanaged irrigated agriculture as the primary use of groundwater in this arid region it was also attempted to partitioning aquifer recharge between rainfall infiltration and irrigation return flow deep percolation of irrigation water 2 study area the study area of the birjand plain with an area of about 1383 km2 is located in south khorasan province se iran birjand city with a population of about 200 000 is the main residential area in this region the alluvial deposits of the plain with a thickness ranged from 5 to 225 m contain valuable groundwater resources namely as birjand aquifer which is stretched in shape along the approximate trend of e w fig 1 covering an area about 271 2 km2 of the plain surface the aquifer is mainly recharged from southern ophiolite highlands bagheran mountain range with maximum height of 2720 m above mean sea level and the general groundwater flow direction is from east to the west zare 2016 surface waters are limited to flash floods in waterways during rainy season winter to early spring and the groundwater aquifer is the only source of water for various uses in this arid region the aquifer is being discharged by 305 deep and semi deep wells with an annual rate of 60 million cubic meters mcm more than 85 of the discharged water is used in irrigated agriculture and the rest for industrial and drinking purposes sudegi 2018 aquifer withdrawals are more than the total recharge and so depletion of the groundwater storage is being occurred it results in declining of the water table with an average rate of about 47 cm year 1 the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 148 mm 2540 mm and 16 5 c respectively the climate regime of the region is defined as arid on the basis of the ratio of the mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration unesco 1979 the ratio is about 0 06 laying into the range determined for arid climates 0 05 0 2 3 methods amount of groundwater recharge to the birjand aquifer was estimated using four techniques including water table fluctuation wtf chloride mass balance cmb stable isotopes and water budget equation wbe recharge estimates were compared and then contributions of the rainfall infiltration and agricultural return flows to recharge of the birjand aquifer were determined 3 1 water table fluctuation wtf method the technique is based on the assumption that an increase in the water level in unconfined aquifers is due to the recharge water arriving at the water table scanlon et al 2002 accordingly recharge rate r is calculated as 1 r s y δ h δ t where sy is specific yield of the aquifer and δh denotes water table rise over time interval δt the formula for estimating recharge eq 1 has been derived from a simple water budget for the groundwater system assuming that water arriving at the water table goes immediately into storage and that sum of the other components of water budget equation e g base flow evapotranspiration subsurface flow away from or into the system and pumping are zero during the period of recharge healy 2010 the values of annual water table rise i e difference between the peak of the rise and low point of the extrapolated antecedent recession curve at the time of the peak healy 2010 were measured on groundwater hydrographs of the 11 piezometers installed in birjand aquifer during a period of 12 year from 2002 to 2016 fig 2 the results of the pumping tests performed in the birjand aquifer were used to estimate appropriate values of the specific yield the estimated values of annual recharge eq 1 were multiplied by the area of the thiessen s polygons surrounding the piezometers and then integrated to calculate annual volume of recharge to the aquifer 3 2 chloride mass balance cmb method water samples including 15 groundwater and 10 rainwater samples were collected during field campaigns in march and may 2017 chloride concentrations were measured by titration with agno3 solution and potassium chromate as an indicator table 1 then aquifer recharge rate r was estimated using eq 2 healy 2010 2 r p c p c gw in which p is annual precipitation depth mm and cp and cgw are chloride concentrations mg l in precipitation and groundwater respectively annual precipitation depth measured in birjand meteorological station at the central parts of the plain was used in eq 2 to estimate the recharge rate 3 3 stable isotopes dark bottles containing 30 ml of the rain and groundwater were prepared to be analyzed for oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h isotopes in the atomic energy agency of iran the isotopes were measured by off axis integrated cavity output laser spectroscopy against carefully calibrated in house standards and controls both 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios are expressed in delta values δ in units of per mil with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow scale standard table 1 with a precision of 0 6 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o clark and fritz 2013 3 δ 18 o 1000 18 o 16 o sample 18 o 16 o standard 18 o 16 o standard 4 δ 2 h 1000 2 h 1 h sample 2 h 1 h standard 2 h 1 h standard where the sample and standard subscripts refer to the ratios in the sample water and vsmow respectively annual recharge rates mm were estimated using the measured isotopes based on the following empirical equations allison et al 1984 presented in clark and fritz 2013 5 δ 18 o shift 3 recharge mm year 1 6 δ 2 h shift 22 recharge mm year 1 where the shifts represent the displacement of groundwater samples from the local meteoric water line lmwl 3 4 water budget equation wbe method aquifer water budget is an accounting of the water movement into and out off and storage change within the groundwater system healy 2010 the most common way of estimating recharge by wbe method is the indirect or residual approach whereby all of the variables in the water budget equation except recharge r are measured or estimated and r is set equal to the residual scanlon et al 2002 the following balance equation was applied for birjand aquifer to estimating groundwater recharge 7 r q off gw q on gw q p δ s gw where r is groundwater recharge q off gw is groundwater outflow q on gw is groundwater inflow q p is groundwater withdrawal by pumping wells and δ s gw is changes in groundwater aquifer storage all the terms are expressed as the volume of water during the balance period volume year 1 groundwater inflow and outflow rates q were calculated using darcy s equation q tiw considering transmissivity t hydraulic gradient i and width of the inlet and outlet flow channels on equipotential map of the aquifer changes in aquifer storage volume δ s gw was calculated using following equation 8 δ s gw a δ h s y where a is the aquifer surface area δ h is the value of the rise or decline of the water table during balance period and sy is the specific yield of the aquifer material it must be mentioned that depth to groundwater level is more than 5 m anywhere in the aquifer sudegi 2018 therefore evapotranspiration from groundwater system was neglected in water budget equation eq 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 recharge estimates based on wtf method groundwater hydrographs in the piezometers of the birjand aquifer are shown in fig 2 a general decreasing trend in groundwater levels is observed in most piezometers as the declining rates range from 14 to 69 cm year 1 the highest values are observed mainly at the western part of the aquifer where the groundwater is locally discharged by the concentrated agricultural wells groundwater levels are fluctuating in response to changes in recharge and discharge components of the aquifer system during the year groundwater rise is occurred in rainy season winter to early spring when the aquifer recharge from different probable sources such as rainfall and irrigation return flows exceeds the discharge groundwater recharge is more diminished out of the rainy season and over exploitation i e abstractions over than recharge of the aquifer causes decline of the water table in order to calculate the groundwater recharge using wtf method groundwater rises related to recharge events in rainy season were calculated based on the hydrographs and then combined to estimate the annual rises δh temporal variations of the water table rise in different piezometers are shown in fig 3 representing values mostly in the range of 0 5 to 1 m year 1 highest values of the water table rise are observed in some piezometers at the west of the aquifer with the lowest specific yield values of the specific yield in different parts of the birjand aquifer were determined based on pumping tests results sudegi 2018 and the spatial distribution of this parameter was investigated fig 4 specific yields vary in the range of 0 005 0 07 the highest values are observed in the east where the coarse sandy gravel to gravelly sand sediments are existed decreasing toward the west with fine sediments having dominant clay textures the average value of the specific yield of the birjand aquifer was estimated at 0 06 annual rates of the groundwater recharge in the thiessen s area of the piezometers fig 4 were calculated using eq 1 multiplied by the polygon area to estimate the recharge volume and then integrated to estimate the annual recharge volume fig 5 the values range from 7 2 to 11 mcm year 1 averaging as 9 mcm year 1 temporal variations of the annual recharges fig 5 represent the nearly constant rate of the aquifer recharge during the study period 2002 2016 in general the mean value of the groundwater recharge of the birjand aquifer is estimated about 33 2 mm year 1 9 mcm year 1 based on the wtf method 4 2 recharge estimates based on cmb method chloride cl content of the groundwater samples collected from different parts of the birjand aquifer was measured in the range of 234 to 2382 mg l table 1 and the average concentration of chloride in precipitation samples was about 14 5 mg l recharge rates estimated using cmb method eq 2 vary between 0 9 and 9 17 mm year 1 which are equivalent to the aquifer recharge volume of 0 24 2 5 mcm year 1 direct relationship between cl and na fig 6 proposes the halite dissolution as the main source of cl in groundwater confirming the non conservative behavior of chloride in birjand aquifer therefore the recharge values based on the lowest concentration of chloride in groundwater samples 9 2 mm year 1 or 2 5 mcm year 1 is recommended as the minimum reliable rate of the aquifer recharge based on the cmb method 4 3 recharge estimates based on stable isotopes the values of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater samples range from 6 24 to 7 11 and 38 45 to 44 34 table 1 and the mean values are 6 7 and 41 5 respectively the average values of about 6 73 for δ2h and 30 2 for δ18o were measured in the local rainfall samples groundwater samples from birjand aquifer have an 18o 2h composition gwl in fig 7 with the equation of δ2h 6 5 δ18o 1 8 that plots below but relatively parallel to the lmwl δ2h 7 1 δ18o 15 9 proposing recharge under conditions of direct infiltration clark and fritz 2013 it shows mixing between the evaporated soil moisture and subsequent rain that infiltrates and displaces the residual soil water downward until this mixed parcel of water will reach the aquifer under relatively uniform conditions of groundwater recharge groundwater should follow a line parallel but to displaced from lmwl for high rates of recharge minimal enrichment by evaporation is occurred and low shifts are expected whereas for low rates of recharge a large displacement for groundwater will be seen clark and fritz 2013 the displacement of groundwaters from lmwl δ2h and δ18o shifts were used to estimate recharge the average values of δ2h and δ18o shifts for the groundwaters from birjand aquifer are on the order of 10 and 1 5 respectively applying eqs 5 and 6 give recharge rates of about 4 to 4 8 mm year 1 for the birjand aquifer recharge 22 δ 2 h s h i f t 2 22 10 2 4 8 mm year 1 recharge 3 δ 18 o s h i f t 2 3 1 3 2 5 3 mm year 1 the average groundwater recharge into the birjand aquifer estimated by the stable isotope technique is reported as 5 0 mm year 1 or 1 4 mcm year 1 4 4 recharge estimates based on wbe method the components of the water balance equation of birjand aquifer were considered as the groundwater subsurface inflows q on gw and outflows q off gw withdrawals by pumping wells q p total recharge r and change in aquifer storage δ s gw inflow and outflow boundaries of the aquifer were determined on iso potential map of the aquifer fig 8 and volume rates of the groundwater flow into and out of the aquifer system were calculated using darcy s equation table 2 the transmissivity values of the aquifer estimated by pumping tests range between 300 to 700 m2 day and the hydraulic gradients slope of the water table vary from 0 0001 to 0 01 m m 1 total volume of the groundwater flow through 10 inlets and 1 outlet of the birjand aquifer were estimated at 45 7 and 4 6 mcm year 1 respectively total volume of the aquifer discharge by pumping wells is estimated about 60 mcm year 1 mostly used for irrigated agriculture 85 and in minor amounts for municipal and industrial purposes over exploitation of the aquifer i e discharge more than the recharge causes water table to be declined about 0 47 m year 1 it means depletion of the aquifer storage with an annual volume rate of 7 6 mcm year 1 δ s gw a δ h s y 271 2 10 6 0 47 0 06 7 6 mcm year 1 by substituting the above components in water budget equation of birjand aquifer eq 7 total groundwater recharge is set to be equal to the residual which is assessed to be about 11 3 mcm year 1 r q off gw q on gw q p δ s gw 4 6 45 7 60 7 6 11 3 mcm year 1 the value is equivalent to the aquifer recharge rate of about 41 7 mm year 1 4 5 comparing recharge estimates and partitioning recharge between rainfall and deep percolation of irrigation water the average rates of groundwater recharge into the birjand aquifer were estimated about 5 0 9 2 33 2 and 41 7 mm year 1 using the stables isotopes cmb wtf and water budget equation techniques respectively table 3 the lowest estimates are related to tracer methods including stable isotopes and cmb while the highest values are obtained from physical techniques of wtf and water budget equation environmental tracers such as chloride are particularly useful for quantifying low recharge rates in arid and semi arid regions healy 2010 the recharge estimates based on tracers are generally relied on the precipitation quality and quantity as the main source of recharge so the values of 5 0 to 9 2 mm year 1 are characterized as the rainfall recharge to the birjand aquifer representing 3 to 6 of the long term average annual precipitation it must be mentioned that an inherent assumption in eq 2 for estimating recharge by cmb method is that all of the chloride within the aquifer is derived from atmospheric deposition therefore additional chloride sources such as halite dissolution in birjand aquifer limit application of the method in this arid aquifer and similar cases irrigation is the primary use of water in arid regions todd and mays 2005 like the study area and irrigation return flows are considered as the important source of aquifer recharge in these areas jafari et al 2012 jiménez martínez et al 2009 time series analysis of irrigation return flows measured by lysimeters in semi arid agricultural regions of iran jafari et al 2012 confirmed the variations of irrigation return flow coefficients from 30 of the applied irrigated water in rainy seasons to less than 6 5 in dry periods high values of irrigation return flows in rainy seasons are mostly related to over irrigation of the agricultural fields by traditional methods border or flooding due to low water demands in this period based on the results an average annual irrigation return flow coefficient of 15 of the annual applied water was introduced these excess irrigated waters are considered as a potential source of groundwater recharge in these areas regarding the annual volume of irrigation water in birjand plain about 51 mcm total value of irrigation return flow deep percolation of excess irrigation water is estimated to be about 8 mcm year 1 no relationship is observed between wtf annual recharges and precipitation fig 9 confirming the more impacts of irrigation returns on recharge process of birjand aquifer both rainfall infiltration and deep percolation of irrigation water that are simultaneously added to water table during the rainy season increase the water level of the aquifer therefore the recharge estimates based on wtf method 9 mcm year 1 is representative of the total recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water to the aquifer the value is more confirmed by using wbe method in which the total recharges are calculated as 11 3 mcm year 1 a similar result showing the capability of wtf method to calculate total recharge of the aquifers was also reported by diouf et al 2012 in general total value of the recharge to the birjand aquifer is estimated about 9 to 11 averaging as 10 mcm year 1 by subtracting the annual rainfall recharge range from 1 4 to 2 5 with an approximate average of 2 mcm year 1 annual deep percolation of irrigation water is calculated about 8 mcm year 1 the value is in high accordance with the amount calculated by the above mentioned irrigation flow coefficient confirming the recharge estimates of the birjand aquifer 5 conclusion average recharge rates of the birjand aquifer were estimated about 5 0 9 17 33 2 and 41 7 mm year 1 using stable isotopes cmb wtf and wbe methods respectively wtf and wbe recharge estimates represent total recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water while stable isotopes and cmb methods calculate exclusively the rainfall recharge no relationships are observed between wtf annual recharge estimates and precipitation confirming the more impact of the irrigation return flows than the direct infiltration of rainwater on recharge process of the birjand aquifer total recharge to the birjand aquifer was estimated to be about 33 2 to 41 7 mm year 1 9 to 11 3 mcm year 1 based on wtf and wbe methods averaging as 37 5 mm year 1 10 mcm year 1 it was partitioned between the rainfall recharge 7 0 mm year 1 or 2 mcm year 1 estimated using tracer methods of isotopes and cmb and deep percolation of irrigation water 30 5 mm year 1 or 8 mcm year 1 the values represent an average rainfall recharge coefficient of about 4 8 of the annual precipitation and return flow coefficient of 15 of the total annual applied water for irrigation recharge estimates are in the range of the previous researches 0 1 5 for rainfall infiltration scanlon et al 2006 and 1 25 for irrigation return flows jafari et al 2012 scanlon et al 2006 recommended as initial guesses for calculating water balance to manage valuable groundwater resources in other arid land aquifers the non conservative behavior of the chloride in the aquifer signifies the cautious application of the simple cmb method for estimating recharge in arid aquifers the capability and priority of stable isotopes in estimating low values of rainfall recharge and wtf estimates of the total groundwater recharge rainfall infiltration deep percolation of irrigation water in arid regions

6411,point scale gauge observations have inherent limitations making it difficult to study the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation in alpine regions due to gauge undercatch and complex terrains the global precipitation measurement gpm mission provides new generation satellite precipitation products that are promising alternative data sources in mountainous areas however quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted prior to the application of satellite data in this study an unprecedentedly dense ground station network composed of more than 1000 automatic weather stations awss over the tianshan mountains in china are used for bias correction of the integrated multisatellite retrievals for gpm imerg product first universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale imerg from 0 1 to 500 m to ensure a fair comparison with the gauge observations then the downscaled imerg precipitation data over this region are corrected by two methods i e stepwise regression step and geographically weighted regression gwr both methods are established on various terrain factors and vegetation indexes that have strong relations with precipitation the results show that 1 gwr outperform the conventional step method as well as the original imerg 2 the original imerg performs best over the plain region less than 1000 m while the best correction effect was found in middle and low elevation region 1000 1500 m and 3 the performance of the gwr model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations in mountainous areas overall the methods and results presented in this study provide insight into the correction of satellite precipitation data in mountainous areas with scarce ground observations keywords precipitation correction imerg geographically weighted regression stepwise regression tianshan mountains 1 introduction precipitation plays a crucial role in atmospheric and land surface processes at various temporal and spatial scales kidd and huffman 2011 tang et al 2016a yang and luo 2014b accurate precipitation data are essential for research in the fields of hydrology meteorology etc however the measured precipitation at weather stations often fails to meet the requirements of research and applications in mountainous regions because of instrumental limitations sparse and uneven gauge distributions and the incapability of representing spatial variations in precipitation tang et al 2018a in contrast satellite data are characterized by wide coverage continuous observation periods and high spatiotemporal resolutions and have been widely used in hydrometeorological research in recent years verdin et al 2015 yin et al 2008 gao et al 2018 currently the most commonly used satellite precipitation products include the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann sorooshian et al 2000 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 and the integrated multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg huffman et al 2017a 2017b imerg is the latest product and synthesizes the advantages of many previous retrieval algorithms thereby attracting much attention in the field of satellite remote sensing of precipitation skofronick jackson et al 2017 the retrospective processing for imerg through the trmm era is ongoing and imerg products are anticipated to play a more important role in hydrological and meteorological research although satellite remote sensing has advantages for large scale precipitation monitoring it can only provide indirect estimates compared with ground stations due to the limitations of spatiotemporal sampling instrument capability and retrieval algorithms the accuracy of satellite precipitation products is relatively low in some cases which is particularly true in arid and mountainous areas ma et al 2014 shen et al 2010 wu and zhai 2012 therefore the comprehensive evaluation and proper bias correction of satellite precipitation products are necessary yin et al 2004 2008 ji and chen 2012 yang and luo 2014a 2014b ouallouche and ameur 2014 golian et al 2015 lu et al 2018a 2018b precipitation in mountainous regions is strongly affected by macroclimate and terrain and has attracted the interest of many researchers smith 1979 roe et al 2002 yin et al 2004 2008 crochet 2009 shige et al 2013 yang and luo 2014a ma et al 2017 tang et al 2018b the tianshan mountain system in northwest china is one of the seven major mountain systems and the largest independent zonal mountain system in the world gao et al 2018 tianshan also bears the most typical mountain ecosystems in temperate arid regions around the world however the sparse gauge network cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of the precipitation intensity and distribution in the tianshan mountains satellite precipitation products such as imerg are valuable substitutes but also suffer from large systematic errors in this region tang et al 2016b li et al 2018 lu et al 2018a therefore it is necessary and meaningful to correct satellite precipitation data in tianshan for a better understanding of the regional hydrological cycle nevertheless to our knowledge there are no or very few studies that focus on correcting the latest imerg products in mountainous regions topographic factors are effective in improving the quality of satellite precipitation products on a monthly and even coarser time scale using topographic factors as inputs the stepwise regression step method has been proven to be very useful in correcting satellite precipitation lu et al 2018b for example yin et al 2004 2008 corrected precipitation data from the special sensor microwave imager ssm i and tmpa 3b42 using the step method based on various topographic factors in the tibetan plateau which is known as the third pole of the world yang and luo 2014a corrected tmpa 3b42 and 3b43 data in northwest china using the step method and a back propagation neural network which improved the accuracy of the original precipitation data vegetation is a natural link among soil the atmosphere and water and an important indicator of ecology and the environment the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is very sensitive to the growth potential and can represent the cover change in surface vegetation to a certain extent therefore ndvi is considered the best indicator of surface vegetation brunsell 2006 brunsell and young 2008 agam et al 2006 immerzeel et al 2009 roberto et al 2011 in addition the greenness of vegetation can be regarded as a proxy for cumulative precipitation which may have time lag brunsell 2006 a large number of studies performed downscaling of satellite precipitation products based on the relationship between ndvi and precipitation immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 xu et al 2015 ma et al 2017 for example based on the interaction and feedback relationship between precipitation and vegetation immerzeel et al 2009 first introduced the vegetation index to downscale tmpa data on an annual scale considering the influence of terrain on precipitation jia et al 2011 introduced multiple linear regression models at the annual scale and used ndvi and digital elevation model dem data in the qaidam basin to downscale tmpa data however few studies have utilized ndvi to correct satellite precipitation products at their original spatial resolutions ma et al 2018b two important problems remain unresolved by current studies i e the lack of corrected imerg products in mountainous regions and the near absence of ndvi in previous correction research to address these two issues this study utilizes two methods to correct the gpm imerg monthly precipitation product in the warm season in the tianshan mountains observations from a highly dense gauge network are used which is unprecedented compared to previous studies in this region ensuring the most reliable evaluation and the best correction performance in tianshan the first correction method is the widely used step the second method is geographically weighted regression gwr which was proposed by brunsdon et al 1996 and has been widely used in studies on spatial heterogeneity fotheringham et al 2002 propastin et al 2008 gwr has significant advantages in exploring the spatial variation relationship between variables and predicting future results and has been applied to downscale satellite precipitation xu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 by comparing the performance of step and gwr this study explores the applicability of the gwr in correcting satellite precipitation which should be valuable for the research community 2 study area and data 2 1 study area tianshan is the largest mountain range in central asia and is located between 39 45 n and 73 96 e fig 1 a which traverses the whole territory of xinjiang china and stretches as far as 1700 km from east to west tianshan has an average elevation of approximately 4000 m and consists of a series of mountain ranges intermountain basins valleys piedmont plains and other geomorphic units gao et al 2018 precipitation in tianshan is mainly affected by a westerly circulation and complex topography and displays dramatic disparities in time and space with a large amount of precipitation in summer and a small amount of precipitation in winter therefore correction of imerg in the warm season is very important for hydrological research in tianshan mountains the average annual precipitation along the northern slope of the tianshan mountains is 500 700 mm on some windward slopes to the west the annual precipitation reaches up to 1000 mm forming the wet island landscape in the arid northwestern region zhang et al 2012 xu et al 2016 tan and shao 2016 the tianshan mountains are not only the climate demarcation line between northern and southern xinjiang but also an important natural barrier affecting the weather climate and ecological environments in xinjiang and even china s central and western regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite datasets 2 2 1 1 gpm imerg gpm is trmm s follow up satellite precipitation program which can provide half hourly microwave infrared based global rain and snow data gpm expands the trmm sensor package and improves the precipitation observation capability the gpm core observatory gpmco which is equipped with a dual frequency radar ku and ka bands can detect a low minimum echo intensity and use the high sensitivity mode for interlaced sampling hou et al 2014 tang et al 2018b at the same time compared with the trmm satellite gpmco s microwave radiometer has four high frequency channels enhancing the observation capability for light precipitation and solid precipitation therefore the gpm mission can provide more accurate light precipitation 0 5 mm h 1 and solid precipitation data which are the dominant forms in mid and high latitude regions huffman et al 2017a 2017b including the tianshan area the imerg algorithm produces three types of products i e the early late and final runs at half hourly and 0 1 0 1 resolutions starting in march 2014 owing to the infusion of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rain gauge data the imerg final run product provides more accurate estimates and is considered the research level product huffman et al 2017a considering that tang et al 2016b and lu et al 2018a show that the imerg product is more accurate than tmpa products in xinjiang imerg final run version 5 was adopted in this study 2 2 1 2 ndvi the ndvi data used in this study were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mounted on the earth observing system eos terra satellite https wist echo nasa gov the level 3 land standard product mod13a1 was selected and comprises 16 day sinusoidal projection raster data at a 500 m spatial resolution we averaged the two files of the modis ndvi for each month to acquire the monthly vegetation cover over the study area 2 2 1 3 dem the dem data used in this study were from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem with a resolution of 1 arc s 30 m at the equator the data are obtained based on detailed observations from the new generation of the earth observation satellite terra launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the data cover all land areas between 83 n and 83 s accounting for approximately 99 of earth s land surface topographic factors are extracted from aster dem data the original 30 m dem data were resampled to a resolution of 500 m 500 m because the topographic factors extracted from the dem with a 500 m resolution can obtain better correction results taniguchi et al 2013 lu et al 2018b and can better match the ndvi data topographic factors including slope slp warren et al 2004 aspect asp yin et al 2004 curvature cvt chen et al 2013 topographic wetness index twi sørensen and seibert 2007 and hillshade hshd yin et al 2008 were derived from the dem data please refer to yin et al 2004 2008 for more information it is worth mentioning that since only 6 topographic factors which are all common environmental variables are selected in this study the definitions of these variables are explicit and largely independent from each other therefore there is no multiple collinearity between these variables 2 2 2 rain gauge data the daily rain gauge precipitation data which undergo strict quality control are provided by the information center of the xinjiang meteorological bureau and are accumulated to the monthly scale the number of automatic weather stations awss in the tianshan mountains reaches up to 1065 the elevation of the stations ranges from 152 m to 3616 m with most stations located at middle and low latitudes fig 2 it is worth mentioning that the number of gauges used in this study is much higher than that used in previous studies e g ji and chen 2012 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 ensuring the reliability of the evaluation and the correction of satellite precipitation among the 1 065 awss there are only 104 snowfall stations fig 1b with the ability to observe solid precipitation which is dominant in the cold season therefore we selected the warm season from may to september between 2014 and 2017 as the study period we also discussed the applicability of the correction methods in the cold season in section 5 based on the 104 snowfall stations in china 194 stations are included in the gpcc monitoring product which is used for the bias correction of trmm gpm research level products shen et al 2013 tang etal 2016b in particular there are 8 gpcc stations in this study area we excluded the 8 gpcc stations for the purpose of independent evaluation due to the sparse distribution and complex topography the interpolation of gauge data would generate large uncertainties therefore this study extracted gauge data that fell within each imerg grid pixel and the collocated imerg data for further correction if more than one gauge was located within the same grid their average precipitation value was adopted ma et al 2009 ward etal 2011 blacutt et al 2015 hu et al 2016 3 methods fig 3 shows the flow chart of the corrected methods in this study first universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale the imerg product to 500 m then the downscaled imerg precipitation data over this region are corrected by step and gwr finally the corrected imerg data with a 500 m resolution are aggregated by pixel averaging to obtain the corrected imerg precipitation at the original 0 1 0 1 resolution the detailed description is as follows 3 1 determination of the lag in ndvi ndvi is regarded as a proxy for cumulative precipitation some studies indicate that the response of ndvi to precipitation usually lagged by two or three months duan and bastiaanssen 2013 however brunsell 2006 analyzed the feedback relationship between ndvi and precipitation in four types of land surfaces the results showed that only one type of land surface had a one month delay while the other three types had almost no delay to clarify this issue we calculated the correlation between ndvi and precipitation under different delays the results show that the correlation becomes increasingly smaller with increasing delays and the precipitation ndvi relationship of the zero month lag is strongest therefore in this study ndvi is used to correct imerg precipitation of the same month 3 2 step step is a method for selecting independent variables in linear regression models that can be used to screen and eliminate variables that cause multicollinearity beale et al 1967 newton and spurrell 1967 the specific steps are as follows first the dependent variable is used to make a simple regression for each selected explanatory variable and then the regression equation corresponding to the explanatory variable with the largest contribution is used to gradually introduce the remaining explanatory variables in this study to eliminate the discontinuity of the mesh boundary universal kriging interpolation was used to downscale the original imerg precipitation hereafter ori imerg to facilitate a fairer comparison against the rain gauge data yin et al 2008 yang and luo 2014a the output resolution was set to 500 m named imerg500m matching the resolutions of the ndvi and dem data in particular the fine resolution can make the gauge observations terrain factors and ndvi more representative in the 500 m 500 m grid and accurately establish a one to one correspondence between the satellite precipitation and observed data previous studies i e yin et al 2008 ji and chen 2012 yang and luo 2014a adopted a buffer of 25 or 50 km around a gauge to extract terrain factors however this buffer could generate relatively large uncertainties it is worth noting that we also used rain gauge data to evaluate the imerg data before and after interpolation and the results show that the universal kriging interpolation has a negligible effect see section 4 1 first this study used the imerg500m monthly precipitation data topographical factors asp slp cvt tri hshd and dem and ndvi as independent variables and the measured precipitation obs from the weather stations as the dependent variable then we employed the statistical product and service solutions spss statistical software to conduct the step analysis to establish each monthly regression equation from may to september next the topographical factors ndvi and imerg500m precipitation for each grid pixel were incorporated into the established regression equation to obtain the 500 m gridded precipitation corrected by the step equation finally an aggregate by pixels average was conducted to acquire the ultimate product named crt step the regression model formula is as follows 1 p obs f p imer g 500 m n d v i t e r r ε where p obs represents the measured precipitation at the station p imer g 500 m represents the imerg500m precipitation before correction terr represents the value of the topographical factors and ε represents the residual 3 3 gwr in spatial analyses observed data are generally sampled at given geographical locations the relation and structure between variables vary among locations i e spatial heterogeneity if a conventional linear regression model is used the analysis of spatial data may fail to provide a satisfactory result because global models are analyzed with the assumption that the relations between variables are homogenous which leads to a certain mean value in the study area therefore it is necessary to adopt a new kind of local regression method to address the innate properties of these spatial data for this purpose the gwr model was proposed and has been frequently practiced and validated foody 2003 li et al 2010 xu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 in addition to adopting gwr this study simultaneously took topographical factors elevation and vegetation coverage into consideration for precipitation correction which reflected the spatial non stationarity between precipitation and related factors moreover at locations without rain gauge data i e non sample points gwr is capable of estimating precipitation data by transforming spatial parameters into regression parameters the basic idea of gwr is that the relationships between variables change with spatial location the regression model is established by estimating parameters for the correlated variable and explanatory variable of each given location in the study area to obtain the best results as in the step the gwr regression model established in this study also uses obs as the dependent variable and the topographical factors ndvi and imerg500m precipitation data as the independent variables the formula is as follows 2 y j β 0 u j v j k 1 p β k u j v j x kj ε j where y j represents the actual precipitation at the jth point x kj represents the kth variable imerg500m precipitation topographical factors and ndvi at the jth point β 0 u j v j and β k u j v j represent the intercept and the slope of the kth variable at the jth point respectively which are spatially variant as shown in fig 3 u j v j represents the coordinates of the jth point in two dimensional space p represents the number of independent variables and ε j represents the residual different from the traditional global regression model eq 2 is based on the assumption that the closer an observation point is to the jth point the greater the impact by the jth point the coefficient of the observation point is the attenuation function for the observation distance revolving around the jth point and can be obtained by solving eq 3 3 β u j v j x t w u j v j x 1 x t w u j v j y where β u j v j represents the coefficient of the jth point and x and y represent the independent and dependent variables respectively w u j v j represents the weight matrix which ensures that the closer the observation point is to the jth point the greater the weight this value can be obtained by the following formula 4 w ij 1 d ij b 2 2 w h e n d ij b w ij 0 w h e n d ij b where d ij represents the distance between the jth point and the surrounding ith observation point and b represents the bandwidth threshold fig 4 a c shows the spatial pattern of the intercept and the slopes of the ndvi and imerg generated by the gwr method over the tianshan mountains in august as illustrated these coefficients display different spatial distributions the intercept is between 2 5 and 68 4 the slopes of the ndvi and imerg precipitation data range from 15 6 to 22 2 and from 19 4 to 54 1 respectively note that the blank areas of the three subfigures in fig 4 represent the locations of outliers and were removed before correction 3 4 main correction steps using the step and gwr methods 1 excluding outliers the values of the ndvi and terrain factors over snow and water are constant which is inconsistent with the assumption that there is a significant relationship between them and precipitation therefore pixels including snow and water bodies are identified and removed from the original data in addition human activities and various natural factors interfere with the relationship between precipitation and the ndvi to avoid this potential influence on the correction we remove these pixels in the ndvi data using a low pass filter with an 11 11 moving window to obtain the smoothed ndvi hereafter s ndvi xu et al 2015 for example fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of ndvi in september 2016 which was calculated to identify the outliers of the ndvi most of the high and low s ndvi values are located over regions adjacent to lakes and snow covered mountains where the ndvi values could be seriously disturbed by surface and atmospheric conditions we identified s ndvi 0 15 and s ndvi 0 15 as outlier thresholds of ndvi values xu et al 2015 using this threshold 62 663 pixels approximately 12 3 were identified and eliminated 2 using the observed data from the training awss as the dependent variable and the co located imerg500m data ndvi data and terrain factors as the independent variables the step and gwr models were established furthermore a tenfold cross validation method was employed to perform an in depth assessment of the performance of the two models in this study the gwr 4 0 software http geoinformatics wp st andrews ac uk gwr gwr downloads was applied to build the gwr model this tool is powerful when estimating the regression coefficient at a location without rain gauge data compared with gwr 3 x an important extension of the new release is the function that fits semiparametric gwr models by blending globally fixed and geographically varying coefficients nakaya 2015 in gwr two parameters are critical the kernel function for estimating the weight matrix w u j v j in eq 3 and the selection criteria used to determine the kernel bandwidth b in eq 4 there are four kernel functions fixed gaussian adaptive bi square adaptive gaussian and fixed bi square and four selection criteria akaike information criterion aic small sample bias corrected aic aicc bayesian information criterion bic and cross validation cv in this study adaptive bi square and aicc were selected as the kernel function and selection criteria respectively as in xu et al 2015 3 applying the step and gwr models established by step 2 to the whole study area to acquire the corrected areal precipitation first the values of the central coordinates from imerg500m ndvi and the terrain factors with a 500 m resolution except for the pixels eliminated in step 1 were extracted in this study area second the extracted element values were brought into eqs 1 and 2 to obtain the areal precipitation corrected by the step and gwr models i e crt step and crt gwr respectively 4 converting the crt step and crt gwr precipitation generated in step 3 to the point vector dataset and then interpolating them using a simple spline tension interpolator to acquire precipitation values for the pixels removed in step 1 5 aggregating the crt step and crt gwr precipitation generated in step 4 by pixel averaging to reduce error we finally obtain the corrected imerg precipitation at the original 0 1 0 1 resolution 3 5 validation

study universal kriging interpolation was used to downscale the original imerg data from 0 1 to 500 m resolution this method prevents a grid from containing multiple rain gauges under coarse resolution conditions thus the ndvi terrain factors and satellite precipitation extracted from corresponding raster data with a 500 m resolution can correspond to the rain gauge data to verify whether the interpolation data are different from the original data we used the observed data to assess the two datasets before and after interpolation the results show that the ccs rbs and rmses of the downscaled imerg and ori imerg are 0 56 and 0 57 6 76 and 7 1 and 27 66 mm and 27 41 mm respectively which indicates that the interpolation almost does not affect the quality of the original data therefore this interpolation provides a good data foundation for the next step of model training and verification huang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 4 2 spatial distributions of original and corrected imerg precipitation fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of the mean precipitation of obs ori imerg crt step and crt gwr from may to september 2016 which was the wettest year in the history of xinjiang the distributions of the original and corrected imerg precipitation both with a 0 1 resolution show a consistent changing tendency with most precipitation converging over the yili valley which is surrounded by mountains on three sides and forms a horn shaped valley to the west under the influence of atlantic water vapor the warm and humid air current climbs upward along the windward slope and forms orographic precipitation therefore the yili valley is mild and humid with abundant rainfall for vegetation growth the annual precipitation amount for the study area is 417 6 mm and in the mountainous area specifically it can reach up to 600 mm which makes the basin the most humid area in xinjiang compared with the obs ori imerg apparently underestimates precipitation over the yili valley the distribution is notably improved by using crt step and crt gwr fig 5c d table 1 shows that the maximum precipitation values of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 529 3 567 8 and 1048 7 mm respectively the maximum observed record from the weather stations is 947 2 mm during the same period indicating that crt gwr is the closest to the rain gauge data regarding extreme precipitation ori imerg and crt step underestimate the maximum precipitation by 44 and 40 respectively the mean precipitation of the original and corrected imerg is close to the value of obs table 1 in terms of the standard deviation sd ori imerg and crt step underestimate the value of obs by 45 and 22 respectively whereas crt gwr is very close to obs table 1 overall ori imerg underestimates heavy precipitation and this underestimation is obviously reduced by crt gwr 4 3 overall assessment as introduced in the methods section the tenfold cross validation strategy was used to evaluate precipitation by ori imerg crt step and crt gwr using gauge data from may to september between 2014 and 2017 table 2 shows the overall performance of the three types of estimates the ccs between the obs and estimates by ori imerg crt step and crt gwr were 0 57 0 74 and 0 79 respectively indicating that the three kinds of estimates all have remarkable linear correlations with the observed data the overall rbs of the three kinds of estimates were 7 1 1 32 and 1 12 respectively illustrating that the corrections can significantly reduce the overestimation of the original imerg data moreover compared with ori imerg the nse of crt gwr increased from 0 31 to 0 62 i e doubling while the rmse decreased from 27 41 mm to 20 94 mm generally crt gwr shows the best performance among the three datasets with noticeable improvement concerning all metrics to further depict the distributions of each metric box plots are used to show cc nse rb and rmse values at all stations in the study area fig 7 box plots describe data by using five statistics namely the minimum first quartile median third quartile and maximum and can roughly present whether the data have symmetry the degree of dispersion etc overall the cc and nse of the crt gwr are higher 0 78 and 0 36 respectively than those of the other two products 0 76 and 0 09 for ori imerg and 0 74 and 0 27 for crt step respectively the rbs are improved by using the two correction methods crt step shows some improvement with a lower rb whereas crt gwr presents better symmetry and a more centralized distribution that approximates at zero compared to ori imerg and crt step in addition the distribution of the nse for the crt gwr precipitation has a strong concentration in contrast more than half of the nse values for ori imerg are below zero and their distribution is relatively dispersed the rmse shows that crt gwr has the smallest error 17 15 mm by comparison the rmses of ori imerg and crt step are 21 69 mm and 20 3 mm respectively 4 4 monthly scale assessment fig 8 shows a group of taylor diagrams that compare the estimates of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr to the rain gauge data the taylor diagram is a graphical method used to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of models or estimates taylor 2001 based on cc centered rmse and sd statistics the closer the points of satellite estimates are to the point of obs the better the accuracy of the estimates the taylor diagram is very useful for evaluating the performance of various models tang et al 2016a ning et al 2016 guo et al 2016 by marking the three statistical indexes in the same picture the advantages and disadvantages of the three products become more straightforward as shown in fig 8a during the whole period the sd of the obs is 34 75 mm while the sds of the ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 20 6 24 87 and 30 55 mm respectively which means that the sd of the crt gwr estimate is the closest to that of the obs the cc of crt gwr is the highest 0 77 and the rmse of crt gwr is lower than that of the other two products the same result can also be seen on the monthly diagrams fig 8b d as september enters the end of the warm season in the study area the rainfall decreases as shown in fig 8f with different patterns from other months fig 9 shows the scatter plots of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr against the rain gauge precipitation during the whole period and at the monthly scale crt gwr is the closest to the 1 1 line followed by crt step while ori imerg displays the most scattered distribution of precipitation reflecting that the accuracy after correction is apparently improved in addition the fitting effect of crt gwr is better than that of crt step for example in august although the cc of the ori imerg related to the observed precipitation is only 0 29 it increases to 0 51 and 0 67 for crt step and crt gwr respectively furthermore as shown in fig 9 b f crt gwr was well correlated with the rain gauge precipitation every month which is even more evident in may and august fig 9b e fig 10 shows the statistics of nse cc rb and rmse the monthly nse corrected by either crt step or crt gwr is significantly improved compared with that before correction the nse is increased to 0 22 0 6 and 0 43 0 69 for crt step and crt gwr respectively compared to that for ori imerg approximately 0 03 0 45 an nse value higher than 0 5 is regarded as satisfactory gupta and tarboton 2016 indicating that the two correction methods improve the quality of imerg to a new level as shown in fig 10 b d ccs at the monthly scale are increased from 0 29 to 0 67 before correction to 0 51 0 77 and 0 67 0 84 after correction by step and gwr respectively the rmses decrease from 26 57 to 35 84 to 16 86 30 99 mm and 14 78 27 81 mm respectively and the rbs also show significant improvement after correction 4 5 pixel scale assessment and elevation impact analysis fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of cc nse rb and rmse at each station in the study area nse has large spatial variations and ori imerg shows negative nse at the stations in contrast crt step and crt gwr show significant improvements especially in yili valley concerning rb ori imerg is characterized by underestimation in the middle and high elevation areas but overestimation in the low elevation areas on both the northern and southern sides of tianshan the underestimation and overestimation are both notably reduced by crt step and crt gwr the rbs of most of the stations after correction are all within 25 the same improvement can be seen in the rmse for the elevation analysis the tianshan mountains are divided into three elevation zones less than 1000 m 1000 1500 m and more than 1500 m table 3 the number of stations within the three zones is 320 404 and 341 respectively the average precipitation increases as elevation increases due to the orographic effect tang et al 2018b with the magnitude being 21 27 26 06 and 46 92 mm for the three zones respectively crt gwr is closest to obs regarding average precipitation with values of 21 50 26 24 and 46 60 mm for the three zones respectively according to the statistics ori imerg performs best over the plain region less than 1000 m with a cc value of 0 67 and an rmse value of 18 95 mm as the elevation increases the error of satellite precipitation becomes larger with an increase in rmse from 18 95 mm for the plain region to 27 7 mm for the middle and low elevation areas 1000 1500 m and 34 91 mm for the high elevation regions over 1500 m the ccs between the obs and the corrected precipitation in the three zones increase by 0 05 0 19 and 0 08 for crt step and 0 11 0 27 and 0 1 for crt gwr respectively suggesting that the correction effect is the most prominent in the 1000 1500 m zone one possible reason for this result is the additional available gauges for modeling in this zone and the raw imerg data have the lowest precision so the room for improvement is also larger additionally this result shows that the correction capability of gwr is powerful the rbs show that the three data sets all underestimate precipitation in the region above 1500 m and the degree of underestimation is greatly reduced after step and gwr correction the rmses show the same trend as the elevation increases overall crt gwr performed better than the other two estimates 5 discussion 5 1 correction during the cold season satellite precipitation performs worse during the cold season tang et al 2018c although the imerg precipitation has been greatly improved compared to the previous tmpa precipitation tang et al 2016b xu et al 2017 lu et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 the improvement in the cold season is still unsatisfactory therefore the correction of satellite precipitation during the cold season is important in this study we also tried correcting cold season precipitation following the five steps in section 3 4 there are only 104 snowfall stations fig 1b accounting for approximately 10 of the stations in the study area the evaluation results are shown in fig 12 crt step showed a certain degree of improvement however crt gwr performed poorly which was unexpected because gwr has proved very useful in the warm season to confirm whether the poor correction effect of the gwr method is due to seasonal reasons we corrected imerg precipitation again using only the 104 snowfall stations in the warm season via both the gwr and the step methods the results are shown in fig 12 d f although the gwr method performs better in the warm season than in the cold season it is still worse than the original imerg precipitation product however the step method showed positive correction effects in both the cold and warm seasons indicating that the step model still works even with much fewer stations in contrast the gwr method seems to have a strong dependence on gauge density and does not work when the number of gauges is small one possible reason for this result is that gwr is a regression method that assigns weights according to the distance of points from the training point at each non sampling point the gwr algorithm calculates the regression coefficients by searching for the adjacent training stations the closer a non sampling point is to the training points the more weight the non sampling point obtains ma et al 2017 conversely the farther the locations are from the training points i e observation locations the greater the uncertainty chen et al 2018 therefore the lower the number of stations is the less reliable the non sampling point regression coefficients in terms of recent research using the gwr method for downscaling ma et al 2017 conducted a downscaling study of tmpa 3b43 at the annual scale with 106 meteorological stations on the qinghai tibet plateau the results show that downscaled precipitation by the gwr method is not ideal xu et al 2015 used the gwr method to perform downscaling studies in a small part of the tianshan mountains and eastern tibetan plateau downscaling in these two regions achieved positive results but both were during the warm season unlike this study xu et al 2015 conducted a satellite precipitation downscaling study for tmpa monthly precipitation that considered satellite precipitation data as a dependent variable whereas this study considers observed data as a dependent variable and satellite precipitation and environmental variables as independent variables in the model to obtain the corrected areal precipitation in addition imerg is used as the initial field in this study and has been validated to have a higher estimation accuracy than tmpa in xinjiang by many previous studies tang et al 2016b lu et al 2018a therefore using imerg as the initial field for correction is reasonably expected to obtain better areal precipitation chen et al 2018 used the gwr kriging gwrk method to downscale tmpa 3b43 precipitation over the relatively flat small and low elevation yangtze river basin and obtained a better monthly precipitation estimate their results indicated that the merged precipitation has larger errors in the regions with sparse gauges than in the regions with a higher gauge density thus a large number of available gauges is particularly important for correction in mountainous areas with complex terrain however the step method could be a better choice when relatively few gauges are available further studies are needed to determine the relation between the performance of gwr with the density of gauge networks and to develop more effective correction methods in mountainous areas 5 2 future research directions according to a large number of evaluation studies the accuracy of snowfall in satellite precipitation data is very poor therefore combining a large amount of snow remote sensing data such as snow water equivalent swe and snow cover sc with atmospheric precipitation such as imerg to develop a better corrected model for cold season precipitation will be the next research direction in addition with the development of machine learning as a research hotspot in recent years how to use this technology to extract precipitation related elements from massive remote sensing data is another potential research direction tang et al 2018c furthermore data mining is a newly developed technology that is shown to be effective in downscaled satellite precipitation products ma et al 2017 investigation of the application of data mining methods for correcting satellite precipitation should be an important and promising direction for future research 6 conclusions by introducing imerg precipitation topographical factors and ndvi as independent variables and observed data as the dependent variable we conducted a study on satellite correction technology for precipitation in the tianshan mountains by means of step and gwr widely applied geographical factors and ndvi were adopted to correct the estimations made by satellite precipitation products the main results are as follows 1 the distributions of the original and corrected imerg precipitation show a consistent spatial pattern and the same maximum precipitation center in the yili valley the maximum precipitation values of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 529 3 567 8 and 1048 7 mm respectively ori imerg and crt step underestimate the maximum precipitation by 44 and 40 respectively while crt gwr is closest to the rain gauge data 947 2 mm indicating that crt gwr could be better at capturing extreme precipitation 2 cross evaluation shows both the step and the gwr methods can improve the original imerg precipitation at the monthly scale and gwr has better correction results the cc increased from 0 57 for ori imerg to 0 74 for crt step and 0 79 for crt gwr the rb decreased from 7 10 for ori imerg to 1 32 for crt step and 1 12 for crt gwr and the rmse decreased from 27 41 mm for ori imerg to 22 63 mm for crt step and 20 94 mm for crt gwr 3 for the elevation impact analyses ori imerg crt step and crt gwr performed worse as the elevation increased and both crt step and crt gwr performed better than ori imerg the three products underestimate precipitation in the region above 1500 m and the degree of underestimation was greatly reduced after applying step and gwr corrections with rb reduced from 29 83 for ori imerg to 4 17 for crt step and 0 68 for crt gwr in addition because of the denser gauge network the best correction effect occurs in the middle and low elevation areas 1000 1500 m with the greatest increment in cc at 0 19 for crt step and 0 27 for crt gwr 4 a comparison of the correction effects in both the cold and the warm seasons using the 104 snowfall stations shows that the gwr method does not improve ori imerg probably because the performance of the gwr model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations especially in mountainous areas with complex terrains in contrast the step method showed positive correction effects in the two seasons although this study was conducted in the tianshan mountains the correction methods are also applicable in other mountainous areas furthermore this study only focuses on the gpm imerg monthly precipitation data while future studies can challenge corrections to precipitation estimations by satellite products at daily or even hourly scales to meet the demands of higher temporal

6411,point scale gauge observations have inherent limitations making it difficult to study the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation in alpine regions due to gauge undercatch and complex terrains the global precipitation measurement gpm mission provides new generation satellite precipitation products that are promising alternative data sources in mountainous areas however quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted prior to the application of satellite data in this study an unprecedentedly dense ground station network composed of more than 1000 automatic weather stations awss over the tianshan mountains in china are used for bias correction of the integrated multisatellite retrievals for gpm imerg product first universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale imerg from 0 1 to 500 m to ensure a fair comparison with the gauge observations then the downscaled imerg precipitation data over this region are corrected by two methods i e stepwise regression step and geographically weighted regression gwr both methods are established on various terrain factors and vegetation indexes that have strong relations with precipitation the results show that 1 gwr outperform the conventional step method as well as the original imerg 2 the original imerg performs best over the plain region less than 1000 m while the best correction effect was found in middle and low elevation region 1000 1500 m and 3 the performance of the gwr model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations in mountainous areas overall the methods and results presented in this study provide insight into the correction of satellite precipitation data in mountainous areas with scarce ground observations keywords precipitation correction imerg

scales kidd and huffman 2011 tang et al 2016a yang and luo 2014b accurate precipitation data are essential for research in the fields of hydrology meteorology etc however the measured precipitation at weather stations often fails to meet the requirements of research and applications in mountainous regions because of instrumental limitations sparse and uneven gauge distributions and the incapability of representing spatial variations in precipitation tang et al 2018a in contrast satellite data are characterized by wide coverage continuous observation periods and high spatiotemporal resolutions and have been widely used in hydrometeorological research in recent years verdin et al 2015 yin et al 2008 gao et al 2018 currently the most commonly used satellite precipitation products include the

multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg huffman et al 2017a 2017b imerg is the latest product and synthesizes the advantages of many previous retrieval algorithms thereby attracting much attention in the field of satellite remote sensing of precipitation skofronick jackson et al 2017 the retrospective processing for imerg through the trmm era is ongoing and imerg products are anticipated to play a more important role in hydrological and meteorological research although satellite remote sensing has advantages for large scale precipitation monitoring it can only provide indirect estimates compared with ground stations due to the limitations of spatiotemporal sampling instrument capability and retrieval algorithms the accuracy of satellite precipitation products is relatively low in some cases which is particularly true in arid and mountainous areas ma et al 2014 shen et al 2010 wu and zhai 2012 therefore the comprehensive evaluation and proper bias correction of satellite precipitation products are necessary yin et al 2004 2008 ji and chen 2012 yang and luo 2014a 2014b ouallouche and ameur 2014 golian et al 2015 lu et al 2018a 2018b precipitation in mountainous regions is strongly affected by macroclimate and terrain and has attracted the interest of many researchers smith 1979 roe et al 2002 yin et al 2004 2008 crochet 2009 shige et al 2013 yang and luo 2014a ma et al 2017 tang et al 2018b the tianshan mountain system in northwest china is one of the seven major mountain systems and the largest independent zonal mountain system in the world gao et al 2018 tianshan also bears the most typical mountain ecosystems in temperate arid regions around the world however the sparse gauge network cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of the precipitation intensity and distribution in the tianshan mountains satellite precipitation products such as imerg are valuable substitutes but also suffer from large systematic errors in this region tang et al 2016b li et al 2018 lu et al 2018a therefore it is necessary and meaningful to correct satellite precipitation data in tianshan for a better understanding of the regional hydrological cycle nevertheless to our knowledge there are no or very few studies that focus on correcting the latest imerg products in mountainous regions topographic factors are effective in improving the quality of satellite precipitation products on a monthly and even coarser time scale using topographic factors as inputs the stepwise regression step method has been proven to be very useful in correcting satellite precipitation lu et al 2018b for example yin et al 2004 2008 corrected precipitation data from the special sensor microwave imager ssm i and tmpa 3b42 using the step method based on various topographic factors in the tibetan plateau which is known as the third pole of the world yang and luo 2014a corrected tmpa 3b42 and 3b43 data in northwest china using the step method and a back propagation neural network which improved the accuracy of the original precipitation data vegetation is a natural link among soil the atmosphere and water and an important indicator of ecology and the environment the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is very sensitive to the growth potential and can represent the cover change in surface vegetation to a certain extent therefore ndvi is considered the best indicator of surface vegetation brunsell 2006 brunsell and young 2008 agam et al 2006 immerzeel et al 2009 roberto et al 2011 in addition the greenness of vegetation can be regarded as a proxy for cumulative precipitation which may have time lag brunsell 2006 a large number of studies performed downscaling of satellite precipitation products based on the relationship between ndvi and precipitation immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 xu et al 2015 ma et al 2017 for example based on the interaction and feedback relationship between precipitation and vegetation immerzeel et al 2009 first introduced the vegetation index to downscale tmpa data on an annual scale considering the influence of terrain on precipitation jia et al 2011 introduced multiple linear regression models at the annual scale and used ndvi and digital elevation model dem data in the qaidam basin to downscale tmpa data however few studies have utilized ndvi to correct satellite precipitation products at their original spatial resolutions ma et al 2018b two important problems remain unresolved by current studies i e the lack of corrected imerg products in mountainous regions and the near absence of ndvi in previous correction research to address these two issues this study utilizes two methods to correct the gpm imerg monthly precipitation product in the warm season in the tianshan mountains observations from a highly dense gauge network are used which is unprecedented compared to previous studies in this region ensuring the most reliable evaluation and the best correction performance in tianshan the first correction method is the widely used step the second method is geographically weighted regression gwr which was proposed by brunsdon et al 1996 and has been widely used in studies on spatial heterogeneity fotheringham et al 2002 propastin et al 2008 gwr has significant advantages in exploring the spatial variation relationship between variables and predicting future results and has been applied to downscale satellite precipitation xu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 by comparing the performance of step and gwr this study explores the applicability of the gwr in correcting satellite precipitation which should be valuable for the research community 2 study area and data 2 1 study area tianshan is the largest mountain range in central asia and is located between 39 45 n and 73 96 e fig 1 a which traverses the whole territory of xinjiang china and stretches as far as 1700 km from east to west tianshan has an average elevation of approximately 4000 m and consists of a series of mountain ranges intermountain basins valleys piedmont plains and other geomorphic units gao et al 2018 precipitation in tianshan is mainly affected by a westerly circulation and complex topography and displays dramatic disparities in time and space with a large amount of precipitation in summer and a small amount of precipitation in winter therefore correction of imerg in the warm season is very important for hydrological research in tianshan mountains the average annual precipitation along the northern slope of the tianshan mountains is 500 700 mm on some windward slopes to the west the annual precipitation reaches up to 1000 mm forming the wet island landscape in the arid northwestern region zhang et al 2012 xu et al 2016 tan and shao 2016 the tianshan mountains are not only the climate demarcation line between northern and southern xinjiang but also an important natural barrier affecting the weather climate and ecological environments in xinjiang and even china s central and western regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite datasets 2 2 1 1 gpm imerg gpm is trmm s follow up satellite precipitation program which can provide half hourly microwave infrared based global rain and snow data gpm expands the trmm sensor package and improves the precipitation observation capability the gpm core observatory gpmco which is equipped with a dual frequency radar ku and ka bands can detect a low minimum echo intensity and use the high sensitivity mode for interlaced sampling hou et al 2014 tang et al 2018b at the same time compared with the trmm satellite gpmco s microwave radiometer has four high frequency channels enhancing the observation capability for light precipitation and solid precipitation therefore the gpm mission can provide more accurate light precipitation 0 5 mm h 1 and solid precipitation data which are the dominant forms in mid and high latitude regions huffman et al 2017a 2017b including the tianshan area the imerg algorithm produces three types of products i e the early late and final runs at half hourly and 0 1 0 1 resolutions starting in march 2014 owing to the infusion of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rain gauge data the imerg final run product provides more accurate estimates and is considered the research level product huffman et al 2017a considering that tang et al 2016b and lu et al 2018a show that the imerg product is more accurate than tmpa products in xinjiang imerg final run version 5 was adopted in this study 2 2 1 2 ndvi the ndvi data used in this study were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mounted on the earth observing system eos terra satellite https wist echo nasa gov the level 3 land standard product mod13a1 was selected and comprises 16 day sinusoidal projection raster data at a 500 m spatial resolution we averaged the two files of the modis ndvi for each month to acquire the monthly vegetation cover over the study area 2 2 1 3 dem the dem data used in this study were from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem with a resolution of 1 arc s 30 m at the equator the data are obtained based on detailed observations from the new generation of the earth observation satellite terra launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the data cover all land areas between 83 n and 83 s accounting for approximately 99 of earth s land surface topographic factors are extracted from aster dem data the original 30 m dem data were resampled to a resolution of 500 m 500 m because the topographic factors extracted from the dem with a 500 m resolution can obtain better correction results taniguchi et al 2013 lu et al 2018b and can better match the ndvi data topographic factors including slope slp warren et al 2004 aspect asp yin et al 2004 curvature cvt chen et al 2013 topographic wetness index twi sørensen and seibert 2007 and hillshade hshd yin et al 2008 were derived from the dem data please refer to yin et al 2004 2008 for more information it is worth mentioning that since only 6 topographic factors which are all common environmental variables are selected in this study the definitions of these variables are explicit and largely independent from each other therefore there is no multiple collinearity between these variables 2 2 2 rain gauge data the daily rain gauge precipitation data which undergo strict quality control are provided by the information center of the xinjiang meteorological bureau and are accumulated to the monthly scale the number of automatic weather stations awss in the tianshan mountains reaches up to 1065 the elevation of the stations ranges from 152 m to 3616 m with most stations located at middle and low latitudes fig 2 it is worth mentioning that the number of gauges used in this study is much higher than that used in previous studies e g ji and chen 2012 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 ensuring the reliability of the evaluation and the correction of satellite precipitation among the 1 065 awss there are only 104 snowfall stations fig 1b with the ability to observe solid precipitation which is dominant in the cold season therefore we selected the warm season from may to september between 2014 and 2017 as the study period we also discussed the applicability of the correction methods in the cold season in section 5 based on the 104 snowfall stations in china 194 stations are included in the gpcc monitoring product which is used for the bias correction of trmm gpm research level products shen et al 2013 tang etal 2016b in particular there are 8 gpcc stations in this study area we excluded the 8 gpcc stations for the purpose of independent evaluation due to the sparse distribution and complex topography the interpolation of gauge data would generate large uncertainties therefore this study extracted gauge data that fell within each imerg grid pixel and the collocated imerg data for further correction if more than one gauge was located within the same grid their average precipitation value was adopted ma et al 2009 ward etal 2011 blacutt et al 2015 hu et al 2016 3 methods fig 3 shows the flow chart of the corrected methods in this study first universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale the imerg product to 500 m then the downscaled imerg precipitation data over this region are corrected by step and gwr finally the corrected imerg data with a 500 m resolution are aggregated by pixel averaging to obtain the corrected imerg precipitation at the original 0 1 0 1 resolution the detailed description is as follows 3 1 determination of the lag in ndvi ndvi is regarded as a proxy for cumulative precipitation some studies indicate that the response of ndvi to precipitation usually lagged by two or three months duan and bastiaanssen 2013 however brunsell 2006 analyzed the feedback relationship between ndvi and precipitation in four types of land surfaces the results showed that only one type of land surface had a one month delay while the other three types had almost no delay to clarify this issue we calculated the correlation between ndvi and precipitation under different delays the results show that the correlation becomes increasingly smaller with increasing delays and the precipitation ndvi relationship of the zero month lag is strongest therefore in this study ndvi is used to correct imerg precipitation of the same month 3 2 step step is a method for selecting independent variables in linear regression models that can be used to screen and eliminate variables that cause multicollinearity beale et al 1967 newton and spurrell 1967 the specific steps are as follows first the dependent variable is used to make a simple regression for each selected explanatory variable and then the regression equation corresponding to the explanatory variable with the largest contribution is used to gradually introduce the remaining explanatory variables in this study to eliminate the discontinuity of the mesh boundary universal kriging interpolation was used to downscale the original imerg precipitation hereafter ori imerg to facilitate a fairer comparison against the rain gauge data yin et al 2008 yang and luo 2014a the output resolution was set to 500 m named imerg500m matching the resolutions of the ndvi and dem data in particular the fine resolution can make the gauge observations terrain factors and ndvi more representative in the 500 m 500 m grid and accurately establish a one to one correspondence between the satellite precipitation and observed data previous studies i e yin et al 2008 ji and chen 2012 yang and luo 2014a adopted a buffer of 25 or 50 km around a gauge to extract terrain factors however this buffer could generate relatively large uncertainties it is worth noting that we also used rain gauge data to evaluate the imerg data before and after interpolation and the results show that the universal kriging interpolation has a negligible effect see section 4 1 first this study used the imerg500m monthly precipitation data topographical factors asp slp cvt tri hshd and dem and ndvi as independent variables and the measured precipitation obs from the weather stations as the dependent variable then we employed the statistical product and service solutions spss statistical software to conduct the step analysis to establish each monthly regression equation from may to september next the topographical factors ndvi and imerg500m precipitation for each grid pixel were incorporated into the established regression equation to obtain the 500 m gridded precipitation corrected by the step equation finally an aggregate by pixels average was conducted to acquire the ultimate product named crt step the regression model formula is as follows 1 p obs f p imer g 500 m n d v i t e r r ε where p obs represents the measured precipitation at the station p imer g 500 m represents the imerg500m precipitation before correction terr represents the value of the topographical factors and ε represents the residual 3 3 gwr in spatial analyses observed data are generally sampled at given geographical locations the relation and structure between variables vary among locations i e spatial heterogeneity if a conventional linear regression model is used the analysis of spatial data may fail to provide a satisfactory result because global models are analyzed with the assumption that the relations between variables are homogenous which leads to a certain mean value in the study area therefore it is necessary to adopt a new kind of local regression method to address the innate properties of these spatial data for this purpose the gwr model was proposed and has been frequently practiced and validated foody 2003 li et al 2010 xu et al 2015 chen et al 2018 in addition to adopting gwr this study simultaneously took topographical factors elevation and vegetation coverage into consideration for precipitation correction which reflected the spatial non stationarity between precipitation and related factors moreover at locations without rain gauge data i e non sample points gwr is capable of estimating precipitation data by transforming spatial parameters into regression parameters the basic idea of gwr is that the relationships between variables change with spatial location the regression model is established by estimating parameters for the correlated variable and explanatory variable of each given location in the study area to obtain the best results as in the step the gwr regression model established in this study also uses obs as the dependent variable and the topographical factors ndvi and imerg500m precipitation data as the independent variables the formula is as follows 2 y j β 0 u j v j k 1 p β k u j v j x kj ε j where y j represents the actual precipitation at the jth point x kj represents the kth variable imerg500m precipitation topographical factors and ndvi at the jth point β 0 u j v j and β k u j v j represent the intercept and the slope of the kth variable at the jth point respectively which are spatially variant as shown in fig 3 u j v j represents the coordinates of the jth point in two dimensional space p represents the number of independent variables and ε j represents the residual different from the traditional global regression model eq 2 is based on the assumption that the closer an observation point is to the jth point the greater the impact by the jth point the coefficient of the observation point is the attenuation function for the observation distance revolving around the jth point and can be obtained by solving eq 3 3 β u j v j x t w u j v j x 1 x t w u j v j y where β u j v j represents the coefficient of the jth point and x and y represent the independent and dependent variables respectively w u j v j represents the weight matrix which ensures that the closer the observation point is to the jth point the greater the weight this value can be obtained by the following formula 4 w ij 1 d ij b 2 2 w h e n d ij b w ij 0 w h e n d ij b where d ij represents the distance between the jth point and the surrounding ith observation point and b represents the bandwidth threshold fig 4 a c shows the spatial pattern of the intercept and the slopes of the ndvi and imerg generated by the gwr method over the tianshan mountains in august as illustrated these coefficients display different spatial distributions the intercept is between 2 5 and 68 4 the slopes of the ndvi and imerg precipitation data range from 15 6 to 22 2 and from 19 4 to 54 1 respectively note that the blank areas of the three subfigures in fig 4 represent the locations of outliers and were removed before correction 3 4 main correction steps using the step and gwr methods 1 excluding outliers the values of the ndvi and terrain factors over snow and water are constant which is inconsistent with the assumption that there is a significant relationship between them and precipitation therefore pixels including snow and water bodies are identified and removed from the original data in addition human activities and various natural factors interfere with the relationship between precipitation and the ndvi to avoid this potential influence on the correction we remove these pixels in the ndvi data using a low pass filter with an 11 11 moving window to obtain the smoothed ndvi hereafter s ndvi xu et al 2015 for example fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of ndvi in september 2016 which was calculated to identify the outliers of the ndvi most of the high and low s ndvi values are located over regions adjacent to lakes and snow covered mountains where the ndvi values could be seriously disturbed by surface and atmospheric conditions we identified s ndvi 0 15 and s ndvi 0 15 as outlier thresholds of ndvi values xu et al 2015 using this threshold 62 663 pixels approximately 12 3 were identified and eliminated 2 using the observed data from the training awss as the dependent variable and the co located imerg500m data ndvi data and terrain factors as the independent variables the step and gwr models were established furthermore a tenfold cross validation method was employed to perform an in depth assessment of the performance of the two models in this study the gwr 4 0 software http geoinformatics wp st andrews ac uk gwr gwr downloads was applied to build the gwr model this tool is powerful when estimating the regression coefficient at a location without rain gauge data compared with gwr 3 x an important extension of the new release is the function that fits semiparametric gwr models by blending globally fixed and geographically varying coefficients nakaya 2015 in gwr two parameters are critical the kernel function for estimating the weight matrix w u j v j in eq 3 and the selection criteria used to determine the kernel bandwidth b in eq 4 there are four kernel functions fixed gaussian adaptive bi square adaptive gaussian and fixed bi square and four selection criteria akaike information criterion aic small sample bias corrected aic aicc bayesian information criterion bic and cross validation cv in this study adaptive bi square and aicc were selected as the kernel function and selection criteria respectively as in xu et al 2015 3 applying the step and gwr models established by step 2 to the whole study area to acquire the corrected areal precipitation first the values of the central coordinates from imerg500m ndvi and the terrain factors with a 500 m resolution except for the pixels eliminated in step 1 were extracted in this study area second the extracted element values were brought into eqs 1 and 2 to obtain the areal precipitation corrected by the step and gwr models i e crt step and crt gwr respectively 4 converting the crt step and crt gwr precipitation generated in step 3 to the point vector dataset and then interpolating them using a simple spline tension interpolator to acquire precipitation values for the pixels removed in step 1 5 aggregating the crt step and crt gwr precipitation generated in step 4 by pixel averaging to reduce error we finally obtain the corrected imerg precipitation at the original 0 1 0 1 resolution 3 5 validation

study universal kriging interpolation was used to downscale the original imerg data from 0 1 to 500 m resolution this method prevents a grid from containing multiple rain gauges under coarse resolution conditions thus the ndvi terrain factors and satellite precipitation extracted from corresponding raster data with a 500 m resolution can correspond to the rain gauge data to verify whether the interpolation data are different from the original data we used the observed data to assess the two datasets before and after interpolation the results show that the ccs rbs and rmses of the downscaled imerg and ori imerg are 0 56 and 0 57 6 76 and 7 1 and 27 66 mm and 27 41 mm respectively which indicates that the interpolation almost does not affect the quality of the original data therefore this interpolation provides a good data foundation for the next step of model training and verification huang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 4 2 spatial distributions of original and corrected imerg precipitation fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of the mean precipitation of obs ori imerg crt step and crt gwr from may to september 2016 which was the wettest year in the history of xinjiang the distributions of the original and corrected imerg precipitation both with a 0 1 resolution show a consistent changing tendency with most precipitation converging over the yili valley which is surrounded by mountains on three sides and forms a horn shaped valley to the west under the influence of atlantic water vapor the warm and humid air current climbs upward along the windward slope and forms orographic precipitation therefore the yili valley is mild and humid with abundant rainfall for vegetation growth the annual precipitation amount for the study area is 417 6 mm and in the mountainous area specifically it can reach up to 600 mm which makes the basin the most humid area in xinjiang compared with the obs ori imerg apparently underestimates precipitation over the yili valley the distribution is notably improved by using crt step and crt gwr fig 5c d table 1 shows that the maximum precipitation values of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 529 3 567 8 and 1048 7 mm respectively the maximum observed record from the weather stations is 947 2 mm during the same period indicating that crt gwr is the closest to the rain gauge data regarding extreme precipitation ori imerg and crt step underestimate the maximum precipitation by 44 and 40 respectively the mean precipitation of the original and corrected imerg is close to the value of obs table 1 in terms of the standard deviation sd ori imerg and crt step underestimate the value of obs by 45 and 22 respectively whereas crt gwr is very close to obs table 1 overall ori imerg underestimates heavy precipitation and this underestimation is obviously reduced by crt gwr 4 3 overall assessment as introduced in the methods section the tenfold cross validation strategy was used to evaluate precipitation by ori imerg crt step and crt gwr using gauge data from may to september between 2014 and 2017 table 2 shows the overall performance of the three types of estimates the ccs between the obs and estimates by ori imerg crt step and crt gwr were 0 57 0 74 and 0 79 respectively indicating that the three kinds of estimates all have remarkable linear correlations with the observed data the overall rbs of the three kinds of estimates were 7 1 1 32 and 1 12 respectively illustrating that the corrections can significantly reduce the overestimation of the original imerg data moreover compared with ori imerg the nse of crt gwr increased from 0 31 to 0 62 i e doubling while the rmse decreased from 27 41 mm to 20 94 mm generally crt gwr shows the best performance among the three datasets with noticeable improvement concerning all metrics to further depict the distributions of each metric box plots are used to show cc nse rb and rmse values at all stations in the study area fig 7 box plots describe data by using five statistics namely the minimum first quartile median third quartile and maximum and can roughly present whether the data have symmetry the degree of dispersion etc overall the cc and nse of the crt gwr are higher 0 78 and 0 36 respectively than those of the other two products 0 76 and 0 09 for ori imerg and 0 74 and 0 27 for crt step respectively the rbs are improved by using the two correction methods crt step shows some improvement with a lower rb whereas crt gwr presents better symmetry and a more centralized distribution that approximates at zero compared to ori imerg and crt step in addition the distribution of the nse for the crt gwr precipitation has a strong concentration in contrast more than half of the nse values for ori imerg are below zero and their distribution is relatively dispersed the rmse shows that crt gwr has the smallest error 17 15 mm by comparison the rmses of ori imerg and crt step are 21 69 mm and 20 3 mm respectively 4 4 monthly scale assessment fig 8 shows a group of taylor diagrams that compare the estimates of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr to the rain gauge data the taylor diagram is a graphical method used to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of models or estimates taylor 2001 based on cc centered rmse and sd statistics the closer the points of satellite estimates are to the point of obs the better the accuracy of the estimates the taylor diagram is very useful for evaluating the performance of various models tang et al 2016a ning et al 2016 guo et al 2016 by marking the three statistical indexes in the same picture the advantages and disadvantages of the three products become more straightforward as shown in fig 8a during the whole period the sd of the obs is 34 75 mm while the sds of the ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 20 6 24 87 and 30 55 mm respectively which means that the sd of the crt gwr estimate is the closest to that of the obs the cc of crt gwr is the highest 0 77 and the rmse of crt gwr is lower than that of the other two products the same result can also be seen on the monthly diagrams fig 8b d as september enters the end of the warm season in the study area the rainfall decreases as shown in fig 8f with different patterns from other months fig 9 shows the scatter plots of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr against the rain gauge precipitation during the whole period and at the monthly scale crt gwr is the closest to the 1 1 line followed by crt step while ori imerg displays the most scattered distribution of precipitation reflecting that the accuracy after correction is apparently improved in addition the fitting effect of crt gwr is better than that of crt step for example in august although the cc of the ori imerg related to the observed precipitation is only 0 29 it increases to 0 51 and 0 67 for crt step and crt gwr respectively furthermore as shown in fig 9 b f crt gwr was well correlated with the rain gauge precipitation every month which is even more evident in may and august fig 9b e fig 10 shows the statistics of nse cc rb and rmse the monthly nse corrected by either crt step or crt gwr is significantly improved compared with that before correction the nse is increased to 0 22 0 6 and 0 43 0 69 for crt step and crt gwr respectively compared to that for ori imerg approximately 0 03 0 45 an nse value higher than 0 5 is regarded as satisfactory gupta and tarboton 2016 indicating that the two correction methods improve the quality of imerg to a new level as shown in fig 10 b d ccs at the monthly scale are increased from 0 29 to 0 67 before correction to 0 51 0 77 and 0 67 0 84 after correction by step and gwr respectively the rmses decrease from 26 57 to 35 84 to 16 86 30 99 mm and 14 78 27 81 mm respectively and the rbs also show significant improvement after correction 4 5 pixel scale assessment and elevation impact analysis fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of cc nse rb and rmse at each station in the study area nse has large spatial variations and ori imerg shows negative nse at the stations in contrast crt step and crt gwr show significant improvements especially in yili valley concerning rb ori imerg is characterized by underestimation in the middle and high elevation areas but overestimation in the low elevation areas on both the northern and southern sides of tianshan the underestimation and overestimation are both notably reduced by crt step and crt gwr the rbs of most of the stations after correction are all within 25 the same improvement can be seen in the rmse for the elevation analysis the tianshan mountains are divided into three elevation zones less than 1000 m 1000 1500 m and more than 1500 m table 3 the number of stations within the three zones is 320 404 and 341 respectively the average precipitation increases as elevation increases due to the orographic effect tang et al 2018b with the magnitude being 21 27 26 06 and 46 92 mm for the three zones respectively crt gwr is closest to obs regarding average precipitation with values of 21 50 26 24 and 46 60 mm for the three zones respectively according to the statistics ori imerg performs best over the plain region less than 1000 m with a cc value of 0 67 and an rmse value of 18 95 mm as the elevation increases the error of satellite precipitation becomes larger with an increase in rmse from 18 95 mm for the plain region to 27 7 mm for the middle and low elevation areas 1000 1500 m and 34 91 mm for the high elevation regions over 1500 m the ccs between the obs and the corrected precipitation in the three zones increase by 0 05 0 19 and 0 08 for crt step and 0 11 0 27 and 0 1 for crt gwr respectively suggesting that the correction effect is the most prominent in the 1000 1500 m zone one possible reason for this result is the additional available gauges for modeling in this zone and the raw imerg data have the lowest precision so the room for improvement is also larger additionally this result shows that the correction capability of gwr is powerful the rbs show that the three data sets all underestimate precipitation in the region above 1500 m and the degree of underestimation is greatly reduced after step and gwr correction the rmses show the same trend as the elevation increases overall crt gwr performed better than the other two estimates 5 discussion 5 1 correction during the cold season satellite precipitation performs worse during the cold season tang et al 2018c although the imerg precipitation has been greatly improved compared to the previous tmpa precipitation tang et al 2016b xu et al 2017 lu et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 the improvement in the cold season is still unsatisfactory therefore the correction of satellite precipitation during the cold season is important in this study we also tried correcting cold season precipitation following the five steps in section 3 4 there are only 104 snowfall stations fig 1b accounting for approximately 10 of the stations in the study area the evaluation results are shown in fig 12 crt step showed a certain degree of improvement however crt gwr performed poorly which was unexpected because gwr has proved very useful in the warm season to confirm whether the poor correction effect of the gwr method is due to seasonal reasons we corrected imerg precipitation again using only the 104 snowfall stations in the warm season via both the gwr and the step methods the results are shown in fig 12 d f although the gwr method performs better in the warm season than in the cold season it is still worse than the original imerg precipitation product however the step method showed positive correction effects in both the cold and warm seasons indicating that the step model still works even with much fewer stations in contrast the gwr method seems to have a strong dependence on gauge density and does not work when the number of gauges is small one possible reason for this result is that gwr is a regression method that assigns weights according to the distance of points from the training point at each non sampling point the gwr algorithm calculates the regression coefficients by searching for the adjacent training stations the closer a non sampling point is to the training points the more weight the non sampling point obtains ma et al 2017 conversely the farther the locations are from the training points i e observation locations the greater the uncertainty chen et al 2018 therefore the lower the number of stations is the less reliable the non sampling point regression coefficients in terms of recent research using the gwr method for downscaling ma et al 2017 conducted a downscaling study of tmpa 3b43 at the annual scale with 106 meteorological stations on the qinghai tibet plateau the results show that downscaled precipitation by the gwr method is not ideal xu et al 2015 used the gwr method to perform downscaling studies in a small part of the tianshan mountains and eastern tibetan plateau downscaling in these two regions achieved positive results but both were during the warm season unlike this study xu et al 2015 conducted a satellite precipitation downscaling study for tmpa monthly precipitation that considered satellite precipitation data as a dependent variable whereas this study considers observed data as a dependent variable and satellite precipitation and environmental variables as independent variables in the model to obtain the corrected areal precipitation in addition imerg is used as the initial field in this study and has been validated to have a higher estimation accuracy than tmpa in xinjiang by many previous studies tang et al 2016b lu et al 2018a therefore using imerg as the initial field for correction is reasonably expected to obtain better areal precipitation chen et al 2018 used the gwr kriging gwrk method to downscale tmpa 3b43 precipitation over the relatively flat small and low elevation yangtze river basin and obtained a better monthly precipitation estimate their results indicated that the merged precipitation has larger errors in the regions with sparse gauges than in the regions with a higher gauge density thus a large number of available gauges is particularly important for correction in mountainous areas with complex terrain however the step method could be a better choice when relatively few gauges are available further studies are needed to determine the relation between the performance of gwr with the density of gauge networks and to develop more effective correction methods in mountainous areas 5 2 future research directions according to a large number of evaluation studies the accuracy of snowfall in satellite precipitation data is very poor therefore combining a large amount of snow remote sensing data such as snow water equivalent swe and snow cover sc with atmospheric precipitation such as imerg to develop a better corrected model for cold season precipitation will be the next research direction in addition with the development of machine learning as a research hotspot in recent years how to use this technology to extract precipitation related elements from massive remote sensing data is another potential research direction tang et al 2018c furthermore data mining is a newly developed technology that is shown to be effective in downscaled satellite precipitation products ma et al 2017 investigation of the application of data mining methods for correcting satellite precipitation should be an important and promising direction for future research 6 conclusions by introducing imerg precipitation topographical factors and ndvi as independent variables and observed data as the dependent variable we conducted a study on satellite correction technology for precipitation in the tianshan mountains by means of step and gwr widely applied geographical factors and ndvi were adopted to correct the estimations made by satellite precipitation products the main results are as follows 1 the distributions of the original and corrected imerg precipitation show a consistent spatial pattern and the same maximum precipitation center in the yili valley the maximum precipitation values of ori imerg crt step and crt gwr are 529 3 567 8 and 1048 7 mm respectively ori imerg and crt step underestimate the maximum precipitation by 44 and 40 respectively while crt gwr is closest to the rain gauge data 947 2 mm indicating that crt gwr could be better at capturing extreme precipitation 2 cross evaluation shows both the step and the gwr methods can improve the original imerg precipitation at the monthly scale and gwr has better correction results the cc increased from 0 57 for ori imerg to 0 74 for crt step and 0 79 for crt gwr the rb decreased from 7 10 for ori imerg to 1 32 for crt step and 1 12 for crt gwr and the rmse decreased from 27 41 mm for ori imerg to 22 63 mm for crt step and 20 94 mm for crt gwr 3 for the elevation impact analyses ori imerg crt step and crt gwr performed worse as the elevation increased and both crt step and crt gwr performed better than ori imerg the three products underestimate precipitation in the region above 1500 m and the degree of underestimation was greatly reduced after applying step and gwr corrections with rb reduced from 29 83 for ori imerg to 4 17 for crt step and 0 68 for crt gwr in addition because of the denser gauge network the best correction effect occurs in the middle and low elevation areas 1000 1500 m with the greatest increment in cc at 0 19 for crt step and 0 27 for crt gwr 4 a comparison of the correction effects in both the cold and the warm seasons using the 104 snowfall stations shows that the gwr method does not improve ori imerg probably because the performance of the gwr model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations especially in mountainous areas with complex terrains in contrast the step method showed positive correction effects in the two seasons although this study was conducted in the tianshan mountains the correction methods are also applicable in other mountainous areas furthermore this study only focuses on the gpm imerg monthly precipitation data while future studies can challenge corrections to precipitation estimations by satellite products at daily or even hourly scales to meet the demands of higher temporal

6412,hydrologic control structures are designed to connect or disconnect water movement in natural surface water groundwater systems and it is important to represent these features effectively within a finite difference element model without over discretization this study presents efficient numerical schemes for operating water allocation and water rights systems in integrated hydrosystem models

groundwater pumping wells and demand farms municipality and stream highlights how the numerical schemes for water management operations can be used to optimize surface water and groundwater extraction and distribution using a fully integrated model keywords integrated surface subsurface model water management hydrologic control structures boundary condition link mesh cutoff tile drainage 1 introduction appropriate management strategies are essential to maximize the value of water resources and to mitigate the risks associated with water misappropriation dillon 2005 panday et al 2009 cao et al 2013 these water management practices are often required to simultaneously consider various components of the water cycle involving the atmosphere land surface and subsurface as they are frequently designed to re distribute water from one flow system to another davison et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 management activities such as groundwater pumping for water supply and irrigation and storage in surface and subsurface reservoirs can also significantly influence the natural water cycle therefore implementation and operation of water resource infrastructure for municipal industrial and agricultural applications needs to take into account a wide range of processes and their interactions panday et al 2009 gorelick and zheng 2015 wu et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 an integrated hydrologic analysis incorporating multiple hydrosystem components into a single integrated system is therefore essential for holistic water resource management kollet and maxwell 2008 refsgaard et al 2010 rassam 2011 rassam et al 2013 davison et al 2015 with the growing realization that fully integrated hydrologic models have the ability to provide a more holistic representation of the terrestrial water cycle and given the increasing application of these models at larger spatial scales chen 2015 hwang et al 2015 condon and maxwell 2017 hwang et al 2018 there is a growing need to develop efficient upscaling approaches berg and sudicky 2019 not only for the representation of physical parameters but also for the representation of water management activities incorporation of physically based water management activities and features such as artificial subsurface drainage systems flow control weirs reservoirs dams and injection extraction systems for groundwater recharge into integrated surface water groundwater hydrologic simulations requires an effective and efficient representation of hydrologic control structures and their operation within a finite element or finite difference framework for the modhms fully integrated surface subsurface flow and transport model panday and huyakorn 2004 panday et al 2009 developed a water supply system wss module that links water and solute sources to their end uses in order to analyze water re distribution and cl loading associated with land use changes additionally water management solvers including operational analysis and optimization tools have been combined with hydrologic numerical simulators to improve the efficiency of the operation of hydrologic control structures valerio et al 2010 condon and maxwell 2013 brookfield et al 2016 brookfield and gnau 2016 dogrul et al 2016 morway et al 2016 condon and maxwell 2013 implemented an optimization solver into parflow maxwell et al 2010 a fully integrated surface subsurface model for a case study focusing on the optimal allocation of groundwater and surface water for consumptive and irrigation demand similarly brookfield and gnau 2016 performed basin scale surface water management analysis using oasis operational analysis and simulation of integrated systems hydrologics 2009 and hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2015 an integrated surface subsurface model in the aforementioned studies hydrologic models were used to inform the operational analysis and optimization algorithms on the current state of the hydrologic system and to forecast system changes in response to management decisions an additional example of surface water groundwater water management tools that link groundwater and surface water flow models through time lagging or iterative coupling is the modflow farm process mf fmp module which was applied by hanson et al 2010 and hanson et al 2012 to simulate conjunctive water management in the central valley california usa although there are several limitations on runoff and variably saturated flow conditions mf fmp is currently one of the most comprehensive water management modelling tools that couples groundwater and surface water hanson et al 2010 specifically mf fmp couples hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation groundwater uptake evapotranspiration and surface subsurface return flows schmid and hanson 2009 for the numerical approaches applied to the water management practices mentioned above the allocation and re distribution of water resources within the hydrologic models was primarily achieved by linking or pairing flux boundary conditions which connect sinks to sources or vice versa among anthropogenic features that influence groundwater surface water partitioning agricultural tile drains are perhaps the most ubiquitous in many parts of north america and europe capability to simulate tile drains has been implemented in hydrogeosphere macquarrie and sudicky 1996 and subsequently applied to integrated surface subsurface models rozemeijer et al 2010 frey et al 2012 de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 to account for the influence of tile drainage on both the groundwater and surface water systems in some cases tile drain networks were represented as seepage nodes or high conductivity porous media in order to simplify the problem such that large model domains can be represented de schepper et al 2015 in addition to subsurface drainage holistic modelling of integrated water management systems also necessitates that engineered barriers that restrict and control surface water flow e g dams floodgates and dikes are represented for which a numerical scheme has not yet been implemented in fully integrated surface subsurface models dam operation software tools have however already been explicitly linked to groundwater flow models and prescribed dam discharges have been used to compute dynamic changes in reservoir water levels in integrated surface subsurface systems valerio et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 brookfield et al 2016 in order to manage and re distribute water within a holistically simulated water resources system a reliable and efficient representation of drains and water management structures is an important component of the analysis because these features often significantly interrupt natural flow conditions however it is also known that these simulations can become computationally expensive when using high resolution three dimensional 3d unstructured meshes that discretize the internal geometric constraints required to represent the control structures shepherd and johnson 2008 durand riard et al 2010 shepherd et al 2010 accordingly the purpose of this study is to present a methodology that overcomes this computational obstacle with an effective and efficient way of representing these structures directly within a fully integrated hydrologic model specifically this study describes a computationally cost effective numerical strategy to implement boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes and demonstrates the utility of these numerical schemes for complex water management systems involving agricultural tile drainage reservoir operations and watershed management 2 method 2 1 illustrative numerical schemes for water management two examples were selected to demonstrate the necessity and advantage of using the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes 1 subsurface tile drainage and 2 dam reservoir operation systems for the first example the boundary condition linking implemented here is similar to those used in previous studies panday et al 2009 condon and maxwell 2013 but it is noted that the linking scheme is not just limited for connecting sources with sink boundary conditions in that its applicability is expanded to other engineering structures that are in some cases geometrically or numerically difficult to represent in an integrated system e g tile drains artificial channels pipelines reservoirs etc in agriculture tile drainage systems as shown in fig 1 a are used to remove excess subsurface water from fields and to provide an optimal soil moisture condition for crop growth and field trafficking frey et al 2013 de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 models based on an integrated surface subsurface framework are illustrated in fig 1b and 1c for case 1 fig 1b where a one dimensional 1d tile drain red lines is implemented in a 3d domain consisting of vertically structured meshes the location of the tile drain outlet blue triangle depends on the topography of the domain indicating that the drain outlet location is dependent on the mesh structure i e node elevation because the tile outlet is usually located at the lowest elevation of the drainage system the groundwater level is highly dependent on the outlet elevation moreover the temporal response of the surface water flow system in the stream receiving the tile drainage is also affected by the lowered groundwater level which may lead to misleading simulation results however the drain outlet for case 2 as shown in fig 1c is flexibly linked to a node in the surface domain gray area which is the linked node blue square the linked node can be assigned anywhere in the surface and subsurface domains using the boundary condition linking scheme for the second example in order to simulate water volume and level changes in a reservoir the physical properties of the engineering barriers are required model input fig 2 a however if there is limited information related to the flow barriers one of the easiest ways to achieve the structural representation of the feature is to increase the surface node elevation to mimic the barriers this may be an alternative solution for the surface flow simulation to restrict flow but it also requires additional work such as mesh refinement in order to conform to the structural dimensions of the barriers more importantly for integrated surface subsurface modelling the alternative solution may not be reasonable because the top layer of a subsurface domain is connected to the surface domain and thus unnecessary assumptions pertaining to the subsurface properties could be imposed on the simulation fig 2b regarding numerical schemes for representing engineered flow barriers the horizontal flow barrier hfb package for use with modflow was implemented by hsieh and freckleton 1993 for groundwater flow modelling the hfb package is controlled by adjusting the hydraulic conductance between cells or elements which may be useful for representing barriers in surface flow domains but it also requires physical properties of the structures for impervious barriers fig 2a the surface barrier structure can be simply represented using the cutoff wall scheme which does not require specification of the physical properties of the structures fig 2c 2 2 integrated hydrologic analysis mathematical formulations for a fully integrated hydrosystem when attempting to simultaneously consider the myriad of physical processes in the various flow compartments dimensional simplification is sometimes unavoidable in the numerical solution procedure for example flow within pumping wells tile drains and rivers are often simplified as 1d flow domains averaged over their cross sections and overland flow is described by a two dimensional 2d depth averaged equation although there are many variations fluid flow in integrated hydrologic systems can be symbolically described using the following simplified equation as 1 a 1 d q 1 d d 2 d q 2 d q 3 d i q i δ x x i t v w 1 v w 2 v w 3 where q 1 d is the flux along the axis of the 1d flow features e g tiles wells channels etc averaged over their cross sectional area a 1 d q 2 d is the flux along the 2d surface flow domain averaged over the water depth or width d 2 d q 3 d is the 3d flux within the 3d flow domain e g porous subsurface the divergence operators for the 1d 2d and 3d domains are and respectively and q i δ x x i is a source or sink representing the rate of water being introduced into or extracted at location x i the right hand side represents the change in storage over all the flow systems 1d flow along tile drains pipes or channels q 1 d can be described using such constitutive equations as the hagen poiseuille analytic method or the manning or hazen williams empirical formulae similarly manning s formula can be used to describe 2d overland fluxes q 2 d and darcy s law can describe 3d subsurface flow q 3 d the amount of water within a control volume under variably saturated subsurface flow is generally described by the degree of water saturation and the porous medium s compressible storage see brunner and simmons 2012 hwang et al 2014 and aquanty inc 2019 for details regarding the hydrogeosphere description and mathematical formulations 2 2 1 boundary condition linking scheme water management and control structures are operated to adjust natural flow systems and to re distribute water in order to best satisfy water demands while minimizing adverse risks fig 3 a illustrates a simple example of the re distribution of water in an integrated hydrologic system an artificial groundwater recharge and recovery system where surface water is re distributed into the subsurface for later recovery in this example pumping from the surface reservoir needs to be represented as an active flux boundary condition the pumping rate is a decision variable while a passive injection condition is applied to the recharge well with the rate being specified by its conjugate pumping condition pumping in a recovery well will then remove water from the aquifer the boundary conditions to represent these control structures thus can be generalized as 2 i q i δ x x i i n ext q i δ x x i ext i n c q i δ x x i δ x x cj where n ext is the number of sources or sinks at x x i ext which are associated with the external components of the system n c is the number of control structures operated at x x i which is linked to its passive conjugate node at x x cj for a multi purpose water supply system the number of passive conjugate nodes linked to the supply is determined based on the number of demand points e g one pumping well supplies groundwater to two farms and one city which requires three conjugate nodes it is noted that q i is often a function of dependent variables such as groundwater heads and subsurface water saturations h and s w and water depths in the surface flow system d additionally for the case of dam operations the flux value for q i can be flexibly computed using either the power rating curve or a user defined stage discharge table as the interactions between the natural hydrologic system and human induced perturbations increase more boundary conditions are needed to be paired numerically in a case where a closed system is considered all natural and anthropogenic water transfers are linked within a hydrologic system and thus the number of external sources or sinks can be zero n ext 0 2 2 2 mesh cutoff scheme when an artificial barrier is used to interrupt the natural water flow at a location x b for 1d domain along a segment δ a in a 2d domain or across a face δ v in 3d an internal zero flux condition needs to be applied at the location as 3 q 1 d x x b 0 or q 2 d n δ a 0 or q 3 d n δ v 0 where n δ a and n δ v represent 2d and 3d vectors normal to the segment δ a and the face δ v respectively forcing a zero flux condition within the domain at a point along a segment or across a face can generate a large hydraulic gradient fig 3b 2 3 numerical representation of operational structures 2 3 1 boundary condition linking scheme for the numerical solution of the integrated hydrological model hydrogeosphere the numerical discretization with a control volume approach can be represented using the following simplified form 4 j η i q ji h i h j q i h i cj n p q cj h cj δ v wi δ t i 1 2 n where q ji is the rate of water flow from the control volume associated with the discrete location node j to i and is a function of the state at the location and the difference of the states between two points e g heads h i a n d h j η i represents a set of nodes connected to the node i q i represents an active source or sink associated with node i and often it is a function of the state variables at the node e g head and water depth n p is the number of the passive nodes linked to the active node q cj is a passive conjugate source or sink associated with any node cj other than node i cj i v wi is the amount of water within the control volume associated with the active node i and n is the number of degrees of freedom used to discretize the domain similar to the work performed by hwang et al 2014 this system of nonlinear equations can be solved using newton successive linearization as 5 r i h i h j s h cj δ v wi δ t j η i q ji h i h j q i h i cj n p q cj h cj i 1 2 n 6 h l 1 h l δ h l l 1 2 3 n 7 δ h l j l 1 r l w h e r e j l r l h l where the r i is the i th component of the residual vector r h is the state vector l is the iteration count for the newton iterative procedure and j is the jacobian matrix because an accurate evaluation of the jacobian matrix can improve the computing efficiency of the newton method the sparsity structure of the jacobian matrix needs to be revised to account for any passive conjugate boundary conditions applied at node cj as follows 8 cj n p q cj h cj q i h i q cj h cj q icj h i 9 j cj c j δ v wcj δ t h cj j η cj q jcj h j h cj h cj 10 j cj i q icj h i h i in eq 8 q icj h i is the amount of supplied water allocated to conjugate node cj because the passive conjugate source or sink term is a function of head at the active node h i the diagonal j cj c j and off diagonal j cj i entries of the jacobian matrix at the passive conjugate node cj are constructed with eqs 9 and 10 respectively 2 3 2 mesh cutoff scheme a cutoff wall approach has been used to avoid over discretization when representing the internal flow barriers within the surface water and subsurface domains where the inter nodal conductance is lowered or set to be zero in the direction perpendicular to the barrier geometry hsieh and freckleton 1993 feng and molz 1997 for large scale models using relatively coarse spatial resolutions however this approach can significantly exaggerate the dimensions of these barriers thus resulting in a less representative solution in this study we implement a duplicate set of nodes representing the barriers to disconnect the upstream and downstream regions of the barrier fig 3b because the duplicate disconnecting nodes are located at the same physical locations as the original nodes explicit accounting of the barrier dimension perpendicular to the barrier is unnecessary in fig 3b each of the quadrilateral elements e 1 and e 2 consists of four nodes and two shared nodes n 2 and n 3 if a wall is constructed along a line connecting n 2 and n 3 to block water flow between e 1 and e 2 then the two elements can be numerically disconnected by adding two new nodes n 7 and n 8 to e 2 or e 1 with this numerical scheme each element is independent in that the segments along n 2 and n 3 for e 1 and n 7 and n 8 for e 2 can be treated as no flow boundary conditions 2 4 demonstrations of boundary condition linking and cutoff wall schemes three examples were selected to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes with 1 being an agricultural tile drainage system 2 a dam reservoir operation system and 3 a complex water supply and demand system the example simulations were performed on the general purpose cluster gpc operated by the scinet consortium at the university of toronto chris et al 2010 gpc consists of 3864 nodes and each node has eight 2 53 ghz intel xeon cores with 16 gb ram additionally the number of linear and nonlinear solver iterations and computing times for the simulations were estimated to evaluate the general performance of the simulations 2 4 1 model setup of tile drainage systems an example of tile drainage implemented into the hydrologic system illustrated in fig 4 includes the 1d tile 2d surface and 3d subsurface domains the tile drainage application was constructed based on sunohara et al 2015 the surface domain shown in fig 4a has an area of 4 76 km2 and a maximum width of 1 3 km ground surface elevations range from 62 1 to 68 2 m a s l with surface drainage ditches being located along the domain perimeter as a means of collecting the tile drainage the surface domain was discretized using a triangular mesh consisting of 62 967 nodes and 124 236 elements with an average element size of 38 3 m2 meshes were refined further along the ditches with a minimum area of 0 82 m2 to better represent the geometry of the ditches and to improve the numerical accuracy and stability of the flow interactions between the surface and subsurface domains the 3d subsurface domain shown in fig 4b consists of eight element layers with four soil horizons table 1 and extends vertically from ground surface to 60 m a s l with a thickness ranging approximately from 0 1 m to 6 2 m a dual continuum frey et al 2016 approach was employed to account for preferential flow through macropores in the top 0 8 m of the simulated soil profile the total number of nodes and 3d prism elements used for the subsurface domain are 952 642 and 1 604 026 respectively using 1d cylindrical line segments with a 0 1 m radius the tile drainage system shown in fig 4c was assigned at a depth of 0 8 m below ground surface draining soil water to the surface drainage ditches the number of 1d line segments used for the tile systems was 27 194 the tile outlets shown in fig 4c blue spheres were assigned with critical depth outflow boundary conditions and their conjugate boundary conditions i e linked nodes green cubes were assigned at the bottom of the ditches in the surface flow domain to route water from the tiles to the drainage ditches the physical properties assigned to all of the flow system elements are listed in table 1 initially the groundwater table was taken to be near the elevation of tile drains which are generally round 1 0 m deep and the initial surface water depth was set to be 10 4 m a constant flux boundary condition was applied to the entire surface domain representing a net precipitation rate of 110 mm yr the simulation was performed until a steady state flow condition was reached 2 4 2 model setup of dam and reservoir operation systems a demonstration example of dam and reservoir operation is based on lake minnewanka located in the south saskatchewan river basin canada fig 5 a the main objective of this demonstration is to evaluate the performance of the numerical schemes for operating the dam and reservoir systems by comparing seasonal water levels in the reservoir between simulation and observation an integrated surface subsurface hydrogeosphere model was constructed for the study area to include the 2d overland and 3d subsurface flow domains and it was parameterized using publicly available land use land cover agriculture and agri food canada 2014 and geologic data dawson et al 1994 agriculture and agri food canada 2007 the entire surface and subsurface domains consist of 20 295 nodes and 26 040 elements the overland domain shown in fig 5b includes four land cover classes i e water barren rock native grasslands and forest with their manning coefficients assigned based on mccuen 1989 as listed in table 2 the subsurface domain was simplified for this example as a homogeneous rock layer fig 5c and the hydraulic parameters describing the subsurface domain were not considered as a calibration target for this demonstration for the simulation domain of lake minnewanka the cutoff wall scheme was applied along a line segment representing the lake minnewanka dam to prevent the lake from draining water into the bow river fig 6 a an inlet node and a paired outlet node were then located at the reservoir and the downstream ends of the dam respectively fig 6a in order to simulate the dam operation for hydroelectric power generation a daily time series of the dam discharge measured from 2009 to 2010 was assigned to the inlet node since the observed minimum water level in the reservoir was 1 468 4 m a s l the dam discharge rates at the inlet node were constrained by a rule in which the discharge was linearly reduced to zero if the simulated reservoir level ranged between 1 469 0 to 1 468 4 m a s l because snow accumulation and melt play a significant role in the hydrological cycle in the study area during the winter and spring seasons with a mean precipitation of 570 mm year and a mean temperature of 2 36 c for the simulation period liquid precipitation plus snowmelt was applied as net liquid precipitation over the land surface where the rate of snowmelt was estimated using measured precipitation and temperature datasets note that evapotranspiration was not considered in this simulation details of the winter process model applied for this study can be found in aquanty inc 2019 and the parameter values for estimating the snowmelt contribution are listed in table 2 fig 6b shows the temporal changes in the snow depth and precipitation for the period from 2009 to 2010 the dam operation was simulated from january 2009 to december 2010 using a daily temporal resolution 2 4 3 model setup of water management applications with the calibrated dam operation model described in section 2 4 2 a water management problem was designed based on condon and maxwell 2013 fig 7 shows a water management system for supplying surface water and groundwater to demand sites according to allocation rules such as supply and demand priorities maximum water demand and maximum supply limits the system consists of four supplies one dam and three wells and seven demands one municipality one stream and five farms as shown in fig 7a the farms cover approximately from 0 58 to 4 60 km2 with a soil hydraulic conductivity of 1 296 m d in the farm areas the surface water supply rate from the dam varies with time which was obtained through the model calibration described in the previous section groundwater pumping at the wells is constant with a maximum capacity of 86 400 m3 d but the pumping rate starts to decrease when the watertable reaches 9 m below ground surface and then stops at a water table depth of 10 m below surface regarding the water demand the municipality has a constant demand of 17 280 m3 d but the farms potentially demand irrigation water supply of up to 129 600 m3 d for farms 1 2 4 and 5 and 86 400 m3 d for farm 3 this is when the average soil saturation at each farm drops below a threshold of 0 95 similar to the moisture dependent irrigation approach in condon and maxwell 2013 water demand for the stream is not specified but any excess supply water is allocated to the stream for the boundary conditions linked to the supplies the amount of water supplied to the stream and the farms returns to the hydrologic system but the municipality is considered as a net water consumer and thus it does not return the supplied water to the simulation domain in terms of allocation rules fig 7b the dam provides surface water supply to the municipality 1st farms 1 2nd and 5 2nd and the stream 3rd ordinal numbers in the parentheses indicate the supply priorities that water from a supplier is delivered in order to satisfy the demand request from the first to the last users note that the supply priorities for farms 1 and 5 are the same and thus the same amount of water will be allocated to them if supply is not limited well 1 supplies groundwater to farms 1 2nd 2 1st and 3 2nd well 2 contributes groundwater to farms 2 2nd 3 1st and 4 2nd and the municipality 3rd the distribution ratios for farms 2 and 4 are set to 0 5 well 3 pumps groundwater to irrigate farms 4 1st and 5 2nd and the municipality 2nd similarly the distribution ratios for farm 5 and the municipality are set to 0 5 for the water demands the municipality takes both surface and groundwater from the dam 1st and wells 2 2nd and 3 3rd respectively ordinal numbers in the parentheses indicate the demand priorities which are similar to the supply priorities farm 1 uses irrigation water from the dam 1st and well 1 2nd both farms 2 and 3 take groundwater from wells 1 1st and 2 2nd but the supply priorities to the farms are different from each other farm 4 receives groundwater from wells 2 1st and 3 2nd and farm 5 obtains surface water from the dam 1st and groundwater from well 3 2nd similar to the water management problem in condon and maxwell 2013 this study was intended to demonstrate the general water management system behaviour during water surplus and deficit conditions however instead of using an optimization tool for the water management system operation the water distribution orders for this system are simply specified based on the supply and demand priorities table 3 the supply priority is first accounted for by setting the distribution orders and then the demand priority is secondarily used if different demand points are assigned with the same supply priority e g farms 1 and 3 from well 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 tile drainage systems the steady state simulation results for the tile drainage problem are shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of the surface water depths provided in fig 8a shows that the surface water depths in the field site are negligible except for the southwestern part of the domain where no tiles are located the surface water depth along the ditch fig 8a inset is approximately 0 18 m due to the water input from the tile drainage outlets fig 8b shows that the spatial distribution of soil saturations at ground surface ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 the saturations in the northeastern area are relatively low approximately 0 78 because of the lower elevation of the drainage ditch fig 8c shows that the watertable is located approximately at the tile elevation 0 8 m from ground surface across most of the domain as expected except for the southwest region where it is relatively shallow due to the absence of drainage tiles and to the northeast near the outlet the total computing time taken to reach the steady state condition with four cores was 2515 s and the numbers of linear and nonlinear iterations were 272 and 7063 respectively the water balance with time is shown in fig 9 the flow rates at the tile drainage outlet red line increase with time from 915 to 934 m3 d because the tiles drain water from the porous medium to the ditches in the overland flow domain the total flow rate at the linked nodes assigned along the drainage ditches is exactly the same as that at the tile drainage outlet nodes as for the total inflow i e rainfall blue circles and outflow rates blue line the total outflow from the simulation domain is lower than the total inflow from the constant rainfall until the system reaches a pseudo steady state condition which takes approximately 106 days the mass balance error black dotted line is less than 10 8 m3 d based on the steady state results the total amount of water drained from the tile system is approximately 65 of the total outflow with the remainder associated with the direct contribution of groundwater to the ditch 3 2 dam and reservoir operation systems simulated water levels in the reservoir and the flow rates at the outlet nodes are compared to the measured water levels red circles and stream flow rates red triangles at the drainage outlet respectively in fig 10 a the simulated water levels in the lake show a high level of agreement with the measured water level fluctuations r2 0 98 the temporal change in the simulated flow rates at the outlet node matches well with those from the stream flow observations with an r2 of 0 88 the correlation coefficient for the flow rate is lower compared to the water level comparison because of the underestimation that occurs approximately from april to june in 2009 and 2010 gray areas in fig 10a and b it is likely that there is an additional source of water flowing into the lake during this period which was not considered in the model but the uncertainty of the simulation results is relatively high because there is no observed data for the inflow at the upstream end of the reservoir additionally for the case of simulating a dam overtopping event caused by extremely large flow input to the dam there is a limitation that the mesh cutoff scheme cannot simulate the overflow because of an assumption that the height of a cutoff wall is infinite however the dam overflow simulation can be possible if the mesh cutoff scheme is combined with the boundary condition linking method wherein the discharge flux in the dam is computed using a stage discharge function 3 3 water management applications the water management simulation was performed for two years from january 2009 to december 2010 for the simulation the time step size varied from 10 5 to 0 5 days based on the maximum changes allowed for primary variables i e groundwater depth pressure head surface water depth and saturation each farm consists of a group of three nodes assigned as passive flux boundary conditions demands which are linked to active boundary conditions at the dam and wells supplies fig 11 shows the simulated amount of water distributed to demands based on the given priority and restriction rules and the relative contribution plotted on the left y axis computed based on the percentage of the amount of water distributed from each supply relative to total demand the municipality shown in fig 11a takes water from the dam blue for most of the simulation period but groundwater pumped from well 2 green contributes to the demand by the municipality for the dry period from april to june the total cumulative contribution to the municipality is approximately 90 from the dam and 10 from well 2 similarly farm 1 takes water primarily from the dam when the soil saturation drops below the threshold 0 95 black dotted line fig 11b the simulated saturation black solid line varies from 0 95 to 0 96 the water supply time cycle for the farms is approximately 1 5 weeks but the frequency increases during the dry season because of water shortage from the dam and thus the water supply time cycle decreases to 0 92 weeks farm 1 experiences a water deficit red during the dry seasons in 2009 and 2010 fig 11b overall well 1 and the dam supply irrigation water to farm 1 in a ratio of approximately 12 and 83 respectively and the water shortage is about 5 of the total demand farm 2 receives water from wells 1 and 2 fig 11c and the irrigation demand is similar to that for farm 1 but the water deficit approximately 6 occurs during the early stage of the simulation period for the cumulative water contribution to farm 2 wells 1 and 2 supply groundwater at a ratio of approximately 70 and 24 respectively fig 11c farm 3 receives groundwater from wells 1 and 2 and its irrigation demand is about 33 lower than those of farms 1 and 2 during the dry seasons the soil saturation changes at farm 3 tend to decrease compared to the other seasons fig 11d cumulative contributions from wells 1 and 2 to farm 3 are approximately 34 and 66 respectively the water demand for farm 3 is fully satisfied without a water deficit which is different from other farms farm 4 takes irrigation water from wells 2 and 3 and because of the less sensitive saturation changes after the supply to farm 4 the irrigation demand is almost doubled compared to that for farms 1 2 and 3 farm 4 experiences a water shortage after august 2010 because of the limited groundwater production from well 3 fig 11e during the simulation period there is about a 26 water deficit at farm 4 with wells 2 and 3 contributing only 74 of the needed water the simulated water supply and soil saturation conditions of farm 5 are even less desirable than those of farm 4 specifically the average irrigation time cycle is less than 0 5 weeks and a water shortage occurs consistently during the dry seasons because of the reduced water supply from the dam for this reason the simulated average saturation at the farm drastically decreases during the dry season from june to october 2010 regarding the cumulative water contribution to farm 5 fig 11f the dam and well 3 account for 63 and 8 of the total demand respectively which indicates that farm 5 is highly dependent on the surface water supply from the dam while the water deficit reaches 29 of the total water demand fig 12 shows the temporal distribution ratios of water supply to demand mean surface water depths for the dam and groundwater depths for wells 1 2 and 3 as noted in the calibration of the dam operation system the surface water discharges during the dry seasons from april to june tend to decrease because the surface water depth at the dam becomes lower than 21 5 m however during the spring and summer seasons the dam supply capacity satisfies the maximum demands of the municipality and farm 1 all the surplus water after meeting the demands is discharged to the stream which has the lowest distribution priority for the dam the cumulative distribution ratios from the dam are 16 for the municipality 4 for farm 1 15 for farm 5 and 65 for the stream fig 12a the mean surface water depth at the dam is 24 0 m with a standard deviation of 2 m well 1 supplies groundwater to farms 1 2 and 3 with a groundwater depth threshold ranging from 9 to 10 m fig 12b the mean groundwater depth at well 1 over the simulation period is 0 8 m with a standard deviation of 1 1 m and the minimum watertable depth is 7 2 m which is higher than the threshold for pumping reduction overall well 1 supplies 66 of the total pumped groundwater to farm 2 which is assigned as the first priority for water supply and the rest of the produced groundwater is supplied to farms 1 14 and 3 20 the groundwater depth at well 2 decreases gradually until november 2009 and fluctuates more than 1 m after march 2010 because of water demand from the municipality which leads to an unstable watertable fig 12c the mean watertable depth at well 2 over the simulation period is 2 1 m with a standard deviation of 1 9 m the minimum watertable depth is 8 9 m which is close to the minimum threshold because of the unstable groundwater conditions farm 4 uses approximately 48 of the total groundwater pumped from well 2 with the rest being distributed to the municipality 6 and farms 2 17 and 3 29 although farm 4 is the second supply priority of well 2 almost half of the produced groundwater is distributed to farm 4 because the demand time frequency for farm 4 is higher than the other demand sites which are under relatively stable water supply conditions the watertable depth behaviour at well 3 is similar to well 2 but the groundwater system at the well is a less dependable source compared to other wells because the water depth can be readily drawn down to the minimum supply threshold fig 12d it is noted that the watertable depth during the first week of july 2010 changes by approximately 8 m and the large groundwater fluctuation is a result of notable net precipitation input after about six months of dry conditions during the simulation period well 3 supplies groundwater to farms 4 and 5 and the municipality according to the rules but the main demand points are farms 4 and 5 because the water demand of the municipality is satisfied by the supply from the dam and well 2 3 4 a comment on efficiency improvements the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes implemented here were successfully demonstrated with the tile drainage dam and reservoir operation examples and the complex water management case the numerical methods are applicable to other surface and subsurface models specifically the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes can be applied to 1d i e line segment 2d i e triangle and rectangle and 3d i e tetrahedron hexahedron and prism meshes therefore the applicability of the numerical methods can be expanded to any surface or integrated surface subsurface model using finite difference element volume methods with 1d 2d and 3d mesh types in order to evaluate the computational efficiency of the mesh cutoff scheme we analyzed two cases the lake minnewanka simulation without the mesh cutoff scheme without case in which the dam structure was explicitly assigned in the mesh as illustrated in fig 2b the the number of nonlinear i e newton linear i e bicgstab sparse matrix iterations and total computing time were compared to those obtained from the simulation with the mesh cutoff scheme with case the number of nonlinear newton iterations for the dam operation simulation was 9845 827 s for the with case and 10 616 887 s for the without case thus indicating that the nonlinear iterations are reduced by 7 3 6 8 using the new numerical scheme numbers in the parentheses correspond to the total computing time similarly the number of linear solver iterations for the with and without cases were 340 060 and 358 680 respectively therefore the computing efficiency for the with case is approximately 5 2 higher than the without case although the gain in computing efficiency for this demonstration example was relatively modest due to the numerically simple simulation conditions it is expected that the computing efficiency will increase as the number of degree of freedom increases and with a more complexity nonlinear problem 4 summary and conclusions engineered hydrologic control structures are commonly used to re distribute water in space and time in order to maximize the value of water and to minimize the risks associated with water misuse this study presents a boundary condition linking and a mesh cutoff scheme for the effective and simple representation of hydrologic control structures in integrated hydrologic models in the numerical schemes developed here a boundary condition applied to one location is paired with its conjugate at other locations with the same intensity but different sign linking and a set of nodes are duplicated for blocking water movement within the domain interior with these numerical schemes an integrated hydrologic modelling analysis can be performed without modifying the mesh for discrete representation of the control structures two illustrative examples were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested numerical schemes a tile drainage system where 1d tiles were used to drain water from a 3d subsurface domain to a 2d surface ditch and a controlled dam operation system in western canada for the tile drainage example the difficulty in discretizing the details of the tile geometry at its outlet to the surface drainage ditch was overcome by pairing the tile outlets located within the subsurface domain with their conjugates located in the surface domain additionally to overcome cases where there are constraints on mesh resolution for discretizing control structures the cutoff wall and boundary condition linking schemes were applied to reservoir operations for lake minnewanka located in the south saskatchewan river basin canada the simulated results agree well with the observations during the simulation period as a proof of concept a simulation involving typical water management practices was performed to demonstrate the robustness of our numerical approach to handle complex water supply and demand systems that are controlled by dynamic water management rules and schedules the results of the water management applications show that the suggested numerical schemes are useful and effective for complex supply and demand decision making problems in integrated hydrosystems regarding the limitations of this study as stated in each demonstration section it is noted that the mesh sizes and calibrations of the example simulations were simplified for the demonstration purposes additionally there are limitations on the functionalities of the numerical schemes although there are tractable workarounds the mesh cutoff scheme cannot directly simulate dam or weir overflow because of the break on connectivity between elements therefore further study on methods to improve the functionality of the methods proposed herein is warranted acknowledgements computations were performed on the general purpose cluster at the

6412,hydrologic control structures are designed to connect or disconnect water movement in natural surface water groundwater systems and it is important to represent these features effectively within a finite difference element model without over discretization this study presents efficient numerical schemes for operating water allocation and water rights systems in integrated hydrosystem models we developed a numerical scheme for representing these structures directly within integrated surface subsurface hydrologic models by creating boundary condition links to route water through control

groundwater pumping wells and demand farms municipality and stream highlights how the numerical schemes for water management operations can be used to optimize surface water and groundwater extraction and distribution using a fully integrated model keywords integrated surface subsurface model water management hydrologic control structures boundary condition link mesh cutoff tile drainage 1 introduction appropriate management strategies are essential to maximize the value of water resources and to mitigate the risks associated with water misappropriation dillon 2005 panday et al 2009 cao et al 2013 these water management practices are often required to simultaneously consider various components of the water cycle involving the atmosphere land surface and subsurface as they are frequently designed to re distribute water from one flow system to another davison et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 management activities such as groundwater pumping for water supply and irrigation and storage in surface and subsurface reservoirs can also significantly influence the natural water cycle therefore implementation and operation of water resource infrastructure for municipal industrial and agricultural applications needs to take into account a wide range of processes and their interactions panday et al 2009 gorelick and zheng 2015 wu et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 an integrated hydrologic analysis incorporating multiple hydrosystem components into a single integrated system is therefore essential for holistic water resource management kollet and maxwell 2008 refsgaard et al 2010 rassam 2011 rassam et al 2013 davison et al 2015 with the growing realization that fully integrated hydrologic models have the ability to provide a more holistic representation of the terrestrial water cycle and given the increasing application of these models at larger spatial scales chen 2015 hwang et al 2015 condon and maxwell 2017 hwang et al 2018 there is a growing need to develop efficient upscaling approaches berg and sudicky 2019 not only for the representation of physical parameters but also for the representation of water management activities incorporation of physically based water management activities and features such as artificial subsurface drainage systems flow control weirs reservoirs dams and injection extraction systems for groundwater recharge into integrated surface water groundwater hydrologic simulations requires an effective and efficient representation of hydrologic control structures and their operation within a finite element or finite difference framework for the modhms fully integrated surface subsurface flow and transport model panday and huyakorn 2004 panday et al 2009 developed a water supply system wss module that links water and solute sources to their end uses in order to analyze water re distribution and cl loading associated with land use changes additionally water management solvers including operational analysis and optimization tools have been combined with hydrologic numerical simulators to improve the efficiency of the operation of hydrologic control structures valerio et al 2010 condon and maxwell 2013 brookfield et al 2016 brookfield and gnau 2016 dogrul et al 2016 morway et al 2016 condon and maxwell 2013 implemented an optimization solver into parflow maxwell et al 2010 a fully integrated surface subsurface model for a case study focusing on the optimal allocation of groundwater and surface water for consumptive and irrigation demand similarly brookfield and gnau 2016 performed basin scale surface water management analysis using oasis operational analysis and simulation of integrated systems hydrologics 2009 and hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2015 an integrated surface subsurface model in the aforementioned studies hydrologic models were used to inform the operational analysis and optimization algorithms on the current state of the hydrologic system and to forecast system changes in response to management decisions an additional example of surface water groundwater water management tools that link groundwater and surface water flow models through time lagging or iterative coupling is the modflow farm process mf fmp module which was applied by hanson et al 2010 and hanson et al 2012 to simulate conjunctive water management in the central valley california usa although there are several limitations on runoff and variably saturated flow conditions mf fmp is currently one of the most comprehensive water management modelling tools that couples groundwater and surface water hanson et al 2010 specifically mf fmp couples hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation groundwater uptake evapotranspiration and surface subsurface return flows schmid and hanson 2009 for the numerical approaches applied to the water management practices mentioned above the allocation and re distribution of water resources within the hydrologic models was primarily achieved by linking or pairing flux boundary conditions which connect sinks to sources or vice versa among anthropogenic features that influence groundwater surface water partitioning agricultural tile drains are perhaps the most ubiquitous in many parts of north america and europe capability to simulate tile drains has been implemented in hydrogeosphere macquarrie and sudicky 1996 and subsequently applied to integrated surface subsurface models rozemeijer et al 2010 frey et al 2012 de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 to account for the influence of tile drainage on both the groundwater and surface water systems in some cases tile drain networks were represented as seepage nodes or high conductivity porous media in order to simplify the problem such that large model domains can be represented de schepper et al 2015 in addition to subsurface drainage holistic modelling of integrated water management systems also necessitates that engineered barriers that restrict and control surface water flow e g dams floodgates and dikes are represented for which a numerical scheme has not yet been implemented in fully integrated surface subsurface models dam operation software tools have however already been explicitly linked to groundwater flow models and prescribed dam discharges have been used to compute dynamic changes in reservoir water levels in integrated surface subsurface systems valerio et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 brookfield et al 2016 in order to manage and re distribute water within a holistically simulated water resources system a reliable and efficient representation of drains and water management structures is an important component of the analysis because these features often significantly interrupt natural flow conditions however it is also known that these simulations can become computationally expensive when using high resolution three dimensional 3d unstructured meshes that discretize the internal geometric constraints required to represent the control structures shepherd and johnson 2008 durand riard et al 2010 shepherd et al 2010 accordingly the purpose of this study is to present a methodology that overcomes this computational obstacle with an effective and efficient way of representing these structures directly within a fully integrated hydrologic model specifically this study describes a computationally cost effective numerical strategy to implement boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes and demonstrates the utility of these numerical schemes for complex water management systems involving agricultural tile drainage reservoir operations and watershed management 2 method 2 1 illustrative numerical schemes for water management two examples were selected to demonstrate the necessity and advantage of using the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes 1 subsurface tile drainage and 2 dam reservoir operation systems for the first example the boundary condition linking implemented here is similar to those used in previous studies panday et al 2009 condon and maxwell 2013 but it is noted that the linking scheme is not just limited for connecting sources with sink boundary conditions in that its applicability is expanded to other engineering structures that are in some cases geometrically or numerically difficult to represent in an integrated system e g tile drains artificial channels pipelines reservoirs etc in agriculture tile drainage systems as shown in fig 1 a are used to remove excess subsurface water from fields and to provide an optimal soil moisture condition for crop growth and field trafficking frey et al 2013 de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 models based on an integrated surface subsurface framework are illustrated in fig 1b and 1c for case 1 fig 1b where a one dimensional 1d tile drain red lines is implemented in a 3d domain consisting of vertically structured meshes the location of the tile drain outlet blue triangle depends on the topography of the domain indicating that the drain outlet location is dependent on the mesh structure i e node elevation because the tile outlet is usually located at the lowest elevation of the drainage system the groundwater level is highly dependent on the outlet elevation moreover the temporal response of the surface water flow system in the stream receiving the tile drainage is also affected by the lowered groundwater level which may lead to misleading simulation results however the drain outlet for case 2 as shown in fig 1c is flexibly linked to a node in the surface domain gray area which is the linked node blue square the linked node can be assigned anywhere in the surface and subsurface domains using the boundary condition linking scheme for the second example in order to simulate water volume and level changes in a reservoir the physical properties of the engineering barriers are required model input fig 2 a however if there is limited information related to the flow barriers one of the easiest ways to achieve the structural representation of the feature is to increase the surface node elevation to mimic the barriers this may be an alternative solution for the surface flow simulation to restrict flow but it also requires additional work such as mesh refinement in order to conform to the structural dimensions of the barriers more importantly for integrated surface subsurface modelling the alternative solution may not be reasonable because the top layer of a subsurface domain is connected to the surface domain and thus unnecessary assumptions pertaining to the subsurface properties could be imposed on the simulation fig 2b regarding numerical schemes for representing engineered flow barriers the horizontal flow barrier hfb package for use with modflow was implemented by hsieh and freckleton 1993 for groundwater flow modelling the hfb package is controlled by adjusting the hydraulic conductance between cells or elements which may be useful for representing barriers in surface flow domains but it also requires physical properties of the structures for impervious barriers fig 2a the surface barrier structure can be simply represented using the cutoff wall scheme which does not require specification of the physical properties of the structures fig 2c 2 2 integrated hydrologic analysis mathematical formulations for a fully integrated hydrosystem when attempting to simultaneously consider the myriad of physical processes in the various flow compartments dimensional simplification is sometimes unavoidable in the numerical solution procedure for example flow within pumping wells tile drains and rivers are often simplified as 1d flow domains averaged over their cross sections and overland flow is described by a two dimensional 2d depth averaged equation although there are many variations fluid flow in integrated hydrologic systems can be symbolically described using the following simplified equation as 1 a 1 d q 1 d d 2 d q 2 d q 3 d i q i δ x x i t v w 1 v w 2 v w 3 where q 1 d is the flux along the axis of the 1d flow features e g tiles wells channels etc averaged over their cross sectional area a 1 d q 2 d is the flux along the 2d surface flow domain averaged over the water depth or width d 2 d q 3 d is the 3d flux within the 3d flow domain e g porous subsurface the divergence operators for the 1d 2d and 3d domains are and respectively and q i δ x x i is a source or sink representing the rate of water being introduced into or extracted at location x i the right hand side represents the change in storage over all the flow systems 1d flow along tile drains pipes or channels q 1 d can be described using such constitutive equations as the hagen poiseuille analytic method or the manning or hazen williams empirical formulae similarly manning s formula can be used to describe 2d overland fluxes q 2 d and darcy s law can describe 3d subsurface flow q 3 d the amount of water within a control volume under variably saturated subsurface flow is generally described by the degree of water saturation and the porous medium s compressible storage see brunner and simmons 2012 hwang et al 2014 and aquanty inc 2019 for details regarding the hydrogeosphere description and mathematical formulations 2 2 1 boundary condition linking scheme water management and control structures are operated to adjust natural flow systems and to re distribute water in order to best satisfy water demands while minimizing adverse risks fig 3 a illustrates a simple example of the re distribution of water in an integrated hydrologic system an artificial groundwater recharge and recovery system where surface water is re distributed into the subsurface for later recovery in this example pumping from the surface reservoir needs to be represented as an active flux boundary condition the pumping rate is a decision variable while a passive injection condition is applied to the recharge well with the rate being specified by its conjugate pumping condition pumping in a recovery well will then remove water from the aquifer the boundary conditions to represent these control structures thus can be generalized as 2 i q i δ x x i i n ext q i δ x x i ext i n c q i δ x x i δ x x cj where n ext is the number of sources or sinks at x x i ext which are associated with the external components of the system n c is the number of control structures operated at x x i which is linked to its passive conjugate node at x x cj for a multi purpose water supply system the number of passive conjugate nodes linked to the supply is determined based on the number of demand points e g one pumping well supplies groundwater to two farms and one city which requires three conjugate nodes it is noted that q i is often a function of dependent variables such as groundwater heads and subsurface water saturations h and s w and water depths in the surface flow system d additionally for the case of dam operations the flux value for q i can be flexibly computed using either the power rating curve or a user defined stage discharge table as the interactions between the natural hydrologic system and human induced perturbations increase more boundary conditions are needed to be paired numerically in a case where a closed system is considered all natural and anthropogenic water transfers are linked within a hydrologic system and thus the number of external sources or sinks can be zero n ext 0 2 2 2 mesh cutoff scheme when an artificial barrier is used to interrupt the natural water flow at a location x b for 1d domain along a segment δ a in a 2d domain or across a face δ v in 3d an internal zero flux condition needs to be applied at the location as 3 q 1 d x x b 0 or q 2 d n δ a 0 or q 3 d n δ v 0 where n δ a and n δ v represent 2d and 3d vectors normal to the segment δ a and the face δ v respectively forcing a zero flux condition within the domain at a point along a segment or across a face can generate a large hydraulic gradient fig 3b 2 3 numerical representation of operational structures 2 3 1 boundary condition linking scheme for the numerical solution of the integrated hydrological model hydrogeosphere the numerical discretization with a control volume approach can be represented using the following simplified form 4 j η i q ji h i h j q i h i cj n p q cj h cj δ v wi δ t i 1 2 n where q ji is the rate of water flow from the control volume associated with the discrete location node j to i and is a function of the state at the location and the difference of the states between two points e g heads h i a n d h j η i represents a set of nodes connected to the node i q i represents an active source or sink associated with node i and often it is a function of the state variables at the node e g head and water depth n p is the number of the passive nodes linked to the active node q cj is a passive conjugate source or sink associated with any node cj other than node i cj i v wi is the amount of water within the control volume associated with the active node i and n is the number of degrees of freedom used to discretize the domain similar to the work performed by hwang et al 2014 this system of nonlinear equations can be solved using newton successive linearization as 5 r i h i h j s h cj δ v wi δ t j η i q ji h i h j q i h i cj n p q cj h cj i 1 2 n 6 h l 1 h l δ h l l 1 2 3 n 7 δ h l j l 1 r l w h e r e j l r l h l where the r i is the i th component of the residual vector r h is the state vector l is the iteration count for the newton iterative procedure and j is the jacobian matrix because an accurate evaluation of the jacobian matrix can improve the computing efficiency of the newton method the sparsity structure of the jacobian matrix needs to be revised to account for any passive conjugate boundary conditions applied at node cj as follows 8 cj n p q cj h cj q i h i q cj h cj q icj h i 9 j cj c j δ v wcj δ t h cj j η cj q jcj h j h cj h cj 10 j cj i q icj h i h i in eq 8 q icj h i is the amount of supplied water allocated to conjugate node cj because the passive conjugate source or sink term is a function of head at the active node h i the diagonal j cj c j and off diagonal j cj i entries of the jacobian matrix at the passive conjugate node cj are constructed with eqs 9 and 10 respectively 2 3 2 mesh cutoff scheme a cutoff wall approach has been used to avoid over discretization when representing the internal flow barriers within the surface water and subsurface domains where the inter nodal conductance is lowered or set to be zero in the direction perpendicular to the barrier geometry hsieh and freckleton 1993 feng and molz 1997 for large scale models using relatively coarse spatial resolutions however this approach can significantly exaggerate the dimensions of these barriers thus resulting in a less representative solution in this study we implement a duplicate set of nodes representing the barriers to disconnect the upstream and downstream regions of the barrier fig 3b because the duplicate disconnecting nodes are located at the same physical locations as the original nodes explicit accounting of the barrier dimension perpendicular to the barrier is unnecessary in fig 3b each of the quadrilateral elements e 1 and e 2 consists of four nodes and two shared nodes n 2 and n 3 if a wall is constructed along a line connecting n 2 and n 3 to block water flow between e 1 and e 2 then the two elements can be numerically disconnected by adding two new nodes n 7 and n 8 to e 2 or e 1 with this numerical scheme each element is independent in that the segments along n 2 and n 3 for e 1 and n 7 and n 8 for e 2 can be treated as no flow boundary conditions 2 4 demonstrations of boundary condition linking and cutoff wall schemes three examples were selected to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes with 1 being an agricultural tile drainage system 2 a dam reservoir operation system and 3 a complex water supply and demand system the example simulations were performed on the general purpose cluster gpc operated by the scinet consortium at the university of toronto chris et al 2010 gpc consists of 3864 nodes and each node has eight 2 53 ghz intel xeon cores with 16 gb ram additionally the number of linear and nonlinear solver iterations and computing times for the simulations were estimated to evaluate the general performance of the simulations 2 4 1 model setup of tile drainage systems an example of tile drainage implemented into the hydrologic system illustrated in fig 4 includes the 1d tile 2d surface and 3d subsurface domains the tile drainage application was constructed based on sunohara et al 2015 the surface domain shown in fig 4a has an area of 4 76 km2 and a maximum width of 1 3 km ground surface elevations range from 62 1 to 68 2 m a s l with surface drainage ditches being located along the domain perimeter as a means of collecting the tile drainage the surface domain was discretized using a triangular mesh consisting of 62 967 nodes and 124 236 elements with an average element size of 38 3 m2 meshes were refined further along the ditches with a minimum area of 0 82 m2 to better represent the geometry of the ditches and to improve the numerical accuracy and stability of the flow interactions between the surface and subsurface domains the 3d subsurface domain shown in fig 4b consists of eight element layers with four soil horizons table 1 and extends vertically from ground surface to 60 m a s l with a thickness ranging approximately from 0 1 m to 6 2 m a dual continuum frey et al 2016 approach was employed to account for preferential flow through macropores in the top 0 8 m of the simulated soil profile the total number of nodes and 3d prism elements used for the subsurface domain are 952 642 and 1 604 026 respectively using 1d cylindrical line segments with a 0 1 m radius the tile drainage system shown in fig 4c was assigned at a depth of 0 8 m below ground surface draining soil water to the surface drainage ditches the number of 1d line segments used for the tile systems was 27 194 the tile outlets shown in fig 4c blue spheres were assigned with critical depth outflow boundary conditions and their conjugate boundary conditions i e linked nodes green cubes were assigned at the bottom of the ditches in the surface flow domain to route water from the tiles to the drainage ditches the physical properties assigned to all of the flow system elements are listed in table 1 initially the groundwater table was taken to be near the elevation of tile drains which are generally round 1 0 m deep and the initial surface water depth was set to be 10 4 m a constant flux boundary condition was applied to the entire surface domain representing a net precipitation rate of 110 mm yr the simulation was performed until a steady state flow condition was reached 2 4 2 model setup of dam and reservoir operation systems a demonstration example of dam and reservoir operation is based on lake minnewanka located in the south saskatchewan river basin canada fig 5 a the main objective of this demonstration is to evaluate the performance of the numerical schemes for operating the dam and reservoir systems by comparing seasonal water levels in the reservoir between simulation and observation an integrated surface subsurface hydrogeosphere model was constructed for the study area to include the 2d overland and 3d subsurface flow domains and it was parameterized using publicly available land use land cover agriculture and agri food canada 2014 and geologic data dawson et al 1994 agriculture and agri food canada 2007 the entire surface and subsurface domains consist of 20 295 nodes and 26 040 elements the overland domain shown in fig 5b includes four land cover classes i e water barren rock native grasslands and forest with their manning coefficients assigned based on mccuen 1989 as listed in table 2 the subsurface domain was simplified for this example as a homogeneous rock layer fig 5c and the hydraulic parameters describing the subsurface domain were not considered as a calibration target for this demonstration for the simulation domain of lake minnewanka the cutoff wall scheme was applied along a line segment representing the lake minnewanka dam to prevent the lake from draining water into the bow river fig 6 a an inlet node and a paired outlet node were then located at the reservoir and the downstream ends of the dam respectively fig 6a in order to simulate the dam operation for hydroelectric power generation a daily time series of the dam discharge measured from 2009 to 2010 was assigned to the inlet node since the observed minimum water level in the reservoir was 1 468 4 m a s l the dam discharge rates at the inlet node were constrained by a rule in which the discharge was linearly reduced to zero if the simulated reservoir level ranged between 1 469 0 to 1 468 4 m a s l because snow accumulation and melt play a significant role in the hydrological cycle in the study area during the winter and spring seasons with a mean precipitation of 570 mm year and a mean temperature of 2 36 c for the simulation period liquid precipitation plus snowmelt was applied as net liquid precipitation over the land surface where the rate of snowmelt was estimated using measured precipitation and temperature datasets note that evapotranspiration was not considered in this simulation details of the winter process model applied for this study can be found in aquanty inc 2019 and the parameter values for estimating the snowmelt contribution are listed in table 2 fig 6b shows the temporal changes in the snow depth and precipitation for the period from 2009 to 2010 the dam operation was simulated from january 2009 to december 2010 using a daily temporal resolution 2 4 3 model setup of water management applications with the calibrated dam operation model described in section 2 4 2 a water management problem was designed based on condon and maxwell 2013 fig 7 shows a water management system for supplying surface water and groundwater to demand sites according to allocation rules such as supply and demand priorities maximum water demand and maximum supply limits the system consists of four supplies one dam and three wells and seven demands one municipality one stream and five farms as shown in fig 7a the farms cover approximately from 0 58 to 4 60 km2 with a soil hydraulic conductivity of 1 296 m d in the farm areas the surface water supply rate from the dam varies with time which was obtained through the model calibration described in the previous section groundwater pumping at the wells is constant with a maximum capacity of 86 400 m3 d but the pumping rate starts to decrease when the watertable reaches 9 m below ground surface and then stops at a water table depth of 10 m below surface regarding the water demand the municipality has a constant demand of 17 280 m3 d but the farms potentially demand irrigation water supply of up to 129 600 m3 d for farms 1 2 4 and 5 and 86 400 m3 d for farm 3 this is when the average soil saturation at each farm drops below a threshold of 0 95 similar to the moisture dependent irrigation approach in condon and maxwell 2013 water demand for the stream is not specified but any excess supply water is allocated to the stream for the boundary conditions linked to the supplies the amount of water supplied to the stream and the farms returns to the hydrologic system but the municipality is considered as a net water consumer and thus it does not return the supplied water to the simulation domain in terms of allocation rules fig 7b the dam provides surface water supply to the municipality 1st farms 1 2nd and 5 2nd and the stream 3rd ordinal numbers in the parentheses indicate the supply priorities that water from a supplier is delivered in order to satisfy the demand request from the first to the last users note that the supply priorities for farms 1 and 5 are the same and thus the same amount of water will be allocated to them if supply is not limited well 1 supplies groundwater to farms 1 2nd 2 1st and 3 2nd well 2 contributes groundwater to farms 2 2nd 3 1st and 4 2nd and the municipality 3rd the distribution ratios for farms 2 and 4 are set to 0 5 well 3 pumps groundwater to irrigate farms 4 1st and 5 2nd and the municipality 2nd similarly the distribution ratios for farm 5 and the municipality are set to 0 5 for the water demands the municipality takes both surface and groundwater from the dam 1st and wells 2 2nd and 3 3rd respectively ordinal numbers in the parentheses indicate the demand priorities which are similar to the supply priorities farm 1 uses irrigation water from the dam 1st and well 1 2nd both farms 2 and 3 take groundwater from wells 1 1st and 2 2nd but the supply priorities to the farms are different from each other farm 4 receives groundwater from wells 2 1st and 3 2nd and farm 5 obtains surface water from the dam 1st and groundwater from well 3 2nd similar to the water management problem in condon and maxwell 2013 this study was intended to demonstrate the general water management system behaviour during water surplus and deficit conditions however instead of using an optimization tool for the water management system operation the water distribution orders for this system are simply specified based on the supply and demand priorities table 3 the supply priority is first accounted for by setting the distribution orders and then the demand priority is secondarily used if different demand points are assigned with the same supply priority e g farms 1 and 3 from well 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 tile drainage systems the steady state simulation results for the tile drainage problem are shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of the surface water depths provided in fig 8a shows that the surface water depths in the field site are negligible except for the southwestern part of the domain where no tiles are located the surface water depth along the ditch fig 8a inset is approximately 0 18 m due to the water input from the tile drainage outlets fig 8b shows that the spatial distribution of soil saturations at ground surface ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 the saturations in the northeastern area are relatively low approximately 0 78 because of the lower elevation of the drainage ditch fig 8c shows that the watertable is located approximately at the tile elevation 0 8 m from ground surface across most of the domain as expected except for the southwest region where it is relatively shallow due to the absence of drainage tiles and to the northeast near the outlet the total computing time taken to reach the steady state condition with four cores was 2515 s and the numbers of linear and nonlinear iterations were 272 and 7063 respectively the water balance with time is shown in fig 9 the flow rates at the tile drainage outlet red line increase with time from 915 to 934 m3 d because the tiles drain water from the porous medium to the ditches in the overland flow domain the total flow rate at the linked nodes assigned along the drainage ditches is exactly the same as that at the tile drainage outlet nodes as for the total inflow i e rainfall blue circles and outflow rates blue line the total outflow from the simulation domain is lower than the total inflow from the constant rainfall until the system reaches a pseudo steady state condition which takes approximately 106 days the mass balance error black dotted line is less than 10 8 m3 d based on the steady state results the total amount of water drained from the tile system is approximately 65 of the total outflow with the remainder associated with the direct contribution of groundwater to the ditch 3 2 dam and reservoir operation systems simulated water levels in the reservoir and the flow rates at the outlet nodes are compared to the measured water levels red circles and stream flow rates red triangles at the drainage outlet respectively in fig 10 a the simulated water levels in the lake show a high level of agreement with the measured water level fluctuations r2 0 98 the temporal change in the simulated flow rates at the outlet node matches well with those from the stream flow observations with an r2 of 0 88 the correlation coefficient for the flow rate is lower compared to the water level comparison because of the underestimation that occurs approximately from april to june in 2009 and 2010 gray areas in fig 10a and b it is likely that there is an additional source of water flowing into the lake during this period which was not considered in the model but the uncertainty of the simulation results is relatively high because there is no observed data for the inflow at the upstream end of the reservoir additionally for the case of simulating a dam overtopping event caused by extremely large flow input to the dam there is a limitation that the mesh cutoff scheme cannot simulate the overflow because of an assumption that the height of a cutoff wall is infinite however the dam overflow simulation can be possible if the mesh cutoff scheme is combined with the boundary condition linking method wherein the discharge flux in the dam is computed using a stage discharge function 3 3 water management applications the water management simulation was performed for two years from january 2009 to december 2010 for the simulation the time step size varied from 10 5 to 0 5 days based on the maximum changes allowed for primary variables i e groundwater depth pressure head surface water depth and saturation each farm consists of a group of three nodes assigned as passive flux boundary conditions demands which are linked to active boundary conditions at the dam and wells supplies fig 11 shows the simulated amount of water distributed to demands based on the given priority and restriction rules and the relative contribution plotted on the left y axis computed based on the percentage of the amount of water distributed from each supply relative to total demand the municipality shown in fig 11a takes water from the dam blue for most of the simulation period but groundwater pumped from well 2 green contributes to the demand by the municipality for the dry period from april to june the total cumulative contribution to the municipality is approximately 90 from the dam and 10 from well 2 similarly farm 1 takes water primarily from the dam when the soil saturation drops below the threshold 0 95 black dotted line fig 11b the simulated saturation black solid line varies from 0 95 to 0 96 the water supply time cycle for the farms is approximately 1 5 weeks but the frequency increases during the dry season because of water shortage from the dam and thus the water supply time cycle decreases to 0 92 weeks farm 1 experiences a water deficit red during the dry seasons in 2009 and 2010 fig 11b overall well 1 and the dam supply irrigation water to farm 1 in a ratio of approximately 12 and 83 respectively and the water shortage is about 5 of the total demand farm 2 receives water from wells 1 and 2 fig 11c and the irrigation demand is similar to that for farm 1 but the water deficit approximately 6 occurs during the early stage of the simulation period for the cumulative water contribution to farm 2 wells 1 and 2 supply groundwater at a ratio of approximately 70 and 24 respectively fig 11c farm 3 receives groundwater from wells 1 and 2 and its irrigation demand is about 33 lower than those of farms 1 and 2 during the dry seasons the soil saturation changes at farm 3 tend to decrease compared to the other seasons fig 11d cumulative contributions from wells 1 and 2 to farm 3 are approximately 34 and 66 respectively the water demand for farm 3 is fully satisfied without a water deficit which is different from other farms farm 4 takes irrigation water from wells 2 and 3 and because of the less sensitive saturation changes after the supply to farm 4 the irrigation demand is almost doubled compared to that for farms 1 2 and 3 farm 4 experiences a water shortage after august 2010 because of the limited groundwater production from well 3 fig 11e during the simulation period there is about a 26 water deficit at farm 4 with wells 2 and 3 contributing only 74 of the needed water the simulated water supply and soil saturation conditions of farm 5 are even less desirable than those of farm 4 specifically the average irrigation time cycle is less than 0 5 weeks and a water shortage occurs consistently during the dry seasons because of the reduced water supply from the dam for this reason the simulated average saturation at the farm drastically decreases during the dry season from june to october 2010 regarding the cumulative water contribution to farm 5 fig 11f the dam and well 3 account for 63 and 8 of the total demand respectively which indicates that farm 5 is highly dependent on the surface water supply from the dam while the water deficit reaches 29 of the total water demand fig 12 shows the temporal distribution ratios of water supply to demand mean surface water depths for the dam and groundwater depths for wells 1 2 and 3 as noted in the calibration of the dam operation system the surface water discharges during the dry seasons from april to june tend to decrease because the surface water depth at the dam becomes lower than 21 5 m however during the spring and summer seasons the dam supply capacity satisfies the maximum demands of the municipality and farm 1 all the surplus water after meeting the demands is discharged to the stream which has the lowest distribution priority for the dam the cumulative distribution ratios from the dam are 16 for the municipality 4 for farm 1 15 for farm 5 and 65 for the stream fig 12a the mean surface water depth at the dam is 24 0 m with a standard deviation of 2 m well 1 supplies groundwater to farms 1 2 and 3 with a groundwater depth threshold ranging from 9 to 10 m fig 12b the mean groundwater depth at well 1 over the simulation period is 0 8 m with a standard deviation of 1 1 m and the minimum watertable depth is 7 2 m which is higher than the threshold for pumping reduction overall well 1 supplies 66 of the total pumped groundwater to farm 2 which is assigned as the first priority for water supply and the rest of the produced groundwater is supplied to farms 1 14 and 3 20 the groundwater depth at well 2 decreases gradually until november 2009 and fluctuates more than 1 m after march 2010 because of water demand from the municipality which leads to an unstable watertable fig 12c the mean watertable depth at well 2 over the simulation period is 2 1 m with a standard deviation of 1 9 m the minimum watertable depth is 8 9 m which is close to the minimum threshold because of the unstable groundwater conditions farm 4 uses approximately 48 of the total groundwater pumped from well 2 with the rest being distributed to the municipality 6 and farms 2 17 and 3 29 although farm 4 is the second supply priority of well 2 almost half of the produced groundwater is distributed to farm 4 because the demand time frequency for farm 4 is higher than the other demand sites which are under relatively stable water supply conditions the watertable depth behaviour at well 3 is similar to well 2 but the groundwater system at the well is a less dependable source compared to other wells because the water depth can be readily drawn down to the minimum supply threshold fig 12d it is noted that the watertable depth during the first week of july 2010 changes by approximately 8 m and the large groundwater fluctuation is a result of notable net precipitation input after about six months of dry conditions during the simulation period well 3 supplies groundwater to farms 4 and 5 and the municipality according to the rules but the main demand points are farms 4 and 5 because the water demand of the municipality is satisfied by the supply from the dam and well 2 3 4 a comment on efficiency improvements the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes implemented here were successfully demonstrated with the tile drainage dam and reservoir operation examples and the complex water management case the numerical methods are applicable to other surface and subsurface models specifically the boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes can be applied to 1d i e line segment 2d i e triangle and rectangle and 3d i e tetrahedron hexahedron and prism meshes therefore the applicability of the numerical methods can be expanded to any surface or integrated surface subsurface model using finite difference element volume methods with 1d 2d and 3d mesh types in order to evaluate the computational efficiency of the mesh cutoff scheme we analyzed two cases the lake minnewanka simulation without the mesh cutoff scheme without case in which the dam structure was explicitly assigned in the mesh as illustrated in fig 2b the the number of nonlinear i e newton linear i e bicgstab sparse matrix iterations and total computing time were compared to those obtained from the simulation with the mesh cutoff scheme with case the number of nonlinear newton iterations for the dam operation simulation was 9845 827 s for the with case and 10 616 887 s for the without case thus indicating that the nonlinear iterations are reduced by 7 3 6 8 using the new numerical scheme numbers in the parentheses correspond to the total computing time similarly the number of linear solver iterations for the with and without cases were 340 060 and 358 680 respectively therefore the computing efficiency for the with case is approximately 5 2 higher than the without case although the gain in computing efficiency for this demonstration example was relatively modest due to the numerically simple simulation conditions it is expected that the computing efficiency will increase as the number of degree of freedom increases and with a more complexity nonlinear problem 4 summary and conclusions engineered hydrologic control structures are commonly used to re distribute water in space and time in order to maximize the value of water and to minimize the risks associated with water misuse this study presents a boundary condition linking and a mesh cutoff scheme for the effective and simple representation of hydrologic control structures in integrated hydrologic models in the numerical schemes developed here a boundary condition applied to one location is paired with its conjugate at other locations with the same intensity but different sign linking and a set of nodes are duplicated for blocking water movement within the domain interior with these numerical schemes an integrated hydrologic modelling analysis can be performed without modifying the mesh for discrete representation of the control structures two illustrative examples were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested numerical schemes a tile drainage system where 1d tiles were used to drain water from a 3d subsurface domain to a 2d surface ditch and a controlled dam operation system in western canada for the tile drainage example the difficulty in discretizing the details of the tile geometry at its outlet to the surface drainage ditch was overcome by pairing the tile outlets located within the subsurface domain with their conjugates located in the surface domain additionally to overcome cases where there are constraints on mesh resolution for discretizing control structures the cutoff wall and boundary condition linking schemes were applied to reservoir operations for lake minnewanka located in the south saskatchewan river basin canada the simulated results agree well with the observations during the simulation period as a proof of concept a simulation involving typical water management practices was performed to demonstrate the robustness of our numerical approach to handle complex water supply and demand systems that are controlled by dynamic water management rules and schedules the results of the water management applications show that the suggested numerical schemes are useful and effective for complex supply and demand decision making problems in integrated hydrosystems regarding the limitations of this study as stated in each demonstration section it is noted that the mesh sizes and calibrations of the example simulations were simplified for the demonstration purposes additionally there are limitations on the functionalities of the numerical schemes although there are tractable workarounds the mesh cutoff scheme cannot directly simulate dam or weir overflow because of the break on connectivity between elements therefore further study on methods to improve the functionality of the methods proposed herein is warranted acknowledgements computations were performed on the general purpose cluster at the

6413,intensity duration frequency idf curves are important tools for hydraulic and hydrologic design considering that there are different approaches to obtain the rainfall quantiles on which the idf curves are based the availability of a method to evaluate their reliability is of great importance with this aim in this work the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall data recorded at 23 rain gauges in the umbria region italy have been used to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method of extreme annual rainfall at each location three methods have been tested local frequency analysis by fitting at each station extreme annual rainfall data of different durations by a probability distribution function regional frequency analysis approach based on l moments and flood index method considering the extreme annual rainfall data from all the stations and a variant of the latter method known as in site regional frequency analysis based on the consideration of the station as a region therefore quantiles of rainfall for different durations and return periods have been obtained these quantiles have been fitted to the montana intensity duration frequency idf curve the scaling properties of rainfall have been obtained through out the empirical moments scaling function k q their comparison with some scaling behavior properties of the idf curves has let the selection of the most adequate quantile estimation method at each site being the regional frequency analysis the most appropriate one for 14 out of the 23 sites included in the study keywords extreme rainfall multifractality frequency analysis methods 1 introduction idf curves are widely used in water resources management projects hajani and rahman 2018 to obtain the value of the design storm depth they are derived by fitting extreme quantiles of rainfall obtained from frequency analysis methods by parametric equations characterized by different number of parameters like the montana equation widely used in real applications di baldassarre et al 2006a the temez equation proposed by the spanish water authority centre of hydrographic studies cedex témez 1987 the four parameter idf function considered by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 or the one propose by chow et al 1988 all of these equations let to obtain the values of rainfall intensity i as a function of the duration d return period t or frequency and some fitted parameters when observed rainfall extremes are available for a certain duration the design storm value quantile of rainfall with a certain duration and return period can be estimated by fitting on such data a suitable extreme probability distribution function e g di baldassarre et al 2006a for low return periods short extreme data series are good enough to estimate quantile values so that a local or at site frequency analysis is valid as the return period value increases the length of the data series needs to enlarge long rainfall data series are usually available for daily durations but not for shorter time periods in this situation a regional frequency analysis shows up as a good option in order to increase the amount of available data and also to improve quantile estimates e g hosking and wallis 1997 yu et al 2004 garcía marín et al 2011 haddad et al 2011 du et al 2014 liu et al 2015 hajani and rahman 2018 moujahid et al 2018 this approach solves the problem of lack of data in time with the abundance of data in space the bigger the sample of data fitted by a probability distribution function the higher confidence is on estimated quantile values specially for low frequencies of occurrence a region will be composed with data from different sites that share the same probability distribution function an alternative approach that is called in site regionalization consists of applying the regionalization technique to a specific station e g de salas and fernández 2007 ayuso muñoz et al 2015 even in this case the amount of available data increases that is the main aim of the regional frequency analysis but with data recorded in the same station over different durations the region will be formed by series that are considered to come from similar frequency distribution as in the standard regionalization technique idf curves have been widely analyzed all over the world e g jakob et al 2007 xu and tung 2009 lee et al 2010 haddad et al 2011 dourte et al 2013 du et al 2014 and different approaches belonging to the aforementioned techniques have been adopted to obtain them elsebaie 2011 mamoon et al 2014 liu et al 2015 some studies show comparisons between at site and regional estimates haddad et al 2011 found that regional design rainfall estimates were generally greater than the at site estimates moujahid et al 2018 found an increase in events intensities derived from regional frequency analysis hajani and rahman 2018 compared idf curves derived by different distributions and methods and found that the regional curves values were generally higher than the at site idf ones despite the existence of these works a widely recognized method to evaluate the reliability of different quantile estimate approaches to obtain idf curves that best reproduces the behavior of real extreme annual rainfall data in a certain place is still lacking rainfall and intensity duration frequency idf curves satisfy scaling relations that are based on the complexity of rainfall that exhibits self similarity at different scales and can be considered as fractal e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 de lima and grasman 1999 kiely and ivanova 1999 castro et al 2004 langousis et al 2009 garcía marín et al 2013 valencia et al 2015 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 rodríguez solá et al 2013 casas castillo et al 2018 self similarity processes look the same regardless of the scale where they are observed fractal processes exhibit the same behavior for different scale measurements so they are self similar fractal self similarity of rainfall has a statistical nature so that its scaling properties can be expressed by statistical relationships schertzer and lovejoy 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 moreover the probability distribution of the annual maximum rainfall intensities follows scale relationships burlando and rosso 1996 the scale invariance character of rainfall must be reproduced by any rainfall model a relation between rainfall fractal behavior and idf scaling exists as detailed in section 3 4 e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 specifically idf values are simple scaled with a power law dependence on the duration d and return period t the power law exponent can be calculated from the moment scaling exponent function k q that characterizes the multifractality of rainfall time series veneziano and furcolo 2009 as a novelty and based on the evidence that idf models satisfy the scaling behavior of rainfall e g yu et al 2004 ghanmi et al 2016 rodríguez solá et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the objective of this work is to use the multifractal analysis to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method to obtain rainfall quantiles at a certain place with this purpose the multifractal characterization of hourly rainfall data series in 23 rain gauges stations in the umbria region italy is performed afterwards rainfall quantiles are obtained at each place by applying three different methods local regional and in site regional frequency analysis the local or at site rainfall frequency analysis is applied by fitting extreme annual rainfall data registered at each station by the general extreme values gev probability distribution function the regional and in site regional analysis performed are based on the regionalization methodology proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 for the former the extreme annual rainfall annual data of several durations from all the available stations are used and regionalization is studied for each duration for the latter the regionalization is made for each site considering only its extreme annual rainfall data for the available durations for each frequency analysis method all the quantiles obtained are fitted by the montana idf model the existing relation between the multifractality of rainfall data previously studied and the scale invariance of the idf curves is finally used to select the most appropriate rainfall frequency analysis methodology at each place 2 study area and data source in this study rainfall data from the umbria region central italy are used the umbria region with an extension of 8456 km2 exhibits a mountainous landscape along its eastern side where apennine mountains reach up to 2000 m a s l and a hilly morphology in the central and western zones with altitudes ranging from 100 to 800 m a s l a wide part of the study area is included in the tiber river basin which crosses the region from north to south west mean annual rainfall for the last century is about 900 mm with values varying in space from 650 mm to 1450 mm based on 1921 2015 period and a network of more than 90 rain gauges the highest rainfall values usually take place during the autumn winter seasons the highest monthly rainfall values generally occur during the autumn winter period together with floods caused by widespread rainfall the highest and lowest rainfall depths typically take place in november and july respectively over the past 15 years the region has been affected by five significant droughts 2001 to 2003 then in 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 as well as by six dangerous flood events one occurred in 2005 one in 2008 one in 2010 two in 2012 and one in 2013 with very large impacts in economic terms morbidelli et al 2018 the study area is currently monitored through a dense rain gauge network about 1 rain gauge every 90 km2 fig 1 in this study 23 rain gauge stations characterized by continuous hourly rainfall data from 1992 to 2015 are considered table 1 and fig 1 one of the interests of the multifractal approaches is to use all the available data to extract the best information possible of the process under analysis therefore for the multifractal approach the continuous hourly rainfall data series are used whereas for the quantile estimation the extreme annual rainfall data series composed by the highest rainfall value in a year for a certain duration are obtained for durations of 1 3 6 12 and 24 h 3 methodology 3 1 multifractality fractal and multifractal approaches can be used for modelling time series and deriving predictions regarding extreme events multifractal analysis is applicable to variables self similarly distributed on a geometric support that is represented by a line i e time series plane volume or fractal set to identify multifractality in hydrological time series it can be assumed that the variability of the process under study can be modeled as a stochastic turbulent cascade process schertzer and lovejoy 1987 gupta and waymare 1993 over and gupta 1994 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 a cascade process can be described as eddies breaking up into smaller sub eddies each of which receives a part of the flux from its parent body this cascade process type behavior can be used with rainfall data to transfer information from some temporal or spatial scales to another if scale invariance is previously found in the data set to identify multifractality in rainfall data sets the statistical moments scaling method has been widely applied sivakumar 2001 to perform the analysis the time series has to be divided into non overlapping intervals of a certain time resolution the ratio of the field maximum scale to this interval is the scale ratio λ by this process the time is scaled so that the duration of the longest period of interest is 1 de lima and grasman 1999 for a time interval i at the scale ratio λ the mean rainfall intensity is given by r λ i in order to obtain non dimensional values the mean rainfall intensity r λ i has to be normalized by the so called joint average of the mean rainfall intensities obtained for λ 1 the average found at the higher resolution r 1 i where 1 n λ j 1 λ with nλ the number of non overlapping time intervals in which the time series is divided for a certain λ the non dimensional mean rainfall intensity for an interval i is then obtained as ε λ i r λ i r 1 i the average qth moments of the rainfall intensities of the process at resolution level λ ε λ q can then be obtained and their scaling can be described by the k q function that satisfies schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1990 1 ε λ q λ k q the scaling behavior given by equation 1 can be investigated by plotting ε λ q as a function of λ in a log log plot diagram for several values of q high and low values of q are related to extreme very high or very low values of rainfall the former are conditioned by the length of data and the latter by the resolution of the pluviograph commonly 0 1 mm therefore a wide range of q moments values greater and lower than 1 is recommended to describe the scale behavior of rainfall in a certain place e g de lima and grasman 1999 the linear fits of the log log plot of equation 1 let to obtain the complete k q function and give information about the temporal scale invariance of the data set different shapes of k q can be expected for mono and multifractal processes for the former k q versus q is a straight line whereas for the latter a convex function appears e g yu et al 2014 if k q is linear through the origin the measure is self similar the value of k 0 is related to the zeros of the data series and also reflects the codimension of the field 0 the codimension function c γ can describe the probability distribution of the process intensity it also indicates how the histograms of a variable change with resolution it can be obtained parametrically as c q q γ q k q where γ q d k q d q parisi and frish 1985 veneziano and furcolo 2002 the value of γmax which is the maximum value of the order of singularity γ can provide information about the rare or extreme events in the data series e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 3 2 frequency analysis of extreme events the main objective of frequency analysis is the estimation of extreme events corresponding to different return periods quantiles by using probability distribution functions for this purpose maximum annual rainfall data series are used being composed by the highest annual values of rainfall for certain duration for annual series the return period of an event is the reciprocal of the probability of exceedance of that event koutsoyiannis et al 1998 langousis et al 2009 and can be also defined as the average time interval between exceedances of a certain value for small return periods or long historical data series single site or local frequency analysis lfa of extreme data is enough to obtain quantile values when dealing with rainfall quantiles are usually estimated to obtain idf curves for this purpose in many studies gev probability distribution function and its particular form gumbel are applied to extreme rainfall menabde et al 1999 bougadis and adamowski 2006 gubareva and gartsman 2010 ghanmi et al 2016 choi et al 2018 the gev function is preferred for rainfall data series with high extreme values e g coles 2001 koutsoyiannis 2004 russell 2019 regardless the probability distribution function used for an at site frequency analysis the main limitation of this analysis appears when the objective is to estimate extreme rainfall quantiles for high return periods starting from short length data series being this kind of data the most frequently found all over the world the regional frequency analysis rfa appears then as a useful tool to solve the problem of temporal data scarcity by increasing data through the space e g rostami 2013 the rfa methodology used in this work was proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 and is based on l moments and the flood index method dalrymple 1960 the l moments introduced by hosking 1990 1992 are commonly used in rfa of rainfall data e g yang et al 2010 zakaria and shabri 2012 monjahid et al 2018 they are linear functions of the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 for a sample size n the estimator of probability weighted moments is given by b r n 1 n 1 r 1 j r 1 n j 1 r x j n being x the variable under analysis the sample l moments are obtained as linear combinations of br being l 1 b 0 l 2 2 b 1 b 0 l 3 6 b 2 6 b 1 b 0 l 4 20 b 3 30 b 2 12 b 1 b 0 among others the l moments ratios are given by t r l r l 2 for r 3 4 the value of t l 2 l 1 is known as l coefficient of variation flood index procedures are a convenient way of pooling summary statistics from different data samples the term flood index arose because early applications of the procedure were performed on flood data in hydrology e g dalrymple 1960 but the method can be used with any kind of data the key assumption of a flood index procedure is that a group of sites forms a homogeneous region that is their data sets are characterized by frequency distributions identical apart from a site specific scaling factor called flood index the rfa is advantageous over at site analysis if homogeneous regions can be compound with the available data series a homogeneous region is composed by stations that have identical frequency distributions apart from a site specific scale factor the obtaining of homogenous regions is the most critical step in rfa and several methodologies and site characteristics can be applied to group stations into homogeneous regions e g garcía marín et al 2011 2015 medina cobo et al 2017 satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 in order to easily understand the main steps of rfa appendix a can be seen as a first step in rfa l moments and their corresponding l moments ratios l coefficient of variation t i l skewness t 3 i and l kurtosis t 4 i have to be obtained for all the data series for each site or station i used in the analysis notice that i changes to r if we refer to the region instead of the site the three l moments ratios of a certain site are considered as components of a vector in a three dimensional space with l moments ratios as coordinates considering that each site is then characterized by a vector the whole set of stations forms a cloud of points in that space any point far from the center of that cloud being a point with average l moments ratios values as coordinates has to be considered as discordant and excluded from the analysis specifically for each station the discordancy di with respect to the center can be determined as hosking and wallis 1997 2 d i 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where u i t i t 3 i t 4 i u n 1 i 1 n u i a i 1 n u i u u i u and n is the number of stations if the obtained di value exceeds a critical value that depends on the number of sites and can be found in hosking and wallis 1997 the site has to be excluded from the analysis because is discordant the critical values of discordancy vary from 1 333 for regions of five sites to 3 000 for regions of fifteen or more sites hosking and wallis 1997 in order to test if a group of sites forms a homogeneous region the heterogeneity measure h that compares the between site variations in sample l moments for a group of sites with what would be expected for a homogeneous region has to be calculated for that purpose it is necessary to calculate the weighted standard deviation of at site sample l coefficient of variation v given by v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 with t r i 1 n n i t i i 1 n n i n the number of data and t i the l coefficient of variation of the station to fit a kappa distribution to the regional average l moments ratios to simulate a large number nsim of realizations of a region with n sites each having this kappa distribution as its frequency distribution the simulated regions are homogeneous and the sites have the same record lengths as their real world counterparts to calculate v for each simulated region to determine the mean μv and standard deviation σv of nsim values of v from the simulations the heterogeneity measure can finally be obtained as 3 h v μ v σ v the region under consideration is acceptably homogeneous when h 1 possibly heterogeneous when 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous for h 2 once the homogeneity of a region is checked the quantiles of the variable analyzed for several return periods can be obtained different probability distribution functions can be tested in order to select the most appropriate to describe the region and to obtain the regional growth curve q f where f is the frequency in a set of three parameter candidate distributions to measure the fit goodness of each one the following statistics can be calculated 4 z dist τ 4 dist t 4 r b 4 σ 4 where τ 4 dist is the l kurtosis coefficient of the three parameter distribution t 4 r the regional average l kurtosis coefficient σ 4 the standard deviation of t 4 r which can be obtained by repeated simulation of a homogeneous region whose sites have the selected three parameter frequency distribution and record lengths the same as those of the observed data and b 4 is the bias in the regional average l kurtosis for regions with the same number of sites and the same record lengths as the observed data the fit of a specific distribution is considered to be adequate if the value of statistics z dist is below or the same as 1 64 at the significance degree of 90 by applying the flood index method the quantiles qi at a site i can then be obtained by 5 q i f μ i q f i 1 n being μi the flood index average of data at site i besides the lack of long data series in some cases there is a lack of spatial information so a regular rfa cannot be performed in this case the regionalization technique can be applied in a single station de salas and fernández 2007 the station now becomes the region and the sites of the region are the available data series of different duration this method is called the in site regional frequency analysis irfa and can be applied at any location where rainfall records of around 10 min to 24 h duration are available allowing the development of robust quantiles estimations ayuso muñoz et al 2015 the following steps to be followed are the same as stated before 3 3 idf formulation regardless of the statistical frequency analysis performed once the quantiles of rainfall are obtained for different durations an idf model can be fitted the most widely used approach consists of using a parametric model characterized typically from 2 to 4 parameters as the number of parameters increases the uncertainty of the estimations is amplified as well di baldassarre et al 2006a b several idf equations can be found e g chow 1964 bell 1969 chen 1983 garcía bartual and schneider 2001 being the one known as montana curve one of the most widely used di baldassarre et al 2006a 6 i t d a d b 1 where a and b are the parameters that depend on the return period this equation shows some limitations for describing the behavior of short term storms of less than 1 h di baldassarre et al 2006a nevertheless considering that it is widely used in the region of the present study and that the work is focused on durations higher than 1 h it has been chosen as idf model 3 4 fractals and idf as veneziano and furcolo 2002 stated most of the models of idf curves belongs to self similar models that satisfy simple scaling relations or asymptotically self similar models while the idf curves satisfy simple scaling relations temporal rainfall has multifractal scale invariance in engineering practice the scaling relations between some idf models and some multifractal parameters can be relevant they can be used to obtain probable maximum precipitation estimates casas castillo et al 2018 rainfall values of low durations by downscaling rodríguez solá et al 2017 or rainfall values in un gauged sites ghanmi et al 2016 one can consider i t d d h i t 1 7 being h the self similarity index d the duration i t d the intensity value with probability 1 t and t the return period on the other hand in approximation and for large t 8 i t 1 t α where α is a constant benjoudi et al 1997 1999 for any finite range of t and d 0 veneziano and furcolo 2002 obtained that h γ 1 and α 1 q 1 where γ 1 is the value of γ where the codimension function c γ equals 1 and q1 is the associated moment order the scaling of idf can be then expressed by 9 i t d d γ 1 t 1 q 1 the parameters γ 1 and q1 can be obtained from k q function from the linear behavior of the field for q values greater than a given moment and be related to the slope of the idf obtained for a certain location thus for each return period analyzed the absolute value of the idf slopes b 1 equation 6 should be close to the γ 1 value obtained from the multifractal analysis of rainfall data at the same place moreover the slope of the line obtained from plotting the mean rainfall intensity values of several duration for different return periods should be close to the value 1 q 1 garcía marín et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 multifractal analysis of hourly rainfall in the umbria region to obtain the empirical moments scaling exponent function k q for the hourly rainfall data series in the 23 rain gauge stations available table 1 the log log plot of the qth average moments of the rainfall intensity ε λ against the scale ratio λ has to be obtained at each place fig 2 shows this plot for three sites casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro as it can be observed straight lines appear for moments higher fig 2a and lower fig 2b than 1 these straight lines give information about the scaling behavior of the moments observed in the range from 1 h to 21 days for the three sites similar values have been found by other authors for different locations e g ladoy et al 1991 1993 fraedrich and larnder 1993 svensson et al 1996 tessier et al 1996 labat et al 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 rodríguez solá et al 2013 the same scale invariance regimens have been found for the hourly rainfall data of the other stations in the umbria region the empirical function k q has been then obtained for the scale regimen detected and for all the sites in fig 3 the function k q for the same stations of fig 2 is shown in all three cases it shows a convex shape that gives information about the multifractal behavior of hourly rainfall at the umbria region important information for the present work can be obtained from k q function like the singularity values γ 1 the value for this parameter varies from 0 7219 for casacastalda to 0 7945 for san benedetto vecchio with a value of 0 7491 for san silvestro table 2 shows the values of γ 1 obtained from the scaling functions at all the sites analyzed found to vary from 0 7125 to 0 8242 similar results have been found by garcía marín et al 2013 and rodríguez solá et al 2017 for rainfall data in spanish stations the value of moment order q1 associated to γ 1 is also shown in table 2 for all the sites and in fig 3 for the selected stations 4 2 quantile estimation for the 23 rain gauges the extreme annual rainfall data series are obtained by selecting the maximum rainfall value of certain duration for durations of 1 3 6 12 and 24 h for each year of data the three different frequency analysis methods described in section 3 have been applied firstly a lfa for each extreme data series at each location secondly a rfa of extreme rainfall data for each duration considering all the sites and finally an irfa at each location for the local analysis the gev probability distribution function has been used obtaining quantiles values of extreme rainfall for return periods of 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years for each duration a rfa has been performed rfaih with i 1 3 6 12 and 24 h obtaining the results summarized in table 3 as first step the existence of discordant sites was checked by obtaining the values of di equation 2 for the hourly extreme rainfall regional frequency analysis rfa1h only petrelle station was found discordant and was taken out of the analysis two sites resulted discordant for rfa3h compignano and san biagio della valle and two more for the rfa12h being narni scalo and san benedetto vecchio for rfa6h and rfa24h no sites were found to be discordant the heterogeneity measure of the region compound by the remaining stations was then evaluated with equation 3 the values of h were found lower than one for rfa1h 0 11 rfa3h 0 90 rfa12h 0 54 and rfa24h 0 97 these results show the homogeneity of the regions constituted by the considered stations for the selected durations for rfa6h the initial value of h was 1 96 which indicated that the region was probably heterogeneous and so it was divided into sub regions following the methodology proposed by garcía marín et al 2015 the multifractal characteristics of rainfall data were used to divide the rfa6h region into two regions with the values of γ 1 and k 0 table 2 a k means cluster analysis was performed and two groups of sites were obtained two new regional frequency analyses were done rfa6ha and rfa6hb the first group was initially composed by 9 sites whereas 14 stations formed the second petrelle station was discordant again so finally two groups stayed one with 8 sites and one with 14 stations table 3 both groups were found to be homogeneous according to the values of h parameter being 0 23 for rfa6ha and 0 83 for rfa6hb respectively once the homogeneous regions have been compounded the growth curves are necessary in order to finally obtain the quantiles at all the sites for this purpose the goodness of a probability distribution function pdf in fitting the regional data has to be studied through the value of zdist equation 4 five three parameter probability distribution functions were tested being the generalized logistic gen log generalized extreme value gev generalized normal gen nor pearson type iii pt iii and generalized pareto gen par table 4 shows the values of statistics zdist obtained by applying equation 4 for all the homogeneous regions and probability distribution functions according to these results the most appropriate function for each region is the one that gives the lowest value of z dist between 0 and 1 64 based on that the gev pdf is the most appropriate for rfa3h rfa6ha and rfa24h the gen nor pdf is the best one for rfa6hb and rfa12h whereas gen log is the most suitable for rfa1h the regional growth curves for each region can then be obtained with the selected probability distribution functions for several return periods table 5 for each duration considering the calculated growth curve and the average datum at each site the quantiles for different return periods were obtained by applying the flood index method equation 5 the irfa was then applied at each location considered as one region and each series of a particular duration 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 min 1 3 6 12 and 24 h as one site into the region as it can be seen in table 6 for 15 out of 23 in site regions all durations sites formed a homogeneous region with h values less than 1 00 for the in site regions forsivo gubbio and la cima some sites were found to be discordant and were removed from the analysis 5 and 24 h in forsivo 24 h in gubbio and 5 10 15 20 in la cima once the discordant sites were eliminated the in site regions became homogeneous according to the h values table 6 in site regions of montelovesco and san biagio della valle formed a homogeneous region considering all sites with h values of 0 57 and 2 07 respectively nevertheless no probability distribution function was found as a good candidate to fit the in site regional data according to the values of zdist obtained for montelovesco two subregions were formed one for durations less than one hour and another for durations greater than one hour table 6 both of them were homogeneous petrelle in site region was heterogeneous considering all sites so two subregions were formed and homogeneity results were obtained table 6 for san biagio della valle some sites were removed in order to form a homogeneous region the final in site homogeneous region was compounded by 7 sites from 30 to 24 h similar situation occurred for san benedetto vecchio station where a final homogeneous region was formed removing some sites table 6 the regional growth curves for each in site region were then obtained with the selected probability distribution functions for several return periods table 7 as an example and in order to compare the different approaches the local regional and in site regional quantiles for 24 h and 50 years of return period are shown in fig 4 notice that the values are missing for forsivo and gubbio where 24 h duration was removed from the in site regional frequency analysis as it can be seen in this figure there is no a general pattern in the values obtained by the different methodologies for 8 sites out of 23 34 8 local quantiles are the highest for 10 sites out of 23 43 5 regional quantiles are the highest whereas in site quantiles are the highest only for 4 out of 23 sites 17 4 in any case the different values of quantiles obtained by the three applied methods provide different idf curves and different design storm values thus it is important to select the most appropriate idf curve for each site in order to reproduce adequately the extreme rainfall behavior 4 3 idf fitting all the quantiles of more than one hour of duration obtained by using lfa rfa and irfa have been fitted by the montana idf model equation 7 as an example table 8 shows the values of parameters a and b for casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro it can be noticed that for each site and frequency analysis the parameter b has a constant value for all the return periods this is because when fitting a different b for each ti i 5 200 years value it was observed that in some cases i d t 2 i d t 1 being t 2 t 1 in order to avoid that situation a constant value of b was obtained as the average of all the b values independently estimated for the different return periods 4 4 selection of frequency analysis the scale invariance properties of idf curves and their relationship with multifractal parameters e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 are used in this work to select the most appropriate frequency analysis at each site of the umbria region in this context for each site the absolute value of slopes of the estimated idf lines slopeidf has to be close to the value obtained for the singularity value γ1 in the multifractal analysis of the hourly rainfall data table 2 for casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro fig 5 a shows slopeidf for each approach and the singularity value γ1 obtained for each location as it can be checked for casacastalda the values obtained for lfa and irfa are lower than γ1 0 7219 being the value for regional frequency analysis very close to the singularity value for san benedetto vecchio station the closest value to γ1 0 7945 is that obtained through lfa whereas at san silvestro station the irfa is the most suitable to reproduce the γ1 value 0 7491 for the same stations fig 5b shows the slope of the fit of the rainfall intensity values averaged over durations for different return periods slopeari the slope value has to be close to the value of 1 q1 obtained for each location table 2 it can be observed that for casacastalda the closest value to 1 q1 0 2222 is the one obtained with rfa being the results obtained with lfa and irfa the worst in san benedetto vecchio station the best result is obtained with lfa whereas irfa is the best to fit 1 q1 0 2667 in san silvestro station according to the results described above the idf curve obtained with quantiles from rfa is the best for casacastalda station the one obtained with local frequency analysis quantiles is the most appropriate for san benedetto vecchio station and the idf curve obtained with quantiles from irfa is the best choice for san silvestro station for the rest of stations the slopeidf and the slopeari values obtained for the three approaches are shown in table 9 the values in table 9 have to be compared to those in table 2 γ1 q1 in order to select the best idf curve at each location to better synthetize the results of fig 5 and table 9 the values of γ 1 s l o p e idf 2 and slop e ari 1 q 1 have been obtained for each site and frequency analysis and shown in table 10 e g garcía marín et al 2013 for each multifractal criterium the green values indicate when the lfa is the best the red values have the same meaning but for rfa and the blue ones correspond to the best results for irfa combining both multifractal criteria a decision can be made and a proper frequency analysis can be selected for each site the selected frequency analysis at each location is shown in bold table 10 shows that only for three sites città di castello ripalvella and san benedetto vecchio stations the lfa is the best option irfa exhibits to be the best choice only at san silvestro station rfa is the most appropriate frequency analysis for 14 out of 23 sites for the rest of stations 5 very close results have been obtained for all frequency analyses but no coincidence of the two multifractal criteria has been found 5 conclusions the scaling properties of idf curves are used in this work to select the proper frequency analysis method to obtain quantiles of rainfall in the umbria region italy with this purpose rainfall data series from 23 rainfall gauges were used the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall were evaluated by applying the statistical moments scaling method the empirical function k q was obtained at each place and some important multifractal parameters were identified γ1 q1 and the value of k 0 three frequency analyses of annual maximum rainfall data for different durations have been considered local regional and in site regional frequency analyses for the local frequency analysis the gev probability distribution function was used and the local quantiles were obtained the regional frequency analysis proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 was performed for each duration and homogeneous regions of annual maximum rainfall were composed different probability distribution functions were tested at each region in order to obtain the regional growth curves and the corresponding quantiles at each location the regional frequency analysis was also applied at each station in site regional frequency analysis considering the site as a region and the maximum annual rainfall data series as the sites of the region and the quantiles were derived different quantile values were obtained at each station for the different frequency analyses approaches with no regular pattern for the highest or lowest values for a certain approach the rainfall quantiles obtained through the different approaches were fitted by the montana idf curve then following the theory proposed by veneziano and furcolo 2002 the values of γ1 were compared with the absolute value of slopes of the different idf curves and the values of 1 q1 were compared to the slope of mean rainfall intensity versus return period fit these comparisons between multifractal parameters and idf properties let to select the most appropriate frequency analysis at each location the regional frequency analysis gave the best results for the 61 of stations closely followed by the local frequency analysis that was the best option for the 13 of sites the in site regional frequency analysis was the most appropriate only in one station and for five more similar values were obtained with the three frequency analysis approaches thus the analysis of the scaling behavior of rainfall proposed here seems to be a good tool to decide which frequency analysis is adequate at a certain place lastly the scaling behavior of rainfall can be analyzed through data sets with time resolution that can vary from fine e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 rodríguez solá et al 2017 to coarse e g garcía marín et al 2015 casas castillo et al 2018 when scale invariance is found in a data set the downscaling or upscaling of maximum rainfall data can be performed this last procedure let to obtain both quantiles and idf relations at places where no fine time resolution data are available therefore different types of quantile estimation can be always obtained and the methodology proposed in this work can be useful to decide among them declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements a p garcía marín acknowledges the support from the spanish ministry of

department of civil and environmental engineering appendix a fig a 1 shows a flowchart that can summarizes the main steps to be followed in rfa let suppose a potential region region 1 in fig a 1 composed by n sites with extreme annual rainfall data series calculate the l moments of the data series afterwards obtain the values of discordancy di from equation 2 remove from the analysis all the m sites with discordancy values greater than the critical one and repeat this procedure until no discordant site is found with all the non discordant sites calculate the heterogeneity value h by applying equation 3 if h value is greater than one star the process again subdividing region 1 into sub regions if the h value is lower than one the region can be considered as homogeneous and the value of zdist for a number of candidate probability distribution functions p d f has to be obtained by applying equation 4 if the absolute value of zdist is lower than 1 64 all the data of region 1 can be fitted by a p d f consider the one with the lowest z dist and the regional growth curve can be obtained on the contrary fit the data through the wakeby p d f finally obtain the quantile values

6413,intensity duration frequency idf curves are important tools for hydraulic and hydrologic design considering that there are different approaches to obtain the rainfall quantiles on which the idf curves are based the availability of a method to evaluate their reliability is of great importance with this aim in this work the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall data recorded at 23 rain gauges in the umbria region italy have been used to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method of extreme annual rainfall at each location three methods have been tested local frequency analysis by fitting at each station extreme annual rainfall data of different durations by a probability distribution function regional frequency analysis approach based on l moments and flood index method considering the extreme annual rainfall data from all the stations and a variant of the latter method known as in site regional frequency analysis based on the consideration of the station as a region therefore quantiles of rainfall for different durations and return periods have been obtained these quantiles have been fitted to the montana intensity duration frequency idf curve the scaling properties of rainfall have been obtained through out the empirical moments scaling function k q their comparison with some scaling behavior properties of the idf curves has let the selection of the most adequate quantile estimation method at each site being the regional frequency analysis the most appropriate one for 14 out of the 23 sites included in the study keywords extreme rainfall multifractality frequency analysis methods 1 introduction idf curves are widely used in water resources management projects hajani and rahman 2018 to obtain the value of the design storm depth they are derived by fitting extreme quantiles of rainfall obtained from frequency analysis methods by parametric equations characterized by different number of parameters like the montana equation widely used in real applications di baldassarre et al 2006a the temez equation proposed by the spanish water authority centre of hydrographic studies cedex témez 1987 the four parameter idf function considered by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 or the one propose by chow et al 1988 all of these equations let to obtain the values of rainfall intensity i as a function of the duration d return period t or frequency and some fitted parameters when observed rainfall extremes are available for a certain duration the design storm value quantile of rainfall with a certain duration and return period can be estimated by fitting on such data a suitable extreme probability distribution function e g di baldassarre et al 2006a for low return periods short extreme data series are good enough to estimate quantile values so that a local or at site frequency analysis is valid as the return period value increases the length of the data series needs to enlarge long rainfall data series are usually available for daily durations but not for shorter time periods in this situation a regional frequency analysis shows up as a good option in order to increase the amount of available data and also to improve quantile estimates e g hosking and wallis 1997 yu et al 2004 garcía marín et al 2011 haddad et al 2011 du et al 2014 liu et al 2015 hajani and rahman 2018 moujahid et al 2018 this approach solves the problem of lack of data in time with the abundance of data in space the bigger the sample of data fitted by a probability distribution function the higher confidence is on estimated quantile values specially for low frequencies of occurrence a region will be composed with data from different sites that share the same probability distribution function an alternative approach that is called in site regionalization consists of applying the regionalization technique to a specific station e g de salas and fernández 2007 ayuso muñoz et al 2015 even in this case the amount of available data increases that is the main aim of the regional frequency analysis but with data recorded in the same station over different durations the region will be formed by series that are considered to come from similar frequency distribution as in the standard regionalization technique idf curves have been widely analyzed all over the world e g jakob et al 2007 xu and tung 2009 lee et al 2010 haddad et al 2011 dourte et al 2013 du et al 2014 and different approaches belonging to the aforementioned techniques have been adopted to obtain them elsebaie 2011 mamoon et al 2014 liu et al 2015 some studies show comparisons between at site and regional estimates haddad et al 2011 found that regional design rainfall estimates were generally greater than the at site estimates moujahid et al 2018 found an increase in events intensities derived from regional frequency analysis hajani and rahman 2018 compared idf curves derived by different distributions and methods and found that the regional curves values were generally higher than the at site idf ones despite the existence of these works a widely recognized method to evaluate the reliability of different quantile estimate approaches to obtain idf curves that best reproduces the behavior of real extreme annual rainfall data in a certain place is still lacking rainfall and intensity duration frequency idf curves satisfy scaling relations that are based on the complexity of rainfall that exhibits self similarity at different scales and can be considered as fractal e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 de lima and grasman 1999 kiely and ivanova 1999 castro et al 2004 langousis et al 2009 garcía marín et al 2013 valencia et al 2015 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 rodríguez solá et al 2013 casas castillo et al 2018 self similarity processes look the same regardless of the scale where they are observed fractal processes exhibit the same behavior for different scale measurements so they are self similar fractal self similarity of rainfall has a statistical nature so that its scaling properties can be expressed by statistical relationships schertzer and lovejoy 1987 schertzer and lovejoy 2011 moreover the probability distribution of the annual maximum rainfall intensities follows scale relationships burlando and rosso 1996 the scale invariance character of rainfall must be reproduced by any rainfall model a relation between rainfall fractal behavior and idf scaling exists as detailed in section 3 4 e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 specifically idf values are simple scaled with a power law dependence on the duration d and return period t the power law exponent can be calculated from the moment scaling exponent function k q that characterizes the multifractality of rainfall time series veneziano and furcolo 2009 as a novelty and based on the evidence that idf models satisfy the scaling behavior of rainfall e g yu et al 2004 ghanmi et al 2016 rodríguez solá et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the objective of this work is to use the multifractal analysis to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method to obtain rainfall quantiles at a certain place with this purpose the multifractal characterization of hourly rainfall data series in 23 rain gauges stations in the umbria region italy is performed afterwards rainfall quantiles are obtained at each place by applying three different methods local regional and in site regional frequency analysis the local or at site rainfall frequency analysis is applied by fitting extreme annual rainfall data registered at each station by the general extreme values gev probability distribution function the regional and in site regional analysis performed are based on the regionalization methodology proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 for the former the extreme annual rainfall annual data of several durations from all the available stations are used and regionalization is studied for each duration for the latter the regionalization is made for each site considering only its extreme annual rainfall data for the available durations for each frequency analysis method all the quantiles obtained are fitted by the montana idf model the existing relation between the multifractality of rainfall data previously studied and the scale invariance of the idf curves is finally used to select the most appropriate rainfall frequency analysis methodology at each place 2 study area and data source in this study rainfall data from the umbria region central italy are used the umbria region with an extension of 8456 km2 exhibits a mountainous landscape along its eastern side where apennine mountains reach up to 2000 m a s l and a hilly morphology in the central and western zones with altitudes ranging from 100 to 800 m a s l a wide part of the study area is included in the tiber river basin which crosses the region from north to south west mean annual rainfall for the last century is about 900 mm with values varying in space from 650 mm to 1450 mm based on 1921 2015 period and a network of more than 90 rain gauges the highest rainfall values usually take place during the autumn winter seasons the highest monthly rainfall values generally occur during the autumn winter period together with floods caused by widespread rainfall the highest and lowest rainfall depths typically take place in november and july respectively over the past 15 years the region has been affected by five significant droughts 2001 to 2003 then in 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 as well as by six dangerous flood events one occurred in 2005 one in 2008 one in 2010 two in 2012 and one in 2013 with very large impacts in economic terms morbidelli et al 2018 the study area is currently monitored through a dense rain gauge network about 1 rain gauge every 90 km2 fig 1 in this study 23 rain gauge stations characterized by continuous hourly rainfall data from 1992 to 2015 are considered table 1 and fig 1 one of the interests of the multifractal approaches is to use all the available data to extract the best information possible of the process under analysis therefore for the multifractal approach the continuous hourly rainfall data series are used whereas for the quantile estimation the extreme annual rainfall data series composed by the highest rainfall value in a year for a certain duration are obtained for durations of 1 3 6 12 and 24 h 3 methodology 3 1 multifractality fractal and multifractal approaches can be used for modelling time series and deriving predictions regarding extreme events multifractal analysis is applicable to variables self similarly distributed on a geometric support that is represented by a line i e time series plane volume or fractal set to identify multifractality in hydrological time series it can be assumed that the variability of the process under study can be modeled as a stochastic turbulent cascade process schertzer and lovejoy 1987 gupta and waymare 1993 over and gupta 1994 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 a cascade process can be described as eddies breaking up into smaller sub eddies each of which receives a part of the flux from its parent body this cascade process type behavior can be used with rainfall data to transfer information from some temporal or spatial scales to another if scale invariance is previously found in the data set to identify multifractality in rainfall data sets the statistical moments scaling method has been widely applied sivakumar 2001 to perform the analysis the time series has to be divided into non overlapping intervals of a certain time resolution the ratio of the field maximum scale to this interval is the scale ratio λ by this process the time is scaled so that the duration of the longest period of interest is 1 de lima and grasman 1999 for a time interval i at the scale ratio λ the mean rainfall intensity is given by r λ i in order to obtain non dimensional values the mean rainfall intensity r λ i has to be normalized by the so called joint average of the mean rainfall intensities obtained for λ 1 the average found at the higher resolution r 1 i where 1 n λ j 1 λ with nλ the number of non overlapping time intervals in which the time series is divided for a certain λ the non dimensional mean rainfall intensity for an interval i is then obtained as ε λ i r λ i r 1 i the average qth moments of the rainfall intensities of the process at resolution level λ ε λ q can then be obtained and their scaling can be described by the k q function that satisfies schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1990 1 ε λ q λ k q the scaling behavior given by equation 1 can be investigated by plotting ε λ q as a function of λ in a log log plot diagram for several values of q high and low values of q are related to extreme very high or very low values of rainfall the former are conditioned by the length of data and the latter by the resolution of the pluviograph commonly 0 1 mm therefore a wide range of q moments values greater and lower than 1 is recommended to describe the scale behavior of rainfall in a certain place e g de lima and grasman 1999 the linear fits of the log log plot of equation 1 let to obtain the complete k q function and give information about the temporal scale invariance of the data set different shapes of k q can be expected for mono and multifractal processes for the former k q versus q is a straight line whereas for the latter a convex function appears e g yu et al 2014 if k q is linear through the origin the measure is self similar the value of k 0 is related to the zeros of the data series and also reflects the codimension of the field 0 the codimension function c γ can describe the probability distribution of the process intensity it also indicates how the histograms of a variable change with resolution it can be obtained parametrically as c q q γ q k q where γ q d k q d q parisi and frish 1985 veneziano and furcolo 2002 the value of γmax which is the maximum value of the order of singularity γ can provide information about the rare or extreme events in the data series e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 3 2 frequency analysis of extreme events the main objective of frequency analysis is the estimation of extreme events corresponding to different return periods quantiles by using probability distribution functions for this purpose maximum annual rainfall data series are used being composed by the highest annual values of rainfall for certain duration for annual series the return period of an event is the reciprocal of the probability of exceedance of that event koutsoyiannis et al 1998 langousis et al 2009 and can be also defined as the average time interval between exceedances of a certain value for small return periods or long historical data series single site or local frequency analysis lfa of extreme data is enough to obtain quantile values when dealing with rainfall quantiles are usually estimated to obtain idf curves for this purpose in many studies gev probability distribution function and its particular form gumbel are applied to extreme rainfall menabde et al 1999 bougadis and adamowski 2006 gubareva and gartsman 2010 ghanmi et al 2016 choi et al 2018 the gev function is preferred for rainfall data series with high extreme values e g coles 2001 koutsoyiannis 2004 russell 2019 regardless the probability distribution function used for an at site frequency analysis the main limitation of this analysis appears when the objective is to estimate extreme rainfall quantiles for high return periods starting from short length data series being this kind of data the most frequently found all over the world the regional frequency analysis rfa appears then as a useful tool to solve the problem of temporal data scarcity by increasing data through the space e g rostami 2013 the rfa methodology used in this work was proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 and is based on l moments and the flood index method dalrymple 1960 the l moments introduced by hosking 1990 1992 are commonly used in rfa of rainfall data e g yang et al 2010 zakaria and shabri 2012 monjahid et al 2018 they are linear functions of the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 for a sample size n the estimator of probability weighted moments is given by b r n 1 n 1 r 1 j r 1 n j 1 r x j n being x the variable under analysis the sample l moments are obtained as linear combinations of br being l 1 b 0 l 2 2 b 1 b 0 l 3 6 b 2 6 b 1 b 0 l 4 20 b 3 30 b 2 12 b 1 b 0 among others the l moments ratios are given by t r l r l 2 for r 3 4 the value of t l 2 l 1 is known as l coefficient of variation flood index procedures are a convenient way of pooling summary statistics from different data samples the term flood index arose because early applications of the procedure were performed on flood data in hydrology e g dalrymple 1960 but the method can be used with any kind of data the key assumption of a flood index procedure is that a group of sites forms a homogeneous region that is their data sets are characterized by frequency distributions identical apart from a site specific scaling factor called flood index the rfa is advantageous over at site analysis if homogeneous regions can be compound with the available data series a homogeneous region is composed by stations that have identical frequency distributions apart from a site specific scale factor the obtaining of homogenous regions is the most critical step in rfa and several methodologies and site characteristics can be applied to group stations into homogeneous regions e g garcía marín et al 2011 2015 medina cobo et al 2017 satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 in order to easily understand the main steps of rfa appendix a can be seen as a first step in rfa l moments and their corresponding l moments ratios l coefficient of variation t i l skewness t 3 i and l kurtosis t 4 i have to be obtained for all the data series for each site or station i used in the analysis notice that i changes to r if we refer to the region instead of the site the three l moments ratios of a certain site are considered as components of a vector in a three dimensional space with l moments ratios as coordinates considering that each site is then characterized by a vector the whole set of stations forms a cloud of points in that space any point far from the center of that cloud being a point with average l moments ratios values as coordinates has to be considered as discordant and excluded from the analysis specifically for each station the discordancy di with respect to the center can be determined as hosking and wallis 1997 2 d i 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where u i t i t 3 i t 4 i u n 1 i 1 n u i a i 1 n u i u u i u and n is the number of stations if the obtained di value exceeds a critical value that depends on the number of sites and can be found in hosking and wallis 1997 the site has to be excluded from the analysis because is discordant the critical values of discordancy vary from 1 333 for regions of five sites to 3 000 for regions of fifteen or more sites hosking and wallis 1997 in order to test if a group of sites forms a homogeneous region the heterogeneity measure h that compares the between site variations in sample l moments for a group of sites with what would be expected for a homogeneous region has to be calculated for that purpose it is necessary to calculate the weighted standard deviation of at site sample l coefficient of variation v given by v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 with t r i 1 n n i t i i 1 n n i n the number of data and t i the l coefficient of variation of the station to fit a kappa distribution to the regional average l moments ratios to simulate a large number nsim of realizations of a region with n sites each having this kappa distribution as its frequency distribution the simulated regions are homogeneous and the sites have the same record lengths as their real world counterparts to calculate v for each simulated region to determine the mean μv and standard deviation σv of nsim values of v from the simulations the heterogeneity measure can finally be obtained as 3 h v μ v σ v the region under consideration is acceptably homogeneous when h 1 possibly heterogeneous when 1 h 2 and definitely heterogeneous for h 2 once the homogeneity of a region is checked the quantiles of the variable analyzed for several return periods can be obtained different probability distribution functions can be tested in order to select the most appropriate to describe the region and to obtain the regional growth curve q f where f is the frequency in a set of three parameter candidate distributions to measure the fit goodness of each one the following statistics can be calculated 4 z dist τ 4 dist t 4 r b 4 σ 4 where τ 4 dist is the l kurtosis coefficient of the three parameter distribution t 4 r the regional average l kurtosis coefficient σ 4 the standard deviation of t 4 r which can be obtained by repeated simulation of a homogeneous region whose sites have the selected three parameter frequency distribution and record lengths the same as those of the observed data and b 4 is the bias in the regional average l kurtosis for regions with the same number of sites and the same record lengths as the observed data the fit of a specific distribution is considered to be adequate if the value of statistics z dist is below or the same as 1 64 at the significance degree of 90 by applying the flood index method the quantiles qi at a site i can then be obtained by 5 q i f μ i q f i 1 n being μi the flood index average of data at site i besides the lack of long data series in some cases there is a lack of spatial information so a regular rfa cannot be performed in this case the regionalization technique can be applied in a single station de salas and fernández 2007 the station now becomes the region and the sites of the region are the available data series of different duration this method is called the in site regional frequency analysis irfa and can be applied at any location where rainfall records of around 10 min to 24 h duration are available allowing the development of robust quantiles estimations ayuso muñoz et al 2015 the following steps to be followed are the same as stated before 3 3 idf formulation regardless of the statistical frequency analysis performed once the quantiles of rainfall are obtained for different durations an idf model can be fitted the most widely used approach consists of using a parametric model characterized typically from 2 to 4 parameters as the number of parameters increases the uncertainty of the estimations is amplified as well di baldassarre et al 2006a b several idf equations can be found e g chow 1964 bell 1969 chen 1983 garcía bartual and schneider 2001 being the one known as montana curve one of the most widely used di baldassarre et al 2006a 6 i t d a d b 1 where a and b are the parameters that depend on the return period this equation shows some limitations for describing the behavior of short term storms of less than 1 h di baldassarre et al 2006a nevertheless considering that it is widely used in the region of the present study and that the work is focused on durations higher than 1 h it has been chosen as idf model 3 4 fractals and idf as veneziano and furcolo 2002 stated most of the models of idf curves belongs to self similar models that satisfy simple scaling relations or asymptotically self similar models while the idf curves satisfy simple scaling relations temporal rainfall has multifractal scale invariance in engineering practice the scaling relations between some idf models and some multifractal parameters can be relevant they can be used to obtain probable maximum precipitation estimates casas castillo et al 2018 rainfall values of low durations by downscaling rodríguez solá et al 2017 or rainfall values in un gauged sites ghanmi et al 2016 one can consider i t d d h i t 1 7 being h the self similarity index d the duration i t d the intensity value with probability 1 t and t the return period on the other hand in approximation and for large t 8 i t 1 t α where α is a constant benjoudi et al 1997 1999 for any finite range of t and d 0 veneziano and furcolo 2002 obtained that h γ 1 and α 1 q 1 where γ 1 is the value of γ where the codimension function c γ equals 1 and q1 is the associated moment order the scaling of idf can be then expressed by 9 i t d d γ 1 t 1 q 1 the parameters γ 1 and q1 can be obtained from k q function from the linear behavior of the field for q values greater than a given moment and be related to the slope of the idf obtained for a certain location thus for each return period analyzed the absolute value of the idf slopes b 1 equation 6 should be close to the γ 1 value obtained from the multifractal analysis of rainfall data at the same place moreover the slope of the line obtained from plotting the mean rainfall intensity values of several duration for different return periods should be close to the value 1 q 1 garcía marín et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 multifractal analysis of hourly rainfall in the umbria region to obtain the empirical moments scaling exponent function k q for the hourly rainfall data series in the 23 rain gauge stations available table 1 the log log plot of the qth average moments of the rainfall intensity ε λ against the scale ratio λ has to be obtained at each place fig 2 shows this plot for three sites casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro as it can be observed straight lines appear for moments higher fig 2a and lower fig 2b than 1 these straight lines give information about the scaling behavior of the moments observed in the range from 1 h to 21 days for the three sites similar values have been found by other authors for different locations e g ladoy et al 1991 1993 fraedrich and larnder 1993 svensson et al 1996 tessier et al 1996 labat et al 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 rodríguez solá et al 2013 the same scale invariance regimens have been found for the hourly rainfall data of the other stations in the umbria region the empirical function k q has been then obtained for the scale regimen detected and for all the sites in fig 3 the function k q for the same stations of fig 2 is shown in all three cases it shows a convex shape that gives information about the multifractal behavior of hourly rainfall at the umbria region important information for the present work can be obtained from k q function like the singularity values γ 1 the value for this parameter varies from 0 7219 for casacastalda to 0 7945 for san benedetto vecchio with a value of 0 7491 for san silvestro table 2 shows the values of γ 1 obtained from the scaling functions at all the sites analyzed found to vary from 0 7125 to 0 8242 similar results have been found by garcía marín et al 2013 and rodríguez solá et al 2017 for rainfall data in spanish stations the value of moment order q1 associated to γ 1 is also shown in table 2 for all the sites and in fig 3 for the selected stations 4 2 quantile estimation for the 23 rain gauges the extreme annual rainfall data series are obtained by selecting the maximum rainfall value of certain duration for durations of 1 3 6 12 and 24 h for each year of data the three different frequency analysis methods described in section 3 have been applied firstly a lfa for each extreme data series at each location secondly a rfa of extreme rainfall data for each duration considering all the sites and finally an irfa at each location for the local analysis the gev probability distribution function has been used obtaining quantiles values of extreme rainfall for return periods of 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years for each duration a rfa has been performed rfaih with i 1 3 6 12 and 24 h obtaining the results summarized in table 3 as first step the existence of discordant sites was checked by obtaining the values of di equation 2 for the hourly extreme rainfall regional frequency analysis rfa1h only petrelle station was found discordant and was taken out of the analysis two sites resulted discordant for rfa3h compignano and san biagio della valle and two more for the rfa12h being narni scalo and san benedetto vecchio for rfa6h and rfa24h no sites were found to be discordant the heterogeneity measure of the region compound by the remaining stations was then evaluated with equation 3 the values of h were found lower than one for rfa1h 0 11 rfa3h 0 90 rfa12h 0 54 and rfa24h 0 97 these results show the homogeneity of the regions constituted by the considered stations for the selected durations for rfa6h the initial value of h was 1 96 which indicated that the region was probably heterogeneous and so it was divided into sub regions following the methodology proposed by garcía marín et al 2015 the multifractal characteristics of rainfall data were used to divide the rfa6h region into two regions with the values of γ 1 and k 0 table 2 a k means cluster analysis was performed and two groups of sites were obtained two new regional frequency analyses were done rfa6ha and rfa6hb the first group was initially composed by 9 sites whereas 14 stations formed the second petrelle station was discordant again so finally two groups stayed one with 8 sites and one with 14 stations table 3 both groups were found to be homogeneous according to the values of h parameter being 0 23 for rfa6ha and 0 83 for rfa6hb respectively once the homogeneous regions have been compounded the growth curves are necessary in order to finally obtain the quantiles at all the sites for this purpose the goodness of a probability distribution function pdf in fitting the regional data has to be studied through the value of zdist equation 4 five three parameter probability distribution functions were tested being the generalized logistic gen log generalized extreme value gev generalized normal gen nor pearson type iii pt iii and generalized pareto gen par table 4 shows the values of statistics zdist obtained by applying equation 4 for all the homogeneous regions and probability distribution functions according to these results the most appropriate function for each region is the one that gives the lowest value of z dist between 0 and 1 64 based on that the gev pdf is the most appropriate for rfa3h rfa6ha and rfa24h the gen nor pdf is the best one for rfa6hb and rfa12h whereas gen log is the most suitable for rfa1h the regional growth curves for each region can then be obtained with the selected probability distribution functions for several return periods table 5 for each duration considering the calculated growth curve and the average datum at each site the quantiles for different return periods were obtained by applying the flood index method equation 5 the irfa was then applied at each location considered as one region and each series of a particular duration 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 min 1 3 6 12 and 24 h as one site into the region as it can be seen in table 6 for 15 out of 23 in site regions all durations sites formed a homogeneous region with h values less than 1 00 for the in site regions forsivo gubbio and la cima some sites were found to be discordant and were removed from the analysis 5 and 24 h in forsivo 24 h in gubbio and 5 10 15 20 in la cima once the discordant sites were eliminated the in site regions became homogeneous according to the h values table 6 in site regions of montelovesco and san biagio della valle formed a homogeneous region considering all sites with h values of 0 57 and 2 07 respectively nevertheless no probability distribution function was found as a good candidate to fit the in site regional data according to the values of zdist obtained for montelovesco two subregions were formed one for durations less than one hour and another for durations greater than one hour table 6 both of them were homogeneous petrelle in site region was heterogeneous considering all sites so two subregions were formed and homogeneity results were obtained table 6 for san biagio della valle some sites were removed in order to form a homogeneous region the final in site homogeneous region was compounded by 7 sites from 30 to 24 h similar situation occurred for san benedetto vecchio station where a final homogeneous region was formed removing some sites table 6 the regional growth curves for each in site region were then obtained with the selected probability distribution functions for several return periods table 7 as an example and in order to compare the different approaches the local regional and in site regional quantiles for 24 h and 50 years of return period are shown in fig 4 notice that the values are missing for forsivo and gubbio where 24 h duration was removed from the in site regional frequency analysis as it can be seen in this figure there is no a general pattern in the values obtained by the different methodologies for 8 sites out of 23 34 8 local quantiles are the highest for 10 sites out of 23 43 5 regional quantiles are the highest whereas in site quantiles are the highest only for 4 out of 23 sites 17 4 in any case the different values of quantiles obtained by the three applied methods provide different idf curves and different design storm values thus it is important to select the most appropriate idf curve for each site in order to reproduce adequately the extreme rainfall behavior 4 3 idf fitting all the quantiles of more than one hour of duration obtained by using lfa rfa and irfa have been fitted by the montana idf model equation 7 as an example table 8 shows the values of parameters a and b for casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro it can be noticed that for each site and frequency analysis the parameter b has a constant value for all the return periods this is because when fitting a different b for each ti i 5 200 years value it was observed that in some cases i d t 2 i d t 1 being t 2 t 1 in order to avoid that situation a constant value of b was obtained as the average of all the b values independently estimated for the different return periods 4 4 selection of frequency analysis the scale invariance properties of idf curves and their relationship with multifractal parameters e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 garcía marín et al 2013 are used in this work to select the most appropriate frequency analysis at each site of the umbria region in this context for each site the absolute value of slopes of the estimated idf lines slopeidf has to be close to the value obtained for the singularity value γ1 in the multifractal analysis of the hourly rainfall data table 2 for casacastalda san benedetto vecchio and san silvestro fig 5 a shows slopeidf for each approach and the singularity value γ1 obtained for each location as it can be checked for casacastalda the values obtained for lfa and irfa are lower than γ1 0 7219 being the value for regional frequency analysis very close to the singularity value for san benedetto vecchio station the closest value to γ1 0 7945 is that obtained through lfa whereas at san silvestro station the irfa is the most suitable to reproduce the γ1 value 0 7491 for the same stations fig 5b shows the slope of the fit of the rainfall intensity values averaged over durations for different return periods slopeari the slope value has to be close to the value of 1 q1 obtained for each location table 2 it can be observed that for casacastalda the closest value to 1 q1 0 2222 is the one obtained with rfa being the results obtained with lfa and irfa the worst in san benedetto vecchio station the best result is obtained with lfa whereas irfa is the best to fit 1 q1 0 2667 in san silvestro station according to the results described above the idf curve obtained with quantiles from rfa is the best for casacastalda station the one obtained with local frequency analysis quantiles is the most appropriate for san benedetto vecchio station and the idf curve obtained with quantiles from irfa is the best choice for san silvestro station for the rest of stations the slopeidf and the slopeari values obtained for the three approaches are shown in table 9 the values in table 9 have to be compared to those in table 2 γ1 q1 in order to select the best idf curve at each location to better synthetize the results of fig 5 and table 9 the values of γ 1 s l o p e idf 2 and slop e ari 1 q 1 have been obtained for each site and frequency analysis and shown in table 10 e g garcía marín et al 2013 for each multifractal criterium the green values indicate when the lfa is the best the red values have the same meaning but for rfa and the blue ones correspond to the best results for irfa combining both multifractal criteria a decision can be made and a proper frequency analysis can be selected for each site the selected frequency analysis at each location is shown in bold table 10 shows that only for three sites città di castello ripalvella and san benedetto vecchio stations the lfa is the best option irfa exhibits to be the best choice only at san silvestro station rfa is the most appropriate frequency analysis for 14 out of 23 sites for the rest of stations 5 very close results have been obtained for all frequency analyses but no coincidence of the two multifractal criteria has been found 5 conclusions the scaling properties of idf curves are used in this work to select the proper frequency analysis method to obtain quantiles of rainfall in the umbria region italy with this purpose rainfall data series from 23 rainfall gauges were used the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall were evaluated by applying the statistical moments scaling method the empirical function k q was obtained at each place and some important multifractal parameters were identified γ1 q1 and the value of k 0 three frequency analyses of annual maximum rainfall data for different durations have been considered local regional and in site regional frequency analyses for the local frequency analysis the gev probability distribution function was used and the local quantiles were obtained the regional frequency analysis proposed by hosking and wallis 1997 was performed for each duration and homogeneous regions of annual maximum rainfall were composed different probability distribution functions were tested at each region in order to obtain the regional growth curves and the corresponding quantiles at each location the regional frequency analysis was also applied at each station in site regional frequency analysis considering the site as a region and the maximum annual rainfall data series as the sites of the region and the quantiles were derived different quantile values were obtained at each station for the different frequency analyses approaches with no regular pattern for the highest or lowest values for a certain approach the rainfall quantiles obtained through the different approaches were fitted by the montana idf curve then following the theory proposed by veneziano and furcolo 2002 the values of γ1 were compared with the absolute value of slopes of the different idf curves and the values of 1 q1 were compared to the slope of mean rainfall intensity versus return period fit these comparisons between multifractal parameters and idf properties let to select the most appropriate frequency analysis at each location the regional frequency analysis gave the best results for the 61 of stations closely followed by the local frequency analysis that was the best option for the 13 of sites the in site regional frequency analysis was the most appropriate only in one station and for five more similar values were obtained with the three frequency analysis approaches thus the analysis of the scaling behavior of rainfall proposed here seems to be a good tool to decide which frequency analysis is adequate at a certain place lastly the scaling behavior of rainfall can be analyzed through data sets with time resolution that can vary from fine e g veneziano and furcolo 2002 rodríguez solá et al 2017 to coarse e g garcía marín et al 2015 casas castillo et al 2018 when scale invariance is found in a data set the downscaling or upscaling of maximum rainfall data can be performed this last procedure let to obtain both quantiles and idf relations at places where no fine time resolution data are available therefore different types of quantile estimation can be always obtained and the

composed by n sites with extreme annual rainfall data series calculate the l moments of the data series afterwards obtain the values of discordancy di from equation 2 remove from the analysis all the m sites with discordancy values greater than the critical one and repeat this procedure until no discordant site is found with all the non discordant sites calculate the heterogeneity value h by applying equation 3 if h value is greater than one star the process again subdividing region 1 into sub regions if the h value is lower than one the region can be considered as homogeneous and the value of zdist for a number of candidate probability distribution functions p d f has to be obtained by applying equation 4 if the absolute value of zdist is lower than 1 64 all the data of region 1 can be fitted by a p d f consider the one with the lowest z dist and the regional growth curve can be obtained on the contrary fit the data through the wakeby p d f finally obtain the quantile values

6414,this study provides experimental evidence of forchheimer flow and transition between flow regimes from the perspective of particle uniformity coefficient we have designed two series of experiments to investigate the particle size control on forchheimer flow including two kinds of quartz sands with mixed particle sizes according to different mass ratio and five particle sizes mixed according to different uniformity coefficients for the experimental results of two mixed particle sizes the critical reynolds number re corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content besides deviation from darcian flow has been observed from experimental results of mixed five particle sizes specifically the pre darcian flow regime or non darcian flow at low velocity in which the pseudo hydraulic conductivity increases with re has not been observed where the pseudo hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the specific discharge over the hydraulic gradient however the post darcian flow regime or non darcian flow at high velocity in which the pseudo hydraulic conductivity begins to decrease when re reaches a certain value has been identified in contrast above observations are absent in experiments using single size particles even when the size of the single size particles is the same as the mean size of the mixed size particles a greater discrepancy among the particle sizes in the mixed size particles used in the flow experiments results in a lower pseudo hydraulic conductivity even when the mean size of the mixed size particles remains the same the degree of deviation from the darcian flow has been quantified and the relation between a newly defined reynolds number for forchheimer flow ref and the friction factor are constructed our experiments show that when ref is greater than 0 1 the experimental data begin to deviate from darcian flow considerably this study shows that the uniformity coefficient of porous media which is a term used to describe the pore size distribution is a critical factor for determining the flow regimes besides the mean particle sizes keywords non darcian flow experiment with mixed size particles relative error particle size heterogeneity 1 introduction the hallmark of darcy s law darcy 1857 is a linear relationship between the specific discharge and the hydraulic gradient and any deviation from such a linear relationship is regarded as non darcian flow bear 1975 in 1901 forchheimer 1901 proposed a widely used non darcian flow equation as follow 1 j a q b q 2 where j is the hydraulic gradient and q is the specific discharge a and b are constants related to fluid properties and pore structure in addition to the forchheimer equation another commonly used non darcian flow equation namely the izbash equation izbash 1931 is written as 2 j a q b where a and b are coefficients that depend on flow and materials properties and b is between 1 and 2 in general the forchheimer equation is more popular than the izbash equation because the former has the capability of covering a wide range of velocity spectrum as the second term on the right side of eq 1 becomes negligible when q becomes sufficiently small besides the theoretical background of the forchheimer equations has been justified panfilov and fourar 2006 panfilov et al 2003 while the eq 2 is an empirical formula therefore this study will concern the forchheimer equation only for describing non darcian flow the forchheimer equation was supported by experimental data for a wide range of reynolds number re defined as re qd ρ w μ where d is particle diameter μ is the dynamic viscosity which is related to the kinematic viscosity υ as υ μ ρ w where ρ w is the density of water the parameters a represents energy losses due to viscous forces at the fluid solid interface while the parameters b is related to inertial forces the parameters a and b in eq 1 were discussed in various experimental investigations for instance blick 1966 considered a mixed model of a bundle of parallel capillary tubes with orifice plates spaced along each tube ergun 1952 extended the kozeny carman model and proposed an expression of forchheimer equation besides similar expressions to ergun 1952 were derived by kovács 1981 and he analyzed a set of 300 data in the range of 10 re 100 and derived the formulae for the case of homodisperse spherical particles macdonald et al 1979 carried out the formula by relatively uniform and smooth particles irmay 1964 proposed a theoretical model for flow in porous media to get the parameters a and b in summary all the forchheimer equations mentioned above have the same pattern and can be written in a uniform form as 3 j α υ g 1 n 2 n 3 d 2 q β 1 n n 3 1 gd q 2 where n is porosity and g is acceleration due to gravity α and β are coefficients related to the pore structure previous experimental results indicated that each forchheimer equation mentioned above may be only suitable for a certain kind of porous media as the values of α and β were different for various media even when the mean particle sizes remained somewhat the same comiti et al 2000 hao et al 2009 lopik et al 2017 moutsopoulos et al 2009 yamada et al 2005 besides salahi et al 2015 evaluated the experimental results of this research for both kinds of aggregates by means of statistical indicators and comparison of different relationships showed the best empirical equation this indicates that the pore structure and pore size distribution play important roles in determining the flow regime because of its obvious importance understanding the transition of flow regimes between darcian and non darcian flows in porous media becomes a long lasting interest among many investigators concerning fluid flow in porous media however despite of many decades of research the exact interrelationship between the forchheimer parameters and pore structure is still not fully understood in fact most experimental studies were focused on the impact of mean particle size on the transition of flow regimes and various forms of non darcian flow phenomena cheng et al 2008 hao et al 2009 hellström and lundström 2006 huang et al 2013 vollmari et al 2015 it is generally accepted that the non darcian flow is mainly caused by the inertial forces when re is relatively large when the viscous force is dominant a situation occurs for relatively small re eq 1 degrades to darcian equation a 0 b 0 both numerical and experimental investigations have been conducted to determine the transition between darcian and non darcian flows when the inertia effects are taken into account the effects of particle size and mass content ratios on the drag force imposed on spherical particles were discussed by micromechanical simulations in array of spheres with various arrangements and the results indicated that pore structures imposed remarkable effects on transition of flow regimes in porous media beetstra et al 2007 kriebitzsch et al 2013 sarkar et al 2009 van der hoef et al 2005 besides using electrochemical technique to investigate microscopic characterization of flow regimes the critical re at the transition from darcian to non darcian flows was found to be around 110 and 370 bu et al 2014 dybbs and edwards 1984 latifi et al 1989 it was further found that the values of critical re increased as the mean particle size increased moreover the darcian law was found to be generally invalid when the mean particle size became greater than 2 8 mm li et al 2017 sedghi asl et al 2014 nevertheless consensuses about the influences of pore structure on transition of flow regimes do not appear to exist among hydrogeologists especially for heterogeneous porous media consist of distinctively different particle sizes among the numerous experimental investigations on this matter most studies were focused on the impact of mean particle sizes rather than the particle size distributions this was partially because many of those experiments were conducted using relatively uniform and sometimes idealized spherical or cylindrical shapes of particles fourar et al 2004 hill et al 2001a b reynolds et al 2000 the validity of the findings from such researches on natural and heterogeneous porous media is questionable particular when the degree of heterogeneity becomes a concern recognizing the importance of particle heterogeneity in understanding the transition of flow regimes lopik et al 2017 investigated forchheimer flow in heterogeneous porous media mainly focusing on the effects of particle sizes distribution on the value of forchheimer coefficients however they did not investigate the transition between different flow regimes the focus of this study is not on discussion of parameters a and b instead it mostly concerns the particle size distribution on transition of flow regimes the reasons of doing so are as follows first we find that there is a lack of research on the transition of flow regimes when different particle size distributions are of concern so the purpose of this paper is to fulfill this knowledge gap second after a careful investigation of many previous studies on the discussion of parameters of forchheimer flow or izbash flow we notice that there is still considerable debate and confusion on factors controlling those parameters such as parameters a and b in the forchheimer flow the lack of theoretical breakthrough on the subject is obvious as many proposed expressions of those parameters are empirical in nature however it is interesting and desirable to discuss the parameters a and b from a more fundamental level and compare the findings with previously proposed formulae such an issue appears to be out of the focus of this study and it deserves a separate investigation in the future the purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis on the effects of particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes between darcian and non darcian flows based on a series of laboratory experiments to meet the objectives we have firstly conducted flow experiments in sand columns with two kinds of particle sizes of quartz sands after that we have carried out flow experiments using more heterogeneous porous media consisting of five different sizes of quartz sands finally the effects of particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes are discussed based on the experimental results 2 experimental setup and data analysis the experiments are conducted by the authors in laboratory of hydrogeological research in school of environmental studies at china university of geosciences wuhan to carry out seepage experiment with different particle distributions the experimental apparatus consists of three parts a water supply device a measurement device and test tubes as shown in fig 1 and the physical drawing of the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the water supply device consists of a feed water tank a centrifugal pump a flow regulating valve and water supply pipes water passing through the test tube is collected by a cylindrical tank the centrifugal pump has a three way valve one of which is connected to the water inlet and the other one is connected to the water supply device the measurement device monitors the real time water temperature and pressure the water temperature is measured using a thermometer with a precision of measurement of 0 1 c the water level fluctuation is measured to calculate the flow rate by a pressure transducer cy201 chengdu test llc china in the range of 0 20 kpa with 0 1 accuracy the flow measurement device consists of an exhalent siphon a cylindrical water tank and a pressure transducer there is a pressure tap at the bottom of the cylindrical water tank near the side wall to calculate the flow rate the test tubes are 1500 mm in length with a circular cross section of 100 mm in diameter three pressure transducers are set to measure the pressure drop to minimize the inlet and outlet boundary effects two pressure transducers are 500 mm away from both ends of the tube and one pressure transducer is in the middle the test tubes are made from poly methyl methacrylate pmma or acrylic glass filled with silica sands the particle size distribution is determined using standard sieves and particles of different sizes are then rinsed the dried in an oven at 104 degrees celsius to remove all the water moisture the characteristic features of four particle combinations with each consisting of two kinds of quartz sands with different particle sizes are summarized in table 1 different mean particle sizes are obtained by different particle mass ratios the particle sizes included in table 1 are 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm the characteristics of five different sizes of quartz sands 0 75 mm 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm with different coefficients of uniformity are shown in table 2 the specific discharge q can be calculated using the total flow rate and hydraulic gradient can be calculated using the hydraulic head drop over two pressure transducers the coefficient of uniformity is calculated using 4 cu d 60 d 10 where d 60 and d 10 have been explained in note of table 2 flow rate is one of the most important parameters in this research we used the following methods to get the results first we connected a pressure sensor at the exit of the cylindrical measurement tank of the experimental apparatus see section 7 in fig 1 when the flow rate reaches steady state we start to measure the water pressure and get the time series of water pressure second selecting two different pressures p 1 and p 2 at two different times t 1 and t 2 with considerable elapse between them to obtain the increment of water level inside the cylindrical measurement tank 5 δ h p 2 p 1 ρ w g where ρ w is the density of water and g is acceleration due to gravity then we can get the flow rate q as 6 q δ h a c t 2 t 1 where ac is the cross sectional area of the cylindrical measurement tank we have tested this method with the conventional method of using a stop watch to measure the flow rate and conclude that this method has more accurate besides the porosity is 0 36 for the experiments of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 a mixture of two particle sizes we have first designed the experimental schemes by mixing quartz sands of two different particle sizes for each combination of two particle sizes three different mass ratios of 3 7 5 5 and 7 3 are employed to generate three sets of heterogeneous porous media and a total of four combinations of two particle sizes are presented in table 1 the relationships between the specific discharge q and the hydraulic gradient j of particle mixtures have been plotted in fig 3 a linear approximation of the j q relationship is also presented for reference in fig 3 fig 3 shows that when q is somewhat the same a larger mass proportion of the finer quartz sands will lead to a larger j this is because when the mean particle size gets smaller with an increasing mass portion of the finer particles the mean pore size gets smaller as well and flow resistance becomes stronger thus a larger j is required to attain the same q this figure exhibits obvious deviation from darcian flow regime as q increases and the experimental results are similar to a previous column experiment using a single particle size sand li et al 2017 to further investigate the transition of flow regimes we have plotted the relationship between q and pseudo hydraulic conductivity k or the so called q k relationship which shows that the pseudo hydraulic conductivity changes with the specific discharge rather than being a constant the traditional hydraulic conductivity is the ratio of the specific discharge versus the hydraulic gradient q j and it is a constant if darcy s law is applicable the hydraulic conductivity for darcy flow is denoted as kd for the problem discussed in this manuscript the ratio of q j is not a constant anymore rather it changes with the specific discharge q to distinguish such a changeable ratio of q j from the constant ratio of q j in darcy s law we name it as the pseudo hydraulic conductivity term denoted as k and the pseudo hydraulic conductivity makes only sense for steady state flows in the case of transient flows it cannot be used because the dependence of flow properties of non darcy flows on time is different than the dependence of darcian flows moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2005 this is a strong evidence showing that the linear q k relationship does not hold anymore or flow becomes non darcian when the mean particle size is smaller or the mass proportion of fine particles is larger the q k relationship consists of two distinctive segments for the first segment k increases with the increase of q which is denoted as the pre darcian flow for the second segment after q increases to a certain value k begins to decrease with q which is called the post darcian flow li et al 2017 relationship between q and k is plotted in fig 4 the critical specific discharge corresponding to the transition of flow regimes from pre darcian to post darcian increases with the increase of coarser particle mass ratios above observations reveal some new features about the influence of particle composition on pore structure and its effect on flow law from a mechanical standpoint the resistance of flow in porous media mainly comes from viscous force and inertial force generated by changes of magnitude and direction of specific discharge in pores the proportion of viscous force and inertial force contributions as reflected in water head loss is related to the structural characteristics of porous media mostly the pore size distribution which is dependent on the particle size gradation and arrangement of granular particles 3 2 a mixture of five particle sizes on the basis of above results we have further designed the column experiments with mixtures of quartz sands of five particle sizes 0 75 mm 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm with different mean particle sizes and coefficients of uniformity the detailed characteristics of the mixtures are listed in table 2 the experimental results show that the hydraulic gradient decreases with the decrease of the coefficients of uniformity under the same specific discharge a finding consistent with the results of section 3 1 see fig 5 besides we have plotted the relationship between q and pseudo hydraulic conductivity k to better observe the influence of the coefficients of uniformity on the transition of flow regimes specifically we have compared the results using single size particles with the results of mixed particles with five different particle sizes and have noticed a feature that has never been reported before see fig 6 a number of interesting observations can be made from fig 6 first this figure shows that the pseudo hydraulic conductivity k decreases with the increase of q for mixtures of five particle sizes which means that the post darcian flow prevails but the pre darcian flow is absent however the results obtained from experiments using single size particles with the same mean particle size are drastically different in which k firstly increases with the increase of q and then decreases as q continually increases exhibiting a smooth transition between the pre darcian flow scheme and the post darcian flow scheme second the value of k decreases with the increase of cu third the k values obtained from experiments using single size particles are the smallest as compared with the k values obtained from experiments using mixtures of different particle sizes even when the mean particle sizes are the same this is a strong evidence showing that for mixed particle sizes the use of the mean particle size as the only criterion to characterize the transition of flow regimes is not enough one should consider the particle size distribution as another important criterion to characterize the transition of flow regimes this is because for mixed particle sizes a greater portion of flow would be conducted through larger pores resulting in a greater inertial force effect and consequently a stronger post darcian flow phenomenon in contrast when the pore size is smaller and the particle uniformity coefficient is larger or the pore size distribution is broader the proportion of fine pores is higher resulting in greater viscous flow resistance which favors the darcian flow condition it can be seen from above results that the inertia force can cause additional local head loss due to the change of pore scale flow pathways because of different pore shapes and pore sizes resulting in a nonlinear relation between the hydraulic gradient and the specific discharge 3 3 quantification of non darcian flow from darcian flow to analyze the discrepancy of non darcian flow from darcian flow a term called the relative error is defined as follows 7 η j 0 j j where j 0 is the hydraulic gradient computed by darcy s law based on the experimental results using the following procedures it is notable that moutsopoulos et al 2009 have used the normalized objective function nof as a criterion to quantitatively evaluate the seepage parameters i e parameters a and b in the forchheimer equation where nof is the ratio of the root mean square error rmse to the overall mean of the experimental data as the focus of this paper is not on discussion of parameters a and b instead it mostly concerns the particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes we found eq 7 of this study is more relevant and convenient to use being said so it will be interesting in the future to compare eq 7 with the nof method of moutsopoulos et al 2009 at first we attempt to identify a linear segment based on the data points of relatively small q values and fit this linear segment with darcy s law to obtain the darcian flow hydraulic conductivity denoted as kd after this step we can obtain j 0 by j 0 k d q li et al 2017 the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 for mixtures of two and five particle sizes respectively the experimental results for a mixture of two particle sizes show that the relative error first decreases with re and then increases with re fig 7 the re value corresponding to the minimum relative error is denoted as the critical re hereinafter one can see that the critical re increases as the coarser particle mass ratio increases when the critical re is in the range of 1 10 indicating that the particle mixing ratio also influences the transition of flow regimes besides the mean particle size li et al 2017 this is because the porous media with a greater portion of coarser particles will be more conductive thus will lead to a larger specific discharge under the same hydraulic gradient resulting in a larger critical re the experimental results for a mixture of five particle sizes are somewhat different from those for a mixture of two particle sizes with a number of interesting observations see fig 8 first when the mean particle size is relatively small such as 1 075 mm and 1 475 mm the relationship between the relative error and re is similar with that for a mixture with two particle sizes and the critical re shows an increasing trend with the increases of cu second when the mean particle size reaches 1 85 mm one can only observe the rising limb between the relative error and re fig 8 this is because as the mean particle size increases to a certain extent the inertial force effect becomes non negligible even at relatively low re value third comparing experiments of a mixture with five particle sizes with those of single particle sizes the critical re value for mixture of five particle sizes is smaller when its mean particle size is the same as the single particle size suggesting that the flow regime transfers to the post darcian flow earlier than that for the single particle sizes this is due to heterogeneous pore size distribution that results in a stronger inertial force effect from the experimental point of view we can qualitatively or semi quantitatively analyze the results and a precise quantitative description of the transition of flow in porous media is quite challenging and may require a high resolution numerical simulation considering the pore morphology this is the task we will explore in the future in general a larger value of cu would promote the post darcian flow effect due to preferential flow in large pores with heterogeneous pore size distribution therefore the relative error for a mixture of five particle sizes is greater during the post darcian flow regime than that for single particle sizes when re is somewhat the same fig 8 as discussed above both mean particle size and particle size distributions could affect the characteristics of head loss and transition of flow regime in porous media thus the range of re for different flow regimes and the critical re for transition between flow regimes vary with the mean particle size d and the coefficient of uniformity cu correspondingly it is difficult if not impossible to create a decisive criterion for validation of darcian or non darcian flow only based on the value of traditionally defined re therefore in the following we will propose a new quantitative method of differentiating darcian flow from non darcian flow li et al 2017 zeng and grigg 2006 the relative error analysis results show that the relative errors are smaller at low q or low re especially near the transition to post darcian flow fig 8 when the inertial force is insignificant as q increases to some extent the inertia force becomes considerable and darcy s law becomes invalid from the forchheimer eq 1 one can see that the hydraulic gradient consists of two terms a quadratic term of q and a linear term of q one may regard the quadratic term of q reflects the inertial force contribution and the linear term of q reflects the viscous force contribution therefore the ratio of the quadratic term to hydraulic gradient could be chosen as the criterion for validation of darcian or non darcian flow therefore we define an inertial index e as follow 8 e b q 2 j b q 2 aq b q 2 where e represents the relative contribution of the inertial force to flow now if dividing both sides of eq 1 by bq 2 one has 9 j b q 2 a bq 1 where a bq is the ratio of viscous force to inertial force now recalling the definition of reynolds number which is essentially the ratio of inertial force over viscous force one may define a new reynolds number r e f when the forchheimer equation is valid as 10 r e f bq a we need to emphasize that this study will concern the forchheimer equation only for describing non darcian flow besides darcy weisbach s head loss expression for flow through porous media is then according to sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 11 δ h f l d q 2 2 g where δ h is the loss of hydraulic head f is the friction factor and l is the length of water flow it is notable that various scholars may use slightly different forms of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow here in eq 11 we have employed the specific discharge q directly in the formulae some investigators however may use the actual groundwater flow velocity v instead of q in the darcy weisbach equation where v q ne and ne is the effective porosity if the actual groundwater flow velocity is used instead of the specific discharge in above eq 11 a different friction factor f f n e 2 should be used where f is the friction factor corresponding to the use of specific discharge in eq 11 it is necessary to elaborate on the applicability of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow before proceeding with the following computation indeed the darcy weisbach equation is originally proposed for dealing with flow in an open conduit munson et al 2014 for instance chen et al 2003 have used the darcy weisbach equation to study a coupled horizontal well aquifer flow system this equation has later been applied for studying porous media flow based on a few considerations flow in a porous media system can be envisaged as flow in an ensemble of tortuous conduits with various sizes such a conceptual model of porous media has been widely used in developing classical theories in porous media flow bear 2013 the use of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow has to acknowledge the characteristics of pore structure which determines the pore conduits sizes and tortuosity and eventually leads to different friction factor for the equation numerous studies have adopted the darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow for example tamayol and bahrami 2009 studied the permeability of touching and non touching ordered fibrous media towards normal and parallel flow and the triangular the rectangular and the hexagonal arrangements can map a porous medium in addition several touching fibers arrangements and the permeability were calculated by darcy weisbach equation shin and park 2017 deduced a permeability relationship that can consider the geometric features of various porous media under different flow regimes and the conventional darcy weisbach relation was reviewed and expanded for porous flow analysis with reference to the previous works of kozeny and carman model sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 combined the manning s formula for open channel flow with the darcy weisbach s friction loss in open pipes to obtain a new relation for pressure drop in porous media rockfill bağcı et al 2014 a minor point to note is that the terminology used by sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is slightly different from this study for instance the symbol of v in sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is actually the specific discharge q of this study and the symbol of vp in sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is the actual groundwater flow velocity v of this study the hydraulic gradient j δ h l therefore one can get the friction factor f as follow 12 f 2 g d j q 2 now considering eqs 1 and 12 one has 13 f 2 g d b 1 a bq defining a normalized friction factor f n f 2 g d b and recalling eq 13 one has 14 f n 1 1 r e f f n 1 e one can see from eq 14 that the normalized friction factor fn is essentially the inverse of inertial index e according to eq 14 the f n r e f curves are drawn using the experimental data in figs 9 and 10 the results show that the experimental data gradually deviate from the straight segment when f n is less than 10 or e 10 which shows obvious non darcian flow characteristics therefore the corresponding critical r e f can be determined through the inertial index e for instance taking e of 10 as the criterion of non darcian flow it is evident from figs 9 and 10 that the corresponding critical r e f is 0 1 another noticeable point of figs 9 and 10 is that all the experimental data fall in a curve deviated upward from a linear trend when r e f is greater than its critical value of 0 1 from a practical point of view one may use the critical r e f value of 0 1 as a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime when the forchheimer equation is valid 4 summary and conclusions this study presents experimental results of forchheimer flow in porous media consisting of mixtures of 1 two different particle sizes using different mass ratios and 2 five different particle sizes using different coefficients of uniformity the effects of mean particle size and particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes is discussed in addition a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime is proposed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the experimental results of flow in mixtures of two different particle sizes show that obvious deviation from darcian flow regime is visible as the specific discharge q increases and the critical reynolds number corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content 2 the experimental results of flow in mixtures of five different particle sizes show that only the post darcian flow has been observed and the pre darcian flow is absent however the flow regimes obtained from experiments with homogeneous media or single particle sizes are completely different from those with heterogeneous media or mixtures of five different particle sizes even when the mean particle size of the heterogeneous media is the same as the particle size of the homogeneous media a stronger heterogeneity of media leads to a lower pseudo hydraulic conductivity value even when the mean particle size remains the same 3 for the mixtures of two particle sizes the mass ratio of these two particle sizes also influences the transition of flow regimes resulting in a larger critical reynolds number with more coarser particles however the results for the mixtures of five different particle sizes are somewhat different comparing with experiments in homogeneous media with a single particle size the flow regime transfers to post darcian flow earlier due to the media heterogeneity 4 the expression of inertial index and the relation between r e f and f n are constructed the non darcian flow criterion applicable to different pore media is established the critical r e f value of 0 1 is identified as a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime when the forchheimer equation is valid

6414,this study provides experimental evidence of forchheimer flow and transition between flow regimes from the perspective of particle uniformity coefficient we have designed two series of experiments to investigate the particle size control on forchheimer flow including two kinds of quartz sands with mixed particle sizes according to different mass ratio and five particle sizes mixed according to different uniformity coefficients for the experimental results of two mixed particle sizes the critical reynolds number re corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content besides deviation from darcian flow has been observed from experimental results of mixed five particle sizes specifically the pre darcian flow regime or non darcian flow at low velocity in which the pseudo hydraulic conductivity increases with re has not been observed where the pseudo hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the specific discharge over the hydraulic gradient however the post darcian flow regime or non darcian flow at high velocity in which the pseudo hydraulic conductivity begins to decrease when re reaches a certain value has been identified in contrast above observations are absent in experiments using single size particles even when the size of the single size particles is the same as the mean size of the mixed size particles a greater discrepancy among the particle sizes in the mixed size particles used in the flow experiments results in a lower pseudo hydraulic conductivity even when the mean size of the mixed size particles remains the same the degree of deviation from the darcian flow has been quantified and the relation between a newly defined reynolds number for forchheimer flow ref and the friction factor are constructed our experiments show that when ref is greater than 0 1 the experimental data begin to deviate from darcian flow considerably this study shows that the uniformity coefficient of porous media which is a term used to describe the pore size distribution is a critical factor for determining the flow regimes besides the mean particle sizes keywords non darcian flow experiment with mixed size particles relative error particle size heterogeneity 1 introduction the hallmark of darcy s law darcy 1857 is a linear relationship between the specific discharge and the hydraulic gradient and any deviation from such a linear relationship is regarded as non darcian flow bear 1975 in 1901 forchheimer 1901 proposed a widely used non darcian flow equation as follow 1 j a q b q 2 where j is the hydraulic gradient and q is the specific discharge a and b are constants related to fluid properties and pore structure in addition to the forchheimer equation another commonly used non darcian flow equation namely the izbash equation izbash 1931 is written as 2 j a q b where a and b are coefficients that depend on flow and materials properties and b is between 1 and 2 in general the forchheimer equation is more popular than the izbash equation because the former has the capability of covering a wide range of velocity spectrum as the second term on the right side of eq 1 becomes negligible when q becomes sufficiently small besides the theoretical background of the forchheimer equations has been justified panfilov and fourar 2006 panfilov et al 2003 while the eq 2 is an empirical formula therefore this study will concern the forchheimer equation only for describing non darcian flow the forchheimer equation was supported by experimental data for a wide range of reynolds number re defined as re qd ρ w μ where d is particle diameter μ is the dynamic viscosity which is related to the kinematic viscosity υ as υ μ ρ w where ρ w is the density of water the parameters a represents energy losses due to viscous forces at the fluid solid interface while the parameters b is related to inertial forces the parameters a and b in eq 1 were discussed in various experimental investigations for instance blick 1966 considered a mixed model of a bundle of parallel capillary tubes with orifice plates spaced along each tube ergun 1952 extended the kozeny carman model and proposed an expression of forchheimer equation besides similar expressions to ergun 1952 were derived by kovács 1981 and he analyzed a set of 300 data in the range of 10 re 100 and derived the formulae for the case of homodisperse spherical particles macdonald et al 1979 carried out the formula by relatively uniform and smooth particles irmay 1964 proposed a theoretical model for flow in porous media to get the parameters a and b in summary all the forchheimer equations mentioned above have the same pattern and can be written in a uniform form as 3 j α υ g 1 n 2 n 3 d 2 q β 1 n n 3 1 gd q 2 where n is porosity and g is acceleration due to gravity α and β are coefficients related to the pore structure previous experimental results indicated that each forchheimer equation mentioned above may be only suitable for a certain kind of porous media as the values of α and β were different for various media even when the mean particle sizes remained somewhat the same comiti et al 2000 hao et al 2009 lopik et al 2017 moutsopoulos et al 2009 yamada et al 2005 besides salahi et al 2015 evaluated the experimental results of this research for both kinds of aggregates by means of statistical indicators and comparison of different relationships showed the best empirical equation this indicates that the pore structure and pore size distribution play important roles in determining the flow regime because of its obvious importance understanding the transition of flow regimes between darcian and non darcian flows in porous media becomes a long lasting interest among many investigators concerning fluid flow in porous media however despite of many decades of research the exact interrelationship between the forchheimer parameters and pore structure is still not fully understood in fact most experimental studies were focused on the impact of mean particle size on the transition of flow regimes and various forms of non darcian flow phenomena cheng et al 2008

when the viscous force is dominant a situation occurs for relatively small re eq 1 degrades to darcian equation a 0 b 0 both numerical and experimental investigations have been conducted to determine the transition between darcian and non darcian flows when the inertia effects are taken into account the effects of particle size and mass content ratios on the drag force imposed on spherical particles were discussed by micromechanical simulations in array of spheres with various arrangements and the results indicated that pore structures imposed remarkable effects on transition of flow regimes in porous media beetstra et al 2007 kriebitzsch et al 2013 sarkar et al 2009 van der hoef et al 2005 besides using electrochemical technique to investigate microscopic characterization of flow regimes the critical re at the transition from darcian to non darcian flows was found to be around 110 and 370 bu et al 2014 dybbs and edwards 1984 latifi et al 1989 it was further found that the values of critical re increased as the mean particle size increased moreover the darcian law was found to be generally invalid when the mean particle size became greater than 2 8 mm li et al 2017 sedghi asl et al 2014 nevertheless consensuses about the influences of pore structure on transition of flow regimes do not appear to exist among hydrogeologists especially for heterogeneous porous media consist of distinctively different particle sizes among the numerous experimental investigations on this matter most studies were focused on the impact of mean particle sizes rather than the particle size distributions this was partially because many of those experiments were conducted using relatively uniform and sometimes idealized spherical or cylindrical shapes of particles fourar et al 2004 hill et al 2001a b reynolds et al 2000 the validity of the findings from such researches on natural and heterogeneous porous media is questionable particular when the degree of heterogeneity becomes a concern recognizing the importance of particle heterogeneity in understanding the transition of flow regimes lopik et al 2017 investigated forchheimer flow in heterogeneous porous media mainly focusing on the effects of particle sizes distribution on the value of forchheimer coefficients however they did not investigate the transition between different flow regimes the focus of this study is not on discussion of parameters a and b instead it mostly concerns the particle size distribution on transition of flow regimes the reasons of doing so are as follows first we find that there is a lack of research on the transition of flow regimes when different particle size distributions are of concern so the purpose of this paper is to fulfill this knowledge gap second after a careful investigation of many previous studies on the discussion of parameters of forchheimer flow or izbash flow we notice that there is still considerable debate and confusion on factors controlling those parameters such as parameters a and b in the forchheimer flow the lack of theoretical breakthrough on the subject is obvious as many proposed expressions of those parameters are empirical in nature however it is interesting and desirable to discuss the parameters a and b from a more fundamental level and compare the findings with previously proposed formulae such an issue appears to be out of the focus of this study and it deserves a separate investigation in the future the purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis on the effects of particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes between darcian and non darcian flows based on a series of laboratory experiments to meet the objectives we have firstly conducted flow experiments in sand columns with two kinds of particle sizes of quartz sands after that we have carried out flow experiments using more heterogeneous porous media consisting of five different sizes of quartz sands finally the effects of particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes are discussed based on the experimental results 2 experimental setup and data analysis the experiments are conducted by the authors in laboratory of hydrogeological research in school of environmental studies at china university of geosciences wuhan to carry out seepage experiment with different particle distributions the experimental apparatus consists of three parts a water supply device a measurement device and test tubes as shown in fig 1 and the physical drawing of the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the water supply device consists of a feed water tank a centrifugal pump a flow regulating valve and water supply pipes water passing through the test tube is collected by a cylindrical tank the centrifugal pump has a three way valve one of which is connected to the water inlet and the other one is connected to the water supply device the measurement device monitors the real time water temperature and pressure the water temperature is measured using a thermometer with a precision of measurement of 0 1 c the water level fluctuation is measured to calculate the flow rate by a pressure transducer cy201 chengdu test llc china in the range of 0 20 kpa with 0 1 accuracy the flow measurement device consists of an exhalent siphon a cylindrical water tank and a pressure transducer there is a pressure tap at the bottom of the cylindrical water tank near the side wall to calculate the flow rate the test tubes are 1500 mm in length with a circular cross section of 100 mm in diameter three pressure transducers are set to measure the pressure drop to minimize the inlet and outlet boundary effects two pressure transducers are 500 mm away from both ends of the tube and one pressure transducer is in the middle the test tubes are made from poly methyl methacrylate pmma or acrylic glass filled with silica sands the particle size distribution is determined using standard sieves and particles of different sizes are then rinsed the dried in an oven at 104 degrees celsius to remove all the water moisture the characteristic features of four particle combinations with each consisting of two kinds of quartz sands with different particle sizes are summarized in table 1 different mean particle sizes are obtained by different particle mass ratios the particle sizes included in table 1 are 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm the characteristics of five different sizes of quartz sands 0 75 mm 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm with different coefficients of uniformity are shown in table 2 the specific discharge q can be calculated using the total flow rate and hydraulic gradient can be calculated using the hydraulic head drop over two pressure transducers the coefficient of uniformity is calculated using 4 cu d 60 d 10 where d 60 and d 10 have been explained in note of table 2 flow rate is one of the most important parameters in this research we used the following methods to get the results first we connected a pressure sensor at the exit of the cylindrical measurement tank of the experimental apparatus see section 7 in fig 1 when the flow rate reaches steady state we start to measure the water pressure and get the time series of water pressure second selecting two different pressures p 1 and p 2 at two different times t 1 and t 2 with considerable elapse between them to obtain the increment of water level inside the cylindrical measurement tank 5 δ h p 2 p 1 ρ w g where ρ w is the density of water and g is acceleration due to gravity then we can get the flow rate q as 6 q δ h a c t 2 t 1 where ac is the cross sectional area of the cylindrical measurement tank we have tested this method with the conventional method of using a stop watch to measure the flow rate and conclude that this method has more accurate besides the porosity is 0 36 for the experiments of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 a mixture of two particle sizes we have first designed the experimental schemes by mixing quartz sands of two different particle sizes for each combination of two particle sizes three different mass ratios of 3 7 5 5 and 7 3 are employed to generate three sets of heterogeneous porous media and a total of four combinations of two particle sizes are presented in table 1 the relationships between the specific discharge q and the hydraulic gradient j of particle mixtures have been plotted in fig 3 a linear approximation of the j q relationship is also presented for reference in fig 3 fig 3 shows that when q is somewhat the same a larger mass proportion of the finer quartz sands will lead to a larger j this is because when the mean particle size gets smaller with an increasing mass portion of the finer particles the mean pore size gets smaller as well and flow resistance becomes stronger thus a larger j is required to attain the same q this figure exhibits obvious deviation from darcian flow regime as q increases and the experimental results are similar to a previous column experiment using a single particle size sand li et al 2017 to further investigate the transition of flow regimes we have plotted the relationship between q and pseudo hydraulic conductivity k or the so called q k relationship which shows that the pseudo hydraulic conductivity changes with the specific discharge rather than being a constant the traditional hydraulic conductivity is the ratio of the specific discharge versus the hydraulic gradient q j and it is a constant if darcy s law is applicable the hydraulic conductivity for darcy flow is denoted as kd for the problem discussed in this manuscript the ratio of q j is not a constant anymore rather it changes with the specific discharge q to distinguish such a changeable ratio of q j from the constant ratio of q j in darcy s law we name it as the pseudo hydraulic conductivity term denoted as k and the pseudo hydraulic conductivity makes only sense for steady state flows in the case of transient flows it cannot be used because the dependence of flow properties of non darcy flows on time is different than the dependence of darcian flows moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2005 this is a strong evidence showing that the linear q k relationship does not hold anymore or flow becomes non darcian when the mean particle size is smaller or the mass proportion of fine particles is larger the q k relationship consists of two distinctive segments for the first segment k increases with the increase of q which is denoted as the pre darcian flow for the second segment after q increases to a certain value k begins to decrease with q which is called the post darcian flow li et al 2017 relationship between q and k is plotted in fig 4 the critical specific discharge corresponding to the transition of flow regimes from pre darcian to post darcian increases with the increase of coarser particle mass ratios above observations reveal some new features about the influence of particle composition on pore structure and its effect on flow law from a mechanical standpoint the resistance of flow in porous media mainly comes from viscous force and inertial force generated by changes of magnitude and direction of specific discharge in pores the proportion of viscous force and inertial force contributions as reflected in water head loss is related to the structural characteristics of porous media mostly the pore size distribution which is dependent on the particle size gradation and arrangement of granular particles 3 2 a mixture of five particle sizes on the basis of above results we have further designed the column experiments with mixtures of quartz sands of five particle sizes 0 75 mm 1 075 mm 1 475 mm 1 85 mm and 3 17 mm with different mean particle sizes and coefficients of uniformity the detailed characteristics of the mixtures are listed in table 2 the experimental results show that the hydraulic gradient decreases with the decrease of the coefficients of uniformity under the same specific discharge a finding consistent with the results of section 3 1 see fig 5 besides we have plotted the relationship between q and pseudo hydraulic conductivity k to better observe the influence of the coefficients of uniformity on the transition of flow regimes specifically we have compared the results using single size particles with the results of mixed particles with five different particle sizes and have noticed a feature that has never been reported before see fig 6 a number of interesting observations can be made from fig 6 first this figure shows that the pseudo hydraulic conductivity k decreases with the increase of q for mixtures of five particle sizes which means that the post darcian flow prevails but the pre darcian flow is absent however the results obtained from experiments using single size particles with the same mean particle size are drastically different in which k firstly increases with the increase of q and then decreases as q continually increases exhibiting a smooth transition between the pre darcian flow scheme and the post darcian flow scheme second the value of k decreases with the increase of cu third the k values obtained from experiments using single size particles are the smallest as compared with the k values obtained from experiments using mixtures of different particle sizes even when the mean particle sizes are the same this is a strong evidence showing that for mixed particle sizes the use of the mean particle size as the only criterion to characterize the transition of flow regimes is not enough one should consider the particle size distribution as another important criterion to characterize the transition of flow regimes this is because for mixed particle sizes a greater portion of flow would be conducted through larger pores resulting in a greater inertial force effect and consequently a stronger post darcian flow phenomenon in contrast when the pore size is smaller and the particle uniformity coefficient is larger or the pore size distribution is broader the proportion of fine pores is higher resulting in greater viscous flow resistance which favors the darcian flow condition it can be seen from above results that the inertia force can cause additional local head loss due to the change of pore scale flow pathways because of different pore shapes and pore sizes resulting in a nonlinear relation between the hydraulic gradient and the specific discharge 3 3 quantification of non darcian flow from darcian flow to analyze the discrepancy of non darcian flow from darcian flow a term called the relative error is defined as follows 7 η j 0 j j where j 0 is the hydraulic gradient computed by darcy s law based on the experimental results using the following procedures it is notable that moutsopoulos et al 2009 have used the normalized objective function nof as a criterion to quantitatively evaluate the seepage parameters i e parameters a and b in the forchheimer equation where nof is the ratio of the root mean square error rmse to the overall mean of the experimental data as the focus of this paper is not on discussion of parameters a and b instead it mostly concerns the particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes we found eq 7 of this study is more relevant and convenient to use being said so it will be interesting in the future to compare eq 7 with the nof method of moutsopoulos et al 2009 at first we attempt to identify a linear segment based on the data points of relatively small q values and fit this linear segment with darcy s law to obtain the darcian flow hydraulic conductivity denoted as kd after this step we can obtain j 0 by j 0 k d q li et al 2017 the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 for mixtures of two and five particle sizes respectively the experimental results for a mixture of two particle sizes show that the relative error first decreases with re and then increases with re fig 7 the re value corresponding to the minimum relative error is denoted as the critical re hereinafter one can see that the critical re increases as the coarser particle mass ratio increases when the critical re is in the range of 1 10 indicating that the particle mixing ratio also influences the transition of flow regimes besides the mean particle size li et al 2017 this is because the porous media with a greater portion of coarser particles will be more conductive thus will lead to a larger specific discharge under the same hydraulic gradient resulting in a larger critical re the experimental results for a mixture of five particle sizes are somewhat different from those for a mixture of two particle sizes with a number of interesting observations see fig 8 first when the mean particle size is relatively small such as 1 075 mm and 1 475 mm the relationship between the relative error and re is similar with that for a mixture with two particle sizes and the critical re shows an increasing trend with the increases of cu second when the mean particle size reaches 1 85 mm one can only observe the rising limb between the relative error and re fig 8 this is because as the mean particle size increases to a certain extent the inertial force effect becomes non negligible even at relatively low re value third comparing experiments of a mixture with five particle sizes with those of single particle sizes the critical re value for mixture of five particle sizes is smaller when its mean particle size is the same as the single particle size suggesting that the flow regime transfers to the post darcian flow earlier than that for the single particle sizes this is due to heterogeneous pore size distribution that results in a stronger inertial force effect from the experimental point of view we can qualitatively or semi quantitatively analyze the results and a precise quantitative description of the transition of flow in porous media is quite challenging and may require a high resolution numerical simulation considering the pore morphology this is the task we will explore in the future in general a larger value of cu would promote the post darcian flow effect due to preferential flow in large pores with heterogeneous pore size distribution therefore the relative error for a mixture of five particle sizes is greater during the post darcian flow regime than that for single particle sizes when re is somewhat the same fig 8 as discussed above both mean particle size and particle size distributions could affect the characteristics of head loss and transition of flow regime in porous media thus the range of re for different flow regimes and the critical re for transition between flow regimes vary with the mean particle size d and the coefficient of uniformity cu correspondingly it is difficult if not impossible to create a decisive criterion for validation of darcian or non darcian flow only based on the value of traditionally defined re therefore in the following we will propose a new quantitative method of differentiating darcian flow from non darcian flow li et al 2017 zeng and grigg 2006 the relative error analysis results show that the relative errors are smaller at low q or low re especially near the transition to post darcian flow fig 8 when the inertial force is insignificant as q increases to some extent the inertia force becomes considerable and darcy s law becomes invalid from the forchheimer eq 1 one can see that the hydraulic gradient consists of two terms a quadratic term of q and a linear term of q one may regard the quadratic term of q reflects the inertial force contribution and the linear term of q reflects the viscous force contribution therefore the ratio of the quadratic term to hydraulic gradient could be chosen as the criterion for validation of darcian or non darcian flow therefore we define an inertial index e as follow 8 e b q 2 j b q 2 aq b q 2 where e represents the relative contribution of the inertial force to flow now if dividing both sides of eq 1 by bq 2 one has 9 j b q 2 a bq 1 where a bq is the ratio of viscous force to inertial force now recalling the definition of reynolds number which is essentially the ratio of inertial force over viscous force one may define a new reynolds number r e f when the forchheimer equation is valid as 10 r e f bq a we need to emphasize that this study will concern the forchheimer equation only for describing non darcian flow besides darcy weisbach s head loss expression for flow through porous media is then according to sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 11 δ h f l d q 2 2 g where δ h is the loss of hydraulic head f is the friction factor and l is the length of water flow it is notable that various scholars may use slightly different forms of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow here in eq 11 we have employed the specific discharge q directly in the formulae some investigators however may use the actual groundwater flow velocity v instead of q in the darcy weisbach equation where v q ne and ne is the effective porosity if the actual groundwater flow velocity is used instead of the specific discharge in above eq 11 a different friction factor f f n e 2 should be used where f is the friction factor corresponding to the use of specific discharge in eq 11 it is necessary to elaborate on the applicability of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow before proceeding with the following computation indeed the darcy weisbach equation is originally proposed for dealing with flow in an open conduit munson et al 2014 for instance chen et al 2003 have used the darcy weisbach equation to study a coupled horizontal well aquifer flow system this equation has later been applied for studying porous media flow based on a few considerations flow in a porous media system can be envisaged as flow in an ensemble of tortuous conduits with various sizes such a conceptual model of porous media has been widely used in developing classical theories in porous media flow bear 2013 the use of darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow has to acknowledge the characteristics of pore structure which determines the pore conduits sizes and tortuosity and eventually leads to different friction factor for the equation numerous studies have adopted the darcy weisbach equation for porous media flow for example tamayol and bahrami 2009 studied the permeability of touching and non touching ordered fibrous media towards normal and parallel flow and the triangular the rectangular and the hexagonal arrangements can map a porous medium in addition several touching fibers arrangements and the permeability were calculated by darcy weisbach equation shin and park 2017 deduced a permeability relationship that can consider the geometric features of various porous media under different flow regimes and the conventional darcy weisbach relation was reviewed and expanded for porous flow analysis with reference to the previous works of kozeny and carman model sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 combined the manning s formula for open channel flow with the darcy weisbach s friction loss in open pipes to obtain a new relation for pressure drop in porous media rockfill bağcı et al 2014 a minor point to note is that the terminology used by sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is slightly different from this study for instance the symbol of v in sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is actually the specific discharge q of this study and the symbol of vp in sedghi asl and rahimi 2011 is the actual groundwater flow velocity v of this study the hydraulic gradient j δ h l therefore one can get the friction factor f as follow 12 f 2 g d j q 2 now considering eqs 1 and 12 one has 13 f 2 g d b 1 a bq defining a normalized friction factor f n f 2 g d b and recalling eq 13 one has 14 f n 1 1 r e f f n 1 e one can see from eq 14 that the normalized friction factor fn is essentially the inverse of inertial index e according to eq 14 the f n r e f curves are drawn using the experimental data in figs 9 and 10 the results show that the experimental data gradually deviate from the straight segment when f n is less than 10 or e 10 which shows obvious non darcian flow characteristics therefore the corresponding critical r e f can be determined through the inertial index e for instance taking e of 10 as the criterion of non darcian flow it is evident from figs 9 and 10 that the corresponding critical r e f is 0 1 another noticeable point of figs 9 and 10 is that all the experimental data fall in a curve deviated upward from a linear trend when r e f is greater than its critical value of 0 1 from a practical point of view one may use the critical r e f value of 0 1 as a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime when the forchheimer equation is valid 4 summary and conclusions this study presents experimental results of forchheimer flow in porous media consisting of mixtures of 1 two different particle sizes using different mass ratios and 2 five different particle sizes using different coefficients of uniformity the effects of mean particle size and particle size distribution on the transition of flow regimes is discussed in addition a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime is proposed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the experimental results of flow in mixtures of two different particle sizes show that obvious deviation from darcian flow regime is visible as the specific discharge q increases and the critical reynolds number corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content 2 the experimental results of flow in mixtures of five different particle sizes show that only the post darcian flow has been observed and the pre darcian flow is absent however the flow regimes obtained from experiments with homogeneous media or single particle sizes are completely different from those with heterogeneous media or mixtures of five different particle sizes even when the mean particle size of the heterogeneous media is the same as the particle size of the homogeneous media a stronger heterogeneity of media leads to a lower pseudo hydraulic conductivity value even when the mean particle size remains the same 3 for the mixtures of two particle sizes the mass ratio of these two particle sizes also influences the transition of flow regimes resulting in a larger critical reynolds number with more coarser particles however the results for the mixtures of five different particle sizes are somewhat different comparing with experiments in homogeneous media with a single particle size the flow regime transfers to post darcian flow earlier due to the media heterogeneity 4 the expression of inertial index and the relation between r e f and f n are constructed the non darcian flow criterion applicable to different pore media is established the critical r e f value of 0 1 is identified as a quantitative criterion for the start of non darcian flow regime when the forchheimer equation is valid
