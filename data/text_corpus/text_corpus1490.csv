7450,an analytical solution is developed for predicting two dimensional transient seepage into ditch drainage network receiving water from a non uniform steady ponding field from the surface of the soil under the influence of source sink in the flow domain the flow domain is assumed to be saturated homogeneous and anisotropic in nature and have finite extends in horizontal and vertical directions the drains are assumed to be standing vertical and penetrating up to impervious layer the water levels in the drains are unequal and invariant with time the flow field is also assumed to be under the continuous influence of time space dependent arbitrary source sink term the correctness of the proposed model is checked by developing a numerical code and also with the existing analytical solution for the simplified case the study highlights the significance of source sink influence in the subsurface flow with the imposition of the source and sink term in the flow domain the pathline and travel time of water particles started deviating from their original position and above that the side and top discharge to the drains were also observed to have a strong influence of the source sink terms the travel time and pathline of water particles are also observed to have a dependency on the height of water in the ditches and on the location of source sink activation area keywords analytical solution source sink hydraulic conductivity specific storage transient seepage ponded drainage 1 introduction drainage plays an important role in the field of agricultural science the land drainage system is very helpful in removing the excess water from the soil as fast as possible roe and ayres 1954 oosterbaan 1991 which ensures the land to be suitable for agricultural purpose another method of removing excess water from the soil is by imposing sink into the flow domain ritzema 1994 subsurface drainage is also useful for removing waterlogging and salinity in the agricultural field youngs 1994 ritzema et al 2008 a commonly used method of salinity remediation is performed by creating a ponding field on the top surface of the soil which will create sufficient force to wash out the salt trapped in the soil matrix rao and leeds harrison 1991 youngs and leeds harrison 2000 barua and alam 2013 sarmah and barua 2015 subsurface drainage is also found helpful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields qiu 2009 groenigen et al 2013 the idea of analysis of subsurface flow to ditch drains can also be extended to subsurface flow to stream and river under similar hydro geological situation sarmah and barua 2017 thus it is understandable that subsurface drainage has ample of application and hence the detailed analysis of the same is much needed the understanding of a subsurface ditch drainage system is incomplete without considering the effect of source sink term in the flow domain in general source and sink terms in the flow domain are created by different physical processes like horizontal well tile drains water extraction by the root zone of plants etc zhan and zlotnik 2002 wang et al 2014 ritzema 1994 the root water uptake due to transpiration is an important sink term in the agricultural field the domain of this source sink term prevails up to the root zone of the plant gardner 1991 wu et al 1999 for more than 50 of the plant in a crop field the maximum root depth is up to 20 cm fan et al 2016 for mathematical simplicity the source and sink terms are generally represented by a point function like direct delta however they can be converted to any other mathematical function by the principle of superposition zhan and zlotnik 2002 the proposed analytical solution is based on the evaluation of two dimensional transient flow to a fully penetrating ditch drainage network system from an uneven ponding field where the flow domain is under the influence of source sink many investigations were done so far to derive the exact solution to two dimensional ditch drainage problem for steady state condition with constant ponding at soil surface kirkham 1950 1960 1965 kirkham et al 1974 fukuda 1957 warrick and kirkham 1969 ilyinsky and kacimov 1992 youngs 1994 barua and tiwari 1995 bereslavskii 2006 römkens 2009 chahar and vadodaria 2008a 2008b 2012 afruzi et al 2014 sarmah and barua 2015 but none of these solutions are equipped enough to tackle the influence of source sink term in the flow field barua and alam 2013 presented an analytical solution for predicting two dimensional transient seepage into a fully penetrating ditch drainage system where the effect of source sink was not taken into consideration liang et al 2015 proposed an analytical solution for a two dimensional subsurface tile drainage system near a river considering time dependent source term sarmah and barua 2017 provided a three dimensional transient analytical solution for a fully penetrating ditch drainage system resting in an impervious stratum in which the level of water in the surrounding ditches and depth of water at the surface of the soil were kept constant with time and the influence of source sink terms were neglected hence from the above literature it is observed that the existing analytical solutions are lagging in tackling the influence of source sink terms in the hydrodynamics of ditch drainage system the objective of this study is to develop a generalized analytical solution for mimicking the transient flow behavior of a two dimensional fully penetrating ditch drainage network underlying by an impervious barrier subjected to an uneven ponding at the surface of the soil and source sink influence in the soil matrix 2 mathematical formulation and solution the geometry of the flow domain for the considered problem is given in fig 1 a rectangular flow field of length l and depth h is drained by two parallel ditch drains having a constant water depth of h 1 and h 2 whereas the top soil surface is being imposed by an uneven ponding field the uneven ponding field at the surface of the soil is created by dividing the domain into n 0 small segments using inner bunds and by maintaining a water height of δ j 1 j n 0 at each segment as can be seen in fig 1 it should be noted that the uneven ponding field can be converted to uniform ponding field by making δ j value equal for all segments i e δ j δ for creating n 0 segments n 0 1 inner bunds are used which are placed at a distance of l i 1 i n 0 1 distance of i th bund from the left hand side drain the width of the ditch bunds at the edge of the ditches and inner bunds between two water levels at the surface of the soil are assumed to be negligible as compared to the length of the flow domain both the drains are assumed to be penetrating up to the impervious barrier which is situated at a depth of h from the surface of the soil a coordinate system is imposed to the flow domain with x axis positive along the right hand side y axis positive vertically downward for mathematical convenience which is clearly demonstrated in fig 1 and the time variable is defined by t the hydraulic conductivity of the flow domain along x and y direction are assumed to be constant and having a magnitude of kx and ky and the specific storage of the soil column is taken as ss an arbitrary time dependent source sink field n x y t is assumed to be acting in the flow domain which is a function of space and time however for all situations with and without source and sink influence it is assumed that the flow field is always under saturated condition the depth of water at top of the soil surface and in the ditch drains are assumed to be constant and are being imposed instantaneously into the system before which it was in level with the surface of the soil with the above assumption and nomenclature naming hydraulic head function as φ the initial and boundary condition for the above mentioned problem is given by i φ x y t 0 0 0 x l 0

calculated now by putting the expression of a m b n c p and d uv t from eqs 9 11 and 21 respectively into eq 2 the proposed hydraulic head function can be evaluated after evaluating the hydraulic head function the directional velocity field can be generated by using darcy s equation and the expression for the same is given by 47 v x k x φ x and 48 v y k y φ y the velocity field obtained from eqs 47 and 48 are also used to generate the pathline of a water particle traveling in flow domain and the time taken by the particle in doing so the procedure used to evaluate the pathline and the travel time is derived on the basis of the method developed by grove et al 1970 and the procedure is as follows let the position of the water particle at any instant of time t in the flow domain be xk yk and the directional velocity along x and y directions are vx and vy which can be evaluated by using eqs 47 and 48 in the incremental time δt the directional displacements along x and y directions are calculated as 49 δ x v x δ t η and 50 δ y v y δ t η where η is the porosity of the flow domain after knowing the incremental distance δ x and δ y traveled by the water particle in time δ t the new position of the water particle x k 1 y k 1 in time t δ t can be expressed as 51 x k 1 x k δ x and 52 y k 1 y k δ y after knowing the position x k 1 y k 1 the new position of the water particle after time t 2 δ t can be evaluated using the same mathematical procedure and can be repeated in same fashion till then water particle reaches the recipient ditch to predict the top discharge per unit width of the drain perpendicular to flow domain the velocity field along y direction generated from the hydraulic head function is used and the expressions for the same is given by 53 q top t k y ε l ε φ y

non zero ponding depth at the extreme most ponding strips i e when δ 1 and δ n 0 values are non zero the detail convergency proof for the same can be derived similar to the given by barua and alam 2013 similarly the expressions for discharge into the left and right drains i e q l t and q r t are given by 55 q l t k x 0 h φ x x 0 dy and 56 q r t k x 0 h φ x x l dy the final expressions of eqs 55

expressions for top discharge and side discharge can be used to calculate the volume of water seeping through the top surface of the soil and ditch surface by integrating the discharge function with respect to time for any desired interval 0 t 3 verification of the proposed model and discussion a comparison is made between the proposed analytical model and the corresponding finite difference model by comparing the hydraulic head contours for a given set of flow parameters to generate the finite difference model the governing equation is expressed in terms of difference equation by truncating the higher order terms of the taylor series expansion of each differential terms of eq 2 discretizing the flow domain in the set of uniform sized grids each of size δ x and δ y along x and y direction respectively and breaking the time space in sets of small incremental time δ t for mathematical simplicity following the nomenclature and methodology used by anderson 1995 the explicate finite difference equation of eq 2 can be expressed as 59 k x φ i 1 j n 2 φ i j n φ i 1 j n δ x 2 k y φ i j 1 n 2 φ i j n φ i j 1 n δ y 2 n x i y i n δ t s s φ i j n 1 φ i j n δ t where i and j are the grid position along x and y direction to demark a grid point in x y plane n represents the time step corresponding to known time t and n 1 represents the time step corresponding to unknown time t δ t the hydraulic head values at all grid points corresponding to unknown time step n 1 is evaluated by rearranging eq 59 as 60 φ i j n 1 φ i j n δ t s s k x φ i 1 j n 2 φ i j n φ i 1 j n δ x 2 k y φ i j 1 n 2 φ i j n φ i j 1 n δ y 2 n x i y i n δ t for a given grid size for fixed values of δ x and δ y the value of δ t is taken such a way that the solution generated by eq 60 is converging i e e i j n 1 e i j n 1 anderson 1995 where e i j n is the error induced from taylor series truncation in i j grid point at nth time step the comparison graph between analytical and numerical finite difference solution is given in fig 2 which shows a close matching between proposed analytical and numerical solution for the comparison the variation of the source sink term is taken as n x y t 0 1 x l x 1 exp t 0 x l 0 y 0 2 n x y t 0 0 x l 0 2 y h the reason behind such variation of sink term in the flow domain is that in the agricultural field the main sink influence is of soil root uptake of water which is active up to root depth for more than 50 of the plant in a crop field the maximum root depth is 20 cm fan et al 2016 therefore for the above analysis the domain of sink influence in the vertical direction is taken to a depth of 0 2 m the correctness of the proposed analytical model is established by comparing the side discharge values obtained from the present model considering n x y t to be zero with the corresponding mathematical model developed by barua and alam 2013 for a given flow problem from fig 3 it can be observed that the side discharge values calculated from the proposed analytical model without considering the effect of source sink term n x y t 0 are matching closely with the values obtained via barua and alam 2013 solution it is because the solution developed by barua and alam 2013 is a special case of the proposed analytical model when n x y t 0 however the effect of introducing source term of magnitude n 0 1 1 exp 0 1 t day in the flow domain can also be seen in fig 3 as the source term starts acting in the flow field the values of the hydraulic head function in the flow domain get increases and hence the difference in the hydraulic head value between the ditch face and any point in the flow domain also increases this increase in the head difference between two points induces a rise in the side discharge values which is clearly depicted in fig 3 via green line for the comparison and analysis purpose the source sink function is taken in the form of n x y t 0 1 1 exp α t day however the developed analytical solution is equipped enough to handle any other variation of n x y t fig 4 represents the variation of side discharge values into the ditches for three different flow situations i e source acting on the flow field sink influencing the flow domain and no influence of source and sink from the graph it is observed that the discharge to ditches attains maximum value when the flow field is under the influence of source and reaches the minimum for sink term influence this is because when the flow field is under the action of the sink the hydraulic head value at each point gets reduced and thus the head difference between the flow domain and the ditch faces get falls hence there is a decrease in discharge value but for the source term influence the discharge phenomenon follows vice verse rule due to the enhancement of the hydraulic head value in the flow domain due to the action of the source term however when there is no action of source sink in the flow domain side discharge values for such case lies in between the discharge values due to source and sink term influence fig 5 shows the variation of top discharge values with time for different situations of source sink input from the graph it is clearly depicted that the maximum discharge value is attained when the flow field is under the influence of sink term this is because the hydraulic head values are least in the flow domain when there is a sink term influence which in return creates a high energy gradient with respect to the non negative constant head maintained at the top surface of the soil in case of source influence the situation is completely opposite of sink this is because due to the continuous action of the source term in the flow domain the hydraulic head values get enhanced and exceeds the constant head boundary in this case which is zero δ 0m value maintained at the surface of the soil this higher hydraulic head at the flow domain as compared to top surface of the soil induces a negative flux which causes a backflow situation which is clearly depicted by the blue line in fig 5 from fig 6 it clear that the presence of source sink term in the flow field greatly influences the pathline pattern of a water particle and also the time taken by them while traveling along the trajectory a hypothetical situation as described in fig 6 is being taken to study the effect of source sink influence in the ditch drainage system from the above figure it is observed that after introducing source sink terms in the flow field the water particles originating from x 1 5m and x 3 5m at the surface of the soil is seen to be following different paths under different conditions of the source and sink influence in above this fig 6 also demonstrates the effect of water depth in the ditches on the travel of the water particle along the pathline by lowering the level of water to 0 75 m on the right hand side ditch at x 5m the travel time of the water particle originating from a distance of 1 5 m away from that ditch can be reduced by a considerable amount as compared to the water particle originating at a distance of 1 5 m away from the left hand side ditch at x 0m holds true for any combination of source sink influence in the flow domain fig 7 depicts the effect of source term influence when a continuous time dependent source of intensity n 1 exp α t day is being imposed on the flow system in the domain 2 4 x 2 6 0 4 y 0 6 with the imposition of the source term in the above said reason the pathlines are seen to be shifting from their original position as compared to no source situation towards the ditches for the water particle originating from a midway distance x 2 5m the pathlines corresponding to the imposition of the source term and no source sink condition are exhibiting a vast difference in their pathline trends since the domain of source activation is nearer to the above said pathline however for pathlines originating from little far distances from the source activation area i e from x 2m and 3m the deviation of the path followed under no source and with source condition are comparatively small as compared to the pathline originating from x 2 5m this is because of the weak influence of the source term to the far away points from the point of action for the water particles originating from very nearby points to the ditches the difference of the water particle trajectory under no source and with source condition will be negligible 4 conclusion an analytical solution is derived for a two dimensional fully penetrating ditch drainage system in a saturated homogeneous and anisotropic flow medium subjected to the presence of any source sink field in the flow domain the correctness of the proposed analytical model is checked by comparing the top discharge function by putting the value of source sink term equal to zero with the corresponding existing model a further check of the proposed model is done by developing a finite difference model for a given flow scenario and then comparing with the corresponding analytical solution the study shows that the presence of source sink in the flow field has a strong influence on the side discharge values to the drains the side discharge values attain maximum when there is a source field in the flow domain and for the sink term the corresponding values of the side discharge function are minimum whereas for no source sink condition the discharge values follows a midway trend between the source and sink influence this behavior is due to the increase in the head difference between ditch face boundary and the point of action of the source in the flow domain which induced a rise in the discharge values and the same is vice versa for the case of sink activation in the flow domain a similar observation is made for the case of top discharge variation with time for different situations of source sink activation in the flow domain in case of source term activation the water is flowing from the soil matrix to the to ponding surface which is a reverse and a non intuitive phenomenon however for sink term activation the top discharge values got enhanced in magnitude and the flow of water is from the surface of the soil to the recipient ditches from the proposed study it is also observed that the source and sink terms have a strong influence on the pathline pattern of the water particles in the flow field and also on time taken by it while traveling along the trajectory with the activation of sink term the pathlines are seen to be penetrating deeper into the soil surface and taking less time to reach recipient drains as compared to source term activation the pathlines exhibited the strong influence of source term near the area of activation and the effect diminishes as the water particles moves away from the area of activation the commonly used method of stability analysis in finite difference formulation like von neumann stability method anderson 1995 is not always capable enough to evaluate convergence criteria the maximum range of δt for which the numerical solution will be stable if the nature of source sink term is complex therefore the proposed solution will be useful to check the correctness of the complex numerical codes developed for ditch drainage problem considering the effect of source sink term by reducing to a simplified setting similar to the present problem

and travel time of water particles started deviating from their original position and above that the side and top discharge to the drains were also observed to have a strong influence of the source sink terms the travel time and pathline of water particles are also observed to have a dependency on the height of water in the ditches and on the location of source sink activation area keywords analytical solution source sink hydraulic conductivity specific storage transient seepage ponded drainage 1 introduction drainage plays an important role in the field of agricultural science the land drainage system is very helpful in removing the excess water from the soil as fast as possible roe and ayres 1954 oosterbaan 1991 which ensures the land to be suitable for agricultural purpose another method of removing excess water from the soil is by imposing sink into the flow domain ritzema 1994 subsurface drainage is also useful for removing waterlogging and salinity in the agricultural field youngs 1994 ritzema et al 2008 a commonly used method of salinity remediation is performed by creating a ponding field on the top surface of the soil which will create sufficient force to wash out the salt trapped in the soil matrix rao and leeds harrison 1991 youngs and leeds harrison 2000 barua and alam 2013 sarmah and barua 2015 subsurface drainage is also found helpful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields qiu 2009 groenigen et al 2013 the idea of analysis of subsurface flow to ditch drains can also be extended to subsurface flow to stream and river under similar hydro geological situation sarmah and barua 2017 thus it is understandable that subsurface drainage has ample of application and hence the detailed analysis of the same is much needed the understanding of a subsurface ditch drainage system is incomplete without considering the effect of source sink term in the flow domain in general source and sink terms in the flow domain are created by different physical processes like horizontal well tile drains water extraction by the root zone of plants etc zhan and zlotnik 2002 wang et al 2014 ritzema 1994 the root water uptake due to transpiration is an important sink term in the agricultural field the domain of this source sink term prevails up to the root zone of the plant gardner 1991 wu et al 1999 for more than 50 of the plant in a crop field the maximum root depth is up to 20 cm fan et al 2016 for mathematical simplicity the source and sink terms are generally represented by a point function like direct delta however they can be converted to any other mathematical function by the principle of superposition zhan and zlotnik 2002 the proposed analytical solution is based on the evaluation of two dimensional transient flow to a fully penetrating ditch drainage network system from an uneven ponding field where the flow domain is under the influence of source sink many investigations were done so far to derive the exact solution to two dimensional ditch drainage problem for steady state condition with constant ponding at soil surface kirkham 1950 1960 1965 kirkham et al 1974 fukuda 1957 warrick and kirkham 1969 ilyinsky and kacimov 1992 youngs 1994 barua and tiwari 1995 bereslavskii 2006 römkens 2009 chahar and vadodaria 2008a 2008b 2012 afruzi et al 2014 sarmah and barua 2015 but none of these solutions are equipped enough to tackle the influence of source sink term in the flow field barua and alam 2013 presented an analytical solution for predicting two dimensional transient seepage into a fully penetrating ditch drainage system where the effect of source sink was not taken into consideration liang et al 2015 proposed an analytical solution for a two dimensional subsurface tile drainage system near a river considering time dependent source term sarmah and barua 2017 provided a three dimensional transient analytical solution for a fully penetrating ditch drainage system resting in an impervious stratum in which the level of water in the surrounding ditches and depth of water at the surface of the soil were kept constant with time and the influence of source sink terms were neglected hence from the above literature it is observed that the existing analytical solutions are lagging in tackling the influence of source sink terms in the hydrodynamics of ditch drainage system the objective of this study is to develop a generalized analytical solution for mimicking the transient flow behavior of a two dimensional fully penetrating ditch drainage network underlying by an impervious barrier subjected to an uneven ponding at the surface of the soil and source sink influence in the soil matrix 2 mathematical formulation and solution the geometry of the flow domain for the considered problem is given in fig 1 a rectangular flow field of length l and depth h is drained by two parallel ditch drains having a constant water depth of h 1 and h 2 whereas the top soil surface is being imposed by an uneven ponding field the uneven ponding field at the surface of the soil is created by dividing the domain into n 0 small segments using inner bunds and by maintaining a water height of δ j 1 j n 0 at each segment as can be seen in fig 1 it should be noted that the uneven ponding field can be converted to uniform ponding field by making δ j value equal for all segments i e δ j δ for creating n 0 segments n 0 1 inner bunds are used which are placed at a distance of l i 1 i n 0 1 distance of i th bund from the left hand side drain the width of the ditch bunds at the edge of the ditches and inner bunds between two water levels at the surface of the soil are assumed to be negligible as compared to the length of the flow domain both the drains are assumed to be penetrating up to the impervious barrier which is situated at a depth of h from the surface of the soil a coordinate system is imposed to the flow domain with x axis positive along the right hand side y axis positive vertically downward for mathematical convenience which is clearly demonstrated in fig 1 and the time variable is defined by t the hydraulic conductivity of the flow domain along x and y direction are assumed to be constant and having a magnitude of kx and ky and the specific storage of the soil column is taken as ss an arbitrary time dependent source sink field n x y t is assumed to be acting in the flow domain which is a function of space and time however for all situations with and without source and sink influence it is assumed that the flow field is always under saturated condition the depth of water at top of the soil surface and in the ditch drains are assumed to be constant and are being imposed instantaneously into the system before which it was in level with the surface of the soil with the above assumption and nomenclature naming hydraulic head function as φ the initial and boundary condition for the above mentioned problem is given by i φ x y t 0 0 0 x l 0

function the directional velocity field can be generated by using darcy s equation and the expression for the same is given by 47 v x k x φ x and 48 v y k y φ y the velocity field obtained from eqs 47 and 48 are also used to generate the pathline of a water particle traveling in flow domain and the time taken by the particle in doing so the procedure used to evaluate the pathline and the travel time is derived on the basis of the method developed by grove et al 1970 and the procedure is as follows let the position of the water particle at any instant of time t in the flow domain be xk yk and the directional velocity along x and y directions are vx and vy which can be evaluated by using eqs 47 and 48 in the incremental time δt the directional displacements along x and y directions are calculated as 49 δ x v x δ t η and 50 δ y v y δ t η where η is the porosity of the flow domain after knowing the incremental distance δ x and δ y traveled by the water particle in time δ t the new position of the water particle x k 1 y k 1 in time t δ t can be expressed as 51 x k 1 x k δ x and 52 y k 1 y k δ y after knowing the position x k 1 y k 1 the new position of the water particle after time t 2 δ t can be evaluated using the same mathematical procedure and can be repeated in same fashion till then water particle reaches the recipient ditch to predict the top discharge per unit width

non zero ponding depth at the extreme most ponding strips i e when δ 1 and δ n 0 values are non zero the detail convergency proof for the same can be derived similar to the given by barua and alam 2013 similarly the expressions for discharge into the left and right drains i e q l t and q r t are given by 55 q l t k x 0 h φ x x 0 dy and 56 q r t k x 0 h φ x x l dy the final expressions of eqs 55

expressions for top discharge and side discharge can be used to calculate the volume of water seeping through the top surface of the soil and ditch surface by integrating the discharge function with respect to time for any desired interval 0 t 3 verification of the proposed model and discussion a comparison is made between the proposed analytical model and the corresponding finite difference model by comparing the hydraulic head contours for a given set of flow parameters to generate the finite difference model the governing equation is expressed in terms of difference equation by truncating the higher order terms of the taylor series expansion of each differential terms of eq 2 discretizing the flow domain in the set of uniform sized grids each of size δ x and δ y along x and y direction respectively and breaking the time space in sets of small incremental time δ t for mathematical simplicity following the nomenclature and methodology used by anderson 1995 the explicate finite difference equation of eq 2 can be expressed as 59 k x φ i 1 j n 2 φ i j n φ i 1 j n δ x 2 k y φ i j 1 n 2 φ i j n φ i j 1 n δ y 2 n x i y i n δ t s s φ i j n 1 φ i j n δ t where i and j are the grid position along x and y direction to demark a grid point in x y plane n represents the time step corresponding to known time t and n 1 represents the time step corresponding to unknown time t δ t the hydraulic head values at all grid points corresponding to unknown time step n 1 is evaluated by rearranging eq 59 as 60 φ i j n 1 φ i j n δ t s s k x φ i 1 j n 2 φ i j n φ i 1 j n δ x 2 k y φ i j 1 n 2 φ i j n φ i j 1 n δ y 2 n x i y i n δ t for a given grid size for fixed values of δ x and δ y the value of δ t is taken such a way that the solution generated by eq 60 is converging i e e i j n 1 e i j n 1 anderson 1995 where e i j n is the error induced from taylor series truncation in i j grid point at nth time step the comparison graph between analytical and numerical finite difference solution is given in fig 2 which shows a close matching between proposed analytical and numerical solution for the comparison the variation of the source sink term is taken as n x y t 0 1 x l x 1 exp t 0 x l 0 y 0 2 n x y t 0 0 x l 0 2 y h the reason behind such variation of sink term in the flow domain is that in the agricultural field the main sink influence is of soil root uptake of water which is active up to root depth for more than 50 of the plant in a crop field the maximum root depth is 20 cm fan et al 2016 therefore for the above analysis the domain of sink influence in the vertical direction is taken to a depth of 0 2 m the correctness of the proposed analytical model is established by comparing the side discharge values obtained from the present model considering n x y t to be zero with the corresponding mathematical model developed by barua and alam 2013 for a given flow problem from fig 3 it can be observed that the side discharge values calculated from the proposed analytical model without considering the effect of source sink term n x y t 0 are matching closely with the values obtained via barua and alam 2013 solution it is because the solution developed by barua and alam 2013 is a special case of the proposed analytical model when n x y t 0 however the effect of introducing source term of magnitude n 0 1 1 exp 0 1 t day in the flow domain can also be seen in fig 3 as the source term starts acting in the flow field the values of the hydraulic head function in the flow domain get increases and hence the difference in the hydraulic head value between the ditch face and any point in the flow domain also increases this increase in the head difference between two points induces a rise in the side discharge values which is clearly depicted in fig 3 via green line for the comparison and analysis purpose the source sink function is taken in the form of n x y t 0 1 1 exp α t day however the developed analytical solution is equipped enough to handle any other variation of n x y t fig 4 represents the variation of side discharge values into the ditches for three different flow situations i e source acting on the flow field sink influencing the flow domain and no influence of source and sink from the graph it is observed that the discharge to ditches attains maximum value when the flow field is under the influence of source and reaches the minimum for sink term influence this is because when the flow field is under the action of the sink the hydraulic head value at each point gets reduced and thus the head difference between the flow domain and the ditch faces get falls hence there is a decrease in discharge value but for the source term influence the discharge phenomenon follows vice verse rule due to the enhancement of the hydraulic head value in the flow domain due to the action of the source term however when there is no action of source sink in the flow domain side discharge values for such case lies in between the discharge values due to source and sink term influence fig 5 shows the variation of top discharge values with time for different situations of source sink input from the graph it is clearly depicted that the maximum discharge value is attained when the flow field is under the influence of sink term this is because the hydraulic head values are least in the flow domain when there is a sink term influence which in return creates a high energy gradient with respect to the non negative constant head maintained at the top surface of the soil in case of source influence the situation is completely opposite of sink this is because due to the continuous action of the source term in the flow domain the hydraulic head values get enhanced and exceeds the constant head boundary in this case which is zero δ 0m value maintained at the surface of the soil this higher hydraulic head at the flow domain as compared to top surface of the soil induces a negative flux which causes a backflow situation which is clearly depicted by the blue line in fig 5 from fig 6 it clear that the presence of source sink term in the flow field greatly influences the pathline pattern of a water particle and also the time taken by them while traveling along the trajectory a hypothetical situation as described in fig 6 is being taken to study the effect of source sink influence in the ditch drainage system from the above figure it is observed that after introducing source sink terms in the flow field the water particles originating from x 1 5m and x 3 5m at the surface of the soil is seen to be following different paths under different conditions of the source and sink influence in above this fig 6 also demonstrates the effect of water depth in the ditches on the travel of the water particle along the pathline by lowering the level of water to 0 75 m on the right hand side ditch at x 5m the travel time of the water particle originating from a distance of 1 5 m away from that ditch can be reduced by a considerable amount as compared to the water particle originating at a distance of 1 5 m away from the left hand side ditch at x 0m holds true for any combination of source sink influence in the flow domain fig 7 depicts the effect of source term influence when a continuous time dependent source of intensity n 1 exp α t day is being imposed on the flow system in the domain 2 4 x 2 6 0 4 y 0 6 with the imposition of the source term in the above said reason the pathlines are seen to be shifting from their original position as compared to no source situation towards the ditches for the water particle originating from a midway distance x 2 5m the pathlines corresponding to the imposition of the source term and no source sink condition are exhibiting a vast difference in their pathline trends since the domain of source activation is nearer to the above said pathline however for pathlines originating from little far distances from the source activation area i e from x 2m and 3m the deviation of the path followed under no source and with source condition are comparatively small as compared to the pathline originating from x 2 5m this is because of the weak influence of the source term to the far away points from the point of action for the water particles originating from very nearby points to the ditches the difference of the water particle trajectory under no source and with source condition will be negligible 4 conclusion an analytical solution is derived for a two dimensional fully penetrating ditch drainage system in a saturated homogeneous and anisotropic flow medium subjected to the presence of any source sink field in the flow domain the correctness of the proposed analytical model is checked by comparing the top discharge function by putting the value of source sink term equal to zero with the corresponding existing model a further check of the proposed model is done by developing a finite difference model for a given flow scenario and then comparing with the corresponding analytical solution the study shows that the presence of source sink in the flow field has a strong influence on the side discharge values to the drains the side discharge values attain maximum when there is a source field in the flow domain and for the sink term the corresponding values of the side discharge function are minimum whereas for no source sink condition the discharge values follows a midway trend between the source and sink influence this behavior is due to the increase in the head difference between ditch face boundary and the point of action of the source in the flow domain which induced a rise in the discharge values and the same is vice versa for the case of sink activation in the flow domain a similar observation is made for the case of top discharge variation with time for different situations of source sink activation in the flow domain in case of source term activation the water is flowing from the soil matrix to the to ponding surface which is a reverse and a non intuitive phenomenon however for sink term activation the top discharge values got enhanced in magnitude and the flow of water is from the surface of the soil to the recipient ditches from the proposed study it is also observed that the source and sink terms have a strong influence on the pathline pattern of the water particles in the flow field and also on time taken by it while traveling along the trajectory with the activation of sink term the pathlines are seen to be penetrating deeper into the soil surface and taking less time to reach recipient drains as compared to source term activation the pathlines exhibited the strong influence of source term near the area of activation and the effect diminishes as the water particles moves away from the area of activation the commonly used method of stability analysis in finite difference formulation like von neumann stability method anderson 1995 is not always capable enough to evaluate convergence criteria the maximum range of δt for which the numerical solution will be stable if the nature of source sink term is complex therefore the proposed solution will be useful to check the correctness of the complex numerical codes developed for ditch drainage problem considering the effect of source sink term by reducing to a simplified setting similar to the present problem 
7451,this work is meant to summarize lessons learned on using satellite precipitation products for riverine flood modeling and to propose future directions in this field of research firstly the most common satellite precipitation products spps during the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and global precipitation mission gpm eras are reviewed secondly we discuss the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect streamflow and runoff model simulations thirdly past studies that focused on using spps for predicting streamflow and runoff are analyzed as the impact of floods depends not only on the characteristics of the flood itself but also on the characteristics of the region population density land use geophysical and climatic factors a regional analysis is required to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods the performance of spp forced hydrological models was shown to largely depend on several factors including precipitation type seasonality hydrological model formulation topography across several basins around the world the bias in spps was recognized as a major issue and bias correction methods of different complexity were shown to significantly reduce streamflow errors model re calibration was also raised as a viable option to improve spp forced streamflow simulations but caution is necessary when recalibrating models with spp which may result in unrealistic parameter values from a general standpoint there is significant potential for using satellite observations in flood forecasting but the performance of spp in hydrological modeling is still inadequate for operational purposes keywords hydrologic modeling satellite precipitation floods 1 introduction riverine flooding occurs either when excessive rain falls over an extended period of time and leads a river to exceed its capacity or because of heavy snow melt there are two main types of riverine flooding overbank floods which occur when water overflows over the edges of a river or stream and flash floods which are caused by heavy rainfall in a short amount of time usually less than 6 h and characterized by an intense high velocity torrent of water that rips through river beds urban streets or mountain canyons floods are among the most dangerous and costly natural disasters causing extensive economic and social damages worldwide wake 2013 unisdr 2015 the recent intensification of extreme precipitation events has the potential to aggravate the frequency and intensity of floods ipcc 2012 in a recent study janssen et al 2014 observed an overall increasing trend in extreme precipitation events from 1901 to 2012 across the united states u s similarly blöschl et al 2017 found a clear climate signal in flood timing change when they analyzed river floods in europe over the past five decades specifically they observed that higher temperatures caused earlier spring snowmelt floods in northeastern europe delayed winter storms caused later winter floods in the north sea region and along the mediterranean coast and earlier soil moisture maxima caused earlier winter floods across western europe future projections of earth system models esms suggest further increases in extreme precipitation frequency in a high emission scenario however model simulations often show an underestimation of extreme events when compared to observations asadieh and krakauer 2015 this highlights the pressing need for improved methods for predicting and mitigating the impact and risk of floods globally e g feyen et al 2012 hydrologic early warning systems are the main tool for assessing flood risk and reducing damages by forecasting flood events using real time data obtained through ground monitoring networks e g rain gauges and radars artan et al 2007 however the use of such data mainly rainfall is affected by several limiting factors 1 the limited spatial representativeness of local measurements kidd et al 2012 2 the network density fig 1 and 3 reflectivity issues related to radar data a way to overcome these issues was suggested more than 30 years ago by barret and martin 1981 that is the use of satellite precipitation products spps that are nowadays available on a global scale at increasing spatial and temporal resolution the use of these products in hydrologic applications has opened new venues to support water management globally especially in poorly gauged basins and large basins with larger concentration times spps may be the only input data to allow flow predictions downstream with enough lead time to implement management and response actions serrat capdevila et al 2014 despite the abundance of spps spaceborne rainfall data are scarcely used in hydrologic applications this work discusses the main reasons for which the use of spps in hydrology is not operational yet including their insufficient latency and spatial temporal resolution serrat capdevila et al 2014 recent research work has shown that even in poorly gauged regions hydrologic simulations using spps are equal or inferior in performance to simulations that employ even just a few ground based rain gauges yilmaz et al 2005 harris et al 2007 stisen and sandholt 2010 model re analysis precipitation products are the only choice above 60 latitude and an effective alternative above 35 latitude where they ingest a high number of ground observations and during cold periods because of their ability to capture fairly well large scale weather systems which represent the dominant source of precipitation in these regions beck et al 2017a 2017b conversely these products perform very poorly in the tropics because of the small scale high intensity nature of rainfall which cannot be reliably simulated by numerical weather prediction models re analysis products are of particular interest especially for estimating snow and rain on snow which are often poorly quantified by spps tian et al 2014 however this work focuses only on the use of spps for streamflow estimation and future work should consider re analysis products and compare their efficiency in simulating streamflow to the one of spps this work provides a brief description of the most common satellite precipitation products section 2 and their errors and uncertainties that have the potential to play an important role in hydrologic modeling section 3 section 4 provides an overview of past research activities that focused on the use of spps for predicting streamflow and runoff in different basins of the world the discussion in section 5 focuses on the main reasons that still limit the adoption of spps in operational flood monitoring and prediction and proposes future research directions 2 satellite precipitation observations satellite precipitation estimates can be derived from a range of observations from many different sensors including geostationary geo satellites and low earth orbiting leo satellites kidd and huffman 2011 serrat capdevila et al 2014 five operational geo satellites are required to ensure full west east and 70n to 70s coverage and provide imagery on a frequent and regular basis i e every 30 min leo satellites generally cross the equator at the same local time on each orbit providing about two overpasses per day rainfall can be inferred from visible images since thick clouds that are more likely to be associated with rainfall tend to be brighter than the earth s surface infrared ir imagery available night and day is potentially more useful since heavier rainfall tends to be associated with larger taller clouds with colder cloud tops passive microwaves pmw represent a useful alternative as emissions from rain droplets lead to an increase in pmw radiation and scattering caused by precipitating ice particles leads to a decrease in pmw radiation a growing number of techniques have been developed that exploit the synergy between polar orbiting retrievals infrequent more direct and geostationary observations frequent less direct and that blend ir radiances with pmw observations e g turk et al 1999 http www isac cnr it ipwg data datasets html one example is the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman and coauthors 2007 which ingests data from pmw imaging with sounding sensors and geostationary ir data other techniques have used artificial neural networks anns to derive precipitation estimates by combining information from multi channel and multi sensor observations like the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using anns persiann hsu et al 1997 other techniques use ir data as a measure of cloud movement to morph the pmw observations between successive satellite overpasses examples of current state of the art methodologies are the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota and coauthors 2007 recently the nasa jaxa global precipitation measurement gpm mission in coordination with the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc released the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2014 which merges precipitation estimates from pmw and ir sensors and monthly surface precipitation gauge analysis data to provide half hourly precipitation estimates on a 0 1 grid over the 60 n s domain as an alternative to standard spps approaches that use satellite soil moisture data were recently used to retrieve and or correct rainfall crow et al 2009 pellarin et al 2013 brocca et al 2013 wanders et al 2015 román cascón et al 2017 for instance crow et al 2011 attempted to correct satellite rainfall estimates using the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart and brocca et al 2013 2014 developed sm2rain a method that inverts the soil water balance equation to directly estimate rainfall from soil moisture observations this algorithm was employed by ciabatta et al 2017 to obtain long term 0 25 daily rainfall estimates by using the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture dataset dorigo et al 2017 3 errors uncertainties and validation of spp a plethora of studies validated spps through comparison with gauge and radar rainfall estimates in different parts of the world and under different climatic conditions gottschalck et al 2005 ebert et al 2007 tian and peters lidard 2010 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 maggioni et al 2016 in this section we summarize the main sources of errors of these products that may limit their use in hydrologic modeling to monitor and predict floods errors in spps are commonly assessed with respect to either ground based observations gauge and or radar or models particular attention when evaluating the performance of different spps has to be paid to the error in the benchmark dataset fig 2 helps to understand how the quality of the benchmark dataset can condition the validation of spps the bias in the north western us changes from positive to negative if either the gauge alone or the radar gauge dataset is considered tian et al 2007 anagnostou et al 2010 presented a cross validation of the mesonet rainfall gauges based on an independent small scale but very dense 100 m inter gauge distances rain gauge network i e micronet in oklahoma their work demonstrated the need to benchmark reference data sources prior to their quantitative use in validating remote sensing retrievals while this reference can be easily obtained in united states europe australia and china thanks to the relatively high rain gauge density see fig 1 many parts of the land areas still lack a sufficiently dense rain gauge coverage such is the main obstacle for a proper evaluation of the satellite retrievals kidd et al 2017 massari et al 2017 this poses a challenge not only for the mere validation of spps but also for i understanding how spp uncertainties propagate into hydrologic simulations i e how do spp uncertainties translate into streamflow uncertainties and ii using rain gauge information for correcting the bias in spps prior to their use in hydrologic models fig 3 two important aspects must be considered when rain gauge measurements are adopted as benchmark namely the temporal sampling uncertainties related to observation frequency and the spatial sampling error related to rain gauge density in particular temporal sampling uncertainties increase with the sampling interval according to a scaling law and decrease with increasing averaging area with no strong dependence on local orography villarini et al 2008 on the other hand spatial sampling uncertainties tend to decrease for increasing accumulation time with no strong dependence on the gauge location within the pixel or on the gauge elevation a simple rule was proposed for the number of gauges required to estimate areal rainfall with a given accuracy for a pixel of about 200 km2 in order to obtain an accuracy of about 20 of its true value 25 25 15 and 4 gauges are necessary at the 15 min hourly 3 hourly and daily scale respectively 3 1 rain detection hit biases and random errors an instantaneous satellite observation can be affected by detection systematic and random errors detection errors include false alarms when the satellite estimate is larger than zero but in fact it does not rain and missed rain when the satellite estimate is zero but there is rain at the ground when the satellite correctly detects rainfall the estimated rain rate may be characterized by systematic or bias and or random errors biases arise from systematic problems while the intrinsic random error depends on the remote sensing measurement retrieval error and the lack of continuity in the coverage by low earth orbiting satellites sampling error bennartz and petty 2001 typical sources of retrieval error are due to beam filling issues and sub pixel inhomogeneity in the rainfall field kummerow 1998 and to the difficulties in estimating the impact of solid hydrometeors bennartz and petty 2001 sampling errors are determined by the satellite orbit swath width and space time characteristics of the rainfall fields themselves chang and chiu 1999 errors in rain detection and in precipitation rate estimation can both play an important role in water cycle applications e g flood forecasting land surface modeling past studies showed that sampling uncertainty decreases at high rainfall rates large domain sizes and long time integration north and nakamoto 1989 bell and kundu 2000 bell et al 1990 steiner et al 2003 huffman 1997 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 hossain and anagnostou 2004 ciabatta et al 2016 since precipitation follows a diurnal cycle the way sampling is distributed during the day may have an effect on the estimated average rain over different accumulation periods salby et al 1997 oliveira et al 2016 gebremichael and krajewski 2005 evaluated the effect of temporal sampling on rain spatial statistics in central us they found that the expected value of the relative error is zero for rainfall averaged over 5 days or longer and that better temporal sampling produces average fields that are spatially less noisy while large catchments should be less affected by rainfall sampling errors because their runoff response is dampened by the basin characteristics small catchments under the effects of intense convective storms could be seriously impacted e g libertino et al 2016 aghakouchak et al 2011 evaluated the ability of cmorph persiann 3b42rt and 3b42 in estimating extreme precipitation over the southern great plains and concluded that the spps detection skills reduce with more extreme events habib et al 2009 showed that 3b42 and 3b42rt tend to overestimate low rain rates and underestimate high rain rates during six tropical storms in louisiana spps usually detect more high intensity events and miss light rainfall events as shown by tian et al 2007 in the southeast us producing a shifted rain distribution due to the non linearity of land surface processes this shift may cause significant errors in runoff prediction as stronger rainfall events would generate more surface runoff in addition missing light rainfall events is detrimental to model state estimation with immediate effects on the catchment conditions prior to any rainfall events which in turn leads to a high probability of underestimating or overestimating the flood magnitude mehran and aghakouchak 2014 studied the capability of 3b42rt cmorph and persiann to estimate high rain rates at different temporal accumulations across the us and found that none of the fine temporal resolution 3 hourly products is ideal for measuring heavy precipitation moreover as accumulation time gets larger probability of detection improves and false alarm ratio decreases which may largely impact hydrologic model simulations ideally run at fine temporal resolutions to catch sub daily flood events e g flash floods 3 2 seasonality storm type and topography many validation studies indicated that the performance of spps is influenced by seasonal precipitation patterns storm type and background surface gottschalck et al 2005 tian et al 2007 ebert et al 2007 oliveira et al 2016 for instance ebert et al 2007 compared near real time spps with numerical weather models in australia us and northwestern europe they found that spps perform better than models for convective storms summer and from the tropics to mid latitudes in these cases retrieval uncertainty is the primary error source mainly caused by the ir inaccuracy with stratiform precipitation and snow cover in semi arid climates northern mexico large false alarm rates are observed due to raindrop evaporation before reaching the surface moazami et al 2013 and dinku et al 2010 detected a similar behavior in iran and eastern africa respectively tian and peters lidard 2010 provided a global map of spps uncertainties without using a reference validation dataset they showed that the spread of global estimates systematically depend on seasonality location and rain rate with the largest standard deviations among products at high latitudes 40 and during the cold seasons deviations are lower in tropical regions with intense convective precipitation and higher in cold regions with complex topography and light rainfall events along coastlines and over water bodies kubota et al 2009 in summary the more the precipitation regime tends toward deep convection the more less accurate the satellite model estimates are although spps have higher accuracy during summers in this season they are characterized by a considerable positive bias which may largely impact hydrologic model predictions when spps are used as forcing data zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 demonstrated the dependence of seven spps errors on climatology in chile and concluded that spps performed better during the wet seasons and in the humid south and central chile in particular at low and mid elevation 0 1000 ma s l than in the arid northern regions and the far south high mountain regions are among the most challenging environments for remote sensing based precipitation measurements due to extreme topography and large weather and climate variability at the same time these regions are typically characterized by a lack of in situ data but also by common flash floods whose consequences can be devastating hong et al 2007 evaluated the impact of topography on the performance of persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs in western mexico the hourly 4 km persiann ccs manages to capture the spatial distribution and timing of diurnal convective rainfall but shows elevation dependent biases underestimating light rain at both high elevations and early in the day and overestimating precipitation rates at low elevation elevation dependent trends with underestimation at higher elevation for cmorph and tmpa 3b42rt were also observed in ethiopia and colombia dinku et al 2007 2010 hirpa et al 2010 the difficulty of spps in estimating precipitation over mountainous regions was also observed by guo et al 2017 in central asia where significant elevation dependent errors were observed in eight spps especially at altitudes higher than 3000 m with large miss precipitation errors and poor detection capabilities similarly yong et al 2010 found that the error structures of both 3b42rt and the 3b42 research product have a significant geo topography dependent distribution pattern closely associated with high latitudes and high elevations however in some regions of the world such as the kabul basin in afghanistan a relatively good detection of both amount and distribution of precipitation is observed ghulami et al 2017 the thermal ir thresholds commonly used to discriminate between raining and non raining clouds could cause the ir based rainfall retrieval algorithms to miss light precipitation events e g hong et al 2007 this however may not be a primary concern for flood monitoring and forecasting on the other hand the underestimation of heavy rainfall in pmw algorithms determined by warm clouds over mountainous regions could be problematic dinku et al 2010 to offset this issue the gsmap algorithm includes an orographic non orographic classification scheme for passive microwave radiometers shige et al 2013 yamamoto and shige 2015 yamamoto et al 2017 4 spp forced hydrologic modeling the impact of a flood largely depends on the characteristics of the flood itself and the characteristics of the region such as population density land use emergency systems as well as geophysical and climatic factors for example flash floods may be more devastating than small scale inundations due to drainage problems and developing countries may have scarcer capital resources to invest in flood protection strategies than more developed regions jonkman 2005 flooding is therefore a global hazard that requires a regional analysis to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods only a few efforts attempted to estimate floods globally using satellite images dottori et al 2016 revilla romero et al 2015 and accomplished it by forcing hydrologic models with quasi global spps wu et al 2012a 2012b 2014 the global flood monitoring system gfms developed at the university of maryland by wu et al 2012b is based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model and uses real time spps to derive flood monitoring parameters for the latitude band 50 n 50 s at 12 km 3hourly resolution http flood umd edu gfms was shown to perform slightly better for the research products which are gauge corrected than the real time ones and for longer duration events 3 day events versus 1 day events poorer performance was observed at higher latitudes because of the larger errors in the spps another attempt was presented by beck et al 2017a who carried out a comprehensive evaluation of 23 quasi global sub daily gridded precipitation datasets for 2000 2016 ten gauge corrected datasets were evaluated using the hbv hydrologic model seibert and vis 2012 which was calibrated with streamflow observations derived from 9053 small to medium sized 50 000 km2 catchments worldwide the datasets directly incorporating daily gauge data overall outperformed the ones directly incorporating 5 day or monthly gauge data 4 1 africa flood risk has been growing in africa in the past decade jonkman 2005 extreme rainfall and subsequent floods affected 600 000 people in 16 west african nations only in september 2009 which followed the 2007 floods that affected more than a million people in uganda ethiopia sudan burkina faso togo mali and niger and the 2008 flood in mozambique united nations 2009 the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred showed that the number of fatalities caused by floods has increased about one order of magnitude during 1950 2009 in africa which indicates the urgent need for action in a continent where spps has great potential due to the lack of in situ observations di baldassarre et al 2010 stisen and sandholt 2010 forced a distributed hydrologic model over the senegal river basin with tmpa 3b42 cmorph cpc fews v2 persiann and a locally product based on cold cloud duration ccd they found that spps need other than a bias correction a specific model recalibration because of differences in the analyzed products e g the number of rainy days and the recorded intensity and differences in the temporal sampling however they state that satellite data can be very useful due to their spatial and temporal continuity and can be used to drive hydrologic models mainly in remote and ungauged areas thiemig et al 2012 performed a hydrologic validation considering tmpa 3b42 cmorph persiann the reanalysis product by the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 and a local rainfall estimation calibrated over the african continent the noaa climate prediction center 2002 over two basins in africa the volta river basin and the upper baro akobo basin which is part of the nile river basin they pointed out that a model recalibration with each spp and a bias correction only if the specific spp is considerably biased are necessary in order to improve the performance of streamflow simulations they also found that the histogram matching method is favorable for bias correction and spps provide better performance for high flow conditions casse et al 2015 analyzed the potential of different rainfall products to predict the niger river flood events in niamey the capital and largest city of niger they found that satellite only products 3b42rt cmorph persiann are characterized by a considerable positive bias and large differences in rainfall distribution with respect to gauge only cpc and gauge adjusted rainfall satellite products 3b42 which led to poor results in flood simulations at niamey however a bias correction significantly improved results similar conclusions were drawn by li et al 2009 who investigated the possibility of integrating 3b42rt into a flood prediction model for disaster management in nzoia a sub basin of lake victoria in east africa prone to flooding because of heavy rains and overflowing of the tributary streams simulated streamflow was found comparable to the benchmark simulation obtained with the model calibrated based on rain gauge and streamflow observations bias ratio 20 and nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency nsce 0 67 results improved even further when a bias correction was applied to 3b42rt bias ratio 3 6 and nsce 0 71 bitew and gebremichael 2011 assessed the suitability of forcing a semi distributed hydrologic model with spps cmorph 3b42rt 3b42 and persiann for daily streamflow simulation in two watersheds in the ethiopian highlands koga of 299 km2 and gilgel abay of 1656 km2 they concluded that the model performance largely depends on the spp type with 3b42rt and cmorph showing modest skills and underestimation of large flood peaks and 3b42 and persiann showing poor skills surprisingly the real time product 3b42rt outperformed the research product 3b42 possibly due to the lack of gauges in the area and the worsening of the rain gauge corrected product increasing the watershed area further improved the simulations obtained from 3b42rt and cmorph in a follow up study on the koga basin bitew et al 2012 investigated two different model calibration approaches with gauge rainfall as input and with each spp as input they concluded that the best model performance was obtained after spps were bias corrected and the model recalibrated with the specific spp which corroborates what observed by artan et al 2007 in the gash river watershed a transboundary basin among ethiopia eritrea and sudan and sub basin of the nile river 4 2 america several studies have been carried out in the past decades to evaluate the performance of hydrologic model forced with spps across the american continent most studies focused on north america with a few examples in the southern hemisphere guetter et al 1996 simulated streamflow in three catchments within the des moines river basin in the midwestern us they forced a rainfall runoff routing model with a 10 year synthetic satellite rainfall dataset in three different ways 1 the model was calibrated and validated with observed rainfall data 2 the model was calibrated with observed rainfall data and then validated by using the synthetic satellite data and 3 the model was calibrated and validated with satellite data they observed an underestimation of the mean areal precipitation and hence biased streamflow simulations when the model was calibrated with observed data and forced with the synthetic satellite dataset errors were also found to increase with decreasing catchment area harris et al 2007 used 3b42rt to force a hydrologic model over a catchment in kentucky finding that a bias correction is needed before using near real time satellite data for flood forecasting specifically they found that bias adjustments could improve flood prediction with the trade off of more false alarms in the peak flow the importance of correcting biases in spps has been shown for other basins across the us including the illinois river basin the leaf river basin in mississippi and the san pedro basin in arizona behrangi et al 2011 hong et al 2006 tobin et al 2010 the propagation of satellite precipitation estimate errors and biases in hydrologic applications has also been object of interest in recent studies especially in terms of how the error propagation is affected as a function of basin size and temporal resolution nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 studied the influence of temporal sampling intervals spatial correlation and drainage area on relative errors in precipitation and streamflow estimates over the ohio river basin a major tributary of the mississippi river basin they observed that 1 streamflow errors were larger for small drainage areas but decreased rapidly for drainage areas larger than 50 000 km2 where most of the streamflow error is associated with fast near surface runoff response 2 streamflow estimates were positively biased due to sampling errors with the bias increasing with sampling interval and drainage area 3 the error in streamflow decreased with increasing accumulation periods and basin areas and 4 a 3 hourly sampling interval may be very useful for hydrologic prediction for medium to large scale river basins 100 000 km2 similarly yilmaz et al 2005 who focused on seven basins of varying size and geographic location within the relatively humid southeastern us found that the hydrologic model performance is better in large basins and largely depends on the bias in the original satellite precipitation estimates on the other hand pan et al 2010 evaluated the skill of 8 different rainfall products i e 3b42 3b42rt cmorph persiann trmm microwave imager global precipitation climatology project gpcp and two reanalysis products as forcing inputs for hydrologic applications over the contiguous us they found that satellite rainfall errors are highly correlated in space within the range of one storm system and thus do not change in magnitude with spatial scale i e basin size pan et al 2010 also observed that gauge corrections significantly enhanced satellite products skills by largely reducing the bias in hydrologic predictions especially over mountainous areas these findings were corroborated by maggioni et al 2013 who proposed to use a stochastic ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain and anagnostou 2004 to improve streamflow predictions across a range of basin scales in the tar pamlico basin by applying srem2d to three spps 3b42rt cmorph and persiann ccs the simulated runoff ensemble was able to envelope the reference runoff they also showed that the bias doubled from rainfall to runoff for basin of different sizes ranging from 500 to 5000 km2 a study on the same basin by vergara et al 2013 investigated the uncertainty due to spp s resolution in hydrologic modeling and forecasting systems they concluded that resolution degradation introduced significant errors in the rainfall fields which propagated to the streamflow simulations as magnified bias and dampened root mean square error the applicability of error corrections to spps in streamflow simulations has also been investigated across 19 sub basins of the tocantins araguaia basin 764 000 km2 located in the center north region of brazil falck et al 2015 the ensemble error model srem2d was able to correct for errors in four satellite precipitation datasets 3b42rt cmorph gsmap and the noaa hydroestimator hydro e by moving the modeled streamflow closer to streamflow observations when compared to simulations forced with uncorrected spps mean absolute errors and root mean square errors decreased as a function of the catchment area for all spps however the rainfall to streamflow error propagation did not show any dependence on the basin size a study by su et al 2008 also focused on south america they forced the vic semi distributed hydrologic model with 3b42 in the la plata basin which with its area of 3 2 106 km2 is the fifth largest river basin in the world and is second only to the amazon in south america 3b42 driven simulations captured daily flooding events and low flows even though peak flows tended to be positively biased spp driven simulated flows were also able to reproduce seasonal and interannual streamflow variability collischonn et al 2008 confirmed the potential of using trmm based rainfall estimates as input to a large scale hydrologic model in the tapajós river basin a major tributary of the amazon river their results showed that spps can be used in place of damaged or missing rain gauges as spp derived hydrographs were comparable to those obtained using rain gauge data 4 3 australasia in humid tropical and subtropical climates which characterize large areas in australasia river flooding is a common consequence of monsoons australasia is indeed the most frequently affected continent by floods during 1973 2002 the number of flood disasters was the largest 40 in asia and 4 in oceania compared to any other continents 25 in america 17 in africa and 14 in europe as reported by cred 2004 specifically during the same period south asia was the most frequently affected region 39 followed by south east asia 30 and east asia 25 with west asia being the least frequently affected region dutta and herath 2004 advancement in remote sensing geographic information systems and hydrologic modeling in the past few decades was shown to have the potential to improve flood risk assessment in the area sanyal and lu 2004 for instance wardah et al 2008 demonstrated that an extra lead time of about 2 h could be gained if information from spps was coupled with a rainfall runoff model to forecast flash floods in the upper klang river basin this basin is located in the western region of peninsular malaysia and characterized by one of the most developed and rapidly urbanizing areas in asia which also includes the federal capital of kuala lumpur in a recent study qi et al 2015 evaluated the applicability of six fine resolution precipitation products including 3b42 3b42rt persiann and gsmap among others to hydrologic modeling in a small basin in china and proposed a framework for quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in the precipitation forcing model formulation and the combination of the two in river discharges they found that the interaction between uncertainties in the precipitation products and in the hydrologic model itself contribute significantly to uncertainty in discharge simulations thus a better precipitation product does not necessarily guarantee a better discharge estimate they also concluded that although spps are not as accurate as gauge observations they might perform better than the ground based dataset when combined with the appropriate hydrologic model similarly artan et al 2007 demonstrated the utility of spps in the nam ou and se done basins which contribute large flows to the mekong river and therefore impact the recurrent floods that occur in the area along the mekong river s main stem like the 2000 summer one that counted more than 800 fatalities plate and insisiengmay 2002 their results showed that a slight rainfall bias was amplified into a much larger streamflow bias in the se done basin whereas in the nam ou basin there was no significant difference between streamflow simulated with ground observations and spps they also concluded that the hydrologic model should be recalibrated with spps instead of using a ground observations based calibration tang et al 2016 compared tmpa to its successor imerg over the ganjiang river basin in southeast china coupled routing and excess storage crest wang et al 2011 hydrologic simulations showed that the day 1 imerg product outperforms its predecessor suggesting a promising prospect of hydrologic utility and a desirable hydrologic continuity from trmm era product heritages to gpm era products however a follow up study by li et al 2017 showed that the performance of imerg in simulating streamflow in the same basin is barely acceptable especially if compared to the one of in situ observations one important issue with flood forecasting is predicting streamflow in downstream countries where river basins are transboundary being located at the sink of the ganges and brahmaputra rivers bangladesh fits this category the flood forecasting and warning center of bangladesh controls a network of more than a hundred rain gauges and 30 river discharge stations which make it an ideal platform for designing and testing a prototype flood monitoring system in tropical basins hossain et al 2007 hossain 2006 however if on one hand there is large potential for using satellite observations in flood forecasting in bangladesh on the other hand there are many roadblocks to developing an operational system which include interaction with stakeholder agencies staff training and allocation of resources hossain et al 2014 4 4 europe floods are the most common natural disaster in europe several flooding events in past decades e g rhine meuse po and oder rivers in the 1990s the uk 2000 wet autumn elbe and danube rivers in 2002 drew considerable media attention hajat et al 2003 this section discusses a few attempts to use spps in hydrologic modeling across europe ciabatta et al 2015 used 3b42rt and sm2rain brocca et al 2014 to drive a lumped hydrologic model over four basins in italy during a 4 year period 2010 2013 this work highlights the need of a bias correction and a recalibration of model parameters for reaching satisfactory performances of the hydrologic model but also shows that model recalibration is not always effective when the model is applied to a period different from the one used for calibration the use of sm2rain for streamflow simulation was found to be promising and the integration of 3b42rt or sm2rain with a gauge only product was able to further improve the performance of the hydrologic model in the scientific literature only few studies address the use of spps for flash flood simulation nikolopoulos et al 2013 used three different satellite datasets 3b42rt cmorph persiann for analyzing a significant flash flood occurred in northern italy although spps suffered from large biases they were able to represent the temporal variability of basin averaged rainfall similar results were also obtained by stampoulis et al 2013 for several flash flood events occurred in the mediterranean region however the spp forced hydrologic simulations could not fully capture the basin s hydrologic response during the flash flood event at satellite pixel scale gourley et al 2011 even after adjusting the satellite rainfall fields for the mean field bias in complex alpine terrain error characteristics were also shown to depend on the flood type mei et al 2016a with the random error dampening effect being less pronounced in flash flood events than regular rain flood events furthermore mei et al 2016b investigated the error propagation of six spps in flash flood simulations for a range of mountainous basin sizes 255 6967 km2 in northeast italy during fall and summer better performances were observed in the summer season for moderate to large basins and gauge adjusted spps were shown to reduce errors and increase correlations with reference precipitation and streamflow simulations nikolopoulos et al 2010 evaluated how scale characteristics influence the propagation of satellite rainfall error through a distributed hydrologic model focusing on flood simulations over complex terrain in the alps they found that i resolution is much more important than the retrieval error and depends strongly on the scale of application catchment area ii different satellite products perform differently in terms of hydrologic error propagation and iii the propagation of error depends on the basin size for example in small watersheds 400 km2 the error from rainfall to runoff is dampened more than that in larger watersheds although the actual error increases as the drainage area decreases 5 lessons learned and way forward this work reviewed the most common satellite precipitation products during the trmm and gpm eras and discussed the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect hydrologic model simulations by analyzing past studies that focused on using spps for predicting streamflow and runoff across several continents it is evident that the performance of spp forced hydrologic models is highly dependent on the satellite product itself and that a few common issues have been raised by several studies the problem of bias in the forcing precipitation dataset is germane and can carry minor e g su et al 2008 to major issues in streamflow simulation e g thiemig et al 2012 biases in spps can greatly vary by region and by season for instance in warm and dry regions evaporation of hydrometeors is significant before they reach the ground this can be the source of important overestimations and false alarms in satellite products on the other hand the poor capability of detecting rainfall events during the cold season makes it difficult to correct for rain events that are missed by satellite retrievals unless real time gauge data are available in this respect very simple or more complex bias correction methods can significantly reduce streamflow errors serrat capdevila et al 2014 for example beck et al 2017b demonstrated that a spp based on merging different non gauge corrected satellite observations rescaled to match a gauge based climatic dataset i e a simple long term bias correction yields reasonable streamflow performance over tropical regions however given the non stationary nature of the bias of spps it is no guarantee that this correction is always effective in terms of improving streamflow predictions ciabatta et al 2016 bitew and gebremichael 2011 model recalibration has also been proved to be a viable strategy for improving spp forced hydrologic model performances across basins of different size and climatology in several regions of the world this can be attributed to the different nature of the spp signal with respect to the one captured by ground measurements most commonly tipping bucket rain gauges on one hand satellite sensors observe large scale instantaneous precipitation at different times and then average it over that time interval which may not fully represent the actual rainfall intermittency especially if the number of the satellite overpasses is very small on the other hand rain gauges measure accumulated rainfall at one single point in space which may not be representative of the rain spatial distribution therefore it is likely that model recalibration is able to adjust for these discrepancies through parameter tuning thus obtaining model performances comparable to the optimal parameter set according to a pre defined criterion equifinality concept beven and binley 1992 in other words different parameter settings can compensate for errors in the satellite rainfall forcing thereby improving streamflow model predictions with respect to the non recalibration option however this parameter compensation comes with a locally optimized model with parameter values that may be unrealistic and may therefore limit the model predictive capability at the sub basin scale be it during periods different from the one used for calibration or when different initial conditions are considered bitew and gebremichael 2011 yong et al 2012 xue et al 2013 nikolopoulos et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2016 the intrinsic quality of spps the basin size the spp resolution and the choice of hydrologic model have been shown to impact the error propagation from the precipitation forcing to the output however no consensus has been reached on the quantification of these effects in some cases the error is shown to increase with the catchment area e g falck et al 2015 but in others no change in the error magnitude was observed as a function of the basin size e g pan et al 2010 spp resolution has been shown to play a more important role than the error associated with spps and its impact on the streamflow simulations strongly depends on the catchment area nikolopoulos et al 2010 nevertheless different models show different performances for different spps suggesting the existence of interconnections between models and their precipitation forcing qi et al 2015 an alternative strategy for employing spps in flood simulations is to combine them with ancillary information like satellite soil moisture observations crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 román cascón et al 2017 merging soil moisture observations with rainfall retrievals can provide significant benefits as the soil moisture signature after a rain event can persist from a few hours to several days for instance chen et al 2014 and alvarez garreton et al 2015 showed that the integration of spps with satellite soil moisture information has the potential to improve streamflow prediction during high flow periods these results open new possibilities for using spps in hydrologic simulations and obtaining more reliable flood simulations we believe that future work should move away from comparing different spps and their performance in streamflow simulations and rather be directed to identify 1 the conditions climatological catchment area acceptable error in the output model formulation under which spps could be successfully used in hydrologic models 2 provide common metrics that are on one hand non redundant but on the other hand comprehensive to assess the performance of a hydrologic model in simulating flood peaks low flows and peak timing and 3 explore the possibility of merging not only different spps but also ancillary information e g soil moisture vegetation water content that can enhance the

7451,this work is meant to summarize lessons learned on using satellite precipitation products for riverine flood modeling and to propose future directions in this field of research firstly the most common satellite precipitation products spps during the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and global precipitation mission gpm eras are reviewed secondly we discuss the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect streamflow and runoff model simulations thirdly past studies that focused on using spps for predicting streamflow and runoff are analyzed as the impact of floods depends not only on the characteristics of the flood itself but also on the characteristics of the region population density land use geophysical and climatic factors a regional analysis is required to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods the performance of spp forced hydrological models was shown to largely depend on several factors including precipitation type seasonality hydrological model formulation topography across several basins around the world the bias in spps was recognized as a major issue and bias correction methods of different complexity were shown to significantly reduce streamflow errors model re calibration was also raised as a viable option to improve spp forced streamflow simulations but caution is necessary when recalibrating models with spp which may result in unrealistic parameter values from a general standpoint there is significant potential for using satellite observations in flood forecasting but the performance of spp in hydrological modeling is still inadequate for operational purposes keywords hydrologic modeling satellite precipitation floods 1 introduction riverine flooding occurs either when excessive rain falls over an extended period of time and leads a river to exceed its capacity or because of heavy snow melt there are two main types of riverine flooding overbank floods which occur when water overflows over the edges of a river or stream and flash floods which are caused by heavy rainfall in a short amount of time usually less than 6 h and characterized by an intense high velocity torrent of water that rips through river beds urban streets or mountain canyons floods are among the most dangerous and costly natural disasters causing extensive economic and social damages worldwide wake 2013 unisdr 2015 the recent intensification of extreme precipitation events has the potential to aggravate the frequency and intensity of floods ipcc 2012 in a recent study janssen et al 2014 observed an overall increasing trend in extreme precipitation events from 1901 to 2012 across the united states u s similarly blöschl et al 2017 found a clear climate signal in flood timing change when they analyzed river floods in europe over the past five decades specifically they observed that higher temperatures caused earlier spring snowmelt floods in northeastern europe delayed winter storms caused later winter floods in the north sea region and along the mediterranean coast and earlier soil moisture maxima caused earlier winter floods across western europe future projections of earth system models esms suggest further increases in extreme precipitation frequency in a high emission scenario however model simulations often show an underestimation of extreme events when compared to observations asadieh and krakauer 2015 this highlights the pressing need for improved methods for predicting and mitigating the impact and risk of floods globally e g feyen et al 2012 hydrologic early warning systems are the main tool for assessing flood risk and reducing damages by forecasting flood events using real time data obtained through ground monitoring networks e g rain gauges and radars artan et al 2007 however the use of such data mainly rainfall is affected by several limiting factors 1 the limited spatial representativeness of local measurements kidd et al 2012 2 the network density fig 1 and 3 reflectivity issues related to radar data a way to overcome these issues was suggested more than 30 years ago by barret and martin 1981 that is the use of satellite precipitation products spps that are nowadays available on a global scale at increasing spatial and temporal resolution the use of these products in hydrologic applications has opened new venues to support water management globally especially in poorly gauged basins and large basins with larger concentration times spps may be the only input data to allow flow predictions downstream with enough lead time to implement management and response actions serrat capdevila et al 2014 despite the abundance of spps spaceborne rainfall data are scarcely used in hydrologic applications this work discusses the main reasons for which the use of spps in hydrology is not operational yet including their insufficient latency and spatial temporal resolution serrat capdevila et al 2014 recent research work has shown that even in poorly gauged regions hydrologic simulations using spps are equal or inferior in performance to simulations that employ even just a few ground based rain gauges yilmaz et al 2005 harris et al 2007 stisen and sandholt 2010 model re analysis precipitation products are the only choice above 60 latitude and an effective alternative above 35 latitude where they ingest a high number of ground observations and during cold periods because of their ability to capture fairly well large scale weather systems which represent the dominant source of precipitation in these regions beck et al 2017a 2017b conversely these products perform very poorly in the tropics because of the small scale high intensity nature of rainfall which cannot be reliably simulated by numerical weather prediction models re analysis products are of particular interest especially for estimating snow and rain on snow which are often poorly quantified by spps tian et al 2014 however this work focuses only on the use of spps for streamflow estimation and future work should consider re analysis products and compare their efficiency in simulating streamflow to the one of spps this work provides a brief description of the most common satellite precipitation products section 2 and their errors and uncertainties that have the potential to play an important role in hydrologic modeling section 3 section 4 provides an overview of past research activities that focused on the use of spps for predicting streamflow and runoff in different basins of the world the discussion in section 5 focuses on the main reasons that still limit the adoption of spps in operational flood monitoring and prediction and proposes future research directions 2 satellite precipitation observations satellite precipitation estimates can be derived from a range of observations from many different sensors including geostationary geo satellites and low earth orbiting leo satellites kidd and huffman 2011 serrat capdevila et al 2014 five operational geo satellites are required to ensure full west east and 70n to 70s coverage and provide imagery on a frequent and regular basis i e every 30 min leo satellites generally cross the equator at the same local time on each orbit providing about two overpasses per day rainfall can be inferred from visible images since thick clouds that are more likely to be associated with rainfall tend to be brighter than the earth s surface infrared ir imagery available night and day is potentially more useful since heavier rainfall tends to be associated with larger taller clouds with colder cloud tops passive microwaves pmw represent a useful alternative as emissions from rain droplets lead to an increase in pmw radiation and scattering caused by precipitating ice particles leads to a decrease in pmw radiation a growing number of techniques have been developed that exploit the synergy between polar orbiting retrievals infrequent more direct and geostationary observations frequent less direct and that blend ir radiances with pmw observations e g turk et al 1999 http www isac cnr it ipwg data datasets html one example is the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman and coauthors 2007 which ingests data from pmw imaging with sounding sensors and geostationary ir data other techniques have used artificial neural networks anns to derive precipitation estimates by combining information from multi channel and multi sensor observations like the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using anns persiann hsu et al 1997 other techniques use ir data as a measure of cloud movement to morph the pmw observations between successive satellite overpasses examples of current state of the art methodologies are the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota and coauthors 2007 recently the nasa jaxa global precipitation measurement gpm mission in coordination with the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc released the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2014 which merges precipitation estimates from pmw and ir sensors and monthly surface precipitation gauge analysis data to provide half hourly precipitation estimates on a 0 1 grid over the 60 n s domain as an alternative to standard spps approaches that use satellite soil moisture data were recently used to retrieve and or correct rainfall crow et al 2009 pellarin et al 2013 brocca et al 2013 wanders et al 2015 román cascón et al 2017 for instance crow et al 2011 attempted to correct satellite rainfall estimates using the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart and brocca et al 2013 2014 developed sm2rain a method that inverts the soil water balance equation to directly estimate rainfall from soil moisture observations this algorithm was employed by ciabatta et al 2017 to obtain long term 0 25 daily rainfall estimates by using the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture dataset dorigo et al 2017 3 errors uncertainties and validation of spp a plethora of studies validated spps through comparison with gauge and radar rainfall estimates in different parts of the world and under different climatic conditions gottschalck et al 2005 ebert et al 2007 tian and peters lidard 2010 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 maggioni et al 2016 in this section we summarize the main sources of errors of these products that may limit their use in hydrologic modeling to monitor and predict floods errors in spps are commonly assessed with respect to either ground based observations gauge and or radar or models particular attention when evaluating the performance of different spps has to be paid to the error in the benchmark dataset fig 2 helps to understand how the quality of the benchmark dataset can condition the validation of spps the bias in the north western us changes from positive to negative if either the gauge alone or the radar gauge dataset is considered tian et al 2007 anagnostou et al 2010 presented a cross validation of the mesonet rainfall gauges based on an independent small scale but very dense 100 m inter gauge distances rain gauge network i e micronet in oklahoma their work demonstrated the need to benchmark reference data sources prior to their quantitative use in validating remote sensing retrievals while this reference can be easily obtained in united states europe australia and china thanks to the relatively high rain gauge density see fig 1 many parts of the land areas still lack a sufficiently dense rain gauge coverage such is the main obstacle for a proper evaluation of the satellite retrievals kidd et al 2017 massari et al 2017 this poses a challenge not only for the mere validation of spps but also for i understanding how spp uncertainties propagate into hydrologic simulations i e how do spp uncertainties translate into streamflow uncertainties and ii using rain gauge information for correcting the bias in spps prior to their use in hydrologic models fig 3 two important aspects must be considered when rain gauge measurements are adopted as benchmark namely the temporal sampling uncertainties related to observation frequency and the spatial sampling error related to rain gauge density in particular temporal sampling uncertainties increase with the sampling interval according to a scaling law and decrease with increasing averaging area with no strong dependence on local orography villarini et al 2008 on the other hand spatial sampling uncertainties tend to decrease for increasing accumulation time with no strong dependence on the gauge location within the pixel or on the gauge elevation a simple rule was proposed for the number of gauges required to estimate areal rainfall with a given accuracy for a pixel of about 200 km2 in order to obtain an accuracy of about 20 of its true value 25 25 15 and 4 gauges are necessary at the 15 min hourly 3 hourly and daily scale respectively 3 1 rain detection hit biases and random errors an instantaneous satellite observation can be affected by detection systematic and random errors detection errors include false alarms when the satellite estimate is larger than zero but in fact it does not rain and missed rain when the satellite estimate is zero but there is rain at the ground when the satellite correctly detects rainfall the estimated rain rate may be characterized by systematic or bias and or random errors biases arise from systematic problems while the intrinsic random error depends on the remote sensing measurement retrieval error and the lack of continuity in the coverage by low earth orbiting satellites sampling error bennartz and petty 2001 typical sources of retrieval error are due to beam filling issues and sub pixel inhomogeneity in the rainfall field kummerow 1998 and to the difficulties in estimating the impact of solid hydrometeors bennartz and petty 2001 sampling errors are determined by the satellite orbit swath width and space time characteristics of the rainfall fields themselves chang and chiu 1999 errors in rain detection and in precipitation rate estimation can both play an important role in water cycle applications e g flood forecasting land surface modeling past studies showed that sampling uncertainty decreases at high rainfall rates large domain sizes and long time integration north and nakamoto 1989 bell and kundu 2000 bell et al 1990 steiner et al 2003 huffman 1997 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 hossain and anagnostou 2004 ciabatta et al 2016 since precipitation follows a diurnal cycle the way sampling is distributed during the day may have an effect on the estimated average rain over different accumulation periods salby et al 1997 oliveira et al 2016 gebremichael and krajewski 2005 evaluated the effect of temporal sampling on rain spatial statistics in central us they found that the expected value of the relative error is zero for rainfall averaged over 5 days or longer and that better temporal sampling produces average fields that are spatially less noisy while large catchments should be less affected by rainfall sampling errors because their runoff response is dampened by the basin characteristics small catchments under the effects of intense convective storms could be seriously impacted e g libertino et al 2016 aghakouchak et al 2011 evaluated the ability of cmorph persiann 3b42rt and 3b42 in estimating extreme precipitation over the southern great plains and concluded that the spps detection skills reduce with more extreme events habib et al 2009 showed that 3b42 and 3b42rt tend to overestimate low rain rates and underestimate high rain rates during six tropical storms in louisiana spps usually detect more high intensity events and miss light rainfall events as shown by tian et al 2007 in the southeast us producing a shifted rain distribution due to the non linearity of land surface processes this shift may cause significant errors in runoff prediction as stronger rainfall events would generate more surface runoff in addition missing light rainfall events is detrimental to model state estimation with immediate effects on the catchment conditions prior to any rainfall events which in turn leads to a high probability of underestimating or overestimating the flood magnitude mehran and aghakouchak 2014 studied the capability of 3b42rt cmorph and persiann to estimate high rain rates at different temporal accumulations across the us and found that none of the fine temporal resolution 3 hourly products is ideal for measuring heavy precipitation moreover as accumulation time gets larger probability of detection improves and false alarm ratio decreases which may largely impact hydrologic model simulations ideally run at fine temporal resolutions to catch sub daily flood events e g flash floods 3 2 seasonality storm type and topography many validation studies indicated that the performance of spps is influenced by seasonal precipitation patterns storm type and background surface gottschalck et al 2005 tian et al 2007 ebert et al 2007 oliveira et al 2016 for instance ebert et al 2007 compared near real time spps with numerical weather models in australia us and northwestern europe they found that spps perform better than models for convective storms summer and from the tropics to mid latitudes in these cases retrieval uncertainty is the primary error source mainly caused by the ir inaccuracy with stratiform precipitation and snow cover in semi arid climates northern mexico large false alarm rates are observed due to raindrop evaporation before reaching the surface moazami et al 2013 and dinku et al 2010 detected a similar behavior in iran and eastern africa respectively tian and peters lidard 2010 provided a global map of spps uncertainties without using a reference validation dataset they showed that the spread of global estimates systematically depend on seasonality location and rain rate with the largest standard deviations among products at high latitudes 40 and during the cold seasons deviations are lower in tropical regions with intense convective precipitation and higher in cold regions with complex topography and light rainfall events along coastlines and over water bodies kubota et al 2009 in summary the more the precipitation regime tends toward deep convection the more less accurate the satellite model estimates are although spps have higher accuracy during summers in this season they are characterized by a considerable positive bias which may largely impact hydrologic model predictions when spps are used as forcing data zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 demonstrated the dependence of seven spps errors on climatology in chile and concluded that spps performed better during the wet seasons and in the humid south and central chile in particular at low and mid elevation 0 1000 ma s l than in the arid northern regions and the far south high mountain regions are among the most challenging environments for remote sensing based precipitation measurements due to extreme topography and large weather and climate variability at the same time these regions are typically characterized by a lack of in situ data but also by common flash floods whose consequences can be devastating hong et al 2007 evaluated the impact of topography on the performance of persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs in western mexico the hourly 4 km persiann ccs manages to capture the spatial distribution and timing of diurnal convective rainfall but shows elevation dependent biases underestimating light rain at both high elevations and early in the day and overestimating precipitation rates at low elevation elevation dependent trends with underestimation at higher elevation for cmorph and tmpa 3b42rt were also observed in ethiopia and colombia dinku et al 2007 2010 hirpa et al 2010 the difficulty of spps in estimating precipitation over mountainous regions was also observed by guo et al 2017 in central asia where significant elevation dependent errors were observed in eight spps especially at altitudes higher than 3000 m with large miss precipitation errors and poor detection capabilities similarly yong et al 2010 found that the error structures of both 3b42rt and the 3b42 research product have a significant geo topography dependent distribution pattern closely associated with high latitudes and high elevations however in some regions of the world such as the kabul basin in afghanistan a relatively good detection of both amount and distribution of precipitation is observed ghulami et al 2017 the thermal ir thresholds commonly used to discriminate between raining and non raining clouds could cause the ir based rainfall retrieval algorithms to miss light precipitation events e g hong et al 2007 this however may not be a primary concern for flood monitoring and forecasting on the other hand the underestimation of heavy rainfall in pmw algorithms determined by warm clouds over mountainous regions could be problematic dinku et al 2010 to offset this issue the gsmap algorithm includes an orographic non orographic classification scheme for passive microwave radiometers shige et al 2013 yamamoto and shige 2015 yamamoto et al 2017 4 spp forced hydrologic modeling the impact of a flood largely depends on the characteristics of the flood itself and the characteristics of the region such as population density land use emergency systems as well as geophysical and climatic factors for example flash floods may be more devastating than small scale inundations due to drainage problems and developing countries may have scarcer capital resources to invest in flood protection strategies than more developed regions jonkman 2005 flooding is therefore a global hazard that requires a regional analysis to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods only a few efforts attempted to estimate floods globally using satellite images dottori et al 2016 revilla romero et al 2015 and accomplished it by forcing hydrologic models with quasi global spps wu et al 2012a 2012b 2014 the global flood monitoring system gfms developed at the university of maryland by wu et al 2012b is based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model and uses real time spps to derive flood monitoring parameters for the latitude band 50 n 50 s at 12 km 3hourly resolution http flood umd edu gfms was shown to perform slightly better for the research products which are gauge corrected than the real time ones and for longer duration events 3 day events versus 1 day events poorer performance was observed at higher latitudes because of the larger errors in the spps another attempt was presented by beck et al 2017a who carried out a comprehensive evaluation of 23 quasi global sub daily gridded precipitation datasets for 2000 2016 ten gauge corrected datasets were evaluated using the hbv hydrologic model seibert and vis 2012 which was calibrated with streamflow observations derived from 9053 small to medium sized 50 000 km2 catchments worldwide the datasets directly incorporating daily gauge data overall outperformed the ones directly incorporating 5 day or monthly gauge data 4 1 africa flood risk has been growing in africa in the past decade jonkman 2005 extreme rainfall and subsequent floods affected 600 000 people in 16 west african nations only in september 2009 which followed the 2007 floods that affected more than a million people in uganda ethiopia sudan burkina faso togo mali and niger and the 2008 flood in mozambique united nations 2009 the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred showed that the number of fatalities caused by floods has increased about one order of magnitude during 1950 2009 in africa which indicates the urgent need for action in a continent where spps has great potential due to the lack of in situ observations di baldassarre et al 2010 stisen and sandholt 2010 forced a distributed hydrologic model over the senegal river basin with tmpa 3b42 cmorph cpc fews v2 persiann and a locally product based on cold cloud duration ccd they found that spps need other than a bias correction a specific model recalibration because of differences in the analyzed products e g the number of rainy days and the recorded intensity and differences in the temporal sampling however they state that satellite data can be very useful due to their spatial and temporal continuity and can be used to drive hydrologic models mainly in remote and ungauged areas thiemig et al 2012 performed a hydrologic validation considering tmpa 3b42 cmorph persiann the reanalysis product by the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 and a local rainfall estimation calibrated over the african continent the noaa climate prediction center 2002 over two basins in africa the volta river basin and the upper baro akobo basin which is part of the nile river basin they pointed out that a model recalibration with each spp and a bias correction only if the specific spp is considerably biased are necessary in order to improve the performance of streamflow simulations they also found that the histogram matching method is favorable for bias correction and spps provide better performance for high flow conditions casse et al 2015 analyzed the potential of different rainfall products to predict the niger river flood events in niamey the capital and largest city of niger they found that satellite only products 3b42rt cmorph persiann are characterized by a considerable positive bias and large differences in rainfall distribution with respect to gauge only cpc and gauge adjusted rainfall satellite products 3b42 which led to poor results in flood simulations at niamey however a bias correction significantly improved results similar conclusions were drawn by li et al 2009 who investigated the possibility of integrating 3b42rt into a flood prediction model for disaster management in nzoia a sub basin of lake victoria in east africa prone to flooding because of heavy rains and overflowing of the tributary streams simulated streamflow was found comparable to the benchmark simulation obtained with the model calibrated based on rain gauge and streamflow observations bias ratio 20 and nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency nsce 0 67 results improved even further when a bias correction was applied to 3b42rt bias ratio 3 6 and nsce 0 71 bitew and gebremichael 2011 assessed the suitability of forcing a semi distributed hydrologic model with spps cmorph 3b42rt 3b42 and persiann for daily streamflow simulation in two watersheds in the ethiopian highlands koga of 299 km2 and gilgel abay of 1656 km2 they concluded that the model performance largely depends on the spp type with 3b42rt and cmorph showing modest skills and underestimation of large flood peaks and 3b42 and persiann showing poor skills surprisingly the real time product 3b42rt outperformed the research product 3b42 possibly due to the lack of gauges in the area and the worsening of the rain gauge corrected product increasing the watershed area further improved the simulations obtained from 3b42rt and cmorph in a follow up study on the koga basin bitew et al 2012 investigated two different model calibration approaches with gauge rainfall as input and with each spp as input they concluded that the best model performance was obtained after spps were bias corrected and the model recalibrated with the specific spp which corroborates what observed by artan et al 2007 in the gash river watershed a transboundary basin among ethiopia eritrea and sudan and sub basin of the nile river 4 2 america several studies have been carried out in the past decades to evaluate the performance of hydrologic model forced with spps across the american continent most studies focused on north america with a few examples in the southern hemisphere guetter et al 1996 simulated streamflow in three catchments within the des moines river basin in the midwestern us they forced a rainfall runoff routing model with a 10 year synthetic satellite rainfall dataset in three different ways 1 the model was calibrated and validated with observed rainfall data 2 the model was calibrated with observed rainfall data and then validated by using the synthetic satellite data and 3 the model was calibrated and validated with satellite data they observed an underestimation of the mean areal precipitation and hence biased streamflow simulations when the model was calibrated with observed data and forced with the synthetic satellite dataset errors were also found to increase with decreasing catchment area harris et al 2007 used 3b42rt to force a hydrologic model over a catchment in kentucky finding that a bias correction is needed before using near real time satellite data for flood forecasting specifically they found that bias adjustments could improve flood prediction with the trade off of more false alarms in the peak flow the importance of correcting biases in spps has been shown for other basins across the us including the illinois river basin the leaf river basin in mississippi and the san pedro basin in arizona behrangi et al 2011 hong et al 2006 tobin et al 2010 the propagation of satellite precipitation estimate errors and biases in hydrologic applications has also been object of interest in recent studies especially in terms of how the error propagation is affected as a function of basin size and temporal resolution nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 studied the influence of temporal sampling intervals spatial correlation and drainage area on relative errors in precipitation and streamflow estimates over the ohio river basin a major tributary of the mississippi river basin they observed that 1 streamflow errors were larger for small drainage areas but decreased rapidly for drainage areas larger than 50 000 km2 where most of the streamflow error is associated with fast near surface runoff response 2 streamflow estimates were positively biased due to sampling errors with the bias increasing with sampling interval and drainage area 3 the error in streamflow decreased with increasing accumulation periods and basin areas and 4 a 3 hourly sampling interval may be very useful for hydrologic prediction for medium to large scale river basins 100 000 km2 similarly yilmaz et al 2005 who focused on seven basins of varying size and geographic location within the relatively humid southeastern us found that the hydrologic model performance is better in large basins and largely depends on the bias in the original satellite precipitation estimates on the other hand pan et al 2010 evaluated the skill of 8 different rainfall products i e 3b42 3b42rt cmorph persiann trmm microwave imager global precipitation climatology project gpcp and two reanalysis products as forcing inputs for hydrologic applications over the contiguous us they found that satellite rainfall errors are highly correlated in space within the range of one storm system and thus do not change in magnitude with spatial scale i e basin size pan et al 2010 also observed that gauge corrections significantly enhanced satellite products skills by largely reducing the bias in hydrologic predictions especially over mountainous areas these findings were corroborated by maggioni et al 2013 who proposed to use a stochastic ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain and anagnostou 2004 to improve streamflow predictions across a range of basin scales in the tar pamlico basin by applying srem2d to three spps 3b42rt cmorph and persiann ccs the simulated runoff ensemble was able to envelope the reference runoff they also showed that the bias doubled from rainfall to runoff for basin of different sizes ranging from 500 to 5000 km2 a study on the same basin by vergara et al 2013 investigated the uncertainty due to spp s resolution in hydrologic modeling and forecasting systems they concluded that resolution degradation introduced significant errors in the rainfall fields which propagated to the streamflow simulations as magnified bias and dampened root mean square error the applicability of error corrections to spps in streamflow simulations has also been investigated across 19 sub basins of the tocantins araguaia basin 764 000 km2 located in the center north region of brazil falck et al 2015 the ensemble error model srem2d was able to correct for errors in four satellite precipitation datasets 3b42rt cmorph gsmap and the noaa hydroestimator hydro e by moving the modeled streamflow closer to streamflow observations when compared to simulations forced with uncorrected spps mean absolute errors and root mean square errors decreased as a function of the catchment area for all spps however the rainfall to streamflow error propagation did not show any dependence on the basin size a study by su et al 2008 also focused on south america they forced the vic semi distributed hydrologic model with 3b42 in the la plata basin which with its area of 3 2 106 km2 is the fifth largest river basin in the world and is second only to the amazon in south america 3b42 driven simulations captured daily flooding events and low flows even though peak flows tended to be positively biased spp driven simulated flows were also able to reproduce seasonal and interannual streamflow variability collischonn et al 2008 confirmed the potential of using trmm based rainfall estimates as input to a large scale hydrologic model in the tapajós river basin a major tributary of the amazon river their results showed that spps can be used in place of damaged or missing rain gauges as spp derived hydrographs were comparable to those obtained using rain gauge data 4 3 australasia in humid tropical and subtropical climates which characterize large areas in australasia river flooding is a common consequence of monsoons australasia is indeed the most frequently affected continent by floods during 1973 2002 the number of flood disasters was the largest 40 in asia and 4 in oceania compared to any other continents 25 in america 17 in africa and 14 in europe as reported by cred 2004 specifically during the same period south asia was the most frequently affected region 39 followed by south east asia 30 and east asia 25 with west asia being the least frequently affected region dutta and herath 2004 advancement in remote sensing geographic information systems and hydrologic modeling in the past few decades was shown to have the potential to improve flood risk assessment in the area sanyal and lu 2004 for instance wardah et al 2008 demonstrated that an extra lead time of about 2 h could be gained if information from spps was coupled with a rainfall runoff model to forecast flash floods in the upper klang river basin this basin is located in the western region of peninsular malaysia and characterized by one of the most developed and rapidly urbanizing areas in asia which also includes the federal capital of kuala lumpur in a recent study qi et al 2015 evaluated the applicability of six fine resolution precipitation products including 3b42 3b42rt persiann and gsmap among others to hydrologic modeling in a small basin in china and proposed a framework for quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in the precipitation forcing model formulation and the combination of the two in river discharges they found that the interaction between uncertainties in the precipitation products and in the hydrologic model itself contribute significantly to uncertainty in discharge simulations thus a better precipitation product does not necessarily guarantee a better discharge estimate they also concluded that although spps are not as accurate as gauge observations they might perform better than the ground based dataset when combined with the appropriate hydrologic model similarly artan et al 2007 demonstrated the utility of spps in the nam ou and se done basins which contribute large flows to the mekong river and therefore impact the recurrent floods that occur in the area along the mekong river s main stem like the 2000 summer one that counted more than 800 fatalities plate and insisiengmay 2002 their results showed that a slight rainfall bias was amplified into a much larger streamflow bias in the se done basin whereas in the nam ou basin there was no significant difference between streamflow simulated with ground observations and spps they also concluded that the hydrologic model should be recalibrated with spps instead of using a ground observations based calibration tang et al 2016 compared tmpa to its successor imerg over the ganjiang river basin in southeast china coupled routing and excess storage crest wang et al 2011 hydrologic simulations showed that the day 1 imerg product outperforms its predecessor suggesting a promising prospect of hydrologic utility and a desirable hydrologic continuity from trmm era product heritages to gpm era products however a follow up study by li et al 2017 showed that the performance of imerg in simulating streamflow in the same basin is barely acceptable especially if compared to the one of in situ observations one important issue with flood forecasting is predicting streamflow in downstream countries where river basins are transboundary being located at the sink of the ganges and brahmaputra rivers bangladesh fits this category the flood forecasting and warning center of bangladesh controls a network of more than a hundred rain gauges and 30 river discharge stations which make it an ideal platform for designing and testing a prototype flood monitoring system in tropical basins hossain et al 2007 hossain 2006 however if on one hand there is large potential for using satellite observations in flood forecasting in bangladesh on the other hand there are many roadblocks to developing an operational system which include interaction with stakeholder agencies staff training and allocation of resources hossain et al 2014 4 4 europe floods are the most common natural disaster in europe several flooding events in past decades e g rhine meuse po and oder rivers in the 1990s the uk 2000 wet autumn elbe and danube rivers in 2002 drew considerable media attention hajat et al 2003 this section discusses a few attempts to use spps in hydrologic modeling across europe ciabatta et al 2015 used 3b42rt and sm2rain brocca et al 2014 to drive a lumped hydrologic model over four basins in italy during a 4 year period 2010 2013 this work highlights the need of a bias correction and a recalibration of model parameters for reaching satisfactory performances of the hydrologic model but also shows that model recalibration is not always effective when the model is applied to a period different from the one used for calibration the use of sm2rain for streamflow simulation was found to be promising and the integration of 3b42rt or sm2rain with a gauge only product was able to further improve the performance of the hydrologic model in the scientific literature only few studies address the use of spps for flash flood simulation nikolopoulos et al 2013 used three different satellite datasets 3b42rt cmorph persiann for analyzing a significant flash flood occurred in northern italy although spps suffered from large biases they were able to represent the temporal variability of basin averaged rainfall similar results were also obtained by stampoulis et al 2013 for several flash flood events occurred in the mediterranean region however the spp forced hydrologic simulations could not fully capture the basin s hydrologic response during the flash flood event at satellite pixel scale gourley et al 2011 even after adjusting the satellite rainfall fields for the mean field bias in complex alpine terrain error characteristics were also shown to depend on the flood type mei et al 2016a with the random error dampening effect being less pronounced in flash flood events than regular rain flood events furthermore mei et al 2016b investigated the error propagation of six spps in flash flood simulations for a range of mountainous basin sizes 255 6967 km2 in northeast italy during fall and summer better performances were observed in the summer season for moderate to large basins and gauge adjusted spps were shown to reduce errors and increase correlations with reference precipitation and streamflow simulations nikolopoulos et al 2010 evaluated how scale characteristics influence the propagation of satellite rainfall error through a distributed hydrologic model focusing on flood simulations over complex terrain in the alps they found that i resolution is much more important than the retrieval error and depends strongly on the scale of application catchment area ii different satellite products perform differently in terms of hydrologic error propagation and iii the propagation of error depends on the basin size for example in small watersheds 400 km2 the error from rainfall to runoff is dampened more than that in larger watersheds although the actual error increases as the drainage area decreases 5 lessons learned and way forward this work reviewed the most common satellite precipitation products during the trmm and gpm eras and discussed the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect hydrologic model simulations by analyzing past studies that focused on using spps for predicting streamflow and runoff across several continents it is evident that the performance of spp forced hydrologic models is highly dependent on the satellite product itself and that a few common issues have been raised by several studies the problem of bias in the forcing precipitation dataset is germane and can carry minor e g su et al 2008 to major issues in streamflow simulation e g thiemig et al 2012 biases in spps can greatly vary by region and by season for instance in warm and dry regions evaporation of hydrometeors is significant before they reach the ground this can be the source of important overestimations and false alarms in satellite products on the other hand the poor capability of detecting rainfall events during the cold season makes it difficult to correct for rain events that are missed by satellite retrievals unless real time gauge data are available in this respect very simple or more complex bias correction methods can significantly reduce streamflow errors serrat capdevila et al 2014 for example beck et al 2017b demonstrated that a spp based on merging different non gauge corrected satellite observations rescaled to match a gauge based climatic dataset i e a simple long term bias correction yields reasonable streamflow performance over tropical regions however given the non stationary nature of the bias of spps it is no guarantee that this correction is always effective in terms of improving streamflow predictions ciabatta et al 2016 bitew and gebremichael 2011 model recalibration has also been proved to be a viable strategy for improving spp forced hydrologic model performances across basins of different size and climatology in several regions of the world this can be attributed to the different nature of the spp signal with respect to the one captured by ground measurements most commonly tipping bucket rain gauges on one hand satellite sensors observe large scale instantaneous precipitation at different times and then average it over that time interval which may not fully represent the actual rainfall intermittency especially if the number of the satellite overpasses is very small on the other hand rain gauges measure accumulated rainfall at one single point in space which may not be representative of the rain spatial distribution therefore it is likely that model recalibration is able to adjust for these discrepancies through parameter tuning thus obtaining model performances comparable to the optimal parameter set according to a pre defined criterion equifinality concept beven and binley 1992 in other words different parameter settings can compensate for errors in the satellite rainfall forcing thereby improving streamflow model predictions with respect to the non recalibration option however this parameter compensation comes with a locally optimized model with parameter values that may be unrealistic and may therefore limit the model predictive capability at the sub basin scale be it during periods different from the one used for calibration or when different initial conditions are considered bitew and gebremichael 2011 yong et al 2012 xue et al 2013 nikolopoulos et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2016 the intrinsic quality of spps the basin size the spp resolution and the choice of hydrologic model have been shown to impact the error propagation from the precipitation forcing to the output however no consensus has been reached on the quantification of these effects in some cases the error is shown to increase with the catchment area e g falck et al 2015 but in others no change in the error magnitude was observed as a function of the basin size e g pan et al 2010 spp resolution has been shown to play a more important role than the error associated with spps and its impact on the streamflow simulations strongly depends on the catchment area nikolopoulos et al 2010 nevertheless different models show different performances for different spps suggesting the existence of interconnections between models and their precipitation forcing qi et al 2015 an alternative strategy for employing spps in flood simulations is to combine them with ancillary information like satellite soil moisture observations crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 román cascón et al 2017 merging soil moisture observations with rainfall retrievals can provide significant benefits as the soil moisture signature after a rain event can persist from a few hours to several days for instance chen et al 2014 and alvarez garreton et al 2015 showed that the integration of spps with satellite soil moisture information has the potential to improve streamflow prediction during high flow periods these results open new possibilities for using spps in hydrologic simulations and obtaining more reliable flood simulations we believe that future work should move away from comparing different spps and their performance in streamflow simulations and rather be directed to identify 1 the conditions climatological catchment area acceptable error in the output model formulation under which spps could be successfully used in hydrologic models 2 provide common metrics that are on one hand non redundant but on the other hand comprehensive to assess the performance of a hydrologic model in simulating flood peaks low flows and peak timing and 3 explore the possibility of merging not only different spps but also ancillary information e g soil moisture vegetation water content that can enhance the

7452,the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes this paper presents a coupled modelling framework for the predictions of flash flood response and of the occurrence of debris flows initiated by channel bed mobilization the framework combines a spatially distributed flash flood response model and a debris flow initiation model to define a threshold value for the peak flow which permits identification of channelized debris flow initiation the threshold is defined over the channel network as a function of the upslope area and of the local channel bed slope and it is based on assumptions concerning the properties of the channel bed material and of the morphology of the channel network the model is validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km2 vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 the results show that the proposed methodology has improved skill in identifying the catchments where debris flows are triggered compared to the use of simpler thresholds based on rainfall properties keywords flash floods debris flows channel bed mobilization flood risk alps 1 introduction flash floods are associated to rainfall events of convective origin i e high intensity and short duration and tend to occur in small basins few hundred square kilometres or less often characterized by complex orography relief is important since it may affect flash flood occurrence in specific catchments by combination of two main mechanisms orographic effects augmenting precipitation and anchoring convection and topographic relief promoting rapid concentration of the streamflow borga et al 2011 the occurrence of flash floods in rugged terrains represents an important geomorphic agent as these floods are often associated with widespread slope failures and debris flows triggering large erosion and sediment transport costa and o connor 1995 hicks et al 2005 marchi et al 2009a b the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes indeed the simultaneous occurrence of intense flooding landslides and debris flows may trigger cascading or progressive events helbing 2013 tao and barros 2014 trigila et al 2015 landslides triggered by the flood generating rainfall may block a river forming a dam which then bursts magnifying the already high flooding hazard landslides and debris flows may enhance the supply of large wood to streams with large impact on infrastructure rigon et al 2012 gurnell 2013 comiti et al 2016 ruiz villanueva et al 2017 the capability of debris flows to deliver sediment to the basin outlet may drastically alter the channel planform with flood hazard amplification in specific locations since the elements at risk are spatially highly dispersed the management of the coupled flash flood debris flow risks only by means of structural measures is difficult and often unsustainable in environmental and economic terms borga et al 2014b reviewed early warning systems for flash floods shallow rainfall induced landslides and debris flows most of the efforts in this area focus on evaluating the likelihood of triggering flash flood or debris flow in terms of alert levels by comparing quantitative precipitation forecasts against rainfall intensity duration thresholds and antecedent precipitation conditions which influences soil wetness guzzetti et al 2012 iadanza et al 2016 one of the main challenges in these early warning systems is the development of coupled models which may be consistently used for both flash flood and debris flows forecasting braud et al 2016 the need for coupling spatially explicit dynamic hydrologic models with debris flow susceptibility models has been articulated earlier simoni et al 2008 tao and barros 2014 most of the available literature is focused on the coupling of dynamically distributed hydrologic models with slope stability models for the prediction of shallow landslides which are triggered by increases in pore water pressure at a slip surface iverson 2000 baum et al 2010 arnone et al 2011 lepore et al 2013 he et al 2016 another common debris flow initiation mechanism is associated to channel bed erosion and mobilization by surface runoff coe et al 2008a kean et al 2013 a debris flow occurs when a critical surface discharge rather than a critical groundwater level is reached berti and simoni 2005 larsen et al 2006 godt and coe 2007 slope stability analyses used to assess slide prone areas are inappropriate for areas that are susceptible to debris flows generated through runoff and erosion in closely monitored sites calibrated rainfall runoff models have been successfully used to investigate the hydrological conditions for channelized debris flows by providing estimates of the rainfall needed to produce the critical level of discharge for debris flow initiation berti and simoni 2005 coe et al 2008a b gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 berti et al 2012 gregoretti et al 2016 however these investigations have been systematically carried out at the local scale of the debris flow catchment a methodology applicable at the regional that combines hydrologic and geomorphic information is still missing the main objective of this work is to present the development and test of a coupled flash flood debris flow model able to consistently predict flood responses and identify the tributaries associated with channelized debris flows the goal of coupling hydrologic and debris flows models is to improve predictions of the timing and location of debris flows and to categorise the typology of floods debris flows concurrence i e conditions where only flood only debris flows or both processes are expected a lack of direct field observations of both debris flow initiation sites and runoff peaks hampers the testing of coupled flash flood debris flow models debris flow observations are scarce because these events are locally infrequent and the terrain of the initiation zone difficult and dangerous to access kean et al 2013 gregoretti et al 2016 flash flood observations are rare because they occur at space time scales which are not well covered by current hydro meteorological networks borga et al 2010 moreover the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows increases the uncertainty of peak flows estimation by means of post event analyses since the large sediment volumes delivered from debris flow channels are likely to alter the stability of rivers cross sections amponsah et al 2016 segura beltrán et al 2016 the verification of the coupled model presented here builds upon a unique dataset collected and collated after the flash flood which impacted the vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 autonomous province südtirol bolzano 2012 the rainfall event triggered 33 debris flows causing two casualties and an estimated 18 million euros in economic damages borga et al 2014a this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the coupled modelling framework the study basin and data for model verification including rainfall estimates discharge and debris flow occurrence and channel width area relationship are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the reconstruction of the flash flood response to the august 4 5 2012 rainstorm in the vizze basin through a combined analysis of results from post flood surveys and hydrological modelling section 5 provides results concerning the application of the coupled flood debris flow model and comparisons with simpler rainfall based thresholds the main findings are summarized in section 6 2 the coupled flood response debris flows initiation model this study focuses on the coupled simulation of flood response and initiation of debris flows due to channel bed mobilization for this purpose a distributed hydrological model is coupled with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with a model for channelized debris flow initiation tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 the main methodological steps of our modelling framework involve i use of distributed flood response model for quantifying flood peaks along the channel network ii development of a model for the initiation of debris flows due to channel bed mobilization iii derivation of geomorphic relationships for the estimation of channel width required for debris flow modelling and iv coupling flood response and channel stability models to predict channelized debris flow initiation conditions the sections below illustrate the development of these steps 2 1 spatially distributed flood response model a distributed hydrologic model is used to compute the flood hydrograph at each channel grid in the modelling domain a mixed curve number green ampt method is used for rainfall excess modelling grimaldi et al 2013 the procedure consists in applying the scs cn approach ponce and hawkins 1996 to quantify the storm net rainfall total amount and using this value to estimate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the green ampt method the green ampt method is used to distribute in time the total volume of the event net rainfall provided by the scs cn method following ponce and hawkins 1996 the value of the s parameter in the scs cn method for a given soil is related to the curve number cn parameter through a calibration parameter called infiltration storativity the use of this parameter allows a spatial distribution of cn values in order to correctly simulate the observed flood water balance the model includes a linear conceptual reservoir for base flow modelling the reservoir input is provided by the infiltrated rate computed by the model a simple description of the drainage system response is used to represent runoff propagation da ros and borga 1997 giannoni et al 2003 the distributed runoff propagation procedure is based on the identification of drainage paths and requires the characterization of hillslope and channel paths we used a channelization support area as km2 which is considered constant at the sub basin scale to distinguish hillslope elements from channel elements two invariant hillslope and channel velocities are used to describe the runoff propagation through hillslopes and channel elements the model framework is based on six parameters the channelization support area the two kinematic parameters related to hillslope and channel flow velocity the parameter of infiltration storativity used in the scs cn procedure the parameter required for the specification of the initial abstraction and the base flow time constant 2 2 debris flow initiation model the initiation of runoff generated debris flows in natural channels is related to the instability of the coarse debris that fills the channel bottom gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the concentration of runoff in the channel bottom produces a water stream that causes erosion of the debris surface layer that extends to the layers below with whole or partial mobilization of the bed material the inclusion of bed material in the water stream generates the debris flow the triggering areas are located where the morphology of the channel allows both the deposit of debris and the concentration of runoff to produce a water stream a number of conceptual and physically based models for channel bed mobilization initiation processes have been developed based on results from sediment transport experiments in steep flumes tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 armanini et al 2005 in some of these experiments a critical discharge of water is observed to create a debris flow surge by eroding the sediment by hydrodynamic forces from the top down models for the incipient motion of particles on steep slopes provide a framework to predict debris flow thresholds from channel bed mobilization in real situations as shown by berti and simoni 2005 and by gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the incipient discharge model for predicting debris flow threshold developed by tognacca et al 2000 and gregoretti 2000 and based on the approach of schoktlitsch 1943 whittaker and jaeggi 1986 and bathurst et al 1987 relates the threshold unit width peak discharge qw t m2 s 1 required to mobilize channel bed materials and therefore trigger the debris flow in steep channel beds to the local channel bed slope θ and to the mean grain size dm m as follows 1 q w t β d m 1 5 tan θ b where β and b are empirical constants eq 1 shows that the smaller the debris material grain size or the higher the bed slope the lower the unit width discharge required to mobilize the channel deposits gregoretti 2000 examined critical hydrologic and geomorphic conditions for channel bed stability from experimental tests in laboratory flumes filled with a layer of three gravel sizes with approximately 12 20 slope angles the experimental results provided the parameters β 0 78 and b 1 27 for the critical incipient discharge equation for debris flow initiation attempts have been made berti and simoni 2005 gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 to extend predictions of debris flow thresholds to real situations generally assuming the availability of information on the grain size characteristics of the debris material of the initiation zone gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 however these characteristics are difficult to determine in practice due to the unsorted nature of the granular material usually involved grain size distribution often ranging often over four orders of magnitude which introduces uncertainty and subjectivity in the grain size distribution determination moreover the systematic assessment of particle size distribution at potential debris flow initiation sites is hardly possible especially if a number of channels has to be investigated thus the model tested in this study aims at specifying the threshold for debris flow initiation in a homogeneous physiographic region based on geomorphic parameters accordingly a threshold index ti for debris flow initiation is obtained from eq 1 as follows 2 ti const t tan θ b where the parameter const t is a function of the grain size characteristics and represents a parameter of the method the model described above analyses the control of water runoff and local channel geometry width slope on the initiation of debris flows caused by channel bed erosion the other fundamental factor that controls debris flow initiation i e the availability of erodible debris is not taken into account by the proposed model the assumption of unlimited sediment supply is often met in alpine basins like the vizze basin in the 2012 flood however even in basins with large presence of loose material in debris flow initiation areas transport limited systems according to bovis and jakob 1999 major fluctuations in debris availability are possible especially after extreme debris flows e g marchi et al 2009b in order to assess if the presence of erodible debris in the initiation areas represents a limiting factor for debris flow triggering and determining channel recharge rates traditional approaches based on field measurements jakob et al 2005 brayshaw and hassan 2009 can be integrated by methods aimed at assessing the variation of in channel stored sediment from high resolution digital terrain models mccoy et al 2010 blasone et al 2014 loye et al 2016 2 3 geomorphic relationships of local channel properties the incipient discharge model for predicting debris flow initiation threshold described in the previous sub section requires the quantification of the unit width flow peak discharge qw for this purpose a relationship permitting evaluation of bankfull channel width w along the channel network is required changes in cross section geometry e g cross section area width and depth have been shown to depend primarily on changes in water discharge leopold and maddock 1953 wohl and wilcox 2005 griffiths 2003 provided theoretical justification for using power law equations to describe the relationship between channel hydraulic geometry and stream discharge in the absence of discharge data the drainage area a can be used as a surrogate dunne and leopold 1978 pope et al 2001 vianello and d agostino 2007 and zink et al 2012 both focusing on small headwater basins reported power law relationships between bankfull channel width and upslope drainage area as follows 3 w γ a c where γ and c are the multiplier and the exponent in the power law relationship respectively in this work we adapted the channel width drainage area power law relationships to apply the debris flow initiation model 2 4 integration of flash flood response and debris flow initiation models the assessment of the likelihood of a debris flow occurrence is based on the comparison of the spatially variable threshold index with the distribution of the simulated unit width peak flows over the portion of river network susceptible to debris flow this is limited by a local slope of 0 1 gregoretti 2000 the assessment is carried out at the sub basin scale termed here elementary catchment with size limited to 4 km2 in this study an elementary catchment is qualified as prone to a debris flow when the simulated unit width peak discharge exceeds the threshold index ti for more than 5 of the river network the use of an area based comparison avoids cases of single low ti values due to isolated singularities in river morphology and reduces the impact of the spatial rainfall uncertainty in the coupled model predictions moreover in the verification of the method the assumptions on the spatial accuracy in the location of the observed debris flow is up to 50 m because of the small size of most debris flow channels in the headwaters of alpine catchments high resolution topography is recommended for the application of the debris flow initiation model in order to permit both the real time use of the framework for warning purposes and the use of the detailed topographic information required for the debris flow initiation model peak discharges along the river network are computed by area scaling the simulated peak discharges at the outlet of the elementary catchments 3 model verification the august 4 5 2012 flash flood event on august 4 5 2012 an extreme rainstorm caused severe flash flooding and widespread debris flows in the vizze basin located within the upper adige basin in the eastern italian alps fig 1 with an area of 140 km2 the basin is characterized by very steep channel and hillslope gradients with elevation ranging between 900 and 3500 m a s l fig 1 the area is characterised by an alpine continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of around 800 mm and a monthly precipitation maximum occurring in july the land use is dominated by forest with meadows and pastures in the valley floor mountain grassland is widespread above the timberline bare ground debris and rocks prevail in the highest elevation belt the geology of the valley astori and venturini 2011 consists of metamorphic rocks gneiss micaschist calcschist amphibolite quaternary formations consisting of scree glacial and fluvio glacial deposits and alluvial deposits alluvial fans and valley floor deposits are also widespread a small glacier is located in the headwater a hydropower reservoir fig 1 is located on the vizze river at novale with upstream area of 112 km2 the observations collated and analysed for the application and verification of the coupled model include radar and rain gauge rainfall estimates flood stages observed at two stream gauge stations analysis of the hydropower reservoir operations and post flood surveys of peak flows and of debris flows 3 1 rainfall estimation and analysis radar and rain gauge observations were used to derive distributed rainfall information for the storm event five minute rainfall data were collected by 14 rain gauges inside and close to the basin the mt macaion single polarization c band doppler radar located about 60 km from the basin at an altitude of 1860 m a s l provided rainfall estimates at spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 km2 and 5 min respectively the rather modest distance from the radar and the limited beam blockage that affects the first two radar beam elevations over the vizze basin permitted a successful correction of radar error sources marra et al 2014 radar data was corrected taking into account the effects of antenna pointing accuracy pellarin et al 2002 rico ramirez et al 2009 ground echoes beam blockage pellarin et al 2002 and signal attenuation due to heavy rain bouilloud et al 2009 rain rate estimates were obtained by using a reflectivity to rain rate relationship derived from measurement of convective events in the study region anagnostou et al 2010 and adjusting the residual mean field bias with respect to the rain gauge data berne and krajewski 2013 we refer to marra et al 2014 for a detailed description of algorithms and correction procedures the assessment of radar rainfall estimation accuracy has been performed by comparison with rain gauge data from 14 stations and it has been carried out on the event cumulated values in order to minimize the sampling errors between rain gauges and radar pixel gires et al 2014 peleg et al 2013 fig 2 shows a scatter plot of the event rainfall accumulation as observed by gauges and co located radar pixels comparison of radar rainfall estimates with rain gauges shows that the root mean square error is 44 of the average rain gauge measurement and that only 31 of the variance remains unexplained radar estimates are unbiased due to the gauge adjustment procedure the spatial distribution of the rainfall is described in fig 3 where the maximum hourly rainfall fig 3a the maximum 3 h rainfall fig 3b and the event rainfall accumulation fig 3c are reported the three maps are fairly similar showing that the area close to the basin outlet received both the maximum event rainfall accumulation 136 mm and the maximum hourly rain intensities 38 mm h the storm total precipitation decreases moving towards the upper part of the basin and from the left side to the right side of the valley the storm total rainfall distribution reflects a southwest northeast motion of the storm elements and a west east shift of the tracks of the storms the storm accumulation can be distinguished in three phases over a total duration of ten hours 16 00 cet to 02 00 cet in the initial period 16 00 18 00 cet the rainfall maxima 30 50 mm concentrated over the area close to the basin outlet in the second period 18 30 22 00 cet the entire left side of the basin was impacted by heavy rainfall ranging from 40 to 80 mm the third phase from 22 00 cet to 02 00 cet is characterised by low rainfall rates the return period for the largest rainfall depths considered over the basin for different duration increases from 30 years at one hour duration to 300 years for six hours duration and decreases again to 30 years for 24 h duration 3 2 discharge data and post flood survey of flood peaks stream gauge data and observations from post event surveys combined with hydraulic modelling were used to examine the flood response stream gauge data were available at the stations 3355 and 3365 fig 1 which are located upstream and downstream of the novale dam on the main river channel draining basins areas of 108 and 120 km2 respectively since data at the downstream station showed clearly the effects of reservoir operations and debris blockage at the dam spillways only the data from the upstream station were retained for model application and event analysis the flood response was investigated through a comprehensive post flood field campaign on 6 17 august 2012 the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 was used for the indirect estimation of flood peaks which requires the survey of high water marks corresponding to flood levels water surface slope and cross sectional geometry estimation of flow roughness and computation of the discharge by means of one dimensional manning strickler equation we focused the post flood field investigation along the channel upstream of the novale dam because the reservoir operation affected the rainfall runoff sequence along the downstream reach two cross sections termed s01 and s02 in fig 1 draining catchment areas of 72 and 45 km2 respectively were surveyed these sections were only marginally affected by sediment transport and did not undergo topographic changes during the event so that the surveyed post flood cross section geometry can be considered a very good approximation of the flood peak time cross section peak flow estimates amount to 70 m3 s 1 and 78 5 m3 s 1 for s02 and s01 respectively the uncertainty assessment carried out by using the first order method amponsah et al 2016 provided a value of 13 5 for the ratio standard deviation to mean value the corresponding uncertainty range values are reported in table 1 in both cases these values correspond to peak flow velocity ranging from 2 7 m s 1 to 3 7 m s 1 and froude numbers ranging from 0 66 to 0 9 3 3 debris flows occurrence and timing debris flow data were collected during repeated field surveys during the three weeks after the flood event autonomous province of bolzano alto adige bozen südtirol hereafter alto adige südtirol 2012 the surveys permitted the recognition of the initiation points of most of the debris flows with some uncertainty and these data were associated to elementary catchments fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the 65 elementary catchments identified in the vizze basin out of these 33 elementary catchments involved generation of debris flows the largest tributary basin on the east part of the headwaters is glaciated and was excluded from the analysis because glacier related processes including proglacial debris flows are not considered in this study the upstream drainage areas of these basins vary from as low as 0 01 up to 4 km2 with an average of 1 29 km2 the lower threshold of 0 01 km2 was used as a minimum area to define an elementary catchment for the study since it approximately corresponds to the transition from unchanneled valleys to channels a close inspection of the deposits of some of the largest catchments lead to classify the transport process of the august 4 5 2012 event as debris flood instead of debris flow such cases were assimilated to debris flows both because their small number does not permit defining a separate class for analysis and because they share with debris flows the high intensity of sediment transport even if with different rheological characteristics debris flow volume ranged from as high as 50 000 m3 for the large basins 14 and 16 to 100 m3 basin 1 with average and median values of 8748 and 3000 m3 respectively for the 33 basins that generated debris flow not surprisingly the distribution of debris flow catchments closely mimics rainfall distribution however inspection of fig 4 shows that some of the basins that were most impacted by the rainfall such as basin 13 and 20 were not affected by debris flows seven post flood interviews with local residents and analysis of information concerning the time of the alarms recorded by the local fire department provide valuable information about the debris flow timing according to the gathered information most of the debris flows were reported by residents between 21 10 and 21 35 cet which agrees with the information made available by the fire department the timings reported by the residents agrees with the last significant radar rainfall peak over the basin 3 4 channel width area relationship the availability of before flood high resolution orthophotos pixel size 0 5 m and lidar based dem pixel size 2 5 m allowed the estimation of bankfull channel width by combining photointerpretation with topographic analysis terrain parameters such as hill shade and minimum plan curvature as well as visual interpretation were used to identify appropriate points on the channel network where channel width estimates were derived specifically points were selected to ensure homogeneous sampling over the study area and where channel sections could be visually verified from orthophoto a total of 149 points fig 5 were selected and width estimates were derived by measuring the bankfull width of the corresponding cross sections top of the banks were identified using minimum curvature derived from dem we avoided bedrock channels where width is constrained by rocky banks as well as channel reaches congested by deposits of coarse sediment the analysis involved at least one section for each elementary catchment and extra sections along tributary streams for the largest basins 14 16 and 60 the estimated bankfull width ranges between 2 5 m and 19 4 m with a mean value of 5 8 m the minimum possible value of channel width estimates is limited by the resolution of the dem and thus could not be lower than 2 5 m however this value is consistent with field observations on the geometry of the smallest debris flow channels in the vizze elementary catchments for each cross section we computed the corresponding drainage area a that ranges between 0 01 and 15 km2 with a mean value of 1 3 km2 fig 5 shows the power law relationship between the estimated bankfull channel width and the drainage area the power law equation obtained using least squares regression is 4 w 6 45 a 0 22 and the coefficient of determination r2 is equal to 0 67 the multiplier of the relationship is higher than the multiplier of previous power law relationships reported for basins of similar size located in the italian dolomites vianello and d agostino 2007 sofia et al 2015 the difference in the multiplier estimate with respect to other catchments of the italian alps vianello and d agostino 2007 is explained by differences in the geomorphological processes and in the lithological settings between vizze and the catchments analysed in previous work actually even the smallest debris flow channels in vizze are significantly wider than the colluvial channels that drain similar areas in the study site of vianello and d agostino 2007 4 flash flood response the availability of runoff data from stream gauge adjusted radar rainfall estimates and post flood field surveys together with 30 m dem and the soil land cover complex of the vizze basin permitted the implementation and calibration of the distributed flood response model the capability of this model to reproduce flash flood peak flows has been proven in several other studies zanon et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 the model was calibrated using the discharge data recorded at the station 3355 fig 1 and verified comparing simulated and field estimated peak discharges at the two surveyed river cross sections because of debris flow spreading and deposition on the fans none of them blocked the vizze river the shape of the hydrograph recorded at 3355 does not show influence of debris flows from the tributaries it is reasonable to think that the moderate sediment transfer downstream of debris flow deposits did not alter significantly the peak discharge of the vizze river fig 6 presents the calibration result for station 3355 and reports a comparison between observed and simulated flood hydrographs the simulation adequately reproduces the peak discharge and the time of peak nash sutcliffe efficiency score was used to quantify the improvement of the simulations relative to the mean of the observations the nash sutcliffe value equal to 0 8 shows a relatively good correspondence between the two hydrographs the model has further been verified through cross validation by transposing the established model parameters to simulate the flood response at sections s01 and s02 where peak discharges have been indirectly estimated through post flood field surveys fig 7 shows the comparison between simulated flood hydrographs and estimated peak discharges for the two sections the simulated peak discharges reaches the lower uncertainty bound of the estimated flood peaks in both the sections highlighting a possible underestimation of the flood peaks however considering the challenges in predicting spatially limited high intensity precipitation borga et al 2010 and uncertainties with indirect estimation of peak flows associated with the occurrence of extreme floods marchi et al 2009a amponsah et al 2016 the overall correspondence between observed flood properties and model results supports the quality of the model predictions the peak flow occurred at 22 00 cet at the three sections this time is slightly delayed with respect to the timing of the debris flow reports if we take into account the propagation time from the tributaries where debris flows occurred to the downstream cross sections along the main stream we find a good agreement with debris flow triggering around the time of peak channel discharge the flood response properties at three cross sections the stream gauge section and the two post flood sections are reported in table 1 the unit peak discharges are rather low when compared to different flash floods in europe e g marchi et al 2010 but these values can be considered extreme in the context of the local climatology the runoff ratio is also low with respect to other floods norbiato et al 2009 this characteristic already illustrated and discussed by marchi et al 2010 and norbiato et al 2009 is related both to the short duration of flash floods and to the characteristics of the soil vegetation system in the area 5 debris flow initiation predictions this section provides results on the application of the coupled flood debris flow model comparing them with simpler rainfall related thresholds 5 1 implementation and verification of the debris flow initiation model the computation of the threshold index ti over the channel network requires evaluation of peak flows qp m3 s 1 channel width w m and local slope at all channel grids the debris flows initiation model has been implemented on a 5 m dem while the hydrological model has been applied by using a 30 m dem in order to compute the peak flow for each 5 m channel grid at the elementary catchment scale avoiding at the same time unnecessary computational burden we scaled the peak flow estimates at 30 m using power law relationships between drainage area and peak discharges qp at the catchment outlets as follows 5 q p δ a d where the δ and d parameters are obtained from power law regression the scaling structure of peak flows represented as a power law with drainage area has been presented and investigated by several past and recent studies gupta 2004 ayalew et al 2014 gupta et al 2015 in our case the accuracy of these relationships was checked independently for all the elementary catchments fig 8 shows the results for four different cases with high catchment 25 moderate catchment 14 and low catchments 52 and 61 rainfall depths see fig 4 as it is shown from the regressions the power law model fits the data very well all cases are characterized by an exponent d very close to 1 suggesting a linear dependence of peak flow on the contributing area the linear dependence is due to the fairly spatially uniform rainfall hitting the small size elementary catchments the variation of the multiplicative parameter δ reflects variations in size rainfall accumulation and land use across the various elementary catchments the local slopes θ for the channel grids were derived from a 5 m dem using the corresponding functions in topotoolbox schwanghart and kuhn 2010 eqs 4 and 5 provided the values of channel width and peak discharge that together with the local channel slope map enabled the computation of the index ti eq 2 along channel networks within each elementary catchment and the comparison between unit width event peak flow and the ti the results obtained by the coupled model for a range of values of the parameter const t the only parameter used for field calibration were compared with reports of debris flow occurrences contingency statistics namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were derived from each value of the parameter and the optimal value of const t was selected maximizing the csi the results obtained from this procedure are reported in fig 9 pod far and csi are defined as 6 pod tp tp fn 7 far fp tp fp 8 csi tp tp fp fn where true positives tp denote the number of actual debris flow occurrences that were correctly predicted i e hits false positives fp denote the number of falsely predicted debris flow occurrences identifying the number of the false alarms false negatives fn denote the number of debris flow occurrences that were not predicted identifying the number of the misses pod far and csi index range between 0 and 1 with a perfect forecast corresponding to values of 0 for far and 1 for pod and csi the coupled model reproduces the distribution of the elementary catchments which originated debris flows fairly well however the model predicts debris flows in the eastern portion of the vizze basin even though such events were not observed in those areas in order to check the improved information provided by the model these results were compared to the well known rainfall thresholds based on the event rainfall accumulation or rain intensities guzzetti et al 2008 we considered the event rainfall accumulation and the maximum 1 h rain intensity both averaged over the elementary catchments as debris flow predictors following the procedures described above for the threshold index we selected the thresholds optimizing the csi the corresponding results are reported in fig 10 for event rainfall accumulation the map for 1 h rainfall intensities is not reported because it is very similar to the event rainfall map which is not surprising considering the rainfall properties reported in fig 3 table 2 summarizes the thresholds identified for the three triggering predictors and the corresponding contingency statistics results show that the three predictors have considerable skill in predicting debris flow occurrence this is not surprising since they were all optimised based on the event information however the coupled model ranks highest allowing to correctly identify more debris flows and to reduce the false alarms by 10 this suggests that combining hydrologic response variables with geomorphologic metrics of local channel properties provides a better delineation of the debris no debris flow catchments the value of threshold parameter constt obtained through csi optimisation corresponds to a dm value of 0 11 m which is consistent with representative parameter ranges for the bed material of the debris flow initiation areas these generally range between 0 07 m and 0 2 m according to field observations and post event reports on the other hand the value of 40 mm found for the event cumulated rainfall exceeds by far the values provided for the event by the regional relationship identified by nikolopoulos et al 2015 for the upper adige river basin and based on availability of radar data this relationship amounts to rtot 11 05 d 0 34 where rtot is the threshold event cumulated rainfall in mm and d is the rainfall duration in hours with a value of ten hours for the event duration the value of rtot is equal to 24 2 mm which is well below the value found through csi optimisation 5 2 cross validation in this section a cross validation is carried out to independently evaluate the performance of the ti based threshold predictions and a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the potential impact of the estimated w a relationship on the performance of the proposed framework the ti data of the 64 elementary catchments were randomly split into two samples 32 basins in each sample the first sample was used for the calibration of ti values according to the procedure described in previous section the calibrated ti value was used for the debris flow prediction of the second sample and the performance was evaluated according to csi value this procedure was repeated 1000 times and the distribution of csi values for both calibration and validation are reported as boxplots in fig 11 the median csi values for calibration and validation samples are 0 79 and 0 82 and the coefficient of variation are 0 08 and 0 10 respectively showing that while some variability exists the performance is quite stable and at acceptable level 88 of the values 0 7 in validation dataset 5 3 sensitivity to the channel width area relationship parameters an important source of uncertainty in the proposed framework is represented by the estimation of the channel width upstream area w a relationship for the entire stream network previous works showed that the w a parameters may vary between different regions or even between catchments of the same region and are strongly influenced by geolithological conditions vianello and d agostino 2007 modrick and georgakakos 2014 sofia et al 2015 furthermore within a given catchment deviation of the actual channel width values from those obtained by the estimated w a relationship may depend on estimation uncertainty as well as natural variability quantification of the uncertainty associated to these sources is beyond the scope of this work it is however important to analyse the sensitivity of the performance of the ti threshold method to the w a parameters we carried out a scenario based analysis in which different sets of γ and c parameters for the w a relationship eq 3 were used to estimate the ti and evaluate its performance a wide range of parameters realistic relative to the topographic features of our study basin was selected considering the relative variability in w a parameters reported for three basins with similar climatic and topographic characteristics vianello and d agostino 2007 sofia et al 2015 the parameter variation variability was achieved by deriving upper lower curves on the reported w a relationships overall we found an average variation of the order of 20 and 50 for multiplier and exponent parameter respectively that we applied to our estimated w a relationship to define a range of parameter γ from 5 16 to 7 74 and parameter c from 0 11 to 0 33 according to these ranges four scenarios were created combining the upper lower values and they were used for the sensitivity analysis first the ti thresholds and corresponding csi values were estimated table 3 it is interesting to note that while there is variability in the ti threshold values the performance of the method as a predictor is stable while the lack of sensitivity to the variations in the multiplicative parameter is due to features of the parameter optimisation procedure variation in the exponent values are also insensitive due to limited extension of drainage areas which are of concerns in the procedure the segment of the river network which are considered in the method are those characterised by a slope larger than 0 1 in a second step of the sensitivity analysis we examined the predictive power of the coupled model conditional to a different true w a relationship in other words how good is the ti derived from scenario x of parameters γ and c to predict the scenario y table 4 reports csi values for the different combinations of true scenario x and used scenario y ti thresholds obviously when x equals y the csi value is the same as that reported in table 3 as it is shown when scenario 3 is true and scenario 2 is used to estimate ti threshold the performance can be degraded significantly with csi dropping from 0 79 best case to 0 63 worst case given the difference in ti values reported in table 3 it is clear that in this case the estimated threshold is much lower than the true threshold thus a large number of false positives occurring degrades the overall prediction performance this sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of the accuracy of w a relationship on the performance of the ti based prediction framework therefore appropriate application of the proposed framework requires knowledge of a region specific w a relationship this can be either obtained from field surveys or estimated following the procedure described in section 3 4 automated algorithms able to estimate channel width at any point in the network e g sofia et al 2015 can also be considered for improving prediction 6 conclusions a coupled flash flood debris flow model for the prediction of flood responses and the identification of channels associated with debris flows was presented a spatially explicit dynamic hydrologic model was coupled with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with channelized debris flows initiation model the coupled model was validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km2 vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 for which discharge data flash flood peaks from post flood survey together with high resolution quality controlled weather radar rainfall estimates were available the main findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed model is able to predict the spatially variable flood responses associated with the examined extreme rainstorm and permits the assessment of the spatial distribution of flood peaks along the channel networks where debris flows were triggered 2 coupling the distributed flood response model with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with a debris flow initiation model provides a framework in which the likelihood of a debris flow occurrence is estimated comparing a spatially variable threshold index with the unit width peak flows over the whole river network susceptible to debris flow 3 the coupled model showed higher predictive power with respect to more commonly used rainfall based models with a critical success index equal to 0 79 and lower false alarm ratios 20 4 considerable sensitivity to the assumptions concerning bankfull channel width drainage area is found suggesting a need for region specific channel width drainage area relations the performance of the proposed coupled flash flood debris flow model framework are encouraging and support the combined use of hydrologic and geomorphologic information in forecasting procedures for both flash floods and channelized debris flows it is nevertheless important to note that the uncertainties associated to different elements of the framework e g hydrologic model performance channel width estimation etc need to be carefully considered in relevant applications further improvements in the accuracy of the method can be achieved by increasing the accuracy of corresponding elements e g improved hydrologic models automated channel width estimation from lidar etc further applications of the model are indeed needed before generalizing the results at a regional scale acknowledgements the authors wish to thank stefano crema for his

7452,the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes this paper presents a coupled modelling framework for the predictions of flash flood response and of the occurrence of debris flows initiated by channel bed mobilization the framework combines a spatially distributed flash flood response model and a debris flow initiation model to define a threshold value for the peak flow which permits identification of channelized debris flow initiation the threshold is defined over the channel network as a function of the upslope area and of the local channel bed slope and it is based on assumptions concerning the properties of the channel bed material and of the morphology of the channel network the model is validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km2 vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 the results show that the proposed methodology has improved skill in identifying the catchments where debris flows are triggered compared to the use of simpler thresholds based on rainfall properties keywords flash floods debris flows channel bed mobilization flood risk alps 1 introduction flash floods are associated to rainfall events of convective origin i e high intensity and short duration and tend to occur in small basins few hundred square kilometres or less often characterized by complex orography relief is important since it may affect flash flood occurrence in specific catchments by combination of two main mechanisms orographic effects augmenting precipitation and anchoring convection and topographic relief promoting rapid concentration of the streamflow borga et al 2011 the occurrence of flash floods in rugged terrains represents an important geomorphic agent as these floods are often associated with widespread slope failures and debris flows triggering large erosion and sediment transport costa and o connor 1995 hicks et al 2005 marchi et al 2009a b the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes indeed the simultaneous occurrence of intense flooding landslides and debris flows may trigger cascading or progressive events helbing 2013 tao and barros 2014 trigila et al 2015 landslides triggered by the flood generating rainfall may block a river forming a dam which then bursts magnifying the already high flooding hazard landslides and debris flows may enhance the supply of large wood to streams with large impact on infrastructure rigon et al 2012 gurnell 2013 comiti et al 2016 ruiz villanueva et al 2017 the capability of debris flows to deliver sediment to the basin outlet may drastically alter the channel planform with flood hazard amplification in specific locations since the elements at risk are spatially highly dispersed the management of the coupled flash flood debris flow risks only by means of structural measures is difficult and often unsustainable in environmental and economic terms borga et al 2014b reviewed early warning systems for flash floods shallow rainfall induced landslides and debris flows most of the efforts in this area focus on evaluating the likelihood of triggering flash flood or debris flow in terms of alert levels by comparing quantitative precipitation forecasts against rainfall intensity duration thresholds and antecedent precipitation conditions which influences soil wetness guzzetti et al 2012 iadanza et al 2016 one of the main challenges in these early warning systems is the development of coupled models which may be consistently used for both flash flood and debris flows forecasting braud et al 2016 the need for coupling spatially explicit dynamic hydrologic models with debris flow susceptibility models has been articulated earlier simoni et al 2008 tao and barros 2014 most of the available literature is focused on the coupling of dynamically distributed hydrologic models with slope stability models for the prediction of shallow landslides which are triggered by increases in pore water pressure at a slip surface iverson 2000 baum et al 2010 arnone et al 2011 lepore et al 2013 he et al 2016 another common debris flow initiation mechanism is associated to channel bed erosion and mobilization by surface runoff coe et al 2008a kean et al 2013 a debris flow occurs when a critical surface discharge rather than a critical groundwater level is reached berti and simoni 2005 larsen et al 2006 godt and coe 2007 slope stability analyses used to assess slide prone areas are inappropriate for areas that are susceptible to debris flows generated through runoff and erosion in closely monitored sites calibrated rainfall runoff models have been successfully used to investigate the hydrological conditions for channelized debris flows by providing estimates of the rainfall needed to produce the critical level of discharge for debris flow initiation berti and simoni 2005 coe et al 2008a b gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 berti et al 2012 gregoretti et al 2016 however these investigations have been systematically carried out at the local scale of the debris flow catchment a methodology applicable at the regional that combines hydrologic and geomorphic information is still missing the main objective of this work is to present the development and test of a coupled flash flood debris flow model able to consistently predict flood responses and identify the tributaries associated with channelized debris flows the goal of coupling hydrologic and debris flows models is to improve predictions of the timing and location of debris flows and to categorise the typology of floods debris flows concurrence i e conditions where only flood only debris flows or both processes are expected a lack of direct field observations of both debris flow initiation sites and runoff peaks hampers the testing of coupled flash flood debris flow models debris flow observations are scarce because these events are locally infrequent and the terrain of the initiation zone difficult and dangerous to access kean et al 2013 gregoretti et al 2016 flash flood observations are rare because they occur at space time scales which are not well covered by current hydro meteorological networks borga et al 2010 moreover the concurrence of flash floods and debris flows increases the uncertainty of peak flows estimation by means of post event analyses since the large sediment volumes delivered from debris flow channels are likely to alter the stability of rivers cross sections amponsah et al 2016 segura beltrán et al 2016 the verification of the coupled model presented here builds upon a unique dataset collected and collated after the flash flood which impacted the vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 autonomous province südtirol bolzano 2012 the rainfall event triggered 33 debris flows causing two casualties and an estimated 18 million euros in economic damages borga et al 2014a this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the coupled modelling framework the study basin and data for model verification including rainfall estimates discharge and debris flow occurrence and channel width area relationship are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the reconstruction of the flash flood response to the august 4 5 2012 rainstorm in the vizze basin through a combined analysis of results from post flood surveys and hydrological modelling section 5 provides results concerning the application of the coupled flood debris flow model and comparisons with simpler rainfall based thresholds the main findings are summarized in section 6 2 the coupled flood response debris flows initiation model this study focuses on the coupled simulation of flood response and initiation of debris flows due to channel bed mobilization for this purpose a distributed hydrological model is coupled with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with a model for channelized debris flow initiation tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 the main methodological steps of our modelling framework involve i use of distributed flood response model for quantifying flood peaks along the channel network ii development of a model for the initiation of debris flows due to channel bed mobilization iii derivation of geomorphic relationships for the estimation of channel width required for debris flow modelling and iv coupling flood response and channel stability models to predict channelized debris flow initiation conditions the sections below illustrate the development of these steps 2 1 spatially distributed flood response model a distributed hydrologic model is used to compute the flood hydrograph at each channel grid in the modelling domain a mixed curve number green ampt method is used for rainfall excess modelling grimaldi et al 2013 the procedure consists in applying the scs cn approach ponce and hawkins 1996 to quantify the storm net rainfall total amount and using this value to estimate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the green ampt method the green ampt method is used to distribute in time the total volume of the event net rainfall provided by the scs cn method following ponce and hawkins 1996 the value of the s parameter in the scs cn method for a given soil is related to the curve number cn parameter through a calibration parameter called infiltration storativity the use of this parameter allows a spatial distribution of cn values in order to correctly simulate the observed flood water balance the model includes a linear conceptual reservoir for base flow modelling the reservoir input is provided by the infiltrated rate computed by the model a simple description of the drainage system response is used to represent runoff propagation da ros and borga 1997 giannoni et al 2003 the distributed runoff propagation procedure is based on the identification of drainage paths and requires the characterization of hillslope and channel paths we used a channelization support area as km2 which is considered constant at the sub basin scale to distinguish hillslope elements from channel elements two invariant hillslope and channel velocities are used to describe the runoff propagation through hillslopes and channel elements the model framework is based on six parameters the channelization support area the two kinematic parameters related to hillslope and channel flow velocity the parameter of infiltration storativity used in the scs cn procedure the parameter required for the specification of the initial abstraction and the base flow time constant 2 2 debris flow initiation model the initiation of runoff generated debris flows in natural channels is related to the instability of the coarse debris that fills the channel bottom gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the concentration of runoff in the channel bottom produces a water stream that causes erosion of the debris surface layer that extends to the layers below with whole or partial mobilization of the bed material the inclusion of bed material in the water stream generates the debris flow the triggering areas are located where the morphology of the channel allows both the deposit of debris and the concentration of runoff to produce a water stream a number of conceptual and physically based models for channel bed mobilization initiation processes have been developed based on results from sediment transport experiments in steep flumes tognacca et al 2000 gregoretti 2000 armanini et al 2005 in some of these experiments a critical discharge of water is observed to create a debris flow surge by eroding the sediment by hydrodynamic forces from the top down models for the incipient motion of particles on steep slopes provide a framework to predict debris flow thresholds from channel bed mobilization in real situations as shown by berti and simoni 2005 and by gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the incipient discharge model for predicting debris flow threshold developed by tognacca et al 2000 and gregoretti 2000 and based on the approach of schoktlitsch 1943 whittaker and jaeggi 1986 and bathurst et al 1987 relates the threshold unit width peak discharge qw t m2 s 1 required to mobilize channel bed materials and therefore trigger the debris flow in steep channel beds to the local channel bed slope θ and to the mean grain size dm m as follows 1 q w t β d m 1 5 tan θ b where β and b are empirical constants eq 1 shows that the smaller the debris material grain size or the higher the bed slope the lower the unit width discharge required to mobilize the channel deposits gregoretti 2000 examined critical hydrologic and geomorphic conditions for channel bed stability from experimental tests in laboratory flumes filled with a layer of three gravel sizes with approximately 12 20 slope angles the experimental results provided the parameters β 0 78 and b 1 27 for the critical incipient discharge equation for debris flow initiation attempts have been made berti and simoni 2005 gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 to extend predictions of debris flow thresholds to real situations generally assuming the availability of information on the grain size characteristics of the debris material of the initiation zone gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 however these characteristics are difficult to determine in practice due to the unsorted nature of the granular material usually involved grain size distribution often ranging often over four orders of magnitude which introduces uncertainty and subjectivity in the grain size distribution determination moreover the systematic assessment of particle size distribution at potential debris flow initiation sites is hardly possible especially if a number of channels has to be investigated thus the model tested in this study aims at specifying the threshold for debris flow initiation in a homogeneous physiographic region based on geomorphic parameters accordingly a threshold index ti for debris flow initiation is obtained from eq 1 as follows 2 ti const t tan θ b where the parameter const t is a function of the grain size characteristics and represents a parameter of the method the model described above analyses the control of water runoff and local channel geometry width slope on the initiation of debris flows caused by channel bed erosion the other fundamental factor that controls debris flow initiation i e the availability of erodible debris is not taken into account by the proposed model the assumption of unlimited sediment supply is often met in alpine basins like the vizze basin in the 2012 flood however even in basins with large presence of loose material in debris flow initiation areas transport limited systems according to bovis and jakob 1999 major fluctuations in debris availability are possible especially after extreme debris flows e g marchi et al 2009b in order to assess if the presence of erodible debris in the initiation areas represents a limiting factor for debris flow triggering and determining channel recharge rates traditional approaches based on field measurements jakob et al 2005 brayshaw and hassan 2009 can be integrated by methods aimed at assessing the variation of in channel stored sediment from high resolution digital terrain models mccoy et al 2010 blasone et al 2014 loye et al 2016 2 3 geomorphic relationships of local channel properties the incipient discharge model for predicting debris flow initiation threshold described in the previous sub section requires the quantification of the unit width flow peak discharge qw for this purpose a relationship permitting evaluation of bankfull channel width w along the channel network is required changes in cross section geometry e g cross section area width and depth have been shown to depend primarily on changes in water discharge leopold and maddock 1953 wohl and wilcox 2005 griffiths 2003 provided theoretical justification for using power law equations to describe the relationship between channel hydraulic geometry and stream discharge in the absence of discharge data the drainage area a can be used as a surrogate dunne and leopold 1978 pope et al 2001 vianello and d agostino 2007 and zink et al 2012 both focusing on small headwater basins reported power law relationships between bankfull channel width and upslope drainage area as follows 3 w γ a c where γ and c are the multiplier and the exponent in the power law relationship respectively in this work we adapted the channel width drainage area power law relationships to apply the debris flow initiation model 2 4 integration of flash flood response and debris flow initiation models the assessment of the likelihood of a debris flow occurrence is based on the comparison of the spatially variable threshold index with the distribution of the simulated unit width peak flows over the portion of river network susceptible to debris flow this is limited by a local slope of 0 1 gregoretti 2000 the assessment is carried out at the sub basin scale termed here elementary catchment with size limited to 4 km2 in this study an elementary catchment is qualified as prone to a debris flow when the simulated unit width peak discharge exceeds the threshold index ti for more than 5 of the river network the use of an area based comparison avoids cases of single low ti values due to isolated singularities in river morphology and reduces the impact of the spatial rainfall uncertainty in the coupled model predictions moreover in the verification of the method the assumptions on the spatial accuracy in the location of the observed debris flow is up to 50 m because of the small size of most debris flow channels in the headwaters of alpine catchments high resolution topography is recommended for the application of the debris flow initiation model in order to permit both the real time use of the framework for warning purposes and the use of the detailed topographic information required for the debris flow initiation model peak discharges along the river network are computed by area scaling the simulated peak discharges at the outlet of the elementary catchments 3 model verification the august 4 5 2012 flash flood event on august 4 5 2012 an extreme rainstorm caused severe flash flooding and widespread debris flows in the vizze basin located within the upper adige basin in the eastern italian alps fig 1 with an area of 140 km2 the basin is characterized by very steep channel and hillslope gradients with elevation ranging between 900 and 3500 m a s l fig 1 the area is characterised by an alpine continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of around 800 mm and a monthly precipitation maximum occurring in july the land use is dominated by forest with meadows and pastures in the valley floor mountain grassland is widespread above the timberline bare ground debris and rocks prevail in the highest elevation belt the geology of the valley astori and venturini 2011 consists of metamorphic rocks gneiss micaschist calcschist amphibolite quaternary formations consisting of scree glacial and fluvio glacial deposits and alluvial deposits alluvial fans and valley floor deposits are also widespread a small glacier is located in the headwater a hydropower reservoir fig 1 is located on the vizze river at novale with upstream area of 112 km2 the observations collated and analysed for the application and verification of the coupled model include radar and rain gauge rainfall estimates flood stages observed at two stream gauge stations analysis of the hydropower reservoir operations and post flood surveys of peak flows and of debris flows 3 1 rainfall estimation and analysis radar and rain gauge observations were used to derive distributed rainfall information for the storm event five minute rainfall data were collected by 14 rain gauges inside and close to the basin the mt macaion single polarization c band doppler radar located about 60 km from the basin at an altitude of 1860 m a s l provided rainfall estimates at spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 km2 and 5 min respectively the rather modest distance from the radar and the limited beam blockage that affects the first two radar beam elevations over the vizze basin permitted a successful correction of radar error sources marra et al 2014 radar data was corrected taking into account the effects of antenna pointing accuracy pellarin et al 2002 rico ramirez et al 2009 ground echoes beam blockage pellarin et al 2002 and signal attenuation due to heavy rain bouilloud et al 2009 rain rate estimates were obtained by using a reflectivity to rain rate relationship derived from measurement of convective events in the study region anagnostou et al 2010 and adjusting the residual mean field bias with respect to the rain gauge data berne and krajewski 2013 we refer to marra et al 2014 for a detailed description of algorithms and correction procedures the assessment of radar rainfall estimation accuracy has been performed by comparison with rain gauge data from 14 stations and it has been carried out on the event cumulated values in order to minimize the sampling errors between rain gauges and radar pixel gires et al 2014 peleg et al 2013 fig 2 shows a scatter plot of the event rainfall accumulation as observed by gauges and co located radar pixels comparison of radar rainfall estimates with rain gauges shows that the root mean square error is 44 of the average rain gauge measurement and that only 31 of the variance remains unexplained radar estimates are unbiased due to the gauge adjustment procedure the spatial distribution of the rainfall is described in fig 3 where the maximum hourly rainfall fig 3a the maximum 3 h rainfall fig 3b and the event rainfall accumulation fig 3c are reported the three maps are fairly similar showing that the area close to the basin outlet received both the maximum event rainfall accumulation 136 mm and the maximum hourly rain intensities 38 mm h the storm total precipitation decreases moving towards the upper part of the basin and from the left side to the right side of the valley the storm total rainfall distribution reflects a southwest northeast motion of the storm elements and a west east shift of the tracks of the storms the storm accumulation can be distinguished in three phases over a total duration of ten hours 16 00 cet to 02 00 cet in the initial period 16 00 18 00 cet the rainfall maxima 30 50 mm concentrated over the area close to the basin outlet in the second period 18 30 22 00 cet the entire left side of the basin was impacted by heavy rainfall ranging from 40 to 80 mm the third phase from 22 00 cet to 02 00 cet is characterised by low rainfall rates the return period for the largest rainfall depths considered over the basin for different duration increases from 30 years at one hour duration to 300 years for six hours duration and decreases again to 30 years for 24 h duration 3 2 discharge data and post flood survey of flood peaks stream gauge data and observations from post event surveys combined with hydraulic modelling were used to examine the flood response stream gauge data were available at the stations 3355 and 3365 fig 1 which are located upstream and downstream of the novale dam on the main river channel draining basins areas of 108 and 120 km2 respectively since data at the downstream station showed clearly the effects of reservoir operations and debris blockage at the dam spillways only the data from the upstream station were retained for model application and event analysis the flood response was investigated through a comprehensive post flood field campaign on 6 17 august 2012 the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 was used for the indirect estimation of flood peaks which requires the survey of high water marks corresponding to flood levels water surface slope and cross sectional geometry estimation of flow roughness and computation of the discharge by means of one dimensional manning strickler equation we focused the post flood field investigation along the channel upstream of the novale dam because the reservoir operation affected the rainfall runoff sequence along the downstream reach two cross sections termed s01 and s02 in fig 1 draining catchment areas of 72 and 45 km2 respectively were surveyed these sections were only marginally affected by sediment transport and did not undergo topographic changes during the event so that the surveyed post flood cross section geometry can be considered a very good approximation of the flood peak time cross section peak flow estimates amount to 70 m3 s 1 and 78 5 m3 s 1 for s02 and s01 respectively the uncertainty assessment carried out by using the first order method amponsah et al 2016 provided a value of 13 5 for the ratio standard deviation to mean value the corresponding uncertainty range values are reported in table 1 in both cases these values correspond to peak flow velocity ranging from 2 7 m s 1 to 3 7 m s 1 and froude numbers ranging from 0 66 to 0 9 3 3 debris flows occurrence and timing debris flow data were collected during repeated field surveys during the three weeks after the flood event autonomous province of bolzano alto adige bozen südtirol hereafter alto adige südtirol 2012 the surveys permitted the recognition of the initiation points of most of the debris flows with some uncertainty and these data were associated to elementary catchments fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the 65 elementary catchments identified in the vizze basin out of these 33 elementary catchments involved generation of debris flows the largest tributary basin on the east part of the headwaters is glaciated and was excluded from the analysis because glacier related processes including proglacial debris flows are not considered in this study the upstream drainage areas of these basins vary from as low as 0 01 up to 4 km2 with an average of 1 29 km2 the lower threshold of 0 01 km2 was used as a minimum area to define an elementary catchment for the study since it approximately corresponds to the transition from unchanneled valleys to channels a close inspection of the deposits of some of the largest catchments lead to classify the transport process of the august 4 5 2012 event as debris flood instead of debris flow such cases were assimilated to debris flows both because their small number does not permit defining a separate class for analysis and because they share with debris flows the high intensity of sediment transport even if with different rheological characteristics debris flow volume ranged from as high as 50 000 m3 for the large basins 14 and 16 to 100 m3 basin 1 with average and median values of 8748 and 3000 m3 respectively for the 33 basins that generated debris flow not surprisingly the distribution of debris flow catchments closely mimics rainfall distribution however inspection of fig 4 shows that some of the basins that were most impacted by the rainfall such as basin 13 and 20 were not affected by debris flows seven post flood interviews with local residents and analysis of information concerning the time of the alarms recorded by the local fire department provide valuable information about the debris flow timing according to the gathered information most of the debris flows were reported by residents between 21 10 and 21 35 cet which agrees with the information made available by the fire department the timings reported by the residents agrees with the last significant radar rainfall peak over the basin 3 4 channel width area relationship the availability of before flood high resolution orthophotos pixel size 0 5 m and lidar based dem pixel size 2 5 m allowed the estimation of bankfull channel width by combining photointerpretation with topographic analysis terrain parameters such as hill shade and minimum plan curvature as well as visual interpretation were used to identify appropriate points on the channel network where channel width estimates were derived specifically points were selected to ensure homogeneous sampling over the study area and where channel sections could be visually verified from orthophoto a total of 149 points fig 5 were selected and width estimates were derived by measuring the bankfull width of the corresponding cross sections top of the banks were identified using minimum curvature derived from dem we avoided bedrock channels where width is constrained by rocky banks as well as channel reaches congested by deposits of coarse sediment the analysis involved at least one section for each elementary catchment and extra sections along tributary streams for the largest basins 14 16 and 60 the estimated bankfull width ranges between 2 5 m and 19 4 m with a mean value of 5 8 m the minimum possible value of channel width estimates is limited by the resolution of the dem and thus could not be lower than 2 5 m however this value is consistent with field observations on the geometry of the smallest debris flow channels in the vizze elementary catchments for each cross section we computed the corresponding drainage area a that ranges between 0 01 and 15 km2 with a mean value of 1 3 km2 fig 5 shows the power law relationship between the estimated bankfull channel width and the drainage area the power law equation obtained using least squares regression is 4 w 6 45 a 0 22 and the coefficient of determination r2 is equal to 0 67 the multiplier of the relationship is higher than the multiplier of previous power law relationships reported for basins of similar size located in the italian dolomites vianello and d agostino 2007 sofia et al 2015 the difference in the multiplier estimate with respect to other catchments of the italian alps vianello and d agostino 2007 is explained by differences in the geomorphological processes and in the lithological settings between vizze and the catchments analysed in previous work actually even the smallest debris flow channels in vizze are significantly wider than the colluvial channels that drain similar areas in the study site of vianello and d agostino 2007 4 flash flood response the availability of runoff data from stream gauge adjusted radar rainfall estimates and post flood field surveys together with 30 m dem and the soil land cover complex of the vizze basin permitted the implementation and calibration of the distributed flood response model the capability of this model to reproduce flash flood peak flows has been proven in several other studies zanon et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 the model was calibrated using the discharge data recorded at the station 3355 fig 1 and verified comparing simulated and field estimated peak discharges at the two surveyed river cross sections because of debris flow spreading and deposition on the fans none of them blocked the vizze river the shape of the hydrograph recorded at 3355 does not show influence of debris flows from the tributaries it is reasonable to think that the moderate sediment transfer downstream of debris flow deposits did not alter significantly the peak discharge of the vizze river fig 6 presents the calibration result for station 3355 and reports a comparison between observed and simulated flood hydrographs the simulation adequately reproduces the peak discharge and the time of peak nash sutcliffe efficiency score was used to quantify the improvement of the simulations relative to the mean of the observations the nash sutcliffe value equal to 0 8 shows a relatively good correspondence between the two hydrographs the model has further been verified through cross validation by transposing the established model parameters to simulate the flood response at sections s01 and s02 where peak discharges have been indirectly estimated through post flood field surveys fig 7 shows the comparison between simulated flood hydrographs and estimated peak discharges for the two sections the simulated peak discharges reaches the lower uncertainty bound of the estimated flood peaks in both the sections highlighting a possible underestimation of the flood peaks however considering the challenges in predicting spatially limited high intensity precipitation borga et al 2010 and uncertainties with indirect estimation of peak flows associated with the occurrence of extreme floods marchi et al 2009a amponsah et al 2016 the overall correspondence between observed flood properties and model results supports the quality of the model predictions the peak flow occurred at 22 00 cet at the three sections this time is slightly delayed with respect to the timing of the debris flow reports if we take into account the propagation time from the tributaries where debris flows occurred to the downstream cross sections along the main stream we find a good agreement with debris flow triggering around the time of peak channel discharge the flood response properties at three cross sections the stream gauge section and the two post flood sections are reported in table 1 the unit peak discharges are rather low when compared to different flash floods in europe e g marchi et al 2010 but these values can be considered extreme in the context of the local climatology the runoff ratio is also low with respect to other floods norbiato et al 2009 this characteristic already illustrated and discussed by marchi et al 2010 and norbiato et al 2009 is related both to the short duration of flash floods and to the characteristics of the soil vegetation system in the area 5 debris flow initiation predictions this section provides results on the application of the coupled flood debris flow model comparing them with simpler rainfall related thresholds 5 1 implementation and verification of the debris flow initiation model the computation of the threshold index ti over the channel network requires evaluation of peak flows qp m3 s 1 channel width w m and local slope at all channel grids the debris flows initiation model has been implemented on a 5 m dem while the hydrological model has been applied by using a 30 m dem in order to compute the peak flow for each 5 m channel grid at the elementary catchment scale avoiding at the same time unnecessary computational burden we scaled the peak flow estimates at 30 m using power law relationships between drainage area and peak discharges qp at the catchment outlets as follows 5 q p δ a d where the δ and d parameters are obtained from power law regression the scaling structure of peak flows represented as a power law with drainage area has been presented and investigated by several past and recent studies gupta 2004 ayalew et al 2014 gupta et al 2015 in our case the accuracy of these relationships was checked independently for all the elementary catchments fig 8 shows the results for four different cases with high catchment 25 moderate catchment 14 and low catchments 52 and 61 rainfall depths see fig 4 as it is shown from the regressions the power law model fits the data very well all cases are characterized by an exponent d very close to 1 suggesting a linear dependence of peak flow on the contributing area the linear dependence is due to the fairly spatially uniform rainfall hitting the small size elementary catchments the variation of the multiplicative parameter δ reflects variations in size rainfall accumulation and land use across the various elementary catchments the local slopes θ for the channel grids were derived from a 5 m dem using the corresponding functions in topotoolbox schwanghart and kuhn 2010 eqs 4 and 5 provided the values of channel width and peak discharge that together with the local channel slope map enabled the computation of the index ti eq 2 along channel networks within each elementary catchment and the comparison between unit width event peak flow and the ti the results obtained by the coupled model for a range of values of the parameter const t the only parameter used for field calibration were compared with reports of debris flow occurrences contingency statistics namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were derived from each value of the parameter and the optimal value of const t was selected maximizing the csi the results obtained from this procedure are reported in fig 9 pod far and csi are defined as 6 pod tp tp fn 7 far fp tp fp 8 csi tp tp fp fn where true positives tp denote the number of actual debris flow occurrences that were correctly predicted i e hits false positives fp denote the number of falsely predicted debris flow occurrences identifying the number of the false alarms false negatives fn denote the number of debris flow occurrences that were not predicted identifying the number of the misses pod far and csi index range between 0 and 1 with a perfect forecast corresponding to values of 0 for far and 1 for pod and csi the coupled model reproduces the distribution of the elementary catchments which originated debris flows fairly well however the model predicts debris flows in the eastern portion of the vizze basin even though such events were not observed in those areas in order to check the improved information provided by the model these results were compared to the well known rainfall thresholds based on the event rainfall accumulation or rain intensities guzzetti et al 2008 we considered the event rainfall accumulation and the maximum 1 h rain intensity both averaged over the elementary catchments as debris flow predictors following the procedures described above for the threshold index we selected the thresholds optimizing the csi the corresponding results are reported in fig 10 for event rainfall accumulation the map for 1 h rainfall intensities is not reported because it is very similar to the event rainfall map which is not surprising considering the rainfall properties reported in fig 3 table 2 summarizes the thresholds identified for the three triggering predictors and the corresponding contingency statistics results show that the three predictors have considerable skill in predicting debris flow occurrence this is not surprising since they were all optimised based on the event information however the coupled model ranks highest allowing to correctly identify more debris flows and to reduce the false alarms by 10 this suggests that combining hydrologic response variables with geomorphologic metrics of local channel properties provides a better delineation of the debris no debris flow catchments the value of threshold parameter constt obtained through csi optimisation corresponds to a dm value of 0 11 m which is consistent with representative parameter ranges for the bed material of the debris flow initiation areas these generally range between 0 07 m and 0 2 m according to field observations and post event reports on the other hand the value of 40 mm found for the event cumulated rainfall exceeds by far the values provided for the event by the regional relationship identified by nikolopoulos et al 2015 for the upper adige river basin and based on availability of radar data this relationship amounts to rtot 11 05 d 0 34 where rtot is the threshold event cumulated rainfall in mm and d is the rainfall duration in hours with a value of ten hours for the event duration the value of rtot is equal to 24 2 mm which is well below the value found through csi optimisation 5 2 cross validation in this section a cross validation is carried out to independently evaluate the performance of the ti based threshold predictions and a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the potential impact of the estimated w a relationship on the performance of the proposed framework the ti data of the 64 elementary catchments were randomly split into two samples 32 basins in each sample the first sample was used for the calibration of ti values according to the procedure described in previous section the calibrated ti value was used for the debris flow prediction of the second sample and the performance was evaluated according to csi value this procedure was repeated 1000 times and the distribution of csi values for both calibration and validation are reported as boxplots in fig 11 the median csi values for calibration and validation samples are 0 79 and 0 82 and the coefficient of variation are 0 08 and 0 10 respectively showing that while some variability exists the performance is quite stable and at acceptable level 88 of the values 0 7 in validation dataset 5 3 sensitivity to the channel width area relationship parameters an important source of uncertainty in the proposed framework is represented by the estimation of the channel width upstream area w a relationship for the entire stream network previous works showed that the w a parameters may vary between different regions or even between catchments of the same region and are strongly influenced by geolithological conditions vianello and d agostino 2007 modrick and georgakakos 2014 sofia et al 2015 furthermore within a given catchment deviation of the actual channel width values from those obtained by the estimated w a relationship may depend on estimation uncertainty as well as natural variability quantification of the uncertainty associated to these sources is beyond the scope of this work it is however important to analyse the sensitivity of the performance of the ti threshold method to the w a parameters we carried out a scenario based analysis in which different sets of γ and c parameters for the w a relationship eq 3 were used to estimate the ti and evaluate its performance a wide range of parameters realistic relative to the topographic features of our study basin was selected considering the relative variability in w a parameters reported for three basins with similar climatic and topographic characteristics vianello and d agostino 2007 sofia et al 2015 the parameter variation variability was achieved by deriving upper lower curves on the reported w a relationships overall we found an average variation of the order of 20 and 50 for multiplier and exponent parameter respectively that we applied to our estimated w a relationship to define a range of parameter γ from 5 16 to 7 74 and parameter c from 0 11 to 0 33 according to these ranges four scenarios were created combining the upper lower values and they were used for the sensitivity analysis first the ti thresholds and corresponding csi values were estimated table 3 it is interesting to note that while there is variability in the ti threshold values the performance of the method as a predictor is stable while the lack of sensitivity to the variations in the multiplicative parameter is due to features of the parameter optimisation procedure variation in the exponent values are also insensitive due to limited extension of drainage areas which are of concerns in the procedure the segment of the river network which are considered in the method are those characterised by a slope larger than 0 1 in a second step of the sensitivity analysis we examined the predictive power of the coupled model conditional to a different true w a relationship in other words how good is the ti derived from scenario x of parameters γ and c to predict the scenario y table 4 reports csi values for the different combinations of true scenario x and used scenario y ti thresholds obviously when x equals y the csi value is the same as that reported in table 3 as it is shown when scenario 3 is true and scenario 2 is used to estimate ti threshold the performance can be degraded significantly with csi dropping from 0 79 best case to 0 63 worst case given the difference in ti values reported in table 3 it is clear that in this case the estimated threshold is much lower than the true threshold thus a large number of false positives occurring degrades the overall prediction performance this sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of the accuracy of w a relationship on the performance of the ti based prediction framework therefore appropriate application of the proposed framework requires knowledge of a region specific w a relationship this can be either obtained from field surveys or estimated following the procedure described in section 3 4 automated algorithms able to estimate channel width at any point in the network e g sofia et al 2015 can also be considered for improving prediction 6 conclusions a coupled flash flood debris flow model for the prediction of flood responses and the identification of channels associated with debris flows was presented a spatially explicit dynamic hydrologic model was coupled with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with channelized debris flows initiation model the coupled model was validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km2 vizze basin in the eastern italian alps on august 4 5 2012 for which discharge data flash flood peaks from post flood survey together with high resolution quality controlled weather radar rainfall estimates were available the main findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed model is able to predict the spatially variable flood responses associated with the examined extreme rainstorm and permits the assessment of the spatial distribution of flood peaks along the channel networks where debris flows were triggered 2 coupling the distributed flood response model with geomorphic relationships of local channel properties and with a debris flow initiation model provides a framework in which the likelihood of a debris flow occurrence is estimated comparing a spatially variable threshold index with the unit width peak flows over the whole river network susceptible to debris flow 3 the coupled model showed higher predictive power with respect to more commonly used rainfall based models with a critical success index equal to 0 79 and lower false alarm ratios 20 4 considerable sensitivity to the assumptions concerning bankfull channel width drainage area is found suggesting a need for region specific channel width drainage area relations the performance of the proposed coupled flash flood debris flow model framework are encouraging and support the combined use of hydrologic and geomorphologic information in forecasting procedures for both flash floods and channelized debris flows it is nevertheless important to note that the uncertainties associated to different elements of the framework e g hydrologic model performance channel width estimation etc need to be carefully considered in relevant applications further improvements in the accuracy of the method can be achieved by increasing the accuracy of corresponding elements e g improved hydrologic models automated channel width estimation from lidar etc further applications of the model are indeed needed before generalizing the results at a regional scale acknowledgements the authors wish to thank stefano crema for his

7453,this paper examines the hydrological impact of the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation seasonality is after aridity a second order determinant of catchment water yield based on a data set of 171 french catchments where aridity ranged between 0 2 and 1 2 we present a parameterization of three commonly used water balance formulas namely turc mezentsev tixeront fu and oldekop formulas to account for seasonality effects we quantify the improvement of seasonality based parameterization in terms of the reconstitution of both catchment streamflow and water yield the significant improvement obtained reduction of rmse between 9 and 14 depending on the formula demonstrates the importance of climate seasonality in the determination of long term catchment water balance keywords budyko framework seasonality synchronicity catchment yield turc mezentsev formula tixeront fu formula oldekop formula 1 introduction 1 1 notations in this paper we discuss the catchment scale water balance and its three main components precipitation p streamflow q and maximum evaporation ex here maximum evaporation is understood in the sense of budyko 1963 1948 as the water equivalent of the energy available to evaporation the three fluxes are computed at catchment scale expressed in millimetres per year and represent long term averages long term being at least a decade and preferentially three decades when working on long term values catchment storage changes both soil moisture and groundwater become negligible compared to the three fluxes over these time scales then by assuming that exchanges between surface and deep groundwater are limited compared to the other fluxes we may estimate long term catchment scale actual evaporation ea as the residual value between p and q ea p q last in what follows the ex p ratio is called the aridity ratio its inverse i e the p ex ratio is called the humidity ratio and the q p ratio is called catchment water yield 1 2 on the hydrological impact of the relative seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation estimating catchment water yield is crucial for water resources assessment in many cases where ground based hydrological measurements are not available gross estimations of mean flow based on climate characteristics can be extremely useful simple water balance formulas can provide such assessments and they have been used for over a century to this end for various water resources applications in 1911 oldekop first proposed to compute catchment water yield as a function of the aridity ratio andréassian et al 2016 this idea was later popularized by budyko 1963 1948 turc 1954 and others today many hydrologists agree on describing catchment water yield as a first order function of aridity and several formulations based on this principle are widely used see among others the studies of arora 2002 asokan et al 2010 choudhury 1999 donohue et al 2011 dooge 1992 greve and seneviratne 2015 le moine et al 2007 moussa and lhomme 2016 oudin et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 the three formulations retained for our study detailed in table 2 are the formulations proposed by oldekop 1911 turc and mezentsev mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 and tixeront and fu fu 1981 tixeront 1964 beyond aridity it has long been acknowledged that climate seasonality also has an impact on water yield thornthwaite 1948 turc 1954 wang et al 2016 depending on the catchment the regime curves of climate variables can show more or less variable patterns in terms of amplitude besides the dynamics of different climate variables can be more or less synchronized or out of phase thornthwaite 1948 in his classic paper dedicated to the average flow of rivers pardé 1933 underlines that for identical values of precipitation and temperature everything else being equal the runoff coefficient q p will be smaller where the larger part of precipitation falls during the warm season as an example pardé p 508 brings the miserable runoff coefficient of the missouri river 2 l s km2 which he explains by the fact that 68 of its precipitation occurs between the months of march and august when evaporative demand is high thornthwaite 1948 proposed to classify climates initially with two indices one characterizing the periods of water surplus and the other the periods of water deficiency which he subsequently combined into a single index lucien turc at the very end of his 1954 paper writes p 539 that the most urgent improvement to his actual evaporation formula should be the introduction of the distribution of precipitations and of the temperature changes within the year but turc did not propose any solution at the interannual time step and subsequently preferred to work at the monthly and 10 day time steps budyko 1974 who had proposed a consensus actual evaporation formula based on the work of oldekop 1911 also underlined that this formula was likely to underestimate values derived from the catchment water balance in those catchments where rainfall and maximum evaporation were in phase a few recent studies have discussed the impact of climate seasonality on water balance see for example the review of wang et al 2016 we present below the main studies which we have divided into two groups those based on theoretical considerations i e model computations and those based on the analysis of actual water balance data 1 2 1 theoretical studies dooge 1992 presented theoretical curves relating the energetic yield ea ex to the humidity ratio p ex where he introduced as a parameter the length of the dry season milly 1994 proposed a theoretical computation of actual evaporation based on the aridity ratio the seasonality of the difference p ex and plant available water holding capacity yokoo et al 2008 p 262 made theoretical computations to show that climate seasonality has a tendency to decrease annual evapotranspiration and increase total runoff if precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are out of phase compared to the case when they are in phase or they have no seasonality roderick and farquhar 2011 summarized the major factors that should lead to a change in runoff yield in the murray darling basin and mentioned the impact that these factors would have on the parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula an increase of p in summer and a complementary decrease in winter would increase n and decrease q an increase of ex in summer and a complementary decrease in winter should decrease n and increase q feng et al 2012 developed a framework for evaluating the role of seasonal climatic variability on soil moisture and mean annual evaporation they concluded that stronger seasonality results in more runoff and lower actual evaporation donohue et al 2012 used this framework and proposed a parameterization of the parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula for the murray darling basin based on plant available soil water holding capacity mean storm depth and effective rooting depth 1 2 2 data based studies potter et al 2005 studied the impact of rainfall seasonality on mean annual water balance in australia and obtained contradictory results first using the stochastic model proposed by milly 1994 they showed that catchments where the precipitation and evaporation regimes are out of phase should produce more runoff or less actual evaporation but then analyzing data measured in 262 australian catchments they were surprised to find the opposite they concluded that this was probably due to the significant role of two other factors soil storage capacity and average rainfall intensity in a context where infiltration excess runoff was substantial using an extended data set of 326 australian catchments hickel and zhang 2006 went one step further and attempted to distinguish climate controlled and storage controlled evaporation they described climate seasonality with the two indices proposed by thornthwaite 1948 water surplus and water deficiency and assumed that catchment scale evaporation could be modelled as the sum of two components one controlled by climate and the other controlled by soil moisture storage they concluded that it was difficult to assess the impact of climate seasonality because the two components were reacting in opposite directions yang et al 2012 used a dataset of 108 chinese catchments to develop two empirical relationships linking parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula with i milly s parametric climate seasonality index and ii the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity the mean precipitation intensity and the plant extractable water capacity to assist the interpretation of this review of the scientific literature figure 1 presents the monthly series of two catchments from our own data set both have an identical humidity ratio p ex 1 05 and only differ in more pronounced seasonality in catchment b both catchments have a similar seasonal evaporation regime and differ in the seasonality of precipitation in this example one observes a behaviour coherent with the predictions of the theoretical studies seasonality enhances runoff yield clearly this is only a single example which we will attempt to generalize in this paper 1 3 objectives of this paper this paper deals with three classical water balance formulas which have been designed to account for the effect of aridity the first order effect of climate on catchment yield but which do not account for the second order seasonality effect our objectives in this paper are threefold i to present a quantitative index able to describe the relative seasonality of p and ex ii to use this index in a relevant parameterization of the above mentioned water balance formulas and iii to show how the seasonality information improves the performance of each water balance formula these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the methods and results sections 2 a set of catchments without significant intercatchment groundwater flows if we are to use the long term water balance of natural catchments as a measure to assess long term actual evaporation losses we need to be able to assume that the catchments in question are conservative see e g eakin 1966 goswami and o connor 2010 in the sense that there are no significant intercatchment groundwater flows igf small catchments which form most catchment data sets have at least in the geological conditions present in france a tendency to be net contributors to regional groundwater systems see the discussion in section 7 of the paper by mouelhi et al 2006 where igfs are substantial we will not be able to close the catchment water balance with any of the formulas presented in table 2 we therefore had to select a catchment subset with conservative catchments to do so we followed the approach of le moine et al 2007 who used a daily rainfall runoff model to estimate the long term intercatchment groundwater flows we identified a subset of 171 french catchments which had negligible positive or negative igfs in the sense that they accounted for less than 5 of the long term precipitation input figure 2 a shows a map of the catchments retained after this procedure and we believe that the spread over the country is quite satisfying figure 2 b shows these catchments in the turc budyko nondimensional space here we choose the q p vs p ex representation it illustrates the variety of climates encountered in france last table 1 gives a few physiographic characteristics 3 methods 3 1 a quantitative index describing the relative seasonality of p and ex a few seasonality indices have been proposed in the literature one can cite for example the two indices of thornthwaite 1948 water surplus and water deficiency which we did not use because we aimed at a simpler single index solution to support our parameterization another solution proposed by milly 1994 was parametric and based on the phase difference of two sines but it was inapplicable in several regions of france were rainfall has no marked seasonality we looked for a non parametric single index able to encapsulate the observed synchronicity of p and ex we present here what we consider to be the simplest such index the computation of which can be easily understood on a graph of monthly precipitation and maximum evaporation figure 3 the intersection of the curves of monthly p and ex p e x i e taking the minimum of p and ex for each month represents the amount of water which is the most easily accessible for evaporation the union of the curves of monthly p and ex p e x i e taking the maximum of p and ex for each month represents an upper limit of actual evaporation i e an amount of water that could be evaporated if there were always energy to evaporate water when water is available and always water to be evaporated when energy is available the λ ratio eq 1 will be always between 0 and 1 it reflects the synchronicity of p and ex high values will reflect situations where evaporation is favoured over streamflow because p and ex occur synchronously while low values will reflect situations where streamflow is favoured over evaporation 1 λ p e x p e x figure 4 presents the spatial distribution of parameter λ values over france based on the safran data set of météo france vidal et al 2010 for precipitation and the oudin et al 2005 formula for maximum evaporation the variability observed on the map reflects climatic domains known to french hydrologists high mountains on the eastern jura vosges alps and southern pyrenees borders display low 0 3 synchronicity indices because of overall low ex and high p values the mediterranean regions display indices close to 0 3 because the mediterranean climate is characterized by a pronounced summer drought and a winter maximum for precipitations di castri et al 1981 the cévennes vivarais highlands the pale coloured arc in south central france combine features of the mediterranean climate with larger than average precipitation amounts falling in autumn obviously the value of λ may be somewhat dependent on the time period considered for its computation and we wished to control that it was not too variable figure 5 shows the distribution of the values of the seasonality index λ computed on overlapping 10 year periods each line represents the different seasonality values obtained on a given catchment clearly the value of λ is quite stable on periods of approximately 10 years making it a stable catchment characteristic 3 2 parameterization of the water balance formulas using the seasonality index in this section we present the method used to study the dependency of catchment water yield to the seasonality index λ table 2 shows the three water balance formulations used in this study note that they can be equivalently presented under one or the other of the two possible forms i e streamflow or actual evaporation several linear and nonlinear parameterization strategies were tested to account for the seasonality effect in the water balance formulas but for the sake of conciseness we will only present here the strategy that worked best we selected the nonlinear formulation of eq 8 with only two parameters a and b to identify 8 f λ ae b λ for the oldekop formula eq 2 which has no free parameter we retained a multiplicative parameterization of the actual evaporation component q p f λ e x tanh p e x for the turc mezentsev formula eq 4 which has a free parameter n we retained a parameterization of n n f λ for the tixeront fu formula eq 6 which has a free parameter m we retained a parameterization of m m f λ 3 3 pareto multi criterion assessment of the modified seasonality accounting water balance formulae parameters a and b of eq 8 can be calibrated by comparing observed and calculated streamflow for the 171 catchments of the data set they can also be calibrated by comparing observed and calculated water yields i e the q p ratio remember that the water balance formulas are often used to compute nondimensional ratios q p ea p ea ex we propose here to perform a multi objective calibration by simultaneously considering two objective functions see table 3 this multi objective calibration implies looking at two efficiency criteria at a time in order to identify the parameter sets which form the pareto front or pareto frontier i e solutions which are called non dominated in the sense that no gain on criterion 1 is possible without a loss on criterion 2 and vice versa efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the final choice is to be made among the parameter sets which lie on the pareto front to simultaneously calibrate parameters a and b on their ability to reproduce discharge and water yield we explore the pareto space by sampling parameter values on a regular grid the optimum value for parameters a and b is determined graphically by minimizing the euclidian distance with the absolute maximum on each axis in the result section we will present pareto plots showing the efficiency of parameter sets with rmseq on the x axis and rmseq p on the y axis table 4 summarizes the successive steps of our methodology 4 results 4 1 analysis of the pareto fronts figure 6 shows the pareto fronts for each of the three formulas where it is possible to identify a unique compromise parameter set efficient for both objectives the optima are presented in table 5 note that we constrained parameter a to be greater than one in order to ensure that the parameter of the tixeront fu formula would be always greater than one 4 2 how significant is the improvement brought by the two additional degrees of freedom to address the question of the significance of the improvement brought by parameterizing the three formulas based on the seasonality index λ it is easy to look at the rmse values that are obtained for a subset of parameter sets where b is kept at 0 and thus λ has no impact the second pareto front represented on figure 7 in blue represents the pareto optimum results when b is kept equal to zero i e when no seasonality effect is accounted for there is clearly an added value to introduce the seasonality based parameterization which reduces the rmseq by 9 for the oldekop formula and by 12 14 for the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas also note that the blue pareto front appears much less constrained than the red one accounting for seasonality is definitely helpful to converge towards a single solution that is almost optimal for both criteria 4 3 maps we now present maps of france for parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula and parameter m of the tixeront fu formula figure 8 it is interesting to note that the average n value for france is 2 03 the average m value is 2 73 and that the difference 0 70 is very close to the theoretically obtained value of 0 72 yang et al 2008 we also computed the average annual actual evaporation figure 9 and the runoff ratio figure 10 it is interesting to underline that the maps obtained by both formulas are extremely similar as far as the average values are concerned the average actual evaporation for france is 535 mm yr with the regionalized turc mezentsev formula and the regionalized tixeront fu formula in terms of average runoff ratio both formulas give the same average value 0 39 the variability observed on the three maps reflects well known hydro climatic characteristics the highest mountains mainly in the alps have lower evaporation rates due to lower temperatures and higher cloudiness all mountain ranges have higher runoff ratios due to a combination of larger precipitation amounts pronounced evaporative demand seasonality and partially lower evaporation rates the mediterranean region with its pronounced asynchronicity of p and ex has low n and m parameters and larger runoff ratios than would be expected based on the humidity index alone beyond the country average values and the spatial variability which are naturally of interest these maps confirm an already known fact sun 2007 yang et al 2008 the turc mezentsev and tixeront fu formulas give even after being made seasonally accounting almost undifferentiable results see in particular figure 11 4 4 synthesis and discussion table 6 summarizes the proposed parameterization of three water balance formulas which have been used for the maps presented in fig 8 10 the only equivalent parameterization we are aware of is that published by yang et al 2012 they worked with the turc mezentsev formula and explained its parameter n although we have not been able to compare our parameterizations because yang et al use milly s parametric seasonality index which is only valid in areas were both precipitation and maximum evaporation have a marked seasonality it is interesting to underline i that we both retained exponential equations over linear ones and ii that we both obtained equations where n decreases when p and ex are increasingly asynchronous remember that λ is an index of synchronicity of p and ex while milly s index is one of phase shift 5 conclusion in this paper we examined the impact of seasonality on long term catchment water yield based on catchment streamflow data we proposed a parameterization of three commonly used water balance formulas table 6 which in their original form relate catchment water yield to catchment aridity ex p the improvement is significant in that the rmse is reduced by 9 for the oldekop formula and by 12 14 for the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas this successful regionalization of the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas also means that the proposed seasonality index λ eq 1 is a relevant climatic descriptor to quantify the synchronicity of p and ex we see two main limits to this study the first one comes from the fact that for data availability issues we had to focus on a set of 171 french catchments although france is a climatically diverse country although our data set includes lowland and mountainous catchments as well as oceanic semi continental and mediterranean catchments this data set would certainly gain to be expanded provided one can ensure that the catchments are not leaking in the sense of being net contributors to regional groundwater systems an extended data set would perhaps point to other factors such as those discussed by potter et al 2005 in australia also we would like to mention that in our search for a way to account for the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation in water balance formulas we did nothing else than follow the recommendation of turc 1954 in certain regions of the world other climatic or physiographic characteristics could have a larger impact and should be taken into account see e g the classification of trancoso et al 2016 or the explaining factors retained by yang et al 2012 last we would like to remind that we used the three water balance formulae as they were initially intended to be used i e with long term averages representative of a static climate no attempt was made to account for climatic or land use changes acknowledgements the authors wish to

7453,this paper examines the hydrological impact of the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation seasonality is after aridity a second order determinant of catchment water yield based on a data set of 171 french catchments where aridity ranged between 0 2 and 1 2 we present a parameterization of three commonly used water balance formulas namely turc mezentsev tixeront fu and oldekop formulas to account for seasonality effects we quantify the improvement of seasonality based parameterization in terms of the reconstitution of both catchment streamflow and water yield the significant improvement obtained reduction of rmse between 9 and 14 depending on the formula demonstrates the importance of climate seasonality in the determination of long term catchment water balance keywords budyko framework seasonality synchronicity catchment yield turc mezentsev formula tixeront fu formula oldekop formula 1 introduction 1 1 notations in this paper we discuss the catchment scale water balance and its three main components precipitation p streamflow q and maximum evaporation ex here maximum evaporation is understood in the sense of budyko 1963 1948 as the water equivalent of the energy available to evaporation the three fluxes are computed at catchment scale expressed in millimetres per year and represent long term averages long term being at least a decade and preferentially three decades when working on long term values catchment storage changes both soil moisture and groundwater become negligible compared to the three fluxes over these time scales then by assuming that exchanges between surface and deep groundwater are limited compared to the other fluxes we may estimate long term catchment scale actual evaporation ea as the residual value between p and q ea p q last in what follows the ex p ratio is called the aridity ratio its inverse i e the p ex ratio is called the humidity ratio and the q p ratio is called catchment water yield 1 2 on the hydrological impact of the relative seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation estimating catchment water yield is crucial for water resources assessment in many cases where ground based hydrological measurements are not available gross estimations of mean flow based on climate characteristics can be extremely useful simple water balance formulas can provide such assessments and they have been used for over a century to this end for various water resources applications in 1911 oldekop first proposed to compute catchment water yield as a function of the aridity ratio andréassian et al 2016 this idea was later popularized by budyko 1963 1948 turc 1954 and others today many hydrologists agree on describing catchment water yield as a first order function of aridity and several formulations based on this principle are widely used see among others the studies of arora 2002 asokan et al 2010 choudhury 1999 donohue et al 2011 dooge 1992 greve and seneviratne 2015 le moine et al 2007 moussa and lhomme 2016 oudin et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 the three formulations retained for our study detailed in table 2 are the formulations proposed by oldekop 1911 turc and mezentsev mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 and tixeront and fu fu 1981 tixeront 1964 beyond aridity it has long been acknowledged that climate seasonality also has an impact on water yield thornthwaite 1948 turc 1954 wang et al 2016 depending on the catchment the regime curves of climate variables can show more or less variable patterns in terms of amplitude besides the dynamics of different climate variables can be more or less synchronized or out of phase thornthwaite 1948 in his classic paper dedicated to the average flow of rivers pardé 1933 underlines that for identical values of precipitation and temperature everything else being equal the runoff coefficient q p will be smaller where the larger part of precipitation falls during the warm season as an example pardé p 508 brings the miserable runoff coefficient of the missouri river 2 l s km2 which he explains by the fact that 68 of its precipitation occurs between the months of march and august when evaporative demand is high thornthwaite 1948 proposed to classify climates initially with two indices one characterizing the periods of water surplus and the other the periods of water deficiency which he subsequently combined into a single index lucien turc at the very end of his 1954 paper writes p 539 that the most urgent improvement to his actual evaporation formula should be the introduction of the distribution of precipitations and of the temperature changes within the year but turc did not propose any solution at the interannual time step and subsequently preferred to work at the monthly and 10 day time steps budyko 1974 who had proposed a consensus actual evaporation formula based on the work of oldekop 1911 also underlined that this formula was likely to underestimate values derived from the catchment water balance in those catchments where rainfall and maximum evaporation were in phase a few recent studies have discussed the impact of climate seasonality on water balance see for example the review of wang et al 2016 we present below the main studies which we have divided into two groups those based on theoretical considerations i e model computations and those based on the analysis of actual water balance data 1 2 1 theoretical studies dooge 1992 presented theoretical curves relating the energetic yield ea ex to the humidity ratio p ex where he introduced as a parameter the length of the dry season milly 1994 proposed a theoretical computation of actual evaporation based on the aridity ratio the seasonality of the difference p ex and plant available water holding capacity yokoo et al 2008 p 262 made theoretical computations to show that climate seasonality has a tendency to decrease annual evapotranspiration and increase total runoff if precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are out of phase compared to the case when they are in phase or they have no seasonality roderick and farquhar 2011 summarized the major factors that should lead to a change in runoff yield in the murray darling basin and mentioned the impact that these factors would have on the parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula an increase of p in summer and a complementary decrease in winter would increase n and decrease q an increase of ex in summer and a complementary decrease in winter should decrease n and increase q feng et al 2012 developed a framework for evaluating the role of seasonal climatic variability on soil moisture and mean annual evaporation they concluded that stronger seasonality results in more runoff and lower actual evaporation donohue et al 2012 used this framework and proposed a parameterization of the parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula for the murray darling basin based on plant available soil water holding capacity mean storm depth and effective rooting depth 1 2 2 data based studies potter et al 2005 studied the impact of rainfall seasonality on mean annual water balance in australia and obtained contradictory results first using the stochastic model proposed by milly 1994 they showed that catchments where the precipitation and evaporation regimes are out of phase should produce more runoff or less actual evaporation but then analyzing data measured in 262 australian catchments they were surprised to find the opposite they concluded that this was probably due to the significant role of two other factors soil storage capacity and average rainfall intensity in a context where infiltration excess runoff was substantial using an extended data set of 326 australian catchments hickel and zhang 2006 went one step further and attempted to distinguish climate controlled and storage controlled evaporation they described climate seasonality with the two indices proposed by thornthwaite 1948 water surplus and water deficiency and assumed that catchment scale evaporation could be modelled as the sum of two components one controlled by climate and the other controlled by soil moisture storage they concluded that it was difficult to assess the impact of climate seasonality because the two components were reacting in opposite directions yang et al 2012 used a dataset of 108 chinese catchments to develop two empirical relationships linking parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula with i milly s parametric climate seasonality index and ii the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity the mean precipitation intensity and the plant extractable water capacity to assist the interpretation of this review of the scientific literature figure 1 presents the monthly series of two catchments from our own data set both have an identical humidity ratio p ex 1 05 and only differ in more pronounced seasonality in catchment b both catchments have a similar seasonal evaporation regime and differ in the seasonality of precipitation in this example one observes a behaviour coherent with the predictions of the theoretical studies seasonality enhances runoff yield clearly this is only a single example which we will attempt to generalize in this paper 1 3 objectives of this paper this paper deals with three classical water balance formulas which have been designed to account for the effect of aridity the first order effect of climate on catchment yield but which do not account for the second order seasonality effect our objectives in this paper are threefold i to present a quantitative index able to describe the relative seasonality of p and ex ii to use this index in a relevant parameterization of the above mentioned water balance formulas and iii to show how the seasonality information improves the performance of each water balance formula these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the methods and results sections 2 a set of catchments without significant intercatchment groundwater flows if we are to use the long term water balance of natural catchments as a measure to assess long term actual evaporation losses we need to be able to assume that the catchments in question are conservative see e g eakin 1966 goswami and o connor 2010 in the sense that there are no significant intercatchment groundwater flows igf small catchments which form most catchment data sets have at least in the geological conditions present in france a tendency to be net contributors to regional groundwater systems see the discussion in section 7 of the paper by mouelhi et al 2006 where igfs are substantial we will not be able to close the catchment water balance with any of the formulas presented in table 2 we therefore had to select a catchment subset with conservative catchments to do so we followed the approach of le moine et al 2007 who used a daily rainfall runoff model to estimate the long term intercatchment groundwater flows we identified a subset of 171 french catchments which had negligible positive or negative igfs in the sense that they accounted for less than 5 of the long term precipitation input figure 2 a shows a map of the catchments retained after this procedure and we believe that the spread over the country is quite satisfying figure 2 b shows these catchments in the turc budyko nondimensional space here we choose the q p vs p ex representation it illustrates the variety of climates encountered in france last table 1 gives a few physiographic characteristics 3 methods 3 1 a quantitative index describing the relative seasonality of p and ex a few seasonality indices have been proposed in the literature one can cite for example the two indices of thornthwaite 1948 water surplus and water deficiency which we did not use because we aimed at a simpler single index solution to support our parameterization another solution proposed by milly 1994 was parametric and based on the phase difference of two sines but it was inapplicable in several regions of france were rainfall has no marked seasonality we looked for a non parametric single index able to encapsulate the observed synchronicity of p and ex we present here what we consider to be the simplest such index the computation of which can be easily understood on a graph of monthly precipitation and maximum evaporation figure 3 the intersection of the curves of monthly p and ex p e x i e taking the minimum of p and ex for each month represents the amount of water which is the most easily accessible for evaporation the union of the curves of monthly p and ex p e x i e taking the maximum of p and ex for each month represents an upper limit of actual evaporation i e an amount of water that could be evaporated if there were always energy to evaporate water when water is available and always water to be evaporated when energy is available the λ ratio eq 1 will be always between 0 and 1 it reflects the synchronicity of p and ex high values will reflect situations where evaporation is favoured over streamflow because p and ex occur synchronously while low values will reflect situations where streamflow is favoured over evaporation 1 λ p e x p e x figure 4 presents the spatial distribution of parameter λ values over france based on the safran data set of météo france vidal et al 2010 for precipitation and the oudin et al 2005 formula for maximum evaporation the variability observed on the map reflects climatic domains known to french hydrologists high mountains on the eastern jura vosges alps and southern pyrenees borders display low 0 3 synchronicity indices because of overall low ex and high p values the mediterranean regions display indices close to 0 3 because the mediterranean climate is characterized by a pronounced summer drought and a winter maximum for precipitations di castri et al 1981 the cévennes vivarais highlands the pale coloured arc in south central france combine features of the mediterranean climate with larger than average precipitation amounts falling in autumn obviously the value of λ may be somewhat dependent on the time period considered for its computation and we wished to control that it was not too variable figure 5 shows the distribution of the values of the seasonality index λ computed on overlapping 10 year periods each line represents the different seasonality values obtained on a given catchment clearly the value of λ is quite stable on periods of approximately 10 years making it a stable catchment characteristic 3 2 parameterization of the water balance formulas using the seasonality index in this section we present the method used to study the dependency of catchment water yield to the seasonality index λ table 2 shows the three water balance formulations used in this study note that they can be equivalently presented under one or the other of the two possible forms i e streamflow or actual evaporation several linear and nonlinear parameterization strategies were tested to account for the seasonality effect in the water balance formulas but for the sake of conciseness we will only present here the strategy that worked best we selected the nonlinear formulation of eq 8 with only two parameters a and b to identify 8 f λ ae b λ for the oldekop formula eq 2 which has no free parameter we retained a multiplicative parameterization of the actual evaporation component q p f λ e x tanh p e x for the turc mezentsev formula eq 4 which has a free parameter n we retained a parameterization of n n f λ for the tixeront fu formula eq 6 which has a free parameter m we retained a parameterization of m m f λ 3 3 pareto multi criterion assessment of the modified seasonality accounting water balance formulae parameters a and b of eq 8 can be calibrated by comparing observed and calculated streamflow for the 171 catchments of the data set they can also be calibrated by comparing observed and calculated water yields i e the q p ratio remember that the water balance formulas are often used to compute nondimensional ratios q p ea p ea ex we propose here to perform a multi objective calibration by simultaneously considering two objective functions see table 3 this multi objective calibration implies looking at two efficiency criteria at a time in order to identify the parameter sets which form the pareto front or pareto frontier i e solutions which are called non dominated in the sense that no gain on criterion 1 is possible without a loss on criterion 2 and vice versa efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the final choice is to be made among the parameter sets which lie on the pareto front to simultaneously calibrate parameters a and b on their ability to reproduce discharge and water yield we explore the pareto space by sampling parameter values on a regular grid the optimum value for parameters a and b is determined graphically by minimizing the euclidian distance with the absolute maximum on each axis in the result section we will present pareto plots showing the efficiency of parameter sets with rmseq on the x axis and rmseq p on the y axis table 4 summarizes the successive steps of our methodology 4 results 4 1 analysis of the pareto fronts figure 6 shows the pareto fronts for each of the three formulas where it is possible to identify a unique compromise parameter set efficient for both objectives the optima are presented in table 5 note that we constrained parameter a to be greater than one in order to ensure that the parameter of the tixeront fu formula would be always greater than one 4 2 how significant is the improvement brought by the two additional degrees of freedom to address the question of the significance of the improvement brought by parameterizing the three formulas based on the seasonality index λ it is easy to look at the rmse values that are obtained for a subset of parameter sets where b is kept at 0 and thus λ has no impact the second pareto front represented on figure 7 in blue represents the pareto optimum results when b is kept equal to zero i e when no seasonality effect is accounted for there is clearly an added value to introduce the seasonality based parameterization which reduces the rmseq by 9 for the oldekop formula and by 12 14 for the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas also note that the blue pareto front appears much less constrained than the red one accounting for seasonality is definitely helpful to converge towards a single solution that is almost optimal for both criteria 4 3 maps we now present maps of france for parameter n of the turc mezentsev formula and parameter m of the tixeront fu formula figure 8 it is interesting to note that the average n value for france is 2 03 the average m value is 2 73 and that the difference 0 70 is very close to the theoretically obtained value of 0 72 yang et al 2008 we also computed the average annual actual evaporation figure 9 and the runoff ratio figure 10 it is interesting to underline that the maps obtained by both formulas are extremely similar as far as the average values are concerned the average actual evaporation for france is 535 mm yr with the regionalized turc mezentsev formula and the regionalized tixeront fu formula in terms of average runoff ratio both formulas give the same average value 0 39 the variability observed on the three maps reflects well known hydro climatic characteristics the highest mountains mainly in the alps have lower evaporation rates due to lower temperatures and higher cloudiness all mountain ranges have higher runoff ratios due to a combination of larger precipitation amounts pronounced evaporative demand seasonality and partially lower evaporation rates the mediterranean region with its pronounced asynchronicity of p and ex has low n and m parameters and larger runoff ratios than would be expected based on the humidity index alone beyond the country average values and the spatial variability which are naturally of interest these maps confirm an already known fact sun 2007 yang et al 2008 the turc mezentsev and tixeront fu formulas give even after being made seasonally accounting almost undifferentiable results see in particular figure 11 4 4 synthesis and discussion table 6 summarizes the proposed parameterization of three water balance formulas which have been used for the maps presented in fig 8 10 the only equivalent parameterization we are aware of is that published by yang et al 2012 they worked with the turc mezentsev formula and explained its parameter n although we have not been able to compare our parameterizations because yang et al use milly s parametric seasonality index which is only valid in areas were both precipitation and maximum evaporation have a marked seasonality it is interesting to underline i that we both retained exponential equations over linear ones and ii that we both obtained equations where n decreases when p and ex are increasingly asynchronous remember that λ is an index of synchronicity of p and ex while milly s index is one of phase shift 5 conclusion in this paper we examined the impact of seasonality on long term catchment water yield based on catchment streamflow data we proposed a parameterization of three commonly used water balance formulas table 6 which in their original form relate catchment water yield to catchment aridity ex p the improvement is significant in that the rmse is reduced by 9 for the oldekop formula and by 12 14 for the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas this successful regionalization of the turc mezentsev and the tixeront fu formulas also means that the proposed seasonality index λ eq 1 is a relevant climatic descriptor to quantify the synchronicity of p and ex we see two main limits to this study the first one comes from the fact that for data availability issues we had to focus on a set of 171 french catchments although france is a climatically diverse country although our data set includes lowland and mountainous catchments as well as oceanic semi continental and mediterranean catchments this data set would certainly gain to be expanded provided one can ensure that the catchments are not leaking in the sense of being net contributors to regional groundwater systems an extended data set would perhaps point to other factors such as those discussed by potter et al 2005 in australia also we would like to mention that in our search for a way to account for the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation in water balance formulas we did nothing else than follow the recommendation of turc 1954 in certain regions of the world other climatic or physiographic characteristics could have a larger impact and should be taken into account see e g the classification of trancoso et al 2016 or the explaining factors retained by yang et al 2012 last we would like to remind that we used the three water balance formulae as they were initially intended to be used i e with long term averages representative of a static climate no attempt was made to account for climatic or land use changes acknowledgements the authors wish to

interpolation methods the results show that the combination of the mgwr and bi square function mgwr bi has the best performance r 0 863 and rmse 7 273 mm day among the eight algorithms the mgwr bi algorithm was then applied to produce hourly merged precipitation product compared to the original cmorph product r 0 208 and rmse 1 208 mm hr the quality of the merged data is significantly higher r

introduction hydrological modeling and forecasting is a critical tool for flood disaster preparedness and mitigation precipitation is the most important meteorological input to hydrological models for flood forecasting bhattacharya et al 2013 langella et al 2010 li and shao 2010 li and zhang 2008 yao et al 2014 zhang k et al 2016 however precipitation data is also a main source of uncertainties for flood forecasting due to the limitations of the existing precipitation observing and estimating methods alfieri et al 2014 renard et al 2010 previous studies suggest that 70 80 of the uncertainty of hydrological modeling is due to the uncertainty of precipitation data gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 accurate precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions are highly desirable for hydrological modeling and flood forecasting precipitation data can be obtained from gauge network satellite quantitative precipitation estimation qpe radar qpe and model forecast or reanalysis precipitation products gauge observations usually have limited coverage and station density in practice gauge measured precipitation at one station is usually used to represent precipitation of a region with a size of tens to hundreds square kilometers especially in the remote areas as actual precipitation has significant spatial variability using point value to represent areal value can be inaccurate and lose some spatial variability beesley et al 2009 hughes 2006 renard et al 2010 weather radar can provide precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions qi et al 2013 zhang j et al 2016 but quality of radar qpe can be heavily impacted by complex terrains qi et al 2014 qi et al 2016 with the development of satellite remote sensing technology precipitation can be observed from space with regional and global coverage and acceptable spatiotemporal resolutions hong et al 2004 hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 satellite precipitation data can provide three dimensional profile of precipitation and produce qpe over land and sea chiu et al 2006 the global precipitation measurement gpm program extends spatial coverage to the arctic circle and more accurately captures trace precipitation 0 5 mm hr and solid precipitation smith et al 2007 however as an indirect measurement of precipitation the accuracy of satellite qpe has large uncertainties and poor performance at high latitudes especially for snowfall karbalaee et al 2017 shen et al 2010 wu and zhai 2012 merging multi source satellite precipitation data and blending satellite precipitation with gauge data have become a popular approach for improving quality of precipitation products beck et al 2017 park et al 2017 qi and zhang 2013 xie and xiong 2011 zhang et al 2014 data fusion a term coined in the 1970s has experienced a fast development since the 1980s waltz and llinas 1990 its classic definition is the use of an algorithm to fuse a variety of information into a high quality information pohl and genderen 1998 the data fusion method has been applied since the 1990s mainly in image processing and battlefield information synthesis sun et al 2015 currently data fusion method is widely used in remote sensing image processing multi sensor fusion automatic device monitoring medical diagnosis robotics intelligent detection system environmental test and resource survey among others castanedo 2013 in the recent years data fusion methods have been introduced to fuse multi source precipitation data to improve their quality krajewski 2013 precipitation data fusion or precipitation merging methods are based on a number of mathematical techniques including optimal interpolation shen et al 2014 kalman filter shi et al 2016 ushio et al 2009 bayesian estimation hill 2015 ma et al 2017a ma et al 2018 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 minimum error estimation mckee and binns 2016 wavelet transform analysis pradhan et al 2016 objective statistical analysis mckee and binns 2016 variation approach li et al 2015 and neural network analysis long et al 2016 the national meteorological information center of china utilized the original probability density function optimal interpolation orig pdf oi algorithm to merge satellite precipitation and station observed precipitation and produce a merged precipitation product at hourly and 0 1 resolutions across china shen et al 2014 beck et al 2017 merged seven satellite based precipitation datasets into a global precipitation dataset data fusion methods are also used to merge multiple radar qpe products to produce more accurate qpe rafieeinasab et al 2015 precipitation data fusion is usually a process to merge several precipitation products into one product or to improve qpe quality using gauge observations previous precipitation merging algorithms usually do not involve in downscaling of precipitation enhancing spatial resolution of precipitation products is also important for hydrological modeling and other applications as precipitation especially orographic precipitation usually varies with altitude many studies use the relationship between spatial variables e g elevation and precipitation to interpolate or downscale precipitation over a large region sobie and murdock 2017 for example marquinez et al 2003 successfully used the sub basin average slope and altitude to significantly improve the accuracy of precipitation simulation many researchers have attempted to downscale precipitation by adding additional terrain variables such as latitude longitude elevation slope and aspect chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 ninyerola et al 2015 wotling et al 2000 one mathematical tool used in spatial interpolation or downscaling spatial variables is the geographically weighted regression gwr gwr is a spatial statistical method developed by brunsdon brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 kamarianakis et al 2008 for dealing with data having spatial non stationarity which is defined as being alterations in relationships between variables from one point to another fotheringham et al 2003a fotheringham et al 2003b kara et al 2016 propastin et al 2008 xu et al 2015 recently gwr has been used to analyze spatial characteristics and non stationarity of hydrological and ecological processes such as precipitation and vegetation productivity fang et al 2017 lloyd 2010 wang et al 2012 zhang t et al 2016 brunsdon et al 2002 applied gwr to analyze spatial variability of precipitation and investigate the relationship between elevation and precipitation gwr model has also been used in geography gao et al 2012 economics liu et al 2016 meteorology li and meng 2017 and epidemiology tsai and teng 2016 in this study we aim to develop a method to merge satellite precipitation and station observations to correct biases in satellite precipitation data and downscale satellite precipitation to a finer spatial resolution at the same time to this end we adopted gwr and mixed geographically weighted regression mgwr to estimate biases in the downscaled satellite precipitation data using bilinear interpolation and correct these biases to produce a satellite gauge merged precipitation product with improved spatial resolution and quality in this way satellite precipitation and gauge data are effectively merged 2 methods and data 2 1 the satellite gauge precipitation merging methods similar to the typical two source i e estimation and observation precipitation merging method the merged precipitation p f is a function of the satellite precipitation data p s and the observed value p o 1 p f p s f p o p s essentially f p o p s represents biases to be corrected in the original satellite precipitation data and is usually solved through certain mathematical optimization methods in this study we developed a three step satellite gauge precipitation merging approach following the above logic first we applied the bilinear interpolation to downscale coarser satellite precipitation data p c with a spatial resolution of 8 km in this study to a finer resolution p s with a spatial resolution of 1 km in this study then we used the gwr and mgwr models to estimate the values of f p o p s i e biases of the downscaled precipitation finally we removed the derived biases from the downscaled satellite precipitation to produce a final downscaled merged precipitation data using eq 1 to realize the precipitation data fusion the above method need be applied at each time step fig 1 more details on how to formulate the gwr and mgwr based merging methods are provided below 2 1 1 gwr based merging method the general idea of gwr is that the relationships between variables change with locations a gwr equation is established by estimating the regression coefficients at each location brunsdon et al 2002 kumari et al 2017 leong and yue 2017 gwr improves and generalizes the traditional multiple linear regression analysis by directly describing and explaining the quantitative relationships between spatial variables and providing uncertainty estimates of the estimated regression coefficients with more computational flexibility the gwr technique is especially suitable for analyzing the spatial relationship between precipitation and its influencing factors such as longitude latitude elevation above sea level and so on lv and zhou 2016 zhou et al 2016 rather than using an optimization method to solve f p o p s we formulated a simple gwr model to estimate f p o p s directly by relating it to parameters such as elevation slope aspect surface roughness and distance to coastline defined as the straight line distance of a given location to the nearest coastline assuming that biases in the satellite observations of precipitation are mainly dependent on geographical topographical and meteorological characteristics following the typical gwr method brunsdon et al 1996 the biases estimated by the gwr method can be written as 2 f p o p s i b i a i 0 k 1 n a ik x ik ε i where b i is the bias i e difference between gauge data and downscaled satellite data of downscaled satellite precipitation at location or grid cell i a i 0 is the constant regression coefficient n is the number of explanatory variables elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline x ik is the kth explanatory variable at location i is the corresponding kth regression coefficient at location i and ε i is the random error following the typical estimation method fotheringham et al 1998 the regression coefficients at location or grid cell i are estimated as follows 3 a i x t w i x 1 x t w i b where a i is the n 1 vector of regression coefficients at location or grid cell i w i is a diagonal matrix m m of spatial weights obtained by the weighting functions quantifying the proximities of location i to its m neighboring gauge stations x is the variable matrix m n elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline and is the bias vector m 1 difference between gauge data and downscaled satellite data the regression coefficients for each 1 km grid cell can be determined using eq 3 once substituting these coefficients into eq 2 one can estimate the bias at each grid cell next we can produce the merged precipitation at 1 km by removing the bias from the 1 km downscaled satellite precipitation as a result the final fused product has hourly and 1 km resolutions by applying the above method one not only downscales satellite precipitation to finer spatial resolution but also realizes the fusion of gauge and satellite data to enhance data quality 2 1 2 mgwr based merging method the mgwr based merging method is similar to the above gwr based merging method the only difference is that the mgwr based method uses the mgwr method rather than the gwr method to model the spatial biases of the downscaled satellite precipitation mgwr is a generalized gwr method by introducing additional global variables such as wind speed to better represent the spatial variability of precipitation in the regression model mei et al 2004 zeng et al 2016 an mgwr regression equation can be written as 4 f p o p s i b i k 1 n 1 a ik x ik l 1 n 2 a ik x ik ε i where x ik the kth local geographical and topographical variable a ik the corresponding kth regression coefficient at location i x il is the lth global meteorological variable at location i and c l the corresponding regression coefficient in the mgwr model used in this study the local variables are elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline while the global variable is wind speed once the biases are derived using the above mgwr method one can gain the merged precipitation by removing the biases from the downscaled satellite precipitation data 2 1 3 spatial weighting functions solving the gwr and mgwr equations need first estimate the values of the spatial weights matrix shown in eq 3 using the weighting functions the weighting functions are often determined using threshold method inverse distance method gauss function method and bi square method brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 fotheringham et al 1998 threshold method th is the simplest method for determining the weights the weight w ij is determined by comparing the distance d ij between location j and the gauge station i with a certain distance threshold d brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 1998 5 w ij 1 d ij d 0 d ij d when d is equal to the maximum value of d ij all w ij values are equal to 1 when d is equal to the minimum value of d ij all w ij values are 0 therefore d is usually determined as a value between the minimum and maximum to obtain the coefficients the inverse distance method ids is based on the tobler s first law of geography klippel et al 2011 westlund 2013 i e a closer point having larger weight that is inversely related to the distance between the two points 6 w ij 1 d ij α where α is an empirical constant some researchers have proved that α is insensitive parameter varies between 1 and 3 and is usually set to 2 osborn et al 1979 in the gauss method gau w ij is computed as a function of d ij brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 1998 7 w ij exp d ij b 2 where b is a nonnegative decay parameter describing the relationship between weight and distance which can be determined based on the akaike information criterion fotheringham et al 2003b tu and xia 2008 to reduce computational cost the above defined gauss function can be replaced by a bi square bi function to generate continuous weight values and remove these points that are far away brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 8 w ij 1 d ij b 2 2 d ij b 0 d ij b to sum up we developed the above three step satellite gauge precipitation fusion approach which uses bilinear interpolation to downscale satellite precipitation and implements a geographically weighted regression coupled with a weighting function to merge the downscaled satellite precipitation with the gauge observations in this study we selected two geographically weighted regression methods namely gwr and mgwr and four weighting functions i e th dis gau and bi the combination of two regression methods and four weighting functions leads to eight merging algorithms gwr th gwr dis gwr gau gwr bi mgwr th mgwr dis mgwr gau and mgwr bi to find the best of the eight merging algorithms we first applied all eight algorithms at daily time step and compared their results finally we applied the best algorithm to produce an hourly merged precipitation data 2 2 validation given that there are a limited number of gauge stations and all gauge observations have been used in the merging algorithm we applied the cross validation method to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed precipitation data fusion methods in this study cross validation may be carried out using several methods including hold out leave one out cross validation loo cv leave p out lpo cv and v fold vfcv in this study loo cv is used the basic idea of loo cv is to take n 1 samples from the n samples for training a model and the remaining one for validating the model this step will be repeated n times until all data points are used for verification one advantage of this method is that all samples are used in the training model so it has the closest distribution of the original samples the statistical metrics used to quantify the accuracy of the merging algorithms include bias bias root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r bias and rmse measure mean error and accuracy of the merged results respectively while r characterizes the degree of fit between the merged and observed results 2 3 study area and data in this study we chose the ziwuhe basin as the case study area the ziwuhe river is a first order tributary of the han river a major tributary of the yangtze river it originates from the south side of the qinling mountains in shaanxi province and has a contributing area of 3028 km2 fig 2 the ziwuhe river has four large tributaries jiaoxi river pu river wenshui river and changan river the ziwuhe basin is located in the northern subtropical humid and semi humid zone with a mild climate and abundant precipitation due to the barrier effect of qinling mountains the warm humid air from the southern and southeastern areas in summer brings a large amount of water vapor leading to frequent disastrous weathers precipitation over the basin has strong seasonality summer rainfall accounts for 46 of the annual precipitation while the winter precipitation accounts for only 3 the average annual precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff of this basin are about 900 mm yr 500 mm yr and 400 mm yr respectively more than 70 of the basin area is covered by dense forest the rugged terrain is featured with steep brooks and streams favoring formation of floods there were only six rain gauges within the whole basin before 2011 in 2011 the chinese government began to invest in infrastructures for monitoring small and medium sized rivers and installed additional rain gauges currently 18 rain gauges are installed within the basin fig 2 in this study we chose the cmorph product as the source satellite precipitation data cmorph is a global precipitation data product developed by the climate prediction center cpc based on satellite microwave and infrared observations covering 60 n 60 s cmorph uses microwave data from the us defense meteorological satellite the united states ocean weather bureau and trmm microwave radiometer to estimate precipitation joyce et al 2004 cmorph uses two consecutive infrared images from the geostationary satellites to determine the cloud motion vector and to obtain the amount of precipitation in the absence of the microwave observation period currently cmorph offers two near real time products one with 30 min and 8 km 8 km resolutions i e the original data product and the other with 3 hourly and 0 25 0 25 resolutions a number of previous studies buarque et al 2011 shen et al 2010 zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 have compared the cmorph data with other satellite precipitation data such as trmm and noaa cpc and suggested that the cmorph data are overall more accurate than many other satellite precipitation data and have higher temporal and spatial resolutions yet even the 8 km cmorph product is not sufficient for hydrological modeling including flood forecasting of small and intermediate basins that requires precipitation data at 1 km resolution or finer chapiot 2014 zhang et al 2012 in this study we chose the 30 min 8 km cmorph data from january 2013 to december 2014 to be downscaled to 1 km and further merged with gauge observations in addition daily 10 meter wind speed data at 0 125 resolutions from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf are also used in this study the ecmwf wind speed data were further downscaled to 1 km through bilinear interpolation the topographic data of elevation slope aspect surface roughness and distance to the coastline at 1 km 1 km resolution are derived from the 90 m digital elevation map dem data provided by the us geological survey usgs available publicly the original 90 m dem data were aggregated to 1 km 1 km grids fig 3 the aspect across this basin ranges from 0 66 to 359 71 while the slope from 0 52 to 53 62 and surface roughness from 1 00 to 1 69 fig 3 the distance to coastline ranges from 950 km to 1050 km and the multi year mean wind speed from 2 3 m s to 4 7 m s fig 3 3 results based on the above geographical and meteorological variables we applied the gwr and mgwr satellite gauge merging algorithms to produce hourly and daily precipitation data to evaluate the effectiveness of the two geographical weighted regression methods gwr and mgwr and the four weighting functions we first carried out daily scale precipitation using the eight satellite gauge merging algorithms the combinations of two regression methods and four weighting functions cross validation was applied to evaluate the performance of these algorithms we then chose the best merging algorithm to produce an hourly 1 km merged precipitation product 3 1 evaluation of daily scale precipitation data fusion results the statistical results of cross validation are shown in fig 4 the mgwr algorithms unanimously have smaller biases 0 62 0 95 mm day than gwr 0 79 1 23 mm day fig 4a suggesting that the mgwr algorithms outperform the gwr counterparts this indicates that introducing additional global meteorological variable wind speed into the gwr model can substantially reduce the biases regarding the four weighting functions defined in eqs 5 8 the th function leads to the largest biases while the bi function has the smallest biases fig 4a the dis and gau functions have intermediate performance in terms of the bias metric as a result the mgwr bi algorithm i e the combination of mgwr and bi has the lowest bias and is likely the best algorithm out of the eight algorithms fig 4b shows the rmse values of the eight algorithms and all rmse values are less than 9 5 mm day in addition all mgwr algorithms have lower rmse values than their gwr counterparts fig 4b indicating that mgwr performs better than gwr the th results have the largest rmse values followed by the ids gau and bi results these results confirm the above finding that the mgwr bi algorithm has the best performance in regard to the correlation coefficient metric the fused precipitation data from all eight algorithms show reasonably high correlation with the observations indicated by r values higher than 0 75 fig 4c the r values shown in fig 4c also show that mgwr outperforms gwr and bi is better than the other three weighting methods we further compared daily precipitation series from the original cmorph product and eight merging algorithms with daily observations at station level to make the data comparable we first applied the bilinear interpolation to interpolate the 8 km gridded cmorph data to the point values cmorphd at the 18 stations the daily cmorphd data have relatively poor quality indicated by an r value of 0 23 a bias of 1 685 mm day and an rmse of 10 647 mm day fig 5 a once the gwr and mgwr merging methods are applied all statistical metrics of the merged precipitation are largely improved fig 5b i once again the fused results using the mgwr methods fig 5f i are clearly better than those of the gwr methods fig 5b e in summary the mgwr algorithms are unanimously better than their gwr counterparts and the bi weighting method has better results than the other three weighting methods as a result the mgwr bi algorithm has achieved the best result to show how the mgwr bi merging algorithm improve the spatial patterns of the precipitation data we also calculated the statistical metrics of the daily downscaled cmorph data and the mgwr bi results relative to the observations at the 18 stations as shown in fig 6 the improvement introduced by the mgwr bi algorithm occurs in every station both rmse and r in the mgwr bi results have been substantially enhanced relative to the downscaled cmorph data more importantly the values of these statistical metrics of the mgwr bi results are spatially homogenous fig 6 indicating that the improvement introduced by mgwr bi is not limited to specific locations but basin wide 3 2 evaluation of hourly scale precipitation data fusion results since the above evaluation of daily scale precipitation data fusion results shows that the mgwr bi algorithm has the best performance the following analysis of hourly scale precipitation data fusion results is only focused on the mgwr bi results the mgwr bi algorithm was applied to merge the hourly cmorph data with the observations from april 2013 to december 2014 we adopted the same cross validation procedure to quantify the performance of the mgwr bi algorithm fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of the original hourly cmorph precipitation interpolated to point level using bilinear interpolation against the gauge observations clearly there is considerable uncertainty in the original satellite data indicated by the relative poor values of r 0 208 bias 0 021 mm hr and rmse 1 208 mm hr once the mgwr bi merging algorithm is applied all these statistics r 0 724 bias 0 012 mm hr and rmse 0 706 mm hr are substantially improved fig 7b we further summarized the degree of fit of the hourly merged precipitation for each month in table 1 all r values are greater than 0 5 while all biases fall between 0 012 and 1 529 mm month and all rmse values are less than 4 9 mm month the above cross validation results confirm the effectiveness of the mgwr bi merging algorithm we further computed the biases rmse values and r values of the downscaled hourly cmorph precipitation cmorphd and the hourly fused precipitation using the mgwr bi method and derived the distributions of these statistical metrics fig 8 a shows that the bias spread of the mgwr bi results is much narrower than that of the cmorphd data in addition the mean bias 0 44 mm hr of the mgwr bi results is also smaller than that of the cmorphd data 1 20 mm hr similar to the above results the rmse values of the mgwr bi results also have a narrower spread and a lower mean than those of the cmorphd results fig 8b the mgwr bi results have much higher r values than the cmorphd results fig 8c all r values of the mgwr bi results are greater than 0 5 the minimum r value of the mgwr bi results is even larger than the maximum r value of the cmorphd results the statistical metrics of the hourly cmorphd data and the mgwr bi results relative to the observations at the 18 stations are shown in fig 9 the improvement of the spatial patterns introduced by the mgwr bi algorithm occurs in every station three statistical metrics in the mgwr bi results have been improved relative to the hourly cmorphd data fig 9 in summary the application of the mgwr bi merging algorithm has significantly improved the quality and accuracy of the precipitation data all the above results clearly prove the effectiveness of the mgwr bi method which is useful for producing better daily and hourly precipitation data 3 3 evaluation of spatial patterns and seasonality in this section we further analyzed the spatial distributions of seasonal and hourly precipitation and compared these results from the original cmorph data observations and merged data we also calculated the regional average precipitations from the three datasets both cmorph and merged data are gridded products and can be directly averaged to compute the areal precipitation for the gauge data we applied the thiessen polygon method to calculate the areal precipitation 3 3 1 comparison of seasonal precipitation fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of seasonal average precipitation from the original cmorph data gauge observations of 18 stations and merged precipitation data using the mgwr bi algorithm it is clear that the original cmorph data have a coarse spatial resolution and lack spatial variability fig 10a d g and j overall seasonal variability shown in the original cmorph precipitation is consistent with the gauge observations summer has the largest amount of precipitation followed by autumn and spring while winter has the least precipitation however due to the limitation of spatial resolution the cmorph data cannot well represent the within the basin variability in contrast the observations show obvious spatial variability especially during summer spring and autumn fig 10b e and h similar to the observations the fused precipitation shows more detailed seasonal and spatial variability and substantial spatial variability in the spring summer and autumn fig 10c f and i it is worth noting that winter precipitations in the cmorph observed and merged data sets have low values and small spatial variability fig 10j k and l after summing up the whole basin regional average precipitations from gauge observation and merged data blue and red bars in fig 11 respectively are very similar in terms of seasonal variability and magnitude fig 11 the regional average precipitation from the merged data is slightly higher than the observation based precipitation in summer autumn and winter fig 11 according to the gauge based areal precipitation data about 80 of annual precipitation in the ziwuhe basin occurs in summer and autumn while only 2 in winter fig 11 similarly about 80 9 of the merged annual precipitation occurs in summer and autumn while only 16 3 and 2 8 in spring and winter respectively fig 11 there are substantially larger biases in the original cmorph data than the mgwr bi data by comparing with the gauge based areal precipitation data fig 11 the largest biases of the cmorph data happen in summer and autumn 74 58 and 156 64 mm respectively clearly the fused precipitation is consistent with gauge observations confirming the effectiveness and reliability of the developed merging method 3 3 2 comparison of event scale precipitation finally we compared the original cmorph and fused hourly precipitation data during the largest rainfall storm event i e the july 22 2013 rainfall storm from april 2013 to december 2014 typically a rainfall storm is characterized by five stages the initial rising peak decline and ending stages fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall for the july 22 2013 storm which is the largest rainfall storm in 2013 in terms of the amount of daily rainfall this storm started at 2 am of the day 2013072202 entered the second stage at 7 am 2013072207 peaked at 9 am 2013072209 and stopped at 9 pm 2013072221 fig 12 by comparing the original cmorph data and merged data with the gauge observations the merged data clearly provide better spatial resolution and more details in particular it well presents the spatial variation of this rainfall storm fig 12 which is critical for hydrological simulations using the distributed hydrological models fig 13 shows the time course of regional average precipitations derived from gauge observations cmorph and the merged results for the july 22 2013 event the areal precipitation derived from station observations has a slightly asymmetric bell shape with a peak around 9 am however the cmorph data shows large difference relative to the observation based areal precipitation the rainfall peak of the cmorph data is two hours later than the observation based result in contrast the fused results show good agreement with the observation based results and well capture the timing of rainfall peak these results further confirm that the effectiveness of this fusion method and its capability of generating reliable event scale precipitation data 4 discussion although the above results have demonstrated the effectiveness and validity of the precipitation data fusion methods used in this study these methods can be further improved in the following studies first the mgwr methods use global and local explanatory variables to model the response variable which is the bias in this study the selection of explanatory variables can impact the accuracy of the mgwr methods more studies on how to choose the best set of explanatory variables should be carried out second as demonstrated in our results the selection of weighting function is also critical for the performance of the mgwr method fig 4 for example the threshold weighting method is a simple method but causes discontinuous values either 0 or 1 the inverse distance ids method can produce continuous weights but may provide overestimated weights to these nearby stations the gauss function gau is a continuous monotonic decreasing function and overcomes the shortcomings of the above two methods however this method is computationally inefficient the bi square function bi is continuous and easy to implement our results also show that it has the best result than the other three weighting functions figs 4 and 5 in this study we only compared the four weighting functions in theory more weighting methods can be developed or adopted the accuracy of merged precipitation is also related to many other factors such as the density of surface rain stations the accuracy of satellite source data and the merging algorithms currently detailed studies on the above topic are still not enough qingfang et al 2013 li et al 2015 has shown that increase of gauge network density can help improve the quality of fused products however what is the optimal gauge network density for achieving the best merged results remains unknown although a study on the topic was carried out in chile yang et al 2017 this type of study will be valuable for the design of rain gauge network layout in ungauged basins precipitation fusion is an effective tool for producing improved precipitation data by combining gauge and satellite observations especially for the regions with sparse gauges previous studies have developed or applied the other precipitation data fusion methods to merge gauge data with satellite precipitation products beck et al 2017 rozante et al 2010 shen et al 2014 xie and xiong 2011 it will be valuable to compare the applicability and effectiveness of these fusion methods in the following studies furthermore introducing multi source satellite reanalysis or model products into the precipitation fusion can potentially help improve the quality of the fused product 5 conclusions in this study we successfully applied the bilinear interpolation method geographically weighted regression methods and spatial weighting functions to develop eight precipitation merging algorithms gwr th gwr ids gwr gau gwr bi mgwr th mgwr ids mgwr gau mgwr bi these merging algorithms can achieve the downscaling of satellite precipitation and data fusion between satellite data and gauge observations at the same time both local geographical and topographical factors and global variables meteorological factor were considered for precipitation downscaling and data fusion fig 3 the mgwr methods show better results than the gwr methods figs 4 and 5 the bi function gains the best fusion results among the four weighting functions figs 4 and 5 therefore the mgwr bi algorithm is proved to be the best among the eight algorithms fig 5 the mgwr bi algorithm can substantially improve the spatial resolution of the precipitation data and capture the spatial variability of precipitation represented by the gauge observations fig 6 the improvement is especially obvious in summer when rainfall peaks during a year fig 10 by applying the mgwr bi algorithm on the hourly scale we were able to produce a precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h fig 12 which is valuable for hydrological simulations and other applications our results clearly demonstrate the merit of a precipitation data fusion method that can both downscale satellite qpe to finer spatial resolution and correct their biases by merging with ground observations figs 10 and 12 our results also show that downscaling has a strong influence on gaining the spatial variability of precipitation by introducing the local and global geographical topographic and meteorological variables one can merge the satellite products with gauge observations to achieve finer resolution and better quality products further studies on the selection of local explanatory and the relative advantages disadvantages relative to the other precipitation merging method are also valuable this research provides an important reference for improving capacity of regional precipitation monitoring and estimation it also can play a positive role in promoting the application of

introduction hydrological modeling and forecasting is a critical tool for flood disaster preparedness and mitigation precipitation is the most important meteorological input to hydrological models for flood forecasting bhattacharya et al 2013 langella et al 2010 li and shao 2010 li and zhang 2008 yao et al 2014 zhang k et al 2016 however precipitation data is also a main source of uncertainties for flood forecasting due to the limitations of the existing precipitation observing and estimating methods alfieri et al 2014 renard et al 2010 previous studies suggest that 70 80 of the uncertainty of hydrological modeling is due to the uncertainty of precipitation data gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 accurate precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions are highly desirable for hydrological modeling and flood forecasting precipitation data can be obtained from gauge network satellite quantitative precipitation estimation qpe radar qpe and model forecast or reanalysis precipitation products gauge observations usually have limited coverage and station density in practice gauge measured precipitation at one station is usually used to represent precipitation of a region with a size of tens to hundreds square kilometers especially in the remote areas as actual precipitation has significant spatial variability using point value to represent areal value can be inaccurate and lose some spatial variability beesley et al 2009 hughes 2006 renard et al 2010 weather radar can provide precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions qi et al 2013 zhang j et al 2016 but quality of radar qpe can be heavily impacted by complex terrains qi et al 2014 qi et al 2016 with the development of satellite remote sensing technology precipitation can be observed from space with regional and global coverage and acceptable spatiotemporal resolutions hong et al 2004 hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 satellite precipitation data can provide three dimensional profile of precipitation and produce qpe over land and sea chiu et al 2006 the global precipitation measurement gpm program extends spatial coverage to the arctic circle and more accurately captures trace precipitation 0 5 mm hr and solid precipitation smith et al 2007 however as an indirect measurement of precipitation the accuracy of satellite qpe has large uncertainties and poor performance at high latitudes especially for snowfall karbalaee et al 2017 shen et al 2010 wu and zhai 2012 merging multi source satellite precipitation data and blending satellite precipitation with gauge data have become a popular approach for improving quality of precipitation products beck et al 2017 park et al 2017 qi and zhang 2013 xie and xiong 2011 zhang et al 2014 data fusion a term coined in the 1970s has experienced a fast development since the 1980s waltz and llinas 1990 its classic definition is the use of an algorithm to fuse a variety of information into a high quality information pohl and genderen 1998 the data fusion method has been applied since the 1990s mainly in image processing and battlefield information synthesis sun et al 2015 currently data fusion method is widely used in remote sensing image processing multi sensor fusion automatic device monitoring medical diagnosis robotics intelligent detection system environmental test and resource survey among others castanedo 2013 in the recent years data fusion methods have been introduced to fuse multi source precipitation data to improve their quality krajewski 2013 precipitation data fusion or precipitation merging methods are based on a number of mathematical techniques including optimal interpolation shen et al 2014 kalman filter shi et al 2016 ushio et al 2009 bayesian estimation hill 2015 ma et al 2017a ma et al 2018 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 minimum error estimation mckee and binns 2016 wavelet transform analysis pradhan et al 2016 objective statistical analysis mckee and binns 2016 variation approach li et al 2015 and neural network analysis long et al 2016 the national meteorological information center of china utilized the original probability density function optimal interpolation orig pdf oi algorithm to merge satellite precipitation and station observed precipitation and produce a merged precipitation product at hourly and 0 1 resolutions across china shen et al 2014 beck et al 2017 merged seven satellite based precipitation datasets into a global precipitation dataset data fusion methods are also used to merge multiple radar qpe products to produce more accurate qpe rafieeinasab et al 2015 precipitation data fusion is usually a process to merge several precipitation products into one product or to improve qpe quality using gauge observations previous precipitation merging algorithms usually do not involve in downscaling of precipitation enhancing spatial resolution of precipitation products is also important for hydrological modeling and other applications as precipitation especially orographic precipitation usually varies with altitude many studies use the relationship between spatial variables e g elevation and precipitation to interpolate or downscale precipitation over a large region sobie and murdock 2017 for example marquinez et al 2003 successfully used the sub basin average slope and altitude to significantly improve the accuracy of precipitation simulation many researchers have attempted to downscale precipitation by adding additional terrain variables such as latitude longitude elevation slope and aspect chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 ninyerola et al 2015 wotling et al 2000 one mathematical tool used in spatial interpolation or downscaling spatial variables is the geographically weighted regression gwr gwr is a spatial statistical method developed by brunsdon brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 kamarianakis et al 2008 for dealing with data having spatial non stationarity which is defined as being alterations in relationships between variables from one point to another fotheringham et al 2003a fotheringham et al 2003b kara et al 2016 propastin et al 2008 xu et al 2015 recently gwr has been used to analyze spatial characteristics and non stationarity of hydrological and ecological processes such as precipitation and vegetation productivity fang et al 2017 lloyd 2010 wang et al 2012 zhang t et al 2016 brunsdon et al 2002 applied gwr to analyze spatial variability of precipitation and investigate the relationship between elevation and precipitation gwr model has also been used in geography gao et al 2012 economics liu et al 2016 meteorology li and meng 2017 and epidemiology tsai and teng 2016 in this study we aim to develop a method to merge satellite precipitation and station observations to correct biases in satellite precipitation data and downscale satellite precipitation to a finer spatial resolution at the same time to this end we adopted gwr and mixed geographically weighted regression mgwr to estimate biases in the downscaled satellite precipitation data using bilinear interpolation and correct these biases to produce a satellite gauge merged precipitation product with improved spatial resolution and quality in this way satellite precipitation and gauge data are effectively merged 2 methods and data 2 1 the satellite gauge precipitation merging methods similar to the typical two source i e estimation and observation precipitation merging method the merged precipitation p f is a function of the satellite precipitation data p s and the observed value p o 1 p f p s f p o p s essentially f p o p s represents biases to be corrected in the original satellite precipitation data and is usually solved through certain mathematical optimization methods in this study we developed a three step satellite gauge precipitation merging approach following the above logic first we applied the bilinear interpolation to downscale coarser satellite precipitation data p c with a spatial resolution of 8 km in this study to a finer resolution p s with a spatial resolution of 1 km in this study then we used the gwr and mgwr models to estimate the values of f p o p s i e biases of the downscaled precipitation finally we removed the derived biases from the downscaled satellite precipitation to produce a final downscaled merged precipitation data using eq 1 to realize the precipitation data fusion the above method need be applied at each time step fig 1 more details on how to formulate the gwr and mgwr based merging methods are provided below 2 1 1 gwr based merging method the general idea of gwr is that the relationships between variables change with locations a gwr equation is established by estimating the regression coefficients at each location brunsdon et al 2002 kumari et al 2017 leong and yue 2017 gwr improves and generalizes the traditional multiple linear regression analysis by directly describing and explaining the quantitative relationships between spatial variables and providing uncertainty estimates of the estimated regression coefficients with more computational flexibility the gwr technique is especially suitable for analyzing the spatial relationship between precipitation and its influencing factors such as longitude latitude elevation above sea level and so on lv and zhou 2016 zhou et al 2016 rather than using an optimization method to solve f p o p s we formulated a simple gwr model to estimate f p o p s directly by relating it to parameters such as elevation slope aspect surface roughness and distance to coastline defined as the straight line distance of a given location to the nearest coastline assuming that biases in the satellite observations of precipitation are mainly dependent on geographical topographical and meteorological characteristics following the typical gwr method brunsdon et al 1996 the biases estimated by the gwr method can be written as 2 f p o p s i b i a i 0 k 1 n a ik x ik ε i where b i is the bias i e difference between gauge data and downscaled satellite data of downscaled satellite precipitation at location or grid cell i a i 0 is the constant regression coefficient n is the number of explanatory variables elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline x ik is the kth explanatory variable at location i is the corresponding kth regression coefficient at location i and ε i is the random error following the typical estimation method fotheringham et al 1998 the regression coefficients at location or grid cell i are estimated as follows 3 a i x t w i x 1 x t w i b where a i is the n 1 vector of regression coefficients at location or grid cell i w i is a diagonal matrix m m of spatial weights obtained by the weighting functions quantifying the proximities of location i to its m neighboring gauge stations x is the variable matrix m n elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline and is the bias vector m 1 difference between gauge data and downscaled satellite data the regression coefficients for each 1 km grid cell can be determined using eq 3 once substituting these coefficients into eq 2 one can estimate the bias at each grid cell next we can produce the merged precipitation at 1 km by removing the bias from the 1 km downscaled satellite precipitation as a result the final fused product has hourly and 1 km resolutions by applying the above method one not only downscales satellite precipitation to finer spatial resolution but also realizes the fusion of gauge and satellite data to enhance data quality 2 1 2 mgwr based merging method the mgwr based merging method is similar to the above gwr based merging method the only difference is that the mgwr based method uses the mgwr method rather than the gwr method to model the spatial biases of the downscaled satellite precipitation mgwr is a generalized gwr method by introducing additional global variables such as wind speed to better represent the spatial variability of precipitation in the regression model mei et al 2004 zeng et al 2016 an mgwr regression equation can be written as 4 f p o p s i b i k 1 n 1 a ik x ik l 1 n 2 a ik x ik ε i where x ik the kth local geographical and topographical variable a ik the corresponding kth regression coefficient at location i x il is the lth global meteorological variable at location i and c l the corresponding regression coefficient in the mgwr model used in this study the local variables are elevation aspect slope surface roughness and distance to the coastline while the global variable is wind speed once the biases are derived using the above mgwr method one can gain the merged precipitation by removing the biases from the downscaled satellite precipitation data 2 1 3 spatial weighting functions solving the gwr and mgwr equations need first estimate the values of the spatial weights matrix shown in eq 3 using the weighting functions the weighting functions are often determined using threshold method inverse distance method gauss function method and bi square method brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 fotheringham et al 1998 threshold method th is the simplest method for determining the weights the weight w ij is determined by comparing the distance d ij between location j and the gauge station i with a certain distance threshold d brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 1998 5 w ij 1 d ij d 0 d ij d when d is equal to the maximum value of d ij all w ij values are equal to 1 when d is equal to the minimum value of d ij all w ij values are 0 therefore d is usually determined as a value between the minimum and maximum to obtain the coefficients the inverse distance method ids is based on the tobler s first law of geography klippel et al 2011 westlund 2013 i e a closer point having larger weight that is inversely related to the distance between the two points 6 w ij 1 d ij α where α is an empirical constant some researchers have proved that α is insensitive parameter varies between 1 and 3 and is usually set to 2 osborn et al 1979 in the gauss method gau w ij is computed as a function of d ij brunsdon et al 1999 brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 1998 7 w ij exp d ij b 2 where b is a nonnegative decay parameter describing the relationship between weight and distance which can be determined based on the akaike information criterion fotheringham et al 2003b tu and xia 2008 to reduce computational cost the above defined gauss function can be replaced by a bi square bi function to generate continuous weight values and remove these points that are far away brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 1998 8 w ij 1 d ij b 2 2 d ij b 0 d ij b to sum up we developed the above three step satellite gauge precipitation fusion approach which uses bilinear interpolation to downscale satellite precipitation and implements a geographically weighted regression coupled with a weighting function to merge the downscaled satellite precipitation with the gauge observations in this study we selected two geographically weighted regression methods namely gwr and mgwr and four weighting functions i e th dis gau and bi the combination of two regression methods and four weighting functions leads to eight merging algorithms gwr th gwr dis gwr gau gwr bi mgwr th mgwr dis mgwr gau and mgwr bi to find the best of the eight merging algorithms we first applied all eight algorithms at daily time step and compared their results finally we applied the best algorithm to produce an hourly merged precipitation data 2 2 validation given that there are a limited number of gauge stations and all gauge observations have been used in the merging algorithm we applied the cross validation method to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed precipitation data fusion methods in this study cross validation may be carried out using several methods including hold out leave one out cross validation loo cv leave p out lpo cv and v fold vfcv in this study loo cv is used the basic idea of loo cv is to take n 1 samples from the n samples for training a model and the remaining one for validating the model this step will be repeated n times until all data points are used for verification one advantage of this method is that all samples are used in the training model so it has the closest distribution of the original samples the statistical metrics used to quantify the accuracy of the merging algorithms include bias bias root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r bias and rmse measure mean error and accuracy of the merged results respectively while r characterizes the degree of fit between the merged and observed results 2 3 study area and data in this study we chose the ziwuhe basin as the case study area the ziwuhe river is a first order tributary of the han river a major tributary of the yangtze river it originates from the south side of the qinling mountains in shaanxi province and has a contributing area of 3028 km2 fig 2 the ziwuhe river has four large tributaries jiaoxi river pu river wenshui river and changan river the ziwuhe basin is located in the northern subtropical humid and semi humid zone with a mild climate and abundant precipitation due to the barrier effect of qinling mountains the warm humid air from the southern and southeastern areas in summer brings a large amount of water vapor leading to frequent disastrous weathers precipitation over the basin has strong seasonality summer rainfall accounts for 46 of the annual precipitation while the winter precipitation accounts for only 3 the average annual precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff of this basin are about 900 mm yr 500 mm yr and 400 mm yr respectively more than 70 of the basin area is covered by dense forest the rugged terrain is featured with steep brooks and streams favoring formation of floods there were only six rain gauges within the whole basin before 2011 in 2011 the chinese government began to invest in infrastructures for monitoring small and medium sized rivers and installed additional rain gauges currently 18 rain gauges are installed within the basin fig 2 in this study we chose the cmorph product as the source satellite precipitation data cmorph is a global precipitation data product developed by the climate prediction center cpc based on satellite microwave and infrared observations covering 60 n 60 s cmorph uses microwave data from the us defense meteorological satellite the united states ocean weather bureau and trmm microwave radiometer to estimate precipitation joyce et al 2004 cmorph uses two consecutive infrared images from the geostationary satellites to determine the cloud motion vector and to obtain the amount of precipitation in the absence of the microwave observation period currently cmorph offers two near real time products one with 30 min and 8 km 8 km resolutions i e the original data product and the other with 3 hourly and 0 25 0 25 resolutions a number of previous studies buarque et al 2011 shen et al 2010 zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 have compared the cmorph data with other satellite precipitation data such as trmm and noaa cpc and suggested that the cmorph data are overall more accurate than many other satellite precipitation data and have higher temporal and spatial resolutions yet even the 8 km cmorph product is not sufficient for hydrological modeling including flood forecasting of small and intermediate basins that requires precipitation data at 1 km resolution or finer chapiot 2014 zhang et al 2012 in this study we chose the 30 min 8 km cmorph data from january 2013 to december 2014 to be downscaled to 1 km and further merged with gauge observations in addition daily 10 meter wind speed data at 0 125 resolutions from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf are also used in this study the ecmwf wind speed data were further downscaled to 1 km through bilinear interpolation the topographic data of elevation slope aspect surface roughness and distance to the coastline at 1 km 1 km resolution are derived from the 90 m digital elevation map dem data provided by the us geological survey usgs available publicly the original 90 m dem data were aggregated to 1 km 1 km grids fig 3 the aspect across this basin ranges from 0 66 to 359 71 while the slope from 0 52 to 53 62 and surface roughness from 1 00 to 1 69 fig 3 the distance to coastline ranges from 950 km to 1050 km and the multi year mean wind speed from 2 3 m s to 4 7 m s fig 3 3 results based on the above geographical and meteorological variables we applied the gwr and mgwr satellite gauge merging algorithms to produce hourly and daily precipitation data to evaluate the effectiveness of the two geographical weighted regression methods gwr and mgwr and the four weighting functions we first carried out daily scale precipitation using the eight satellite gauge merging algorithms the combinations of two regression methods and four weighting functions cross validation was applied to evaluate the performance of these algorithms we then chose the best merging algorithm to produce an hourly 1 km merged precipitation product 3 1 evaluation of daily scale precipitation data fusion results the statistical results of cross validation are shown in fig 4 the mgwr algorithms unanimously have smaller biases 0 62 0 95 mm day than gwr 0 79 1 23 mm day fig 4a suggesting that the mgwr algorithms outperform the gwr counterparts this indicates that introducing additional global meteorological variable wind speed into the gwr model can substantially reduce the biases regarding the four weighting functions defined in eqs 5 8 the th function leads to the largest biases while the bi function has the smallest biases fig 4a the dis and gau functions have intermediate performance in terms of the bias metric as a result the mgwr bi algorithm i e the combination of mgwr and bi has the lowest bias and is likely the best algorithm out of the eight algorithms fig 4b shows the rmse values of the eight algorithms and all rmse values are less than 9 5 mm day in addition all mgwr algorithms have lower rmse values than their gwr counterparts fig 4b indicating that mgwr performs better than gwr the th results have the largest rmse values followed by the ids gau and bi results these results confirm the above finding that the mgwr bi algorithm has the best performance in regard to the correlation coefficient metric the fused precipitation data from all eight algorithms show reasonably high correlation with the observations indicated by r values higher than 0 75 fig 4c the r values shown in fig 4c also show that mgwr outperforms gwr and bi is better than the other three weighting methods we further compared daily precipitation series from the original cmorph product and eight merging algorithms with daily observations at station level to make the data comparable we first applied the bilinear interpolation to interpolate the 8 km gridded cmorph data to the point values cmorphd at the 18 stations the daily cmorphd data have relatively poor quality indicated by an r value of 0 23 a bias of 1 685 mm day and an rmse of 10 647 mm day fig 5 a once the gwr and mgwr merging methods are applied all statistical metrics of the merged precipitation are largely improved fig 5b i once again the fused results using the mgwr methods fig 5f i are clearly better than those of the gwr methods fig 5b e in summary the mgwr algorithms are unanimously better than their gwr counterparts and the bi weighting method has better results than the other three weighting methods as a result the mgwr bi algorithm has achieved the best result to show how the mgwr bi merging algorithm improve the spatial patterns of the precipitation data we also calculated the statistical metrics of the daily downscaled cmorph data and the mgwr bi results relative to the observations at the 18 stations as shown in fig 6 the improvement introduced by the mgwr bi algorithm occurs in every station both rmse and r in the mgwr bi results have been substantially enhanced relative to the downscaled cmorph data more importantly the values of these statistical metrics of the mgwr bi results are spatially homogenous fig 6 indicating that the improvement introduced by mgwr bi is not limited to specific locations but basin wide 3 2 evaluation of hourly scale precipitation data fusion results since the above evaluation of daily scale precipitation data fusion results shows that the mgwr bi algorithm has the best performance the following analysis of hourly scale precipitation data fusion results is only focused on the mgwr bi results the mgwr bi algorithm was applied to merge the hourly cmorph data with the observations from april 2013 to december 2014 we adopted the same cross validation procedure to quantify the performance of the mgwr bi algorithm fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of the original hourly cmorph precipitation interpolated to point level using bilinear interpolation against the gauge observations clearly there is considerable uncertainty in the original satellite data indicated by the relative poor values of r 0 208 bias 0 021 mm hr and rmse 1 208 mm hr once the mgwr bi merging algorithm is applied all these statistics r 0 724 bias 0 012 mm hr and rmse 0 706 mm hr are substantially improved fig 7b we further summarized the degree of fit of the hourly merged precipitation for each month in table 1 all r values are greater than 0 5 while all biases fall between 0 012 and 1 529 mm month and all rmse values are less than 4 9 mm month the above cross validation results confirm the effectiveness of the mgwr bi merging algorithm we further computed the biases rmse values and r values of the downscaled hourly cmorph precipitation cmorphd and the hourly fused precipitation using the mgwr bi method and derived the distributions of these statistical metrics fig 8 a shows that the bias spread of the mgwr bi results is much narrower than that of the cmorphd data in addition the mean bias 0 44 mm hr of the mgwr bi results is also smaller than that of the cmorphd data 1 20 mm hr similar to the above results the rmse values of the mgwr bi results also have a narrower spread and a lower mean than those of the cmorphd results fig 8b the mgwr bi results have much higher r values than the cmorphd results fig 8c all r values of the mgwr bi results are greater than 0 5 the minimum r value of the mgwr bi results is even larger than the maximum r value of the cmorphd results the statistical metrics of the hourly cmorphd data and the mgwr bi results relative to the observations at the 18 stations are shown in fig 9 the improvement of the spatial patterns introduced by the mgwr bi algorithm occurs in every station three statistical metrics in the mgwr bi results have been improved relative to the hourly cmorphd data fig 9 in summary the application of the mgwr bi merging algorithm has significantly improved the quality and accuracy of the precipitation data all the above results clearly prove the effectiveness of the mgwr bi method which is useful for producing better daily and hourly precipitation data 3 3 evaluation of spatial patterns and seasonality in this section we further analyzed the spatial distributions of seasonal and hourly precipitation and compared these results from the original cmorph data observations and merged data we also calculated the regional average precipitations from the three datasets both cmorph and merged data are gridded products and can be directly averaged to compute the areal precipitation for the gauge data we applied the thiessen polygon method to calculate the areal precipitation 3 3 1 comparison of seasonal precipitation fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of seasonal average precipitation from the original cmorph data gauge observations of 18 stations and merged precipitation data using the mgwr bi algorithm it is clear that the original cmorph data have a coarse spatial resolution and lack spatial variability fig 10a d g and j overall seasonal variability shown in the original cmorph precipitation is consistent with the gauge observations summer has the largest amount of precipitation followed by autumn and spring while winter has the least precipitation however due to the limitation of spatial resolution the cmorph data cannot well represent the within the basin variability in contrast the observations show obvious spatial variability especially during summer spring and autumn fig 10b e and h similar to the observations the fused precipitation shows more detailed seasonal and spatial variability and substantial spatial variability in the spring summer and autumn fig 10c f and i it is worth noting that winter precipitations in the cmorph observed and merged data sets have low values and small spatial variability fig 10j k and l after summing up the whole basin regional average precipitations from gauge observation and merged data blue and red bars in fig 11 respectively are very similar in terms of seasonal variability and magnitude fig 11 the regional average precipitation from the merged data is slightly higher than the observation based precipitation in summer autumn and winter fig 11 according to the gauge based areal precipitation data about 80 of annual precipitation in the ziwuhe basin occurs in summer and autumn while only 2 in winter fig 11 similarly about 80 9 of the merged annual precipitation occurs in summer and autumn while only 16 3 and 2 8 in spring and winter respectively fig 11 there are substantially larger biases in the original cmorph data than the mgwr bi data by comparing with the gauge based areal precipitation data fig 11 the largest biases of the cmorph data happen in summer and autumn 74 58 and 156 64 mm respectively clearly the fused precipitation is consistent with gauge observations confirming the effectiveness and reliability of the developed merging method 3 3 2 comparison of event scale precipitation finally we compared the original cmorph and fused hourly precipitation data during the largest rainfall storm event i e the july 22 2013 rainfall storm from april 2013 to december 2014 typically a rainfall storm is characterized by five stages the initial rising peak decline and ending stages fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall for the july 22 2013 storm which is the largest rainfall storm in 2013 in terms of the amount of daily rainfall this storm started at 2 am of the day 2013072202 entered the second stage at 7 am 2013072207 peaked at 9 am 2013072209 and stopped at 9 pm 2013072221 fig 12 by comparing the original cmorph data and merged data with the gauge observations the merged data clearly provide better spatial resolution and more details in particular it well presents the spatial variation of this rainfall storm fig 12 which is critical for hydrological simulations using the distributed hydrological models fig 13 shows the time course of regional average precipitations derived from gauge observations cmorph and the merged results for the july 22 2013 event the areal precipitation derived from station observations has a slightly asymmetric bell shape with a peak around 9 am however the cmorph data shows large difference relative to the observation based areal precipitation the rainfall peak of the cmorph data is two hours later than the observation based result in contrast the fused results show good agreement with the observation based results and well capture the timing of rainfall peak these results further confirm that the effectiveness of this fusion method and its capability of generating reliable event scale precipitation data 4 discussion although the above results have demonstrated the effectiveness and validity of the precipitation data fusion methods used in this study these methods can be further improved in the following studies first the mgwr methods use global and local explanatory variables to model the response variable which is the bias in this study the selection of explanatory variables can impact the accuracy of the mgwr methods more studies on how to choose the best set of explanatory variables should be carried out second as demonstrated in our results the selection of weighting function is also critical for the performance of the mgwr method fig 4 for example the threshold weighting method is a simple method but causes discontinuous values either 0 or 1 the inverse distance ids method can produce continuous weights but may provide overestimated weights to these nearby stations the gauss function gau is a continuous monotonic decreasing function and overcomes the shortcomings of the above two methods however this method is computationally inefficient the bi square function bi is continuous and easy to implement our results also show that it has the best result than the other three weighting functions figs 4 and 5 in this study we only compared the four weighting functions in theory more weighting methods can be developed or adopted the accuracy of merged precipitation is also related to many other factors such as the density of surface rain stations the accuracy of satellite source data and the merging algorithms currently detailed studies on the above topic are still not enough qingfang et al 2013 li et al 2015 has shown that increase of gauge network density can help improve the quality of fused products however what is the optimal gauge network density for achieving the best merged results remains unknown although a study on the topic was carried out in chile yang et al 2017 this type of study will be valuable for the design of rain gauge network layout in ungauged basins precipitation fusion is an effective tool for producing improved precipitation data by combining gauge and satellite observations especially for the regions with sparse gauges previous studies have developed or applied the other precipitation data fusion methods to merge gauge data with satellite precipitation products beck et al 2017 rozante et al 2010 shen et al 2014 xie and xiong 2011 it will be valuable to compare the applicability and effectiveness of these fusion methods in the following studies furthermore introducing multi source satellite reanalysis or model products into the precipitation fusion can potentially help improve the quality of the fused product 5 conclusions in this study we successfully applied the bilinear interpolation method geographically weighted regression methods and spatial weighting functions to develop eight precipitation merging algorithms gwr th gwr ids gwr gau gwr bi mgwr th mgwr ids mgwr gau mgwr bi these merging algorithms can achieve the downscaling of satellite precipitation and data fusion between satellite data and gauge observations at the same time both local geographical and topographical factors and global variables meteorological factor were considered for precipitation downscaling and data fusion fig 3 the mgwr methods show better results than the gwr methods figs 4 and 5 the bi function gains the best fusion results among the four weighting functions figs 4 and 5 therefore the mgwr bi algorithm is proved to be the best among the eight algorithms fig 5 the mgwr bi algorithm can substantially improve the spatial resolution of the precipitation data and capture the spatial variability of precipitation represented by the gauge observations fig 6 the improvement is especially obvious in summer when rainfall peaks during a year fig 10 by applying the mgwr bi algorithm on the hourly scale we were able to produce a precipitation dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h fig 12 which is valuable for hydrological simulations and other applications our results clearly demonstrate the merit of a precipitation data fusion method that can both downscale satellite qpe to finer spatial resolution and correct their biases by merging with ground observations figs 10 and 12 our results also show that downscaling has a strong influence on gaining the spatial variability of precipitation by introducing the local and global geographical topographic and meteorological variables one can merge the satellite products with gauge observations to achieve finer resolution and better quality products further studies on the selection of local explanatory and the relative advantages disadvantages relative to the other precipitation merging method are also valuable this research provides an important reference for improving capacity of regional precipitation monitoring and estimation it also can play a positive role in promoting the application of remote sensing and gauge precipitation data fusion in hydrology and water resources enref 34 acknowledgments this study was partially supported by the national key research and development program of
