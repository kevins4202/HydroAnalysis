graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban stormwater media best management practices contaminant removal 1 introduction stormwater management in urban areas has become a growing challenge for civil and environmental engineers and city planners increases in population urbanization and impervious surface coverage have led to subsequent increases in surface runoff volume hogan and walbridge 2007 and decreases in local stormwater infiltration during natural and managed aquifer recharge berndtsson 2010 lack of appropriate stormwater management practices results in overflow of urban stormwater into receiving waters streets and building basements during storm events areas with combined sewer systems experience greater raw sewage and stormwater runoff during overflow events fig s1 in addition to high volumes of surface runoff and sewer overflow another consequence of poorly managed and untreated urban stormwater is that it acts as a major pollution source to receiving waters due to elevated contaminant concentrations table 1 after storm events hazardous contaminants in stormwater runoff are transported to local groundwater and surface water via interactions with impermeable surfaces e g roads roofs etc and chemically treated greenways e g lawns parks etc göbel et al 2007 contaminant groups typically found in urban stormwater include suspended solids and particulate associated e g bacteria organic and dissolved e g nutrients metals ionic salts organic compounds species göbel et al 2007 houtz and sedlak 2012 zgheib et al 2012 spahr et al 2020 some sources of these contaminants include deposits from the atmosphere roofing materials metal pipes and gutters pavement emissions from combustion engines tire brake pad abrasion gasoline oil brake fluid göbel et al 2007 houtz and sedlak 2012 zgheib et al 2012 spahr et al 2020 biocides fertilizers and flame retardants spahr et al 2020 the national stormwater quality database compiled a list of commonly detected stormwater contaminants in table 1 we highlight representative contaminants and their concentrations suspended solids lead to increased turbidity and the build up of sediments in receiving waters shammaa and zhu 2001 which impact the quality of these waters nutrients in urban stormwater runoff houtz and sedlak 2012 which contribute to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication paerl et al 2016 was recently the second largest cause of united states water impairment affecting over 7 000 water bodies epa 2016 additionally the presence of metals and organic and biological contaminants in urban stormwater runoff can pollute receiving waters and pose risks to aquatic and human health grebel et al 2013 houtz and sedlak 2012 stormwater best management practices bmps offer a practical solution to reduce surface runoff volume and street flooding and provide some level of contaminant removal architects city planners and engineers are thoughtfully implementing permeable pavement rain gardens and bioretention tackett et al 2013 and bioinfiltration basins deletic and fletcher 2006 grebel et al 2013 elliott and trowsdale 2007 to promote local groundwater recharge and prevent runoff backup in cities with high impervious surface coverage other countries including the united states may classify these systems as low impact developments or green stormwater infrastructure for this review we will refer to stormwater infrastructure as bmps existing bmps designed for filtration e g bioretention systems wetlands sand filters and vegetated channels typically employ native soil vegetation and or sand in their designs which help convey urban runoff from the street and retain large particulates fig 1 collins et al 2010 grebel et al 2013 in regions of water scarcity other bmp options include urban stormwater capture by businesses and residences to create a local water source for non potable applications such as landscape irrigation nnadi et al 2015 chong et al 2013 unfortunately bmps may be ineffective in reducing dissolved concentrations of nutrients organic compounds metals and other contaminants in urban stormwater because they are primarily designed to mitigate impacts of high water volume during overflow events and to remove suspended solids and large particles fig 1 a shows the performance of common stormwater bmps reporting the influent and effluent concentrations of various pollutants during urban storm events there is a wide range in the total number of bmp sites reporting measurements in the database 24 grass swales 44 detention basins 66 retention ponds and 92 wetland basins the majority of the bmps in the database are located in the united states and the most common bmp sites reporting pollutant concentration data are retention ponds and wetland basins fig 1 a across all bmp categories there is large variability in the number of total reporting sites for each chemical parameter for example approximately 200 bmp sites report concentrations of phosphorus total p and total suspended solids tss whereas less than 25 bmp sites report chemical oxygen demand cod levels the median removal efficiency ranges for the reported chemical parameters across all bmp categories are as follows nitrogen total n 14 25 cod 16 26 total p 10 38 total pb 37 52 total zn 51 59 and tss 46 64 fig 1 b for total n total p and cod the median removal efficiency in all selected bmp categories is less than 40 fig 1 suggests that 1 more data is needed to accurately validate compare and predict bmp contaminant removal capabilities 2 bmp treatment efficacy is not reported for certain contaminants i e especially trace organic compounds table s1 and 3 there is an opportunity and need to enhance the removal efficiency of all urban stormwater contaminants amending existing bmps with media can enhance contaminant removal from urban runoff while promoting groundwater recharge and reducing discharge volume during overflow events additionally media amendments are a more cost effective option for enhanced contaminant removal when designing new and or maintaining existing stormwater infrastructure particularly where physical space is limited in urban areas when combined with conventional media novel engineered media can further reduce levels of contamination in urban stormwater runoff to surface water or recharged groundwater efficient planning and heavy financial support from cities and states is often required to achieve these goals to better inform decisions made by engineers and city planners regarding improved management safer discharge or infiltration of urban stormwater a synthesis and critical review of available stormwater media is needed in this review we present an overview of conventional and emerging engineered media for stormwater treatment in urban areas where space constraints and contamination from industrial and other anthropogenic sources complicate stormwater management these media types are further divided into organic and inorganic media and composite media classifications for engineered media we discuss physicochemical properties of inorganic organic and composite materials affecting contaminant removal and present opportunities to functionalize media for targeting specific contaminants and or enhancing removal it is important to consider that the specific physicochemical properties of media may vary depending on how the media is prepared or synthesized to better elucidate how media can be incorporated into existing and future stormwater infrastructure we highlight key factors impacting contaminant removal e g media characteristics stormwater hydrology and composition and provide recommendations for lab scale media tests and material characterization we conclude the review by providing insight into some potential challenges and uncertainties associated with performance and implementation of engineered media for stormwater management applications 2 conventional stormwater remediation media here we highlight research conducted in the united states to assess the potential of different conventional media for stormwater pollutant removal a majority of the studies were conducted using synthetic stormwater in lab scale column and batch experiments and a few studies report contaminant removal in columns treating real urban stormwater under field conditions table s1 fig 2 reports the removal efficiencies of conventional media used to treat various stormwater contaminants with a primary primary focus on the removal of nutrients and metals a majority of the media categories exhibit a high removal efficiency 75 for solids volatile and total suspended solids there are notable differences between the types of contaminants removed and the nature of the media for example inorganic media like zeolites and iron based media have similar removal efficiencies for solids pathogens nutrients metals and hydrocarbons whereas wh organic media have higher removal efficiencies for organic contaminants in contrast to both organic and other inorganic media sand has a lower removal efficiency with respect to organic contaminants excluding hydrocarbons metals nutrients and pathogens across all media categories similar removal efficiencies were observed for hydrocarbons while nutrient removal varied across media categories 2 1 organic materials multiple studies have evaluated the application of organic materials such as compost mulch wood activated carbon biochar peat and agricultural wastes for stormwater treatment ashoori et al 2019 boving and neary 2007 boving and zhang 2004 clark 2000 erickson et al 2016 faucette et al 2013 jang et al 2005 johnson et al 2003 mohanty et al 2014 ray et al 2006 ray et al 2005 2019 reddy krishna et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2016 silvertooth et al 2015 syring et al 2009 tobiason et al 2002 ulrich et al 2015 2017 van lienden et al 2010 zhou et al 2003 the retention and removal of stormwater pollutants by carbonaceous media is aided by their high organic matter content and reactive functional groups e g carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl phenolic amino and sulfonyl for example metals removal by organic media was hypothesized to correlate to the amount of oxygen containing moieties e g carboxyl and hydroxyl present on the surface mohanty et al 2018 reddy krishna et al 2014 the large degree of hydrophobicity and porosity of organic media can also facilitate removal of organic compounds wu et al 2013 organic media can also improve biotransformation of organic contaminants by serving as excellent substrates for microbial growth 2 1 1 biochar in our review of stormwater treatment media literature we found that biochar was the most well studied media with reports covering a wide range of stormwater contaminants fig 2 tables 2 and s2 biochar and activated carbon are among the most commonly used organic materials for water treatment applications chars possess large porosities and acidic functional groups which respectively enable them to remove organic compounds via diffusion inyang and dickenson 2015 and metals via complexation uchimiya et al 2010 chars are produced from raw biomass with a high content of readily available carbon biochar is produced through low oxygen thermochemical processing of raw biomass which increases the overall surface area and number of active sites for the diffusion and adsorption of pollutants ahmad et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018 activated carbon requires additional processing steps employing oxygen or strong acids to activate the charred biomass ahmad et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018 variations in the physical and chemical properties of different precursor biomass feeds and thermochemical conditions used to produce biochar and activated carbon impact their removal capacities for different contaminants mohanty et al 2018 ulrich et al 2017 van lienden et al 2010 for example batch adsorption experiments conducted under the same conditions show that despite the lower surface area of granular activated carbon gac produced from rice byproducts it has higher affinity to cu and zn than nutshell sourced gac van lienden et al 2010 additionally mohanty et al observed that low temperature biochar exhibited greater removal of e coli during stormwater infiltrationand only 1 remobilization after intermittent flow compared to 3 remobilization using high temperature biochar mohanty et al 2014 biochar is particularly effective at removing organic contaminants and pathogens figs 2 and 3 many of which are persistent in stormwater bmps afrooz and boehm 2017 spahr et al 2020 ulrich et al and ray et al evaluated biochar produced from gasification of pinewood for the simultaneous removal of multiple organic contaminants in synthetic stormwater matrices ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2015 ray et al used a biochar dose of 3 wt amended with sand for column filtration of a synthetic stormwater solution containing 10 µg l each of seven representative organic contaminants and observed complete removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate diuron fipronil perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid select organic compounds shown in fig 3 a1 and 80 100 atrazine removal ray et al 2019 the presence of dissolved organic carbon doc 5 mg c l in a mirrored study did not significantly alter the performance of biochar during treatment fig 3 a2 ulrich et al also reported 70 100 removal of prometon benzotriazole atrazine diuron and tris 3 chloro 2 propyl phosphate for over 428 pore volumes with initial contaminant concentrations of 20 µg l each and 10 mg c l doc using a biochar dose of only 0 2 wt ulrich et al 2015 these studies suggest that the biochar high surface area 351 m2 g and functional groups were enough to overcome competing sorption and complexation site occupation by organic compounds doc and or metals select metals shown in figs 3 a1and 3 a2 the high removal 99 of these metals except as and cr and organic contaminants suggest that multiple stormwater contaminants can be effectively and simultaneously removed if a sufficiently large surface area 300 m2 g biochar is used the large hydrophobic biochar surface area also provides an anchor for pathogens like e coli to attach overcoming electrostatic repulsive forces and facilitating efficient removal during stormwater infiltration mohanty et al 2014 while biochar exhibits moderate to high removal efficiency 50 for most contaminants figs 2 and 3 more research is needed to better predict removal of contaminants with different phases and under more realistic stormwater conditions several studies have evaluated biochar s ability to remove multiple types of contaminants simultaneously ashoori et al 2019 ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 for example reddy al evaluated the simultaneous removal of nutrients no3 and tp metals cd cr cu pb ni and zn and hydrocarbons phenanthrene naphthalene and benzo a pyrene by biochar in synthetic stormwater reddy krishna et al 2014 a stormwater matrix containing a mixture of contaminants would be a more realistic assessment of biochar performance allowing for better comparison of removal efficiencies of different contaminant categories as previously discussed stormwater contaminants can exist as dissolved species and particulate associated species therefore the removal of some contaminants e g nutrients organic compounds and metals can be dictated by the behavior of particles in the stormwater and in the treatment systems for example organic contaminants and metals can react with natural organic matter nom to form nom complexes and metals can form precipitates with sulfate sulfides and phosphate species although removal of solids by organic media such as biochar and gac was evaluated in some studies reddy krishna et al 2014 silvertooth et al 2015 syring et al 2009 zhou et al 2003 table s2 further analysis is needed to assess the fraction of the solids associated with other dissolved stormwater contaminants 2 1 2 compost based media compost has high humic content which can promote removal of metals through complexation and removal of organic compounds through hydrophobic interactions clark 2000 although compost alone has demonstrated capability of reducing stormwater runoff volume reinsch et al 2007 the possible leaching of organic matter and nutrients during high volume storm events makes compost an ineffective media to mitigate this issue compost can be mixed with media such as biochar or activated carbon which have a higher affinity to retain leached compounds fig 2 shows that the removal of nutrients by compost based media ranges from 9 to 71 the low removal efficiences were obtained in studies using only compost faucette et al 2013 whereas the high removal efficiencies were obtained when compost was amended with either biochar or activated carbon ulrich et al 2017 for example ulrich et al reported that the addition of biochar to vegetated biofilters containing a mixture of sand and compost prevented leaching of total organic carbon toc total dissolved phosphate tdp and total nitrogen tn and increased diuron and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate removal by 6 and 83 ulrich et al 2017 removal of toc tdp tn and no3 also increased by 80 73 86 and 68 respectively in the presence of biochar ulrich et al 2017 2 1 3 woodchips based media woodchips are readily available and primarily used in denitrifying bioreactors for stormwater wastewater and agricultural drainage treatment ashoori et al 2019 halaburka et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 woodchips can act as a source of carbon and as electron donors for denitrifying microorganisms for example ashoori et al reported a 99 removal efficiency of no3 in column experiments employing woodchips which also assessed removal of metals cu cd pb ni and zn and organic contaminants diuron 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate 1h benzotriazole atrazine and fipronil in stormwater ashoori et al 2019 the authors reported average removal efficiencies of 80 94 for metals with the exception of zn which exhibited poorer removal 45 these estimates were similar to the removal efficiencies observed when biochar was added at 33 wt to the woodchips the retention of metals was attributed to the formation of metal sulfide precipitates in the presence of woodchips ashoori et al 2019 in contrast the addition of biochar enhanced removal of the organic contaminants adsorption isotherm experiments revealed that woodchips sorption affinity towards the contaminants was significantly lower than the biochar sorption affinity the linear kd sorption coefficient was estimated at 10 20 l kg for woodchips and 105 106 l kg for biochar thus the application of a woodchips biochar mixture in stormwater treatment systems can ensure the simultaneous removal of several contaminants e g no3 metals and organic contaminants however a thorough analysis will be needed to choose an appropriate biochar woodchips are an efficient media because they have an extended bedlife however in this study ashoori et al reported that biochar decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the system by more than two fold i e 2 1 cm s in woodchips only columns and 0 5 cm s in woodchips biochar columns ashoori et al 2019 this decrease in hydraulic conductivity could lead to frequent clogging during stormwater infiltration overall current literature suggests that organic media can effectively capture stormwater contaminants nevertheless a more complete analysis of their performance and potential for stormwater treatment applications is needed 2 2 inorganic materials in this review the inorganic conventional media considered are mineral based materials such as sand zeolite metal hydr oxides and other metal based materials e g iron filings the presence of ionic species and acidic moieties on the surface of these materials promotes sorption via electrostatic interactions and or complexation of charged species such as nutrients e g no3 nh4 po4 3 metals and organic contaminants 2 2 1 sand coarse and silica based materials like sand offer functional advantages to stormwater treatment systems because of their high hydraulic conductivities and ability to strain solids during infiltration beginning in the 1980s the city of austin tx started using sand filters as an alternative bmp clark 2000 equipped with a sedimentation basin designed to retain and slowly release stormwater runoff i e 90 of 24 h storm events barrett michael 2003 since then sand filters have been commonly adopted in cities across the united states e g washington dc and seattle wa for stormwater management they have a small land area requirement which makes them convenient to use especially for small development sites urbonas 1994 zarezadeh et al 2018 pollutant removal by sand filters is characterized by physical filtration sedimentation and straining clark 2000 clark and pitt 2012 both labscale and field studies have been used to evaluate sand s ability to remove stormwater contaminants sand filters constructed near roadways in populous industrial cities exhibited high removal efficiency of stormwater solids 86 94 barrett michael 2003 zarezadeh et al 2018 similar results indicating high i e 98 tss removal in lab scale filters were also observed prabhukumar et al 2015 removal of other contaminants by sand especially metals varies greatly fig 2 and depends upon metal speciation ray et al ulrich et al and prabhukumar et al reported removal efficiencies greater than 80 for dissolved cu for different influent concentrations in lab scale column experiments prabhukumar et al 2015 ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 in contrast barret identified only a 6 and 39 reduction of dissolved cu and pb concentrations by sand filters and 33 and 86 removal of total cu and total pb barrett michael e 2003 these conflicting findings suggest the need for more studies to assess removal efficiencies of different phases and speciation of contaminants during stormwater treatment the limited affinity of sand for dissolved contaminants is reflected in its low removal of organic contaminants fig 2 3 a2 and b2 ray et al and ulrich et al reported removal efficiencies ranging from 0 to 47 for polar organic contaminants ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 fig 2 shows that sand can efficiently remove some hydrocarbons however these results were obtained from lab scale studies prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy krishna et al 2014b conducted under simplistic conditions using high contaminant concentrations which are not representative of typical concentrations found in natural stormwater tables 1 ands1 for example batch experiments conducted by reddy et al using sand and a synthetic solution of phenanthrene 30 1900 µg l and naphthalene 900 43 000 µg l reported a removal efficiency of more than 90 for both compounds at all concentrations reddy krishna et al 2014b a survey of different runoff events in the united states estimated the maximum concentrations of phenanthrene and naphthalene in urban runoff at 1 and 29 µg l respectively masoner et al 2019 a study with lower field relevant organic compound concentrations is necessary to properly assess sand removal capacity for these compounds the aforementioned studies and results in fig 2 suggest that sand alone will be ineffective for urban stormwater treatment containing dissolved contaminants and a wide variety of other contaminants 2 2 2 clays and zeolites clay minerals and zeolites are naturally occurring minerals with great potential for water and wastewater treatment due to their high surface area high affinity and selectivity for metals low cost abundance and low toxicity studies investigating the utilization of clay minerals as treatment media for stormwater have focused primarily on zeolites both clays and zeolites can be purchased and synthesized at the laboratory scale li et al 2016 xie et al 2013 which offers the advantage of being readily available fig 2 shows that zeolites have moderate to high affinity for solids pathogens metals nutrients and hydrocarbons zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates with high surface area ion exchange capacity and water retention capacity smith 2011 their high surface area provides an abundance of active sites onto which pollutants can adsorb the porous and molecular sieve characteristic of zeolites can promote the structural sequestration and intraparticle diffusion of stormwater contaminants such as small neutral organic compounds clark 2000 jiang et al 2018 zeolites with high silica content are favorable for the sorption of some organic contaminants e g pharmaceuticals pesticides due to their high si al ratio which promotes strong hydrophobic interactions between zeolite surfaces and organic contaminants jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 the si4 and al3 in the structural framework of zeolites creates a net negative charge that attracts common stormwater cations e g ca2 mg2 na and k which can be exchanged with cationic trace metals uddin 2017 wang and peng 2010 for example prabhukumar et al reported a removal efficiency of 78 96 for cationic metals cd cu ni pb and zn by zeolite as opposed to a removal efficiency of 55 for anionic cr prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy et al also observed low removal efficiencies 5 9 of cr reddy et al 2014a the permanent negative surface charge of zeolites leads to the repulsion of negatively charged species thus limiting their sorption clark 2000 while promoting the sorption of positively charged species however in zeolites with high silica content the minimal negative charge limits their sorption capacity for cations instead zeolites with high silica content can be used for the sorption of some organic contaminants their high si al ratio promotes strong hydrophobic interactions between their surfaces and organic contaminants jiang et al 2018 2020 zeolites are also good candidates for nutrient removal and denitrification in stormwater fig 2 zeolites can sequester nh4 through ion exchange and no3 and po4 3 through formation of metal complexes and precipitates additionally their large surface area and ion exchange capacity promotes the attachment of microorganisms he et al 2007 smith 2011 enhancing denitrification a pilot study evaluating the performance of zeolite as a biofiltration media for nh4 removal observed that the average initial nh4 level 0 78 mg l decreased by 93 under steady flow operation and by 98 during a high flow event followed by a 40 d dry period smith 2011 a close monitoring of the nitrogen and oxygen profiles in the biofilter showed that as levels of nh4 and oxygen declined no3 and no2 increased in the effluent which suggests that nitrification occurred a parallel sand control biofilter in the same study exhibited an average removal efficiency of 87 for nh4 both biofilters accumulated similar amounts of no3 and no2 suggesting that in addition to denitrification nh4 could be removed through ion exchange in the zeolite biofilter compared to zeolite sand has much lower surface area and cation exchange capacity grebel et al 2013 which limit adsorption sites and ion exchange processes occurring at the sand surface this study indicates that zeolite can sustain performance through typical storm events making it an excellent media candidate for stormwater infiltration systems where nh4 removal is the main priority 2 2 3 iron based media like zeolites iron based materials exhibit high removal efficiencies for solids pathogens metals nutrients and hydrocarbons fig 2 metal oxides and metal based materials are useful for the attenuation of metal contaminants ernst et al 2016 prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy et al 2014a reddy et al 2014b because of chemical properties that facilitate ion exchange surface precipitation redox and complexation processes farley et al 1985 gadde and laitinen 1974 ugwu and igbokwe 2019 for example reddy et al report removal efficiencies of 51 100 for cd cu pb ni cr and zn in batch experiments using a synthetic stormwater solution and iron filings byproducts of the grinding or milling of iron material primarily consisting of iron hydr oxide minerals reddy et al 2014a prabukhumar et al also reported similar removal efficiency 57 100 during column experiments using iron filings prabhukumar et al 2015 these high removal efficiencies could be due to the high initial concentrations 5 500 mg l of the metals used in these studies in contrast column experiments using natural highway runoff to assess granular ferric hydroxide capacity to remove metals report average removal efficiencies of 14 and 34 for cu initial concentration 36 µg l and zn initial concentration 50 µg l ernst et al 2016 breakthrough i e the ratio of influent to effluent concentration c c0 0 for both cu and zn occurred within 5 000 pore volumes but the media was not saturated within the duration of the experimental period 98 000 pore volumes ernst et al 2016 compared to sand and zeolites iron based media exhibit greater removal efficiencies for nutrients fig 2 mixtures of sand and iron filings at doses of 7 2 and 10 7 wt along the trenches of a wet detention basin reduced po4 3 concentrations by 29 90 erickson et al 2012 erickson et al also conducted column experiments with different doses of iron filings in the absence of iron filings sand sorption capacity for po4 3 was exhausted at a column depth less than 10 m whereas a 5 wt iron filing dose did not result in the exhaustion of the media sorption capacity even after 200 m of treated depth furthermore the author reported that the hydraulic conductivity in the iron sand columns did not change significantly as the iron filings fraction increased from 0 3 to 5 wt thus iron filings can be applied in bmps e g bioretention ponds grass swales where po4 3 removal is low fig 1 to minimize risk of po4 3 leaching the limited reactivity of sand to dissolved contaminants resulted in minimal sorption of po4 3 in the erickson et al study erickson et al 2012 in contrast to sand the high surface area of iron based media and other metal oxides present numerous active sites for the adsorption of po4 3 which can sorb to iron filings through the formation of iron phosphate precipitates or ligand exchange with iron hydr oxides grebel et al 2013 reddy et al 2013 overall zeolites and iron based media possess great potential for pollutant removal and using them in stormwater treatment systems would ensure better water quality however they reportedly have low hydraulic conductivities compared to sand hsieh and davis 2005 this could lead to rapid clogging flooding and inhibition of groundwater recharge careful considerations like these are needed in choosing media for stormwater treatment in section 4 we discuss the influence of media properties in greater detail 3 composite engineered media for enhanced urban stormwater treatment to maximize the removal of trace contaminants in urban stormwater and protect receiving waters conventional materials may not be sufficient researchers are testing new low cost engineered materials as supplements to enhance the contaminant removal efficiency of conventional materials composite materials can take advantage of surface functional groups or chemical properties of a substrate by coating doping or decorating it with a material of different properties to enhance performance or add utility typically the goal of composite fabrication is to expand the range of contaminants removed in urban stormwater and other water treatment applications this section will identify the synthesis properties contaminant removal mechanisms and opportunities for field deployment of different engineered media evaluated for urban stormwater treatment 3 1 metal oxide composite engineered media as outlined in section 2 conventional inorganic media such as metal oxides clays and sand exhibit some affinity for urban stormwater contaminant removal however currently there are several limitations to incorporating these media in urban stormwater bmps for example metal oxides and clays typically occur as amorphous flocs or powder which may clog infiltration systems during storm events or transport adsorbed or complexed contaminants downstream to receiving waters although sand can offer benefits of metal sorption and high hydraulic conductivity in infiltration applications ray et al 2019 its reactivity is limited to inorganic species in urban stormwater development of engineered media can help overcome the moderate to low reactivity and feasability of conventional inorganic media while enhancing reactivity during urban stormwater treatment 3 1 1 iron hydr oxide coated sand in addition to trace metal removal naturally occurring iron hydr oxides can also aid in the attenuation and immobilization of fecal indicator bacteria which is one of the main classes of contaminants in urban stormwater table 1 fe iii mineral phases adhere to bacteria cell walls creating bacteria iron oxide flocs delaire et al 2016 and enabling subsequent redox reactions to inactivate the immobilized bacteria giannakis et al 2018 in urban stormwater infiltration applications cell adhesion to iron hydr oxides and adsorption of trace metals can be an effective pollutant removal strategy however because iron oxides typically occur as powders or flocs in soils it is impractical to employ them as filtration media for runoff treatment to facilitate their use as a reactive media in existing urban stormwater management practices researchers have investigated coating iron hydr oxides on conventional media to augment bmps zhang et al 2010 amorphous iron iii oxyhydroxides synthesized by slowly increasing the ph of a ferric solution e g ferric chloride can be easily coated onto granular media substrates like sand knapp et al 1998 mills et al 1994 coating iron hydr oxides on sand increases its ability for trace contaminant removal without sacrificing hydraulic conductivity which is critical for stormwater infiltration applications for example mohanty et al designed bioinfiltration cells i e columns amended with iron hydr oxide coated sand to sequester fecal indicator bacteria from simulated stormwater mohanty et al 2013 even at a 50 wt sand to iron hydr oxide coated sand loading 99 of e coli and 97 of enterococcus faecalis initial concentration of both bacteria 0 8 1 8 106 cfu ml were removed from synthetic stormwater compared to 70 and 58 removal with just sand amended bioinfiltration systems furthermore when flow of bacteria laden simulated stormwater was paused and resumed to mimic intermittent flow less than 0 25 of attached bacteria were mobilized from the iron hydr oxide coated sand columns compared to up to 13 2 mobilization of bacteria attached to uncoated sand in a column filtration study zhang et al observed no breakthrough of e coli in synthetic stormwater from lab scale columns packed with iron hydr oxide coated sand for over 6 h of filtration while breakthrough was observed in only 0 75 h in sand amended columns zhang et al 2010 columns in this study were operated at hydraulic conditions comparable to a typical storm event with no evidence of clogging while iron hydr oxide coated sand contributed to greater bacterial removal 87 columns packed with conventional bioretention media i e sand resulted in 69 removal at a faster bacterial death rate i e 0 90 d 1 compared to the reactive engineered media columns 0 04 d 1 this effect was attributed to the lack of native microorganisms competing for nutrients on the iron hydr oxide coated sands compared to the conventional media which was inoculated with a native culture iron hydr oxide coated sand has also been investigated for trace metal adsorption sansalone prepared iron hydr oxide coated sand for passive removal of cu zn cd and pb trace metals in an exfiltration trench capturing urban stormwater sansalone 1999 test columns amended with sand and coated sand were used to determine trace metal removal in deionized water and real stormwater containing suspended solids which can complex trace metals herngren et al 2005 virgin sand column breakthrough i e c c0 0 90 of metals in deionized water ph 6 5 occurred 10 times as fast for zn and cd and 25 times as fast for cu and pb compared to iron hydr oxide coated sand this effect was exaggerated when the solution ph was increased above the point of zero charge for the iron hydr oxide coating ph 7 0 8 0 promoting favorable electrostatic interactions between the divalent cations and negatively charged coated sand the lifetime of the iron hydr oxide coated sand tested under the conditions in the sansalone study was approximated at 15 years to provide city planners civil and structural engineers and urban landscape architects with adequate information to deploy engineered media like iron hydr oxide coated sand additional research is needed for example even though the studies were conducted with the intended application of employing iron hydr oxide coated sand in infiltration systems none of the studies report hydraulic conductivity or a comparable relevant parameter though because the engineered media substrate i e sand has a high hydraulic conductivity it is reasonable to assume that introducing iron hydr oxide coated sand into existing infiltration systems would not reduce stormwater permeability to determine the expected lifetime and reactivity of iron hydr oxide coated sands more information is needed on trace metal adsorption capacity and bacterial removal or inactivation under a wider range of stormwater conditions this includes information about the iron hydr oxide coating stability because trace metals adsorbed onto iron hydr oxide coatings may be transported downstream if the coating leaches from sand surfaces over time 3 1 2 manganese oxide coated sand similar to iron hydr oxides manganese oxides are abundant naturally occurring and can undergosurface complexation with trace metals e g pb cu cd via hydroxide functional groups at their microporous surface al degs et al 2000 farley et al 1985 wang et al 2012 in addition to interactions with trace metals manganese oxides can undergo redox reactions with organic compounds in aquatic environments for example humic and fulvic acids as well as simple phenols can reduce mn iv oxides in natural waters to mn ii phases stone and morgan 1984 sunda and kieber 1994 this inherent property of manganese oxides has been exploited through its use as a substrate for trace organic compound oxidation mn iii mn iv oxide catalysts have been investigated in the oxidation of organic compounds such as toluene santos et al 2010 anilines hydroquinones laha and luthy 1990 and antibiotics song et al 2019 in water like their iron hydr oxide counterparts powdered amorphous manganese oxide mineral phases can be precipitated onto sand support media using a reductive synthesis to facilitate employment in infiltration systems in fact dissolved mn2 in raw feed water can be oxidized to mn4 and coated on sand grains in trickling filters during wastewater treatment gouzinis et al 1998 the subsequent mn iv o2 coating catalyzes additional oxidation of nearby mn2 facilitating manganese removal morgan 1967 to expedite mn iv o2 coatings on sand grains a solution of potassium permanganate is added to sand and reduced by addition of an acid e g hydrochloric acid foroughi et al 2013 han et al 2006 tiwari et al 2011 to achieve a birnessite i e a mixed mn iii mn iv phase manganese oxide coated sand grebel et al 2016 manganese oxide coated sand has been investigated as both an adsorbent media for trace metal removal charbonnet et al 2020 guha et al 2001 han et al 2006 and as a heterogeneous oxidation media for trace organic compound degradation in urban stormwater charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 liu et al compared the sorptive removal of pb cu cd and zn in synthetic runoff by sand iron oxide coated sand and manganese oxide coated sand liu et al 2005 both the engineered sand media had higher exhaustion capacities i e metal loading on geomedia at c c0 0 9 than uncoated sand for all trace metals under the same experimental conditions exhaustion capacities for pb cd and zn were at least twice as high on iron hydr oxide coated sands than on manganese oxide coated sand due to differences in metal affinities during surface complexation table 3 in comparison to both coated sands commercial gac underperformed with respect to trace metal removal tiwari et al similarly reported a combined effect of adsorption and co precipitation of cu and pb species on manganese oxide coated sand surfaces at neutral ph tiwari et al 2011 grebel et al demonstrated the range of oxidation rates of representative runoff trace organic compounds by birnessite manganese oxide coated sand in column filtration studies grebel et al 2016 for example reaction rate constants ranged from 1 8 x 10 3 l g s for bisphenol a to 66 7 x 10 9 l g s for diuron further investigation of this particular manganese oxide coated sand in synthetic stormwater free of doc corroborated previous findings demonstrating high removal efficiency of cu and pb i e c c0 0 for over 2 000 pore volumes and very low removal efficiency of zn and cd i e c c0 1 in 1 000 pore volumes charbonnet et al 2020 observed decreases in metal removal by manganese oxide coated sand due to doc addition were attributed to complexation of doc with trace metals and not to loss of adsorption sites on sand surfaces charbonnet et al have also provided important information regarding the stability of the manganese oxide coating charbonnet et al 2018 the coating density of manganese oxide coated sand decreased from 2 mg mn g media for native media to 1 7 mg mn g for spent media after treating 1 300 pore volumes of bisphenol a in a synthetic stormwater matrix this reduction in coating density indicated that approximately 6 4 mg mn was released exceeding the 0 91 µm epa secondary drinking water standard epa 2019 because manganese oxide and iron hydr oxide coated sands remove trace metals using similar mechanisms it is possible that leached mn and by extension fe may act as mobile carriers transporting adsorbed trace metals downstream 3 1 3 phoslock high nutrient loads originating from stormwater runoff to receiving waters is a growing concern in the increasingly urban landscapes across the united states adyel et al 2016 for example a study in st paul minnesota revealed that urban watersheds exhibit high phosphorus retention due to high street density and transport via stormwater runoff hobbie et al 2017 recent studies have found that controlling and reducing phosphorus loads rather than nitrogen is key to mitigating harmful algal blooms and eutrophication in surface waters schindler et al 2016 to reduce phosphorus loads to receiving waters from urban runoff phoslock a commercially available phosphorus adsorbent could be considered as an engineered media amendment in existing urban stormwater bmps phoslock is a bentonite clay complexed with lanthanum a rare earth metal haghseresht et al 2009 the la3 forms stable complexes with phosphate in water xie et al 2014 which can effectively reduce phosphate concentrations in surface waters prone to eutrophication fig 4 when applied to surface waters phoslock complexes free phosphate ions as it travels through the water column to the sediment bed surface regulating phosphorus release from the lake bed and limiting excess growth of phytoplankton spears et al 2013 because phoslock was designed for surface water applications there are limited studies investigating its use as a filtration media for urban stormwater treatment randall et al examined phoslock amendments in vegetated bioretention cell mesocosms to treat synthetic stormwater randall and bradford 2013 the hydraulic conductivity of phoslock amended mesocosms was significantly lower than mesocosms amended with sand alum and a commercial oxide coated media during down flow operation interestingly sand phoslock mesocosms had much higher removal efficiencies for orthophosphate 85 than for total phosphorus 34 which was better removed by sand only mesocosms 76 the poor removal efficiency of total phosphorus by sand phoslock mesocosms was attributed to the formation of fe po4 complexes which reduced the amount of free phosphate in urban stormwater but promoted phosphorus release from organic carbon decomposition in the bioretention soil however phoslock amended mesocosms had the highest nitrate removal efficiencies i e 98 due to increased denitrification under the anoxic conditions generated in the bioretention columns to our knowledge the 2013 randal and bradford study is the only peer reviewed article employing phoslock as an engineered urban stormwater media randall and bradford 2013 other reports examining phoslock application to surface waters identify potential negative ecological consequences associated with deployment of phoslock in natural systems for example there have been several documented studies identifying negative toxicological effects to daphnia magna a representative zooplankton controlling phytoplankton growth in surface waters slijkerman et al 2004 when la3 is leached during phoslock treatment of phosphorus rich waters lürling and tolman 2010 further investigation of safety and other environmental concerns is needed before phoslock amendments are considered for urban stormwater treatment 3 2 organic coated composite engineered media many studies have proposed the creation of layered treatment zones kim et al 2018 sun et al 2020 xiong et al 2019 using combinations of conventional media engineered materials or hybrid composite materials for water treatment applications jing et al 2013 su 2017 upadhyay et al 2014 however due to limitations associated with certain media e g hydraulic conductivity in this section we only describe a few viable candidates for stormwater treatment applications 3 2 1 modified graphene oxide coated sand graphene oxides are single layer trigonal planar sp2 carbon nanosheets decorated with epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal planes and carboxylic acid groups along the edges marcano et al 2010 produced from chemical exfoliation of oxidized graphite minerals graphene oxides have high reactive surface area increased hydrophilicity li et al 2008 and are conducive to additional functionalization dreyer et al 2010 as a result graphene oxides are used in a wide variety of applications including biosensors chung et al 2013 enhanced electron transport in electrochemical systems chen et al 2012 zhou et al 2009 drug delivery liu et al 2013 sun et al 2008 and water treatment ray et al 2015 wang et al 2016 additionally the recent demonstrated success of the well established modified hummers method chen et al 2013 for high throughput synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets has greatly expanded the practical feasibility of using nanoscale graphene oxide in real engineered applications similar to iron and manganese oxides graphene oxide nanosheets are difficult to employ during water treatment unless a support is used e g semipermeable membranes goh et al 2015 hu and mi 2013 lee et al 2013 there are several studies investigating modified graphene oxide coated sand for water treatment applications including urban stormwater treatment coating graphene oxide onto sand can mimic the performance of gac used in water treatment by creating a carbonaceous media with high adsorptive capacity for removing trace organic compounds naveen prasad et al 2015 ray et al 2017 yang et al 2015 and inorganic contaminants hou et al 2015 yang et al 2006 to generate graphene oxide coated sands additional modification of graphene oxide is needed the increased number of oxygen containing functional groups on graphene oxide compared to graphene impart some hydrophilicity however the large domains of remaining hydrophobic aromatic groups kim et al 2010 can decrease its suitability for coating substrates like sand which require acidic functional group linkages to facilitate a stable coating of graphene oxide onto sand for stormwater treatment researchers have modified graphene oxide with hydrophilic species to increase attachment efficiency huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 wen et al 2013 for example gao et al modified graphene oxide nanosheets with thiol groups by taking advantage of diazonium grafting chemistry lomeda et al 2010 to allow self assembly of graphene oxide onto sand surfaces gao et al 2011 the resulting graphene oxide coated sand exhibited five times higher adsorption of mercury and rhodamine b compared to unmodified sand during column filtration studies similarly there are studies investigating coating sand surfaces with al2 and mg2 graphene oxide nanosheets which demonstrated higher complexation efficiencies of phosphate and metals i e zn and cu and adsorption of organic compounds i e diclofenac and caffeine compared to reduced graphene oxides ahmadi et al 2018 vu and wu 2019 gao et al and vu et al have also included important information regarding the stability of the modified graphene oxide coated sand for stormwater infiltration applications during a 2 h column filtration study treating mercury and rhodamine b in water no leaching of graphene oxide from the sand surface was observed gao et al 2011 the vu et al study examined removal of po4 3 zn caffeine and e coli model stormwater contaminants in synthetic and real filtered surface runoff during single and multi contaminant column experiments in the multiple contaminant experiments using al mg graphene oxide coated sand e coli removal was 93 8 in synthetic runoff and 93 0 in real surface runoff with minimal remobilization in either scenario vu and wu 2019 furthermore complete breakthrough of caffeine zn and po4 3 0 5 mg l each occurred nearly 5 000 pore volumes sooner in real surface runoff than in cleaner synthetic stormwater conditions which was attributed to sorption site competition with doc present in the real water the estimated lifetime of the al mg graphene oxide coated sand in the vu et al study was determined to be at least 15 years given the study experimental conditions 3 2 2 polymer clay composites polymer clay composites are promising stormwater treatment media typically synthesized by mixing cationic polymer solutions with a clay solution at ratios corresponding to the clay cation exchange capacity and the desired degree of hydrophobicity radian and mishael 2008 following mixing of the polymer and clay solutions the modified clay slurry is removed washed and dried the simple fabrication of these low cost adsorbents combines the high reactive surface area and cation exchange capacity of clays lin and juang 2002 with the functionality of organic polymers because of their added utility to remove organic and inorganic species polymer clay nanocomposites have been proposed since the 90s usuki et al 2005 as effective adsorbents and flocculants for water treatment wu et al 2005 compared to polymers or virgin clays used independently polymer clay nanocomposites have higher adsorption capacities and faster kinetics unuabonah and taubert 2014 the hydrophilicity and negative charge of clays okada and usuki 1995 allow positively charged polymers i e polycations to adsorb to the outside of the clay particle as well as exchange with the inner layer cations in swelling clays resulting in charge reversal yang et al 2003 the polymers add hydrophobic domains on the clay surface which can enhance trace organic compound removal yang et al 2003 via partitioning to the hydrophobic polymer clay composite surface fig 5 left schematic park et al 2011 the polycation coating which typically possesses positively charged moieties like quaternary amines can also facilitate removal of negatively charged pathogens undabeytia et al 2014 and free and complexed doc species anirudhan and suchithra 2010 chang and juang 2004 undabeytia et al 2014 to account for the possibility of polymer desorption from the composite surface during stormwater treatment the choice of polymers must weigh functionality with potential toxicity the majority of studies investigating polymer clay composites have been for treatment of trace organics in drinking water sources kohay et al 2015 ganigar et al 2010 radian and mishael 2012 and in wastewater el zahhar et al 2014 unuabonah et al 2010 of these only a few studies have performed column experiments to gauge the performance of polymer clay composites under more field relevant treatment conditions ray et al synthesized polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene montmorillonite clay composite media for urban stormwater treatment during continuous flow of synthetic stormwater in lab scale columns ray et al 2019 at 3 wt loading amended with sand the clay composites exhibited greater removal of hydrophobic trace organics e g fipronil and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid compared to more hydrophilic compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and atrazine the dual functionality of the modified polymer clay composites was demonstrated by their simultaneous and complete removal of all divalent trace metals e g cd cu zn and ni and 40 60 removal oxyanions i e as v and cr vi over 150 pore volumes interestingly the hydraulic conductivity of the polymer clay composite amended columns was equal to or higher than the hydraulic conductivity of sand additionally over 98 of the polymer coating remained on the clay after 48 h of constant wetting this finding suggests that it may be feasible to employ polymer coated clays as urban stormwater media in infiltration applications 3 2 3 surfactant modified zeolites smzs like clays zeolites are naturally abundant and negatively charged aluminosilicate minerals with high surface area and cation exchange capacity elshorbagy and chowdhury 2013 because of these properties zeolites are similarly easy to modify with positively charged polymers and materials zeolites have been employed as adsorbents jiang et al 2018 in wastewater treatment for trace metal removal wang and peng 2010 hui et al 2005 and have more recently been investigated for ammonia and phosphate recovery applications karapınar 2009 in fact there are several studies investigating metal modified zeolites as antimicrobial media for urban stormwater biofilters li et al 2014a 2014b 2016 cu ag and zn among other metals possess inherent antimicrobial properties li et al examined cu2 and cu oh 2 zeolite filter media for inactivation of e coli during stormwater filtration and discovered that over 2 log e coli removal was consistently achieved during five months of treating natural stormwater under typical conditions li et al 2014 in addition to metal modified zeolites there have also been studies investigating surfactant modified zeolites for enhanced adsorption of other types of micropollutants a popular candidate for clay and zeolite modification is cetrimonium bromide also known as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtma which is a positively charged quaternary ammonium surfactant similar to clays the quaternary ammonium cation provides an anchor for the surfactant to attach to the negatively charged zeolite surface via electrostatic attraction the methylene surfactant tail ch2 x provides a hydrophobic anchor for adsorption of organic compounds if the surfactant concentration is increased past the critical micelle concentration it is possible to reverse the charge of zeolites and generate a positively charged adsorbent fig 5 right schematic chutia et al 2009 this is often done to adsorb negatively charged contaminants such as arsenate chutia et al 2009 perchlorate zhang et al 2007 and chromate selenate and sulfate haggerty and bowman 1994 while surfactant modified zeolites have not been employed for urban stormwater treatment their ability to remove a broad suite of contaminants is a promising quality for urban stormwater media as for the longevity of this engineered media li et al probed the biochemical stability of hdtma modified zeolites and observed that the hdtma coating was stable at high ionic strength and over a wide ph range of 3 10 li et al 1998 furthermore over 90 of the initial hdtma remained bound to zeolites after 100 pore volume washes and over 98 remained on the surface after a 12 17 week incubation with activated sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions these observations suggest that surfactant modified zeolites may be viable as engineered urban stormwater treatment media 4 factors affecting media performance for contaminant removal many researchers characterizing novel media for stormwater remediation conduct lab scale studies using synthetic stormwater to measure contaminant removal under ideal consistent and replicable conditions however prior to scaling up and implementing novel media in urban stormwater management systems the following factors influencing contaminant removal must be considered media characteristics stormwater composition and stormwater hydrology 4 1 media characteristics in this review we discuss various conventional and emerging materials designed to target the removal of inorganic and organic stormwater contaminants the long term durability and field efficacy of materials incorporated into existing urban stormwater bmps depends on their chemical characteristics structural integrity and susceptibility to clogging and fouling here we present current knowledge regarding the impact of these factors on stormwater treatment based on experimental data in section 5 we present several remaining factors requiring additional research to gain a deeper understanding of how stormwater media can be employed in existing treatment systems to improve urban stormwater quality 4 1 1 porosity surface area structural integrity porous materials such as biochar and activated carbon are often used to sequester contaminants through intraparticle diffusion of pollutants within pores depending on the biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature used to produce biochar the product porosity and bulk density can vary significantly brewer et al 2014 the low bulk density and mechanical strength of some biochars may impact soil properties and make it difficult to incorporate biochar amendments into existing treatment systems in particular structural weaknesses in biochar lehmann and joseph 2015 can cause it to break apart leading to rapid and frequent clogging ray et al 2019 additionally biochar s porosity leads to higher water retention which can also reduce urban stormwater permeability during infiltration low hydraulic conductivity of biochar due to water retention may be overcome if the correct particle size mass loading and porosity are selected particularly during stormwater infiltration applications extreme storm events such as floods can physically shear biochar and similarly structured media causing transport of contaminants to receiving waters to mitigate this outcome and ensure that smaller particles are trapped more effectively it is important to choose support media e g gravel sand etc with the appropriate particle size porosity and density in addition to media porosity other properties e g particle size surface area hydration etc can also impact urban stormwater contaminant removal in bmps some media like clays can undergo structural changes when introduced to water in particular the characteristic layered structure of certain clays e g montmorillonite and other smectites allows water to become absorbed within the structure and the clay to swell resulting in expansion and strong electrostatic repulsive forces between the negatively charged layers karaborni et al 1996 zeolites also exist in layered structures and can undergo swelling when introduced to water roth et al 2015 in fact it is the expansion characteristic of these materials that contributes to easy functionalization with polymers and surfactants once modified as in the case of clays swelling may occur despite the intercalation of polymers within the layers zhang and wang 2007 if the loading of functionalized clay and zeolite mineral amendments in urban stormwater infrastructure is too high structural expansion and water absorption could reduce urban stormwater permeability and clog infiltration systems richards and neretnieks 2010 considering that the frequency and intensity of stormwater events depend upon regional and seasonal weather patterns it is often difficult to predict or control the structural changes that media can undergo 4 2 stormwater composition in addition to media characteristics the chemical properties e g ph redox potential and composition of urban stormwater e g suspended solids cationic salts doc microbes can dramatically impact media performance 4 2 1 co occurring inorganic salts cationic bridging nutrients and redox potential in addition to the target metal contaminants other inorganic salts and species present in urban stormwater can impact media performance for example particularly in subsurface systems the redox conditions are governed by inorganic species e g fe s and biological processes e g denitrification and respiration stormwater media incorporated into subsurface treatment systems could therefore potentially interact with these species and processes that typically contribute to low dissolved oxygen levels and anoxic conditions aqueous redox conditions can also impact the solubility of certain metals e g iron oxides can dissolve in anoxic conditions and the transformation and degradation of certain contaminants e g oxidation of trace organics and reduction of microorganisms metals grebel et al 2013 negatively charged adsorbent media used in stormwater remediation e g aluminosilicate clays activated carbon biochar can undergo interactions with divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 present in urban stormwater which often serve as bridges between anionic contaminants and the media divalent cation bridging was introduced by mckinney and edwards 1952 and tezuka 1969 as a mechanism for biological floc formation divalent cations bridge negatively charged functional groups within extracellular polymeric substances to aggregate and stabilize microbes a similar mechanism occurs between negatively charged surface functional groups on stormwater media divalent cations and anionic contaminants in stormwater promote adsorption of compounds such as phosphate qian et al 2013 polysaccharides dontsova and bigham 2005 and oils kobayashi et al 2017 for example per and poly fluoroalkyl substances have been demonstrated to form complexes with biochar and activated carbon through cationic bridging arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 divalent cations in urban stormwater infiltration systems where media is employed may also contribute to metals desorption e g during snow deicing huber et al 2016 4 2 2 co occurring organics doc and microbes high molecular weight negatively charged colloidal and hydrophobic organic species with numerous functional groups such as doc leenheer and croué 2003 can also impact media contaminant removal efficacy during urban stormwater treatment in bmps doc a component of natural organic matter is one of the most ubiquitous organic constituents in natural and engineered aquatic systems doc is notorious for adsorbing to media surfaces and competing with contaminants for adsorption sites davis 1982 newcombe et al 1997 passivation of media surfaces by doc could also reduce the lifetime of stormwater media and treatment efficacy the acidic functional groups of doc behave similarly to those of metal oxides by participating in complexation of trace metals reuter and perdue 1977 which may lead to enhanced contaminant removal if the metal complexed doc adsorbs to stormwater media surfaces ray et al 2019 during oxidative treatments e g scenarios involving application of manganese oxide coated sand media the presence of doc and its many aromatic and electron rich moieties can act as an electron shuttle to promote redox reactions kang and choi 2009 another important process impacting media performance is biological fouling particularly for carbonaceous stormwater media like activated carbon and biochar microbes like doc are ubiquitous in aquatic environments activated carbon and biochar are essentially carbon rich substrates that can act as a food source to promote biological growth and fouling of media surfaces weber et al 1978 biofouling of media surfaces will result in similar surface site passivation of stormwater media and reduce the long term removal of trace contaminants during treatment over time however the biofilm formation on media surfaces may contribute to media supported biodegradation of organic contaminants in urban stormwater in fact with thoughtful design known stormwater composition and redox conditions could be used to stimulate microbial growth using media like biochar 4 3 media quality assessments for field applicability the information in the preceding sections provide insight into the multitude of factors and attributes of stormwater and media associated with maximizing contaminant removal during urban stormwater treatment there is potential for media amendment in existing stormwater bmps to greatly increase contaminant removal during urban stormwater management trends of increasing annual precipitation in the united states sinha et al 2017 combined with the negative impacts of anthropogenic activity and frequency of extreme weather events e g floods schoof 2015 will result in more overflow events and will drive the need for improved urban runoff management in regions prone to water scarcity proper stormwater management can be leveraged to augment the urban water supply major cities are beginning to recognize the untapped potential of using urban runoff as a water resource investing millions of dollars to convert urban landscapes into stormwater capture basins and providing utility rebates to residences and commercial properties to financially incentivize urban stormwater capture bendor et al 2018 for example the city of los angeles and local stakeholders have partnered to transform an existing landfill in sun valley into the rory m shaw wetlands park project cost 22 5 million to address local flooding issues and to increase water conservation efforts hagekhalil et al 2014 the city of seattle public utilities offers a residential rainwise rebate program to single family residences to install cisterns for stormwater capture and other bmps such as rain gardens porous pavement and grass centered driveways to help reduce the damage caused by combined sewer overflow events tackett et al 2013 to help city planners and researchers determine if a media is suitable for de centralized urban stormwater treatment the authors recommend the following considerations and tests described in the following sections 4 3 1 characterization of media physicochemical properties the discussions of conventional and engineered media have included information regarding specific properties linked to contaminant removal table 2 if a new media is under consideration for a particular field application it is necessary to understand the physical and chemical properties of the media to predict interactions with water common stormwater matrix constituents and contaminants of interest recommended analytical methods for characterizing stormwater media are provided in table 4 it is important to note that the information of recommended analyses in this section is a limited view of many techniques available to characterize solid materials if the media is organic in nature e g compost activated carbon and biochar the carbon content and corresponding porosity will be key predictors of aqueous interactions including with contaminants as discussed previously the media feedstock has significant implications on the type of contaminants removed and the affinity of those contaminants to the media this is due in large part to the carbon content of the feed and the resulting aromaticity and porosity associated with the method of thermochemical i e pyrolysis processing for example a study by singh et al suggests that biochars produced from feedstocks with low carbon content e g manure and at low pyrolysis temperatures have 20 times less stability compared to biochars of high carbon content feeds and pyrolysis temperatures singh et al 2012 proximate analysis and elemental analysis provide important information regarding the composition of organic particularly carbonaceous media which is facilitated by tga weight loss measurements upon heating table 4 the available surface area and porosity can be obtained via brunauer emmett teller bet theory and analysis following elemental analysis if more information is desired regarding media aromaticity 13c nuclear magnetic resonance analysis can be performed for primarily inorganic media several techniques can be employed to characterize mineral phases and structural and chemical bonding environments which can provide insight into the cation exchange capacity and potential for complexation via acid base functional groups x ray techniques e g xrd and xrf table 4 provide structural and elemental composition information for inorganic materials with an atomic lattice structure there are several analytical techniques that are suitable for both organic and inorganic media making them particularly appropriate to characterize hybrid inorganic organic composite media xps and ftir provide surface chemistry and atomic bonding information which can help identify available functional groups for stormwater contaminant removal media surface charge is another useful physicochemical quality that can facilitate contaminant removal and other electrostatic interactions with common ions in stormwater media hydraulic conductivity and water permeability are other important properties that can help assess the suitability of media for contaminant removal during urban stormwater treatment particularly during stormwater infiltration applications for example a 30 month field study where biochar was amended in a sandy loam soil revealed that biochar resulted in increased local hydraulic conductivity and lower bulk density hardie et al 2014 if the media has low hydraulic conductivity then augmented stormwater bmps can become clogged during stormwater infiltration finally it may be desirable to determine the media s mechanical strength if stress and shear are a concern for the structural stability in certain bmps 4 3 2 recommended lab scale media studies lab scale studies provide practical and useful information of media behavior and performance particularly when field scale or pilot studies are too costly difficult or time consuming to execute many reports investigating media for stormwater and water treatment generally perform lab scale batch experiments to gauge media contaminant affinity kinetics and removal capacity e g isotherm experiments media behavior from batch studies can be informative to predict field performance however additional experiments may be required to more accurately assess media longevity and reactivity under field conditions one important lab scale experiment that should be considered for stormwater media is column infiltration in contrast to batch studies column studies allow media to continuously interact with a constant concentration of contaminants in the influent source this distinction is critical to determining the lifetime of a stormwater media continuous operation and contaminant treatment will be applicable regardless of whether the media is implemented in de centralized bmps for passive remediation or in designated treatment facilities near urban stormwater bmps column studies can mimic field conditions of stormwater infiltration to allow for prediction of media behavior during intermittent storm events mohanty et al 2013 2014 after long periods of drying and rehydration and media regeneration during backwashing 4 3 3 leaching and desorption for long term media stability in stormwater bmps it is important to determine the potential for leaching and desorption there are limited studies described in previous sections that examine contaminant desorption during stormwater treatment desorption is particularly troublesome for adsorption based media where contaminants may be loosely adsorbed via weak interactions such as electrostatic attraction or van der waals and hydrophobic interactions furthermore changes in stormwater composition can weaken contaminant chemisorption e g hydrogen bonding complexation and lead to contaminant desorption from media in stormwater bmps which will neutralize any benefits of media amendment to reduce contaminant loads to receiving waters in addition to contaminant desorption tests need to be conducted to determine if modifications to media surfaces will leach during stormwater infiltration for example a study on manganese oxide coated sand suggests that the coating can leach from the sand surface during infiltration releasing levels of dissolved manganese exceeding the epa recommended level charbonnet et al 2018 both analyses of leaching and desorption are easily performed by taking advantage of column studies measuring contaminant concentrations in column effluent and detecting the presence of media modifiers e g polymers after complete breakthrough has been achieved will indicate if desorption and or leaching has occurred to mitigate the potential for additional environmental and human risks it is important to consider the toxicities of media modification materials 5 conclusions this review presents an overview of physicochemical characteristics reactivities and interfacial properties of current and emerging media available to enhance contaminant removal of existing stormwater best management practices the international stormwater database reveals that the most commonly used and monitored bmps are grass swales retention ponds detention basins and wetland basins while these systems offer the potential to reduce runoff volume our data analysis indicates that bmps exhibit low removal efficiencies for many contaminants e g 40 for total n total p and cod furthermore the lack of information on organic contaminant occurrence and removal as well as the variability in the type and number of reporting sites pose a challenge in fully assessing the performance of bmps a variety of low cost materials have been tested for stormwater pollutant removal organic materials such as compost activated carbon and biochar possess surface functional groups favorable to adsorption of metals and trace organics although sand can maintain high hydraulic conductivity and effectively remove solids it displays low affinity for dissolved contaminants such as nutrients and organic contaminants clays and zeolites are often employed to remove metals in stormwater nutrients such as ammonium can be removed through ion exchange processes by zeolites novel engineered media that modify or combine these conventional media e g surfactant modified zeolites polymer clay composites metal oxide coated sands offer the benefit of enhancing stormwater pollutant removal without sacrificing hydraulic performance studies on conventional and emerging media discussed in this review showed promising results for stormwater treatment however additional physicochemical characteristics impacting media performance and longevity must also be considered for example media with a high water retention capacity could be more prone to flooding and clogging during high volume storm events ultimately resulting in a shorter lifetime additionally stormwater composition can impact pollutant removal by altering stormwater pollutants or the surface of the media 6 future research directions in order to develop smarter designs of engineered systems for stormwater treatment it is first crucial to improve our understanding of the relationship between media performance and hydrological factors such as intermittency of flow length of wet and dry periods and contaminant remobilization for example during extreme storm events levels of contaminants will be high and treatment efficiency in bmps will be reduced due to overwhelmed capacity in the paper modelling urban stormwater treatment a unified approach wong et al present an algorithmic model to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of storage facilities wetlands and ponds vegetated swales and infiltration systems sediments basins and biofilters operating under variable conditions wong et al 2006 the authors conclude that the fundamental physical processes occurring in these systems during storm events include i initial perception of contaminants through sedimentation and filtration and ii continuing flow attenuation and detention wong et al 2006 future research is necessary to build stormwater treatment systems that can be operated at different spatial and temporal scales of hydraulic loading the majority of the current studies on conventional media for stormwater treatment have been conducted in synthetic water matrices table 2 there is a need for additional studies to be conducted using real stormwater matrices because despite the high concentration and occurrence of certain common constituents e g fats oils and greases rank third in table 1 there is little research on the removal or impact of these constituents for instance only a few publications address the mechanisms employed by emerging engineered media to remove nutrients and nitrogenous compounds our synthesis of stormwater bmp data fig 1 showed low nutrient removal across all bmp categories yet few studies evaluate the addition of engineered media to bmps for the purpose of nutrient removal nitrogenous compound removal is impacted by nitrogen speciation and microbiological nitrification processes that transform the nitrogen species but do not remove it collins et al 2010 certain bmps designed to have high infiltration rates give rise to aerobic conditions favoring nitrification collins et al 2010 which could lead to increased nitrate concentrations in stormwater treatment systems additionally inputs of nitrogen in stormwater runoff are primarily in the form of dissolved nitrogen which is soluble and difficult to capture engineered media can promote the removal of nitrogenous compounds and nutrients through ion exchange processes and co precipitation with trace metals however depending on the corresponding solubility product the pollutant concentration may not decrease to levels that conform to water quality standards thus to gain a more comprehensive view of media performance in contaminant removal additional research on more realistic stormwater matrices containing representative pollutants e g nutrients fats oils greases is necessary few studies have focused on the durability and longevity of media intended for stormwater remediation or currently incorporated in existing stormwater bmp systems although some researchers have explored the impacts of regeneration and backwashing on increasing the lifetime of filtration media e g manganese oxide coated sand charbonnet et al 2018 al mg graphene oxide composites ahmadi et al 2018 base treated juniper media min et al 2007 there is a lack of published data from field studies to demonstrate the feasibility of these processes in real world applications further research on waste management and media reuse is necessary to compare the levelized cost and labor implications of incorporating stormwater media into existing bmps or replacing other remediation technologies factors such as media characteristics e g porosity surface area structural integrity and stormwater composition e g inorganic salts nutrients redox potential microbes and doc can influence media performance and longevity in order to fully assess the suitability and applicability of media material characterization analyses and column studies employing real stormwater matrices are needed few studies examine stormwater treatment by media in bmps in the united states at the pilot scale tian et al 2019 ashoori et al 2019 boving and neary 2007 erickson et al 2012 however it is this critical knowledge gap that limits deployment of media particularly engineered media in existing or new urban stormwater bmps for example until the media are scrutinized under more realistic field level conditions it is difficult to assess economic viability primary advantages and disadvantages with respect to contaminant sequestration and stormwater permeability and opportunities for reuse and regeneration of exhausted media more pilot studies are imperative before media can be utilized

17470,stormwater is a major component of the urban water cycle contributing to street flooding and high runoff volumes in urban areas and elevated contaminant concentrations in receiving waters from

graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban stormwater media best management practices contaminant removal 1 introduction stormwater management in urban areas has become a growing challenge for civil and environmental engineers and city planners increases in population urbanization and impervious surface coverage have led to subsequent increases in surface runoff volume hogan and walbridge 2007 and decreases in local stormwater infiltration during natural and managed aquifer recharge berndtsson 2010 lack of appropriate stormwater management practices results in overflow of urban stormwater into receiving waters streets and building basements during storm events areas with combined sewer systems experience greater raw sewage and stormwater runoff during overflow events fig s1 in addition to high volumes of surface runoff and sewer overflow another consequence of poorly managed and untreated urban stormwater is that it acts as a major pollution source to receiving waters due to elevated contaminant concentrations table 1 after storm events hazardous contaminants in stormwater runoff are transported to local groundwater and surface water via interactions with impermeable surfaces e g roads roofs etc and chemically treated greenways e g lawns parks etc göbel et al 2007 contaminant groups typically found in urban stormwater include suspended solids and particulate associated e g bacteria organic and dissolved e g nutrients metals ionic salts organic compounds species göbel et al 2007 houtz and sedlak 2012 zgheib et al 2012 spahr et al 2020 some sources of these contaminants include deposits from the atmosphere roofing materials metal pipes and gutters pavement emissions from combustion engines tire brake pad abrasion gasoline oil brake fluid göbel et al 2007 houtz and sedlak 2012 zgheib et al 2012 spahr et al 2020 biocides fertilizers and flame retardants spahr et al 2020 the national stormwater quality database compiled a list of commonly detected stormwater contaminants in table 1 we highlight representative contaminants and their concentrations suspended solids lead to increased turbidity and the build up of sediments in receiving waters shammaa and zhu 2001 which impact the quality of these waters nutrients in urban stormwater runoff houtz and sedlak 2012 which contribute to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication paerl et al 2016 was recently the second largest cause of united states water impairment affecting over 7 000 water bodies epa 2016 additionally the presence of metals and organic and biological contaminants in urban stormwater runoff can pollute receiving waters and pose risks to aquatic and human health grebel et al 2013 houtz and sedlak 2012 stormwater best management practices bmps offer a practical solution to reduce surface runoff volume and street flooding and provide some level of contaminant removal architects city planners and engineers are thoughtfully implementing permeable pavement rain gardens and bioretention tackett et al 2013 and bioinfiltration basins deletic and fletcher 2006 grebel et al 2013 elliott and trowsdale 2007 to promote local groundwater recharge and prevent runoff backup in cities with high impervious surface coverage other countries including the united states may classify these systems as low impact developments or green stormwater infrastructure for this review we will refer to stormwater infrastructure as bmps existing bmps designed for filtration e g bioretention systems wetlands sand filters and vegetated channels typically employ native soil vegetation and or sand in their designs which help convey urban runoff from the street and retain large particulates fig 1 collins et al 2010 grebel et al 2013 in regions of water scarcity other bmp options include urban stormwater capture by businesses and residences to create a local water source for non potable applications such as landscape irrigation nnadi et al 2015 chong et al 2013 unfortunately bmps may be ineffective in reducing dissolved concentrations of nutrients organic compounds metals and other contaminants in urban stormwater because they are primarily designed to mitigate impacts of high water volume during overflow events and to remove suspended solids and large particles fig 1 a shows the performance of common stormwater bmps reporting the influent and effluent concentrations of various pollutants during urban storm events there is a wide range in the total number of bmp sites reporting measurements in the database 24 grass swales 44 detention basins 66 retention ponds and 92 wetland basins the majority of the bmps in the database are located in the united states and the most common bmp sites reporting pollutant concentration data are retention ponds and wetland basins fig 1 a across all bmp categories there is large variability in the number of total reporting sites for each chemical parameter for example approximately 200 bmp sites report concentrations of phosphorus total p and total suspended solids tss whereas less than 25 bmp sites report chemical oxygen demand cod levels the median removal efficiency ranges for the reported chemical parameters across all bmp categories are as follows nitrogen total n 14 25 cod 16 26 total p 10 38 total pb 37 52 total zn 51 59 and tss 46 64 fig 1 b for total n total p and cod the median removal efficiency in all selected bmp categories is less than 40 fig 1 suggests that 1 more data is needed to accurately validate compare and predict bmp contaminant removal capabilities 2 bmp treatment efficacy is not reported for certain contaminants i e especially trace organic compounds table s1 and 3 there is an opportunity and need to enhance the removal efficiency of all urban stormwater contaminants amending existing bmps with media can enhance contaminant removal from urban runoff while promoting groundwater recharge and reducing discharge volume during overflow events additionally media amendments are a more cost effective option for enhanced contaminant removal when designing new and or maintaining existing stormwater infrastructure particularly where physical space is limited in urban areas when combined with conventional media novel engineered media can further reduce levels of contamination in urban stormwater runoff to surface water or recharged groundwater efficient planning and heavy financial support from cities and states is often required to achieve these goals to better inform decisions made by engineers and city planners regarding improved management safer discharge or infiltration of urban stormwater a synthesis and critical review of available stormwater media is needed in this review we present an overview of conventional and emerging engineered media for stormwater treatment in urban areas where space constraints and contamination from industrial and other anthropogenic sources complicate stormwater management these media types are further divided into organic and inorganic media and composite media classifications for engineered media we discuss physicochemical properties of inorganic organic and composite materials affecting contaminant removal and present opportunities to functionalize media for targeting specific contaminants and or enhancing removal it is important to consider that the specific physicochemical properties of media may vary depending on how the media is prepared or synthesized to better elucidate how media can be incorporated into existing and future stormwater infrastructure we highlight key factors impacting contaminant removal e g media characteristics stormwater hydrology and composition and provide recommendations for lab scale media tests and material characterization we conclude the review by providing insight into some potential challenges and uncertainties associated with performance and implementation of engineered media for stormwater management applications 2 conventional stormwater remediation media here we highlight research conducted in the united states to assess the potential of different conventional media for stormwater pollutant removal a majority of the studies were conducted using synthetic stormwater in lab scale column and batch experiments and a few studies report contaminant removal in columns treating real urban stormwater under field conditions table s1 fig 2 reports the removal efficiencies of conventional media used to treat various stormwater contaminants with a primary primary focus on the removal of nutrients and metals a majority of the media categories exhibit a high removal efficiency 75 for solids volatile and total suspended solids there are notable differences between the types of contaminants removed and the nature of the media for example inorganic media like zeolites and iron based media have similar removal efficiencies for solids pathogens nutrients metals and hydrocarbons whereas wh organic media have higher removal efficiencies for organic contaminants in contrast to both organic and other inorganic media sand has a lower removal efficiency with respect to organic contaminants excluding hydrocarbons metals nutrients and pathogens across all media categories similar removal efficiencies were observed for hydrocarbons while nutrient removal varied across media categories 2 1 organic materials multiple studies have evaluated the application of organic materials such as compost mulch wood activated carbon biochar peat and agricultural wastes for stormwater treatment ashoori et al 2019 boving and neary 2007 boving and zhang 2004 clark 2000 erickson et al 2016 faucette et al 2013 jang et al 2005 johnson et al 2003 mohanty et al 2014 ray et al 2006 ray et al 2005 2019 reddy krishna et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2016 silvertooth et al 2015 syring et al 2009 tobiason et al 2002 ulrich et al 2015 2017 van lienden et al 2010 zhou et al 2003 the retention and removal of stormwater pollutants by carbonaceous media is aided by their high organic matter content and reactive functional groups e g carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl phenolic amino and sulfonyl for example metals removal by organic media was hypothesized to correlate to the amount of oxygen containing moieties e g carboxyl and hydroxyl present on the surface mohanty et al 2018 reddy krishna et al 2014 the large degree of hydrophobicity and porosity of organic media can also facilitate removal of organic compounds wu et al 2013 organic media can also improve biotransformation of organic contaminants by serving as excellent substrates for microbial growth 2 1 1 biochar in our review of stormwater treatment media literature we found that biochar was the most well studied media with reports covering a wide range of stormwater contaminants fig 2 tables 2 and s2 biochar and activated carbon are among the most commonly used organic materials for water treatment applications chars possess large porosities and acidic functional groups which respectively enable them to remove organic compounds via diffusion inyang and dickenson 2015 and metals via complexation uchimiya et al 2010 chars are produced from raw biomass with a high content of readily available carbon biochar is produced through low oxygen thermochemical processing of raw biomass which increases the overall surface area and number of active sites for the diffusion and adsorption of pollutants ahmad et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018 activated carbon requires additional processing steps employing oxygen or strong acids to activate the charred biomass ahmad et al 2014 mohanty et al 2018 variations in the physical and chemical properties of different precursor biomass feeds and thermochemical conditions used to produce biochar and activated carbon impact their removal capacities for different contaminants mohanty et al 2018 ulrich et al 2017 van lienden et al 2010 for example batch adsorption experiments conducted under the same conditions show that despite the lower surface area of granular activated carbon gac produced from rice byproducts it has higher affinity to cu and zn than nutshell sourced gac van lienden et al 2010 additionally mohanty et al observed that low temperature biochar exhibited greater removal of e coli during stormwater infiltrationand only 1 remobilization after intermittent flow compared to 3 remobilization using high temperature biochar mohanty et al 2014 biochar is particularly effective at removing organic contaminants and pathogens figs 2 and 3 many of which are persistent in stormwater bmps afrooz and boehm 2017 spahr et al 2020 ulrich et al and ray et al evaluated biochar produced from gasification of pinewood for the simultaneous removal of multiple organic contaminants in synthetic stormwater matrices ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2015 ray et al used a biochar dose of 3 wt amended with sand for column filtration of a synthetic stormwater solution containing 10 µg l each of seven representative organic contaminants and observed complete removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate diuron fipronil perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid select organic compounds shown in fig 3 a1 and 80 100 atrazine removal ray et al 2019 the presence of dissolved organic carbon doc 5 mg c l in a mirrored study did not significantly alter the performance of biochar during treatment fig 3 a2 ulrich et al also reported 70 100 removal of prometon benzotriazole atrazine diuron and tris 3 chloro 2 propyl phosphate for over 428 pore volumes with initial contaminant concentrations of 20 µg l each and 10 mg c l doc using a biochar dose of only 0 2 wt ulrich et al 2015 these studies suggest that the biochar high surface area 351 m2 g and functional groups were enough to overcome competing sorption and complexation site occupation by organic compounds doc and or metals select metals shown in figs 3 a1and 3 a2 the high removal 99 of these metals except as and cr and organic contaminants suggest that multiple stormwater contaminants can be effectively and simultaneously removed if a sufficiently large surface area 300 m2 g biochar is used the large hydrophobic biochar surface area also provides an anchor for pathogens like e coli to attach overcoming electrostatic repulsive forces and facilitating efficient removal during stormwater infiltration mohanty et al 2014 while biochar exhibits moderate to high removal efficiency 50 for most contaminants figs 2 and 3 more research is needed to better predict removal of contaminants with different phases and under more realistic stormwater conditions several studies have evaluated biochar s ability to remove multiple types of contaminants simultaneously ashoori et al 2019 ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 for example reddy al evaluated the simultaneous removal of nutrients no3 and tp metals cd cr cu pb ni and zn and hydrocarbons phenanthrene naphthalene and benzo a pyrene by biochar in synthetic stormwater reddy krishna et al 2014 a stormwater matrix containing a mixture of contaminants would be a more realistic assessment of biochar performance allowing for better comparison of removal efficiencies of different contaminant categories as previously discussed stormwater contaminants can exist as dissolved species and particulate associated species therefore the removal of some contaminants e g nutrients organic compounds and metals can be dictated by the behavior of particles in the stormwater and in the treatment systems for example organic contaminants and metals can react with natural organic matter nom to form nom complexes and metals can form precipitates with sulfate sulfides and phosphate species although removal of solids by organic media such as biochar and gac was evaluated in some studies reddy krishna et al 2014 silvertooth et al 2015 syring et al 2009 zhou et al 2003 table s2 further analysis is needed to assess the fraction of the solids associated with other dissolved stormwater contaminants 2 1 2 compost based media compost has high humic content which can promote removal of metals through complexation and removal of organic compounds through hydrophobic interactions clark 2000 although compost alone has demonstrated capability of reducing stormwater runoff volume reinsch et al 2007 the possible leaching of organic matter and nutrients during high volume storm events makes compost an ineffective media to mitigate this issue compost can be mixed with media such as biochar or activated carbon which have a higher affinity to retain leached compounds fig 2 shows that the removal of nutrients by compost based media ranges from 9 to 71 the low removal efficiences were obtained in studies using only compost faucette et al 2013 whereas the high removal efficiencies were obtained when compost was amended with either biochar or activated carbon ulrich et al 2017 for example ulrich et al reported that the addition of biochar to vegetated biofilters containing a mixture of sand and compost prevented leaching of total organic carbon toc total dissolved phosphate tdp and total nitrogen tn and increased diuron and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate removal by 6 and 83 ulrich et al 2017 removal of toc tdp tn and no3 also increased by 80 73 86 and 68 respectively in the presence of biochar ulrich et al 2017 2 1 3 woodchips based media woodchips are readily available and primarily used in denitrifying bioreactors for stormwater wastewater and agricultural drainage treatment ashoori et al 2019 halaburka et al 2017 peterson et al 2015 woodchips can act as a source of carbon and as electron donors for denitrifying microorganisms for example ashoori et al reported a 99 removal efficiency of no3 in column experiments employing woodchips which also assessed removal of metals cu cd pb ni and zn and organic contaminants diuron 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate 1h benzotriazole atrazine and fipronil in stormwater ashoori et al 2019 the authors reported average removal efficiencies of 80 94 for metals with the exception of zn which exhibited poorer removal 45 these estimates were similar to the removal efficiencies observed when biochar was added at 33 wt to the woodchips the retention of metals was attributed to the formation of metal sulfide precipitates in the presence of woodchips ashoori et al 2019 in contrast the addition of biochar enhanced removal of the organic contaminants adsorption isotherm experiments revealed that woodchips sorption affinity towards the contaminants was significantly lower than the biochar sorption affinity the linear kd sorption coefficient was estimated at 10 20 l kg for woodchips and 105 106 l kg for biochar thus the application of a woodchips biochar mixture in stormwater treatment systems can ensure the simultaneous removal of several contaminants e g no3 metals and organic contaminants however a thorough analysis will be needed to choose an appropriate biochar woodchips are an efficient media because they have an extended bedlife however in this study ashoori et al reported that biochar decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the system by more than two fold i e 2 1 cm s in woodchips only columns and 0 5 cm s in woodchips biochar columns ashoori et al 2019 this decrease in hydraulic conductivity could lead to frequent clogging during stormwater infiltration overall current literature suggests that organic media can effectively capture stormwater contaminants nevertheless a more complete analysis of their performance and potential for stormwater treatment applications is needed 2 2 inorganic materials in this review the inorganic conventional media considered are mineral based materials such as sand zeolite metal hydr oxides and other metal based materials e g iron filings the presence of ionic species and acidic moieties on the surface of these materials promotes sorption via electrostatic interactions and or complexation of charged species such as nutrients e g no3 nh4 po4 3 metals and organic contaminants 2 2 1 sand coarse and silica based materials like sand offer functional advantages to stormwater treatment systems because of their high hydraulic conductivities and ability to strain solids during infiltration beginning in the 1980s the city of austin tx started using sand filters as an alternative bmp clark 2000 equipped with a sedimentation basin designed to retain and slowly release stormwater runoff i e 90 of 24 h storm events barrett michael 2003 since then sand filters have been commonly adopted in cities across the united states e g washington dc and seattle wa for stormwater management they have a small land area requirement which makes them convenient to use especially for small development sites urbonas 1994 zarezadeh et al 2018 pollutant removal by sand filters is characterized by physical filtration sedimentation and straining clark 2000 clark and pitt 2012 both labscale and field studies have been used to evaluate sand s ability to remove stormwater contaminants sand filters constructed near roadways in populous industrial cities exhibited high removal efficiency of stormwater solids 86 94 barrett michael 2003 zarezadeh et al 2018 similar results indicating high i e 98 tss removal in lab scale filters were also observed prabhukumar et al 2015 removal of other contaminants by sand especially metals varies greatly fig 2 and depends upon metal speciation ray et al ulrich et al and prabhukumar et al reported removal efficiencies greater than 80 for dissolved cu for different influent concentrations in lab scale column experiments prabhukumar et al 2015 ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 in contrast barret identified only a 6 and 39 reduction of dissolved cu and pb concentrations by sand filters and 33 and 86 removal of total cu and total pb barrett michael e 2003 these conflicting findings suggest the need for more studies to assess removal efficiencies of different phases and speciation of contaminants during stormwater treatment the limited affinity of sand for dissolved contaminants is reflected in its low removal of organic contaminants fig 2 3 a2 and b2 ray et al and ulrich et al reported removal efficiencies ranging from 0 to 47 for polar organic contaminants ray et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 fig 2 shows that sand can efficiently remove some hydrocarbons however these results were obtained from lab scale studies prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy krishna et al 2014b conducted under simplistic conditions using high contaminant concentrations which are not representative of typical concentrations found in natural stormwater tables 1 ands1 for example batch experiments conducted by reddy et al using sand and a synthetic solution of phenanthrene 30 1900 µg l and naphthalene 900 43 000 µg l reported a removal efficiency of more than 90 for both compounds at all concentrations reddy krishna et al 2014b a survey of different runoff events in the united states estimated the maximum concentrations of phenanthrene and naphthalene in urban runoff at 1 and 29 µg l respectively masoner et al 2019 a study with lower field relevant organic compound concentrations is necessary to properly assess sand removal capacity for these compounds the aforementioned studies and results in fig 2 suggest that sand alone will be ineffective for urban stormwater treatment containing dissolved contaminants and a wide variety of other contaminants 2 2 2 clays and zeolites clay minerals and zeolites are naturally occurring minerals with great potential for water and wastewater treatment due to their high surface area high affinity and selectivity for metals low cost abundance and low toxicity studies investigating the utilization of clay minerals as treatment media for stormwater have focused primarily on zeolites both clays and zeolites can be purchased and synthesized at the laboratory scale li et al 2016 xie et al 2013 which offers the advantage of being readily available fig 2 shows that zeolites have moderate to high affinity for solids pathogens metals nutrients and hydrocarbons zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates with high surface area ion exchange capacity and water retention capacity smith 2011 their high surface area provides an abundance of active sites onto which pollutants can adsorb the porous and molecular sieve characteristic of zeolites can promote the structural sequestration and intraparticle diffusion of stormwater contaminants such as small neutral organic compounds clark 2000 jiang et al 2018 zeolites with high silica content are favorable for the sorption of some organic contaminants e g pharmaceuticals pesticides due to their high si al ratio which promotes strong hydrophobic interactions between zeolite surfaces and organic contaminants jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 the si4 and al3 in the structural framework of zeolites creates a net negative charge that attracts common stormwater cations e g ca2 mg2 na and k which can be exchanged with cationic trace metals uddin 2017 wang and peng 2010 for example prabhukumar et al reported a removal efficiency of 78 96 for cationic metals cd cu ni pb and zn by zeolite as opposed to a removal efficiency of 55 for anionic cr prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy et al also observed low removal efficiencies 5 9 of cr reddy et al 2014a the permanent negative surface charge of zeolites leads to the repulsion of negatively charged species thus limiting their sorption clark 2000 while promoting the sorption of positively charged species however in zeolites with high silica content the minimal negative charge limits their sorption capacity for cations instead zeolites with high silica content can be used for the sorption of some organic contaminants their high si al ratio promotes strong hydrophobic interactions between their surfaces and organic contaminants jiang et al 2018 2020 zeolites are also good candidates for nutrient removal and denitrification in stormwater fig 2 zeolites can sequester nh4 through ion exchange and no3 and po4 3 through formation of metal complexes and precipitates additionally their large surface area and ion exchange capacity promotes the attachment of microorganisms he et al 2007 smith 2011 enhancing denitrification a pilot study evaluating the performance of zeolite as a biofiltration media for nh4 removal observed that the average initial nh4 level 0 78 mg l decreased by 93 under steady flow operation and by 98 during a high flow event followed by a 40 d dry period smith 2011 a close monitoring of the nitrogen and oxygen profiles in the biofilter showed that as levels of nh4 and oxygen declined no3 and no2 increased in the effluent which suggests that nitrification occurred a parallel sand control biofilter in the same study exhibited an average removal efficiency of 87 for nh4 both biofilters accumulated similar amounts of no3 and no2 suggesting that in addition to denitrification nh4 could be removed through ion exchange in the zeolite biofilter compared to zeolite sand has much lower surface area and cation exchange capacity grebel et al 2013 which limit adsorption sites and ion exchange processes occurring at the sand surface this study indicates that zeolite can sustain performance through typical storm events making it an excellent media candidate for stormwater infiltration systems where nh4 removal is the main priority 2 2 3 iron based media like zeolites iron based materials exhibit high removal efficiencies for solids pathogens metals nutrients and hydrocarbons fig 2 metal oxides and metal based materials are useful for the attenuation of metal contaminants ernst et al 2016 prabhukumar et al 2015 reddy et al 2014a reddy et al 2014b because of chemical properties that facilitate ion exchange surface precipitation redox and complexation processes farley et al 1985 gadde and laitinen 1974 ugwu and igbokwe 2019 for example reddy et al report removal efficiencies of 51 100 for cd cu pb ni cr and zn in batch experiments using a synthetic stormwater solution and iron filings byproducts of the grinding or milling of iron material primarily consisting of iron hydr oxide minerals reddy et al 2014a prabukhumar et al also reported similar removal efficiency 57 100 during column experiments using iron filings prabhukumar et al 2015 these high removal efficiencies could be due to the high initial concentrations 5 500 mg l of the metals used in these studies in contrast column experiments using natural highway runoff to assess granular ferric hydroxide capacity to remove metals report average removal efficiencies of 14 and 34 for cu initial concentration 36 µg l and zn initial concentration 50 µg l ernst et al 2016 breakthrough i e the ratio of influent to effluent concentration c c0 0 for both cu and zn occurred within 5 000 pore volumes but the media was not saturated within the duration of the experimental period 98 000 pore volumes ernst et al 2016 compared to sand and zeolites iron based media exhibit greater removal efficiencies for nutrients fig 2 mixtures of sand and iron filings at doses of 7 2 and 10 7 wt along the trenches of a wet detention basin reduced po4 3 concentrations by 29 90 erickson et al 2012 erickson et al also conducted column experiments with different doses of iron filings in the absence of iron filings sand sorption capacity for po4 3 was exhausted at a column depth less than 10 m whereas a 5 wt iron filing dose did not result in the exhaustion of the media sorption capacity even after 200 m of treated depth furthermore the author reported that the hydraulic conductivity in the iron sand columns did not change significantly as the iron filings fraction increased from 0 3 to 5 wt thus iron filings can be applied in bmps e g bioretention ponds grass swales where po4 3 removal is low fig 1 to minimize risk of po4 3 leaching the limited reactivity of sand to dissolved contaminants resulted in minimal sorption of po4 3 in the erickson et al study erickson et al 2012 in contrast to sand the high surface area of iron based media and other metal oxides present numerous active sites for the adsorption of po4 3 which can sorb to iron filings through the formation of iron phosphate precipitates or ligand exchange with iron hydr oxides grebel et al 2013 reddy et al 2013 overall zeolites and iron based media possess great potential for pollutant removal and using them in stormwater treatment systems would ensure better water quality however they reportedly have low hydraulic conductivities compared to sand hsieh and davis 2005 this could lead to rapid clogging flooding and inhibition of groundwater recharge careful considerations like these are needed in choosing media for stormwater treatment in section 4 we discuss the influence of media properties in greater detail 3 composite engineered media for enhanced urban stormwater treatment to maximize the removal of trace contaminants in urban stormwater and protect receiving waters conventional materials may not be sufficient researchers are testing new low cost engineered materials as supplements to enhance the contaminant removal efficiency of conventional materials composite materials can take advantage of surface functional groups or chemical properties of a substrate by coating doping or decorating it with a material of different properties to enhance performance or add utility typically the goal of composite fabrication is to expand the range of contaminants removed in urban stormwater and other water treatment applications this section will identify the synthesis properties contaminant removal mechanisms and opportunities for field deployment of different engineered media evaluated for urban stormwater treatment 3 1 metal oxide composite engineered media as outlined in section 2 conventional inorganic media such as metal oxides clays and sand exhibit some affinity for urban stormwater contaminant removal however currently there are several limitations to incorporating these media in urban stormwater bmps for example metal oxides and clays typically occur as amorphous flocs or powder which may clog infiltration systems during storm events or transport adsorbed or complexed contaminants downstream to receiving waters although sand can offer benefits of metal sorption and high hydraulic conductivity in infiltration applications ray et al 2019 its reactivity is limited to inorganic species in urban stormwater development of engineered media can help overcome the moderate to low reactivity and feasability of conventional inorganic media while enhancing reactivity during urban stormwater treatment 3 1 1 iron hydr oxide coated sand in addition to trace metal removal naturally occurring iron hydr oxides can also aid in the attenuation and immobilization of fecal indicator bacteria which is one of the main classes of contaminants in urban stormwater table 1 fe iii mineral phases adhere to bacteria cell walls creating bacteria iron oxide flocs delaire et al 2016 and enabling subsequent redox reactions to inactivate the immobilized bacteria giannakis et al 2018 in urban stormwater infiltration applications cell adhesion to iron hydr oxides and adsorption of trace metals can be an effective pollutant removal strategy however because iron oxides typically occur as powders or flocs in soils it is impractical to employ them as filtration media for runoff treatment to facilitate their use as a reactive media in existing urban stormwater management practices researchers have investigated coating iron hydr oxides on conventional media to augment bmps zhang et al 2010 amorphous iron iii oxyhydroxides synthesized by slowly increasing the ph of a ferric solution e g ferric chloride can be easily coated onto granular media substrates like sand knapp et al 1998 mills et al 1994 coating iron hydr oxides on sand increases its ability for trace contaminant removal without sacrificing hydraulic conductivity which is critical for stormwater infiltration applications for example mohanty et al designed bioinfiltration cells i e columns amended with iron hydr oxide coated sand to sequester fecal indicator bacteria from simulated stormwater mohanty et al 2013 even at a 50 wt sand to iron hydr oxide coated sand loading 99 of e coli and 97 of enterococcus faecalis initial concentration of both bacteria 0 8 1 8 106 cfu ml were removed from synthetic stormwater compared to 70 and 58 removal with just sand amended bioinfiltration systems furthermore when flow of bacteria laden simulated stormwater was paused and resumed to mimic intermittent flow less than 0 25 of attached bacteria were mobilized from the iron hydr oxide coated sand columns compared to up to 13 2 mobilization of bacteria attached to uncoated sand in a column filtration study zhang et al observed no breakthrough of e coli in synthetic stormwater from lab scale columns packed with iron hydr oxide coated sand for over 6 h of filtration while breakthrough was observed in only 0 75 h in sand amended columns zhang et al 2010 columns in this study were operated at hydraulic conditions comparable to a typical storm event with no evidence of clogging while iron hydr oxide coated sand contributed to greater bacterial removal 87 columns packed with conventional bioretention media i e sand resulted in 69 removal at a faster bacterial death rate i e 0 90 d 1 compared to the reactive engineered media columns 0 04 d 1 this effect was attributed to the lack of native microorganisms competing for nutrients on the iron hydr oxide coated sands compared to the conventional media which was inoculated with a native culture iron hydr oxide coated sand has also been investigated for trace metal adsorption sansalone prepared iron hydr oxide coated sand for passive removal of cu zn cd and pb trace metals in an exfiltration trench capturing urban stormwater sansalone 1999 test columns amended with sand and coated sand were used to determine trace metal removal in deionized water and real stormwater containing suspended solids which can complex trace metals herngren et al 2005 virgin sand column breakthrough i e c c0 0 90 of metals in deionized water ph 6 5 occurred 10 times as fast for zn and cd and 25 times as fast for cu and pb compared to iron hydr oxide coated sand this effect was exaggerated when the solution ph was increased above the point of zero charge for the iron hydr oxide coating ph 7 0 8 0 promoting favorable electrostatic interactions between the divalent cations and negatively charged coated sand the lifetime of the iron hydr oxide coated sand tested under the conditions in the sansalone study was approximated at 15 years to provide city planners civil and structural engineers and urban landscape architects with adequate information to deploy engineered media like iron hydr oxide coated sand additional research is needed for example even though the studies were conducted with the intended application of employing iron hydr oxide coated sand in infiltration systems none of the studies report hydraulic conductivity or a comparable relevant parameter though because the engineered media substrate i e sand has a high hydraulic conductivity it is reasonable to assume that introducing iron hydr oxide coated sand into existing infiltration systems would not reduce stormwater permeability to determine the expected lifetime and reactivity of iron hydr oxide coated sands more information is needed on trace metal adsorption capacity and bacterial removal or inactivation under a wider range of stormwater conditions this includes information about the iron hydr oxide coating stability because trace metals adsorbed onto iron hydr oxide coatings may be transported downstream if the coating leaches from sand surfaces over time 3 1 2 manganese oxide coated sand similar to iron hydr oxides manganese oxides are abundant naturally occurring and can undergosurface complexation with trace metals e g pb cu cd via hydroxide functional groups at their microporous surface al degs et al 2000 farley et al 1985 wang et al 2012 in addition to interactions with trace metals manganese oxides can undergo redox reactions with organic compounds in aquatic environments for example humic and fulvic acids as well as simple phenols can reduce mn iv oxides in natural waters to mn ii phases stone and morgan 1984 sunda and kieber 1994 this inherent property of manganese oxides has been exploited through its use as a substrate for trace organic compound oxidation mn iii mn iv oxide catalysts have been investigated in the oxidation of organic compounds such as toluene santos et al 2010 anilines hydroquinones laha and luthy 1990 and antibiotics song et al 2019 in water like their iron hydr oxide counterparts powdered amorphous manganese oxide mineral phases can be precipitated onto sand support media using a reductive synthesis to facilitate employment in infiltration systems in fact dissolved mn2 in raw feed water can be oxidized to mn4 and coated on sand grains in trickling filters during wastewater treatment gouzinis et al 1998 the subsequent mn iv o2 coating catalyzes additional oxidation of nearby mn2 facilitating manganese removal morgan 1967 to expedite mn iv o2 coatings on sand grains a solution of potassium permanganate is added to sand and reduced by addition of an acid e g hydrochloric acid foroughi et al 2013 han et al 2006 tiwari et al 2011 to achieve a birnessite i e a mixed mn iii mn iv phase manganese oxide coated sand grebel et al 2016 manganese oxide coated sand has been investigated as both an adsorbent media for trace metal removal charbonnet et al 2020 guha et al 2001 han et al 2006 and as a heterogeneous oxidation media for trace organic compound degradation in urban stormwater charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 liu et al compared the sorptive removal of pb cu cd and zn in synthetic runoff by sand iron oxide coated sand and manganese oxide coated sand liu et al 2005 both the engineered sand media had higher exhaustion capacities i e metal loading on geomedia at c c0 0 9 than uncoated sand for all trace metals under the same experimental conditions exhaustion capacities for pb cd and zn were at least twice as high on iron hydr oxide coated sands than on manganese oxide coated sand due to differences in metal affinities during surface complexation table 3 in comparison to both coated sands commercial gac underperformed with respect to trace metal removal tiwari et al similarly reported a combined effect of adsorption and co precipitation of cu and pb species on manganese oxide coated sand surfaces at neutral ph tiwari et al 2011 grebel et al demonstrated the range of oxidation rates of representative runoff trace organic compounds by birnessite manganese oxide coated sand in column filtration studies grebel et al 2016 for example reaction rate constants ranged from 1 8 x 10 3 l g s for bisphenol a to 66 7 x 10 9 l g s for diuron further investigation of this particular manganese oxide coated sand in synthetic stormwater free of doc corroborated previous findings demonstrating high removal efficiency of cu and pb i e c c0 0 for over 2 000 pore volumes and very low removal efficiency of zn and cd i e c c0 1 in 1 000 pore volumes charbonnet et al 2020 observed decreases in metal removal by manganese oxide coated sand due to doc addition were attributed to complexation of doc with trace metals and not to loss of adsorption sites on sand surfaces charbonnet et al have also provided important information regarding the stability of the manganese oxide coating charbonnet et al 2018 the coating density of manganese oxide coated sand decreased from 2 mg mn g media for native media to 1 7 mg mn g for spent media after treating 1 300 pore volumes of bisphenol a in a synthetic stormwater matrix this reduction in coating density indicated that approximately 6 4 mg mn was released exceeding the 0 91 µm epa secondary drinking water standard epa 2019 because manganese oxide and iron hydr oxide coated sands remove trace metals using similar mechanisms it is possible that leached mn and by extension fe may act as mobile carriers transporting adsorbed trace metals downstream 3 1 3 phoslock high nutrient loads originating from stormwater runoff to receiving waters is a growing concern in the increasingly urban landscapes across the united states adyel et al 2016 for example a study in st paul minnesota revealed that urban watersheds exhibit high phosphorus retention due to high street density and transport via stormwater runoff hobbie et al 2017 recent studies have found that controlling and reducing phosphorus loads rather than nitrogen is key to mitigating harmful algal blooms and eutrophication in surface waters schindler et al 2016 to reduce phosphorus loads to receiving waters from urban runoff phoslock a commercially available phosphorus adsorbent could be considered as an engineered media amendment in existing urban stormwater bmps phoslock is a bentonite clay complexed with lanthanum a rare earth metal haghseresht et al 2009 the la3 forms stable complexes with phosphate in water xie et al 2014 which can effectively reduce phosphate concentrations in surface waters prone to eutrophication fig 4 when applied to surface waters phoslock complexes free phosphate ions as it travels through the water column to the sediment bed surface regulating phosphorus release from the lake bed and limiting excess growth of phytoplankton spears et al 2013 because phoslock was designed for surface water applications there are limited studies investigating its use as a filtration media for urban stormwater treatment randall et al examined phoslock amendments in vegetated bioretention cell mesocosms to treat synthetic stormwater randall and bradford 2013 the hydraulic conductivity of phoslock amended mesocosms was significantly lower than mesocosms amended with sand alum and a commercial oxide coated media during down flow operation interestingly sand phoslock mesocosms had much higher removal efficiencies for orthophosphate 85 than for total phosphorus 34 which was better removed by sand only mesocosms 76 the poor removal efficiency of total phosphorus by sand phoslock mesocosms was attributed to the formation of fe po4 complexes which reduced the amount of free phosphate in urban stormwater but promoted phosphorus release from organic carbon decomposition in the bioretention soil however phoslock amended mesocosms had the highest nitrate removal efficiencies i e 98 due to increased denitrification under the anoxic conditions generated in the bioretention columns to our knowledge the 2013 randal and bradford study is the only peer reviewed article employing phoslock as an engineered urban stormwater media randall and bradford 2013 other reports examining phoslock application to surface waters identify potential negative ecological consequences associated with deployment of phoslock in natural systems for example there have been several documented studies identifying negative toxicological effects to daphnia magna a representative zooplankton controlling phytoplankton growth in surface waters slijkerman et al 2004 when la3 is leached during phoslock treatment of phosphorus rich waters lürling and tolman 2010 further investigation of safety and other environmental concerns is needed before phoslock amendments are considered for urban stormwater treatment 3 2 organic coated composite engineered media many studies have proposed the creation of layered treatment zones kim et al 2018 sun et al 2020 xiong et al 2019 using combinations of conventional media engineered materials or hybrid composite materials for water treatment applications jing et al 2013 su 2017 upadhyay et al 2014 however due to limitations associated with certain media e g hydraulic conductivity in this section we only describe a few viable candidates for stormwater treatment applications 3 2 1 modified graphene oxide coated sand graphene oxides are single layer trigonal planar sp2 carbon nanosheets decorated with epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal planes and carboxylic acid groups along the edges marcano et al 2010 produced from chemical exfoliation of oxidized graphite minerals graphene oxides have high reactive surface area increased hydrophilicity li et al 2008 and are conducive to additional functionalization dreyer et al 2010 as a result graphene oxides are used in a wide variety of applications including biosensors chung et al 2013 enhanced electron transport in electrochemical systems chen et al 2012 zhou et al 2009 drug delivery liu et al 2013 sun et al 2008 and water treatment ray et al 2015 wang et al 2016 additionally the recent demonstrated success of the well established modified hummers method chen et al 2013 for high throughput synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets has greatly expanded the practical feasibility of using nanoscale graphene oxide in real engineered applications similar to iron and manganese oxides graphene oxide nanosheets are difficult to employ during water treatment unless a support is used e g semipermeable membranes goh et al 2015 hu and mi 2013 lee et al 2013 there are several studies investigating modified graphene oxide coated sand for water treatment applications including urban stormwater treatment coating graphene oxide onto sand can mimic the performance of gac used in water treatment by creating a carbonaceous media with high adsorptive capacity for removing trace organic compounds naveen prasad et al 2015 ray et al 2017 yang et al 2015 and inorganic contaminants hou et al 2015 yang et al 2006 to generate graphene oxide coated sands additional modification of graphene oxide is needed the increased number of oxygen containing functional groups on graphene oxide compared to graphene impart some hydrophilicity however the large domains of remaining hydrophobic aromatic groups kim et al 2010 can decrease its suitability for coating substrates like sand which require acidic functional group linkages to facilitate a stable coating of graphene oxide onto sand for stormwater treatment researchers have modified graphene oxide with hydrophilic species to increase attachment efficiency huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 wen et al 2013 for example gao et al modified graphene oxide nanosheets with thiol groups by taking advantage of diazonium grafting chemistry lomeda et al 2010 to allow self assembly of graphene oxide onto sand surfaces gao et al 2011 the resulting graphene oxide coated sand exhibited five times higher adsorption of mercury and rhodamine b compared to unmodified sand during column filtration studies similarly there are studies investigating coating sand surfaces with al2 and mg2 graphene oxide nanosheets which demonstrated higher complexation efficiencies of phosphate and metals i e zn and cu and adsorption of organic compounds i e diclofenac and caffeine compared to reduced graphene oxides ahmadi et al 2018 vu and wu 2019 gao et al and vu et al have also included important information regarding the stability of the modified graphene oxide coated sand for stormwater infiltration applications during a 2 h column filtration study treating mercury and rhodamine b in water no leaching of graphene oxide from the sand surface was observed gao et al 2011 the vu et al study examined removal of po4 3 zn caffeine and e coli model stormwater contaminants in synthetic and real filtered surface runoff during single and multi contaminant column experiments in the multiple contaminant experiments using al mg graphene oxide coated sand e coli removal was 93 8 in synthetic runoff and 93 0 in real surface runoff with minimal remobilization in either scenario vu and wu 2019 furthermore complete breakthrough of caffeine zn and po4 3 0 5 mg l each occurred nearly 5 000 pore volumes sooner in real surface runoff than in cleaner synthetic stormwater conditions which was attributed to sorption site competition with doc present in the real water the estimated lifetime of the al mg graphene oxide coated sand in the vu et al study was determined to be at least 15 years given the study experimental conditions 3 2 2 polymer clay composites polymer clay composites are promising stormwater treatment media typically synthesized by mixing cationic polymer solutions with a clay solution at ratios corresponding to the clay cation exchange capacity and the desired degree of hydrophobicity radian and mishael 2008 following mixing of the polymer and clay solutions the modified clay slurry is removed washed and dried the simple fabrication of these low cost adsorbents combines the high reactive surface area and cation exchange capacity of clays lin and juang 2002 with the functionality of organic polymers because of their added utility to remove organic and inorganic species polymer clay nanocomposites have been proposed since the 90s usuki et al 2005 as effective adsorbents and flocculants for water treatment wu et al 2005 compared to polymers or virgin clays used independently polymer clay nanocomposites have higher adsorption capacities and faster kinetics unuabonah and taubert 2014 the hydrophilicity and negative charge of clays okada and usuki 1995 allow positively charged polymers i e polycations to adsorb to the outside of the clay particle as well as exchange with the inner layer cations in swelling clays resulting in charge reversal yang et al 2003 the polymers add hydrophobic domains on the clay surface which can enhance trace organic compound removal yang et al 2003 via partitioning to the hydrophobic polymer clay composite surface fig 5 left schematic park et al 2011 the polycation coating which typically possesses positively charged moieties like quaternary amines can also facilitate removal of negatively charged pathogens undabeytia et al 2014 and free and complexed doc species anirudhan and suchithra 2010 chang and juang 2004 undabeytia et al 2014 to account for the possibility of polymer desorption from the composite surface during stormwater treatment the choice of polymers must weigh functionality with potential toxicity the majority of studies investigating polymer clay composites have been for treatment of trace organics in drinking water sources kohay et al 2015 ganigar et al 2010 radian and mishael 2012 and in wastewater el zahhar et al 2014 unuabonah et al 2010 of these only a few studies have performed column experiments to gauge the performance of polymer clay composites under more field relevant treatment conditions ray et al synthesized polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene montmorillonite clay composite media for urban stormwater treatment during continuous flow of synthetic stormwater in lab scale columns ray et al 2019 at 3 wt loading amended with sand the clay composites exhibited greater removal of hydrophobic trace organics e g fipronil and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid compared to more hydrophilic compounds e g 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and atrazine the dual functionality of the modified polymer clay composites was demonstrated by their simultaneous and complete removal of all divalent trace metals e g cd cu zn and ni and 40 60 removal oxyanions i e as v and cr vi over 150 pore volumes interestingly the hydraulic conductivity of the polymer clay composite amended columns was equal to or higher than the hydraulic conductivity of sand additionally over 98 of the polymer coating remained on the clay after 48 h of constant wetting this finding suggests that it may be feasible to employ polymer coated clays as urban stormwater media in infiltration applications 3 2 3 surfactant modified zeolites smzs like clays zeolites are naturally abundant and negatively charged aluminosilicate minerals with high surface area and cation exchange capacity elshorbagy and chowdhury 2013 because of these properties zeolites are similarly easy to modify with positively charged polymers and materials zeolites have been employed as adsorbents jiang et al 2018 in wastewater treatment for trace metal removal wang and peng 2010 hui et al 2005 and have more recently been investigated for ammonia and phosphate recovery applications karapınar 2009 in fact there are several studies investigating metal modified zeolites as antimicrobial media for urban stormwater biofilters li et al 2014a 2014b 2016 cu ag and zn among other metals possess inherent antimicrobial properties li et al examined cu2 and cu oh 2 zeolite filter media for inactivation of e coli during stormwater filtration and discovered that over 2 log e coli removal was consistently achieved during five months of treating natural stormwater under typical conditions li et al 2014 in addition to metal modified zeolites there have also been studies investigating surfactant modified zeolites for enhanced adsorption of other types of micropollutants a popular candidate for clay and zeolite modification is cetrimonium bromide also known as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtma which is a positively charged quaternary ammonium surfactant similar to clays the quaternary ammonium cation provides an anchor for the surfactant to attach to the negatively charged zeolite surface via electrostatic attraction the methylene surfactant tail ch2 x provides a hydrophobic anchor for adsorption of organic compounds if the surfactant concentration is increased past the critical micelle concentration it is possible to reverse the charge of zeolites and generate a positively charged adsorbent fig 5 right schematic chutia et al 2009 this is often done to adsorb negatively charged contaminants such as arsenate chutia et al 2009 perchlorate zhang et al 2007 and chromate selenate and sulfate haggerty and bowman 1994 while surfactant modified zeolites have not been employed for urban stormwater treatment their ability to remove a broad suite of contaminants is a promising quality for urban stormwater media as for the longevity of this engineered media li et al probed the biochemical stability of hdtma modified zeolites and observed that the hdtma coating was stable at high ionic strength and over a wide ph range of 3 10 li et al 1998 furthermore over 90 of the initial hdtma remained bound to zeolites after 100 pore volume washes and over 98 remained on the surface after a 12 17 week incubation with activated sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions these observations suggest that surfactant modified zeolites may be viable as engineered urban stormwater treatment media 4 factors affecting media performance for contaminant removal many researchers characterizing novel media for stormwater remediation conduct lab scale studies using synthetic stormwater to measure contaminant removal under ideal consistent and replicable conditions however prior to scaling up and implementing novel media in urban stormwater management systems the following factors influencing contaminant removal must be considered media characteristics stormwater composition and stormwater hydrology 4 1 media characteristics in this review we discuss various conventional and emerging materials designed to target the removal of inorganic and organic stormwater contaminants the long term durability and field efficacy of materials incorporated into existing urban stormwater bmps depends on their chemical characteristics structural integrity and susceptibility to clogging and fouling here we present current knowledge regarding the impact of these factors on stormwater treatment based on experimental data in section 5 we present several remaining factors requiring additional research to gain a deeper understanding of how stormwater media can be employed in existing treatment systems to improve urban stormwater quality 4 1 1 porosity surface area structural integrity porous materials such as biochar and activated carbon are often used to sequester contaminants through intraparticle diffusion of pollutants within pores depending on the biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature used to produce biochar the product porosity and bulk density can vary significantly brewer et al 2014 the low bulk density and mechanical strength of some biochars may impact soil properties and make it difficult to incorporate biochar amendments into existing treatment systems in particular structural weaknesses in biochar lehmann and joseph 2015 can cause it to break apart leading to rapid and frequent clogging ray et al 2019 additionally biochar s porosity leads to higher water retention which can also reduce urban stormwater permeability during infiltration low hydraulic conductivity of biochar due to water retention may be overcome if the correct particle size mass loading and porosity are selected particularly during stormwater infiltration applications extreme storm events such as floods can physically shear biochar and similarly structured media causing transport of contaminants to receiving waters to mitigate this outcome and ensure that smaller particles are trapped more effectively it is important to choose support media e g gravel sand etc with the appropriate particle size porosity and density in addition to media porosity other properties e g particle size surface area hydration etc can also impact urban stormwater contaminant removal in bmps some media like clays can undergo structural changes when introduced to water in particular the characteristic layered structure of certain clays e g montmorillonite and other smectites allows water to become absorbed within the structure and the clay to swell resulting in expansion and strong electrostatic repulsive forces between the negatively charged layers karaborni et al 1996 zeolites also exist in layered structures and can undergo swelling when introduced to water roth et al 2015 in fact it is the expansion characteristic of these materials that contributes to easy functionalization with polymers and surfactants once modified as in the case of clays swelling may occur despite the intercalation of polymers within the layers zhang and wang 2007 if the loading of functionalized clay and zeolite mineral amendments in urban stormwater infrastructure is too high structural expansion and water absorption could reduce urban stormwater permeability and clog infiltration systems richards and neretnieks 2010 considering that the frequency and intensity of stormwater events depend upon regional and seasonal weather patterns it is often difficult to predict or control the structural changes that media can undergo 4 2 stormwater composition in addition to media characteristics the chemical properties e g ph redox potential and composition of urban stormwater e g suspended solids cationic salts doc microbes can dramatically impact media performance 4 2 1 co occurring inorganic salts cationic bridging nutrients and redox potential in addition to the target metal contaminants other inorganic salts and species present in urban stormwater can impact media performance for example particularly in subsurface systems the redox conditions are governed by inorganic species e g fe s and biological processes e g denitrification and respiration stormwater media incorporated into subsurface treatment systems could therefore potentially interact with these species and processes that typically contribute to low dissolved oxygen levels and anoxic conditions aqueous redox conditions can also impact the solubility of certain metals e g iron oxides can dissolve in anoxic conditions and the transformation and degradation of certain contaminants e g oxidation of trace organics and reduction of microorganisms metals grebel et al 2013 negatively charged adsorbent media used in stormwater remediation e g aluminosilicate clays activated carbon biochar can undergo interactions with divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 present in urban stormwater which often serve as bridges between anionic contaminants and the media divalent cation bridging was introduced by mckinney and edwards 1952 and tezuka 1969 as a mechanism for biological floc formation divalent cations bridge negatively charged functional groups within extracellular polymeric substances to aggregate and stabilize microbes a similar mechanism occurs between negatively charged surface functional groups on stormwater media divalent cations and anionic contaminants in stormwater promote adsorption of compounds such as phosphate qian et al 2013 polysaccharides dontsova and bigham 2005 and oils kobayashi et al 2017 for example per and poly fluoroalkyl substances have been demonstrated to form complexes with biochar and activated carbon through cationic bridging arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 divalent cations in urban stormwater infiltration systems where media is employed may also contribute to metals desorption e g during snow deicing huber et al 2016 4 2 2 co occurring organics doc and microbes high molecular weight negatively charged colloidal and hydrophobic organic species with numerous functional groups such as doc leenheer and croué 2003 can also impact media contaminant removal efficacy during urban stormwater treatment in bmps doc a component of natural organic matter is one of the most ubiquitous organic constituents in natural and engineered aquatic systems doc is notorious for adsorbing to media surfaces and competing with contaminants for adsorption sites davis 1982 newcombe et al 1997 passivation of media surfaces by doc could also reduce the lifetime of stormwater media and treatment efficacy the acidic functional groups of doc behave similarly to those of metal oxides by participating in complexation of trace metals reuter and perdue 1977 which may lead to enhanced contaminant removal if the metal complexed doc adsorbs to stormwater media surfaces ray et al 2019 during oxidative treatments e g scenarios involving application of manganese oxide coated sand media the presence of doc and its many aromatic and electron rich moieties can act as an electron shuttle to promote redox reactions kang and choi 2009 another important process impacting media performance is biological fouling particularly for carbonaceous stormwater media like activated carbon and biochar microbes like doc are ubiquitous in aquatic environments activated carbon and biochar are essentially carbon rich substrates that can act as a food source to promote biological growth and fouling of media surfaces weber et al 1978 biofouling of media surfaces will result in similar surface site passivation of stormwater media and reduce the long term removal of trace contaminants during treatment over time however the biofilm formation on media surfaces may contribute to media supported biodegradation of organic contaminants in urban stormwater in fact with thoughtful design known stormwater composition and redox conditions could be used to stimulate microbial growth using media like biochar 4 3 media quality assessments for field applicability the information in the preceding sections provide insight into the multitude of factors and attributes of stormwater and media associated with maximizing contaminant removal during urban stormwater treatment there is potential for media amendment in existing stormwater bmps to greatly increase contaminant removal during urban stormwater management trends of increasing annual precipitation in the united states sinha et al 2017 combined with the negative impacts of anthropogenic activity and frequency of extreme weather events e g floods schoof 2015 will result in more overflow events and will drive the need for improved urban runoff management in regions prone to water scarcity proper stormwater management can be leveraged to augment the urban water supply major cities are beginning to recognize the untapped potential of using urban runoff as a water resource investing millions of dollars to convert urban landscapes into stormwater capture basins and providing utility rebates to residences and commercial properties to financially incentivize urban stormwater capture bendor et al 2018 for example the city of los angeles and local stakeholders have partnered to transform an existing landfill in sun valley into the rory m shaw wetlands park project cost 22 5 million to address local flooding issues and to increase water conservation efforts hagekhalil et al 2014 the city of seattle public utilities offers a residential rainwise rebate program to single family residences to install cisterns for stormwater capture and other bmps such as rain gardens porous pavement and grass centered driveways to help reduce the damage caused by combined sewer overflow events tackett et al 2013 to help city planners and researchers determine if a media is suitable for de centralized urban stormwater treatment the authors recommend the following considerations and tests described in the following sections 4 3 1 characterization of media physicochemical properties the discussions of conventional and engineered media have included information regarding specific properties linked to contaminant removal table 2 if a new media is under consideration for a particular field application it is necessary to understand the physical and chemical properties of the media to predict interactions with water common stormwater matrix constituents and contaminants of interest recommended analytical methods for characterizing stormwater media are provided in table 4 it is important to note that the information of recommended analyses in this section is a limited view of many techniques available to characterize solid materials if the media is organic in nature e g compost activated carbon and biochar the carbon content and corresponding porosity will be key predictors of aqueous interactions including with contaminants as discussed previously the media feedstock has significant implications on the type of contaminants removed and the affinity of those contaminants to the media this is due in large part to the carbon content of the feed and the resulting aromaticity and porosity associated with the method of thermochemical i e pyrolysis processing for example a study by singh et al suggests that biochars produced from feedstocks with low carbon content e g manure and at low pyrolysis temperatures have 20 times less stability compared to biochars of high carbon content feeds and pyrolysis temperatures singh et al 2012 proximate analysis and elemental analysis provide important information regarding the composition of organic particularly carbonaceous media which is facilitated by tga weight loss measurements upon heating table 4 the available surface area and porosity can be obtained via brunauer emmett teller bet theory and analysis following elemental analysis if more information is desired regarding media aromaticity 13c nuclear magnetic resonance analysis can be performed for primarily inorganic media several techniques can be employed to characterize mineral phases and structural and chemical bonding environments which can provide insight into the cation exchange capacity and potential for complexation via acid base functional groups x ray techniques e g xrd and xrf table 4 provide structural and elemental composition information for inorganic materials with an atomic lattice structure there are several analytical techniques that are suitable for both organic and inorganic media making them particularly appropriate to characterize hybrid inorganic organic composite media xps and ftir provide surface chemistry and atomic bonding information which can help identify available functional groups for stormwater contaminant removal media surface charge is another useful physicochemical quality that can facilitate contaminant removal and other electrostatic interactions with common ions in stormwater media hydraulic conductivity and water permeability are other important properties that can help assess the suitability of media for contaminant removal during urban stormwater treatment particularly during stormwater infiltration applications for example a 30 month field study where biochar was amended in a sandy loam soil revealed that biochar resulted in increased local hydraulic conductivity and lower bulk density hardie et al 2014 if the media has low hydraulic conductivity then augmented stormwater bmps can become clogged during stormwater infiltration finally it may be desirable to determine the media s mechanical strength if stress and shear are a concern for the structural stability in certain bmps 4 3 2 recommended lab scale media studies lab scale studies provide practical and useful information of media behavior and performance particularly when field scale or pilot studies are too costly difficult or time consuming to execute many reports investigating media for stormwater and water treatment generally perform lab scale batch experiments to gauge media contaminant affinity kinetics and removal capacity e g isotherm experiments media behavior from batch studies can be informative to predict field performance however additional experiments may be required to more accurately assess media longevity and reactivity under field conditions one important lab scale experiment that should be considered for stormwater media is column infiltration in contrast to batch studies column studies allow media to continuously interact with a constant concentration of contaminants in the influent source this distinction is critical to determining the lifetime of a stormwater media continuous operation and contaminant treatment will be applicable regardless of whether the media is implemented in de centralized bmps for passive remediation or in designated treatment facilities near urban stormwater bmps column studies can mimic field conditions of stormwater infiltration to allow for prediction of media behavior during intermittent storm events mohanty et al 2013 2014 after long periods of drying and rehydration and media regeneration during backwashing 4 3 3 leaching and desorption for long term media stability in stormwater bmps it is important to determine the potential for leaching and desorption there are limited studies described in previous sections that examine contaminant desorption during stormwater treatment desorption is particularly troublesome for adsorption based media where contaminants may be loosely adsorbed via weak interactions such as electrostatic attraction or van der waals and hydrophobic interactions furthermore changes in stormwater composition can weaken contaminant chemisorption e g hydrogen bonding complexation and lead to contaminant desorption from media in stormwater bmps which will neutralize any benefits of media amendment to reduce contaminant loads to receiving waters in addition to contaminant desorption tests need to be conducted to determine if modifications to media surfaces will leach during stormwater infiltration for example a study on manganese oxide coated sand suggests that the coating can leach from the sand surface during infiltration releasing levels of dissolved manganese exceeding the epa recommended level charbonnet et al 2018 both analyses of leaching and desorption are easily performed by taking advantage of column studies measuring contaminant concentrations in column effluent and detecting the presence of media modifiers e g polymers after complete breakthrough has been achieved will indicate if desorption and or leaching has occurred to mitigate the potential for additional environmental and human risks it is important to consider the toxicities of media modification materials 5 conclusions this review presents an overview of physicochemical characteristics reactivities and interfacial properties of current and emerging media available to enhance contaminant removal of existing stormwater best management practices the international stormwater database reveals that the most commonly used and monitored bmps are grass swales retention ponds detention basins and wetland basins while these systems offer the potential to reduce runoff volume our data analysis indicates that bmps exhibit low removal efficiencies for many contaminants e g 40 for total n total p and cod furthermore the lack of information on organic contaminant occurrence and removal as well as the variability in the type and number of reporting sites pose a challenge in fully assessing the performance of bmps a variety of low cost materials have been tested for stormwater pollutant removal organic materials such as compost activated carbon and biochar possess surface functional groups favorable to adsorption of metals and trace organics although sand can maintain high hydraulic conductivity and effectively remove solids it displays low affinity for dissolved contaminants such as nutrients and organic contaminants clays and zeolites are often employed to remove metals in stormwater nutrients such as ammonium can be removed through ion exchange processes by zeolites novel engineered media that modify or combine these conventional media e g surfactant modified zeolites polymer clay composites metal oxide coated sands offer the benefit of enhancing stormwater pollutant removal without sacrificing hydraulic performance studies on conventional and emerging media discussed in this review showed promising results for stormwater treatment however additional physicochemical characteristics impacting media performance and longevity must also be considered for example media with a high water retention capacity could be more prone to flooding and clogging during high volume storm events ultimately resulting in a shorter lifetime additionally stormwater composition can impact pollutant removal by altering stormwater pollutants or the surface of the media 6 future research directions in order to develop smarter designs of engineered systems for stormwater treatment it is first crucial to improve our understanding of the relationship between media performance and hydrological factors such as intermittency of flow length of wet and dry periods and contaminant remobilization for example during extreme storm events levels of contaminants will be high and treatment efficiency in bmps will be reduced due to overwhelmed capacity in the paper modelling urban stormwater treatment a unified approach wong et al present an algorithmic model to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of storage facilities wetlands and ponds vegetated swales and infiltration systems sediments basins and biofilters operating under variable conditions wong et al 2006 the authors conclude that the fundamental physical processes occurring in these systems during storm events include i initial perception of contaminants through sedimentation and filtration and ii continuing flow attenuation and detention wong et al 2006 future research is necessary to build stormwater treatment systems that can be operated at different spatial and temporal scales of hydraulic loading the majority of the current studies on conventional media for stormwater treatment have been conducted in synthetic water matrices table 2 there is a need for additional studies to be conducted using real stormwater matrices because despite the high concentration and occurrence of certain common constituents e g fats oils and greases rank third in table 1 there is little research on the removal or impact of these constituents for instance only a few publications address the mechanisms employed by emerging engineered media to remove nutrients and nitrogenous compounds our synthesis of stormwater bmp data fig 1 showed low nutrient removal across all bmp categories yet few studies evaluate the addition of engineered media to bmps for the purpose of nutrient removal nitrogenous compound removal is impacted by nitrogen speciation and microbiological nitrification processes that transform the nitrogen species but do not remove it collins et al 2010 certain bmps designed to have high infiltration rates give rise to aerobic conditions favoring nitrification collins et al 2010 which could lead to increased nitrate concentrations in stormwater treatment systems additionally inputs of nitrogen in stormwater runoff are primarily in the form of dissolved nitrogen which is soluble and difficult to capture engineered media can promote the removal of nitrogenous compounds and nutrients through ion exchange processes and co precipitation with trace metals however depending on the corresponding solubility product the pollutant concentration may not decrease to levels that conform to water quality standards thus to gain a more comprehensive view of media performance in contaminant removal additional research on more realistic stormwater matrices containing representative pollutants e g nutrients fats oils greases is necessary few studies have focused on the durability and longevity of media intended for stormwater remediation or currently incorporated in existing stormwater bmp systems although some researchers have explored the impacts of regeneration and backwashing on increasing the lifetime of filtration media e g manganese oxide coated sand charbonnet et al 2018 al mg graphene oxide composites ahmadi et al 2018 base treated juniper media min et al 2007 there is a lack of published data from field studies to demonstrate the feasibility of these processes in real world applications further research on waste management and media reuse is necessary to compare the levelized cost and labor implications of incorporating stormwater media into existing bmps or replacing other remediation technologies factors such as media characteristics e g porosity surface area structural integrity and stormwater composition e g inorganic salts nutrients redox potential microbes and doc can influence media performance and longevity in order to fully assess the suitability and applicability of media material characterization analyses and column studies employing real stormwater matrices are needed few studies examine stormwater treatment by media in bmps in the united states at the pilot scale tian et al 2019 ashoori et al 2019 boving and neary 2007 erickson et al 2012 however it is this critical knowledge gap that limits deployment of media particularly engineered media in existing or new urban stormwater bmps for example until the media are scrutinized under more realistic field level conditions it is difficult to assess economic viability primary advantages and disadvantages with respect to contaminant sequestration and stormwater permeability and opportunities for reuse and regeneration of exhausted media more pilot studies are imperative before media can be utilized

subsequent sludge reduction and stabilization numerous approaches have been proposed for sludge treatment such as anaerobic digestion dewatering composting and landfill treatment zhen et al 2017 in recent years dissolved organic matter dom in sludge has received much attention during these treatments the web of science database shows that the number of publications per year with dissolved organic matter searching with the word of dissolved organic matter as topic increased sharply only 587 papers in 2000 over 1000 papers per year since 2007 and up to 2462 papers in 2019 by specific search with the word of dissolved organic matter in sludge the numbers increased from 17 papers in 2000 to 155 papers in 2019 supporting information figure s1 the researchers from china based on the country name of the first affiliation address where the authors come from published the highest number of papers 37 followed by those from the united states 11 and spain 6 this shows the ever growing importance of dom studies during sludge treatment processes dom in sludge often originates from influent wastewater cell lysis and hydrolysis of particulate compounds during biological wastewater treatment and non biodegradable residues of some biochemical and chemical refractory compounds cai et al 2016a the composition of dom in the influent of wastewater treatment plants varies due to the different sources as shown in fig 1 during pretreatments with screening and de gritting and gravitational sedimentation in the preliminary sedimentation tank part of the dom is removed due to sorption to particulate matter and biodegradation xue et al 2017 and about 20 30 of organic matter in terms of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc can be removed carstea et al 2016 the main processes for organic matter removal accounting for about 55 60 of total bod5 cod or toc removal during wastewater treatment are biodegradation biotransformation and sorption to activated sludge in the biological steps like activated sludge clarification anoxic aerobic aerobic aerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactors and membrane bioreactors carstea et al 2016 xue et al 2017 after secondary sedimentation further tertiary and quaternary treatment can remove about another 5 8 of total bod5 cod or toc by processes like soil aquifer infiltration filtration flocculation and clarification oxidation and filtration stabilization in ponds ultra violet uv disinfection and or chlorination ou et al 2014 reynolds 2002 yu et al 2014 partial soluble microbial products originating from the activated sludge treatment higher molecular weight substances formed due to polymerization during degradation processes and trace organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin may be discharged into the effluent finally michael kordatou et al 2015 wang and chen 2018b during anaerobic digestion dom in sludge is an important regulator for the microbial communities since the insoluble substrates can only become accessible to microbes after being solubilized to dom narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 if considering the initial content of volatile solids in sludge is 100 about 40 60 of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded during the anaerobic digestion process if mechanical thermal chemical and biological pretreatments are applied maspolim et al 2015a zhen et al 2017 in brief as is known the hydrolysis of complex organic matter particularly the insoluble organic matter of sludge into dom is the first and the rate limiting step of anaerobic sludge digestion alvarado et al 2021 more knowledge about the dom characteristics is essential to understand the hydrolysis features of sludge subsequently the biodegradable dom fraction can be fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas and vfas are subsequently converted to biogas by methanogens while the anaerobic digestion refractory part still remains in both the liquid and solid phase of the anaerobic digestate hence understanding the composition of the biodegradable and anaerobic digestion refractory parts of dom is particularly important in the anaerobic digestion process when dewatering with traditional polymers the water content of the sludge cake is very often in the range of 75 85 w w and fails to meet the strict regulations of a content of less than 60 w w for the subsequent sludge treatment and disposal in landfill zhang et al 2010 to achieve this target the bound water trapped in sludge dom and extracellular polymeric substances eps needs to be removed about 25 50 of dom in terms of bod5 cod or dissolved organic carbon doc can be shifted from the inner eps layer into the outer eps layer by chemical degradation and mineralization through advanced oxidation treatment xiao et al 2016a xiao et al 2017b thus knowledge of the composition molecular size and weight conformation structure and aggregation of dom can significantly help to improve sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2016a during sludge composting about 30 40 of volatile solids in terms of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded zheng et al 2020 as dom is considered as an important source of organic carbon in sludge composting the dom characteristics can impact the decomposition and polymerization processes as well as the degree of final humification yu et al 2019 during landfill treatment about 10 20 of volatile solids in sludge in terms of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded during the aerobic or anaerobic processes lo et al 2002 parravicini et al 2008 the composition and structural characteristics of dom are considered to impact biological stability as most changes of organic matter occur in the water soluble phase during landfill stabilization he et al 2011 liu et al 2019a in addition sludge incineration has received attractively growing attention due to its volume reduction organic pollutant destruction and energy recovery features hao et al 2020 sludge pyrolysis is another thermal treatment method which often converts organic material into char oil and or wax tar and syngas in the absence of oxygen li et al 2020 during these two processes sludge is typically exposed to dewatering and or drying prior to incineration or pyrolysis numerous studies have reported the changes in the sludge composition during incineration and pyrolysis which mostly impacts proteins lipids carbohydrates and amino acids bahadur et al 1995 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 however most of the studies used the whole sludge sample both solid and liquid fraction hence the results cannot be transferred directly to the changes in the dom composition during the pyrolysis and incineration processes given this background understanding how the characteristic of dom is changing during anaerobic digestion dewatering composting and landfill treatment has required efforts to probe into its composition and molecular characteristics it is necessary to decipher the dom composition in order to understand how dom is degraded removed and finally what makes organic compounds biochemical and chemical refractory after exposing to different sludge treatment methods moreover the characteristic of dom is often related with the efficiencies of these processes and in some cases is combined with environmental pollutions such as malodor water pollution and soil contamination if treated improperly and vice versa dignac et al 2000 sludge properties like hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity aggregation ability degradability and settleability can be determined by means of dom characterization shakeri et al 2012a yet numerous studies tended to focus on improving treatment efficiencies by developing new process methods changing operational ways or simply combining different process methods rather than to control key compounds of dom during the processes bozkurt and apul 2020 huang et al 2017 in all these studies the performance was typically evaluated in terms of engineering parameters e g methane production for anaerobic digestion xiao et al 2016b sludge dewaterability in terms of capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf bound water content shear sensitivity cake dry matter content lv et al 2019 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 compost stability stable organic matter and maturity the absence of phytotoxic compounds and plant or animal pathogens for plant growth potential for composting wei et al 2020 leachate characteristics and the stability of landfill piles lou et al 2015 current standards and evaluation methods for sludge treatment focused almost on these engineering parameters whether certain ranges are fulfilled or not but in fact only process efficiencies can be inferred from such studies similarly the community physiological profiles can only show the predominant microbial communities during the degradation of nutrient sources in sludge but will not directly elucidate what kind of substrates and to which degree it is used maspolim et al 2015b a more detailed characterization of the dom composition can act as a bridge linking both engineering performance and microbial community together and by this more in depth understanding of different treatment process can be achieved li et al 2014 undoubtedly revealing the underlying mechanism and how and why these performances of sludge treatment are changed in terms of dom always needs to be in the first place this type of bottom up analysis is necessary as the changes in the dom characteristics in sludge are concomitant results of changes in microbial communities and sludge treatment efficiencies thus the question arises as to a better understanding of dom composition for sludge produced during the different sludge treatment processes according to literature in the past years the dom analysis methods developed have shifted from simple chemical analysis like uv and visible absorbance measurements xiao et al 2016c to more sophisticated techniques like mass spectrometry ms maspolim et al 2015a and x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes shakeri et al 2012b among other methods which allow a more detailed view in the structural changes of dom during different sludge treatment processes in the past ten years several state of the art overviews have been published related to dom present in different environments selected references are dom in natural environments frimmel and abbt braun 2009 in aquatic systems aiken 2014 in sea water perdue and benner 2009 natural organic matter nom in atmospheric particles duarte and duarte 2009 dom in soil concerning storage and turnover torn et al 2009 and dom in wastewater carstea et al 2016 chon et al 2017 tran et al 2015 currently limited studies have discussed or reviewed dom in sludge and sludge related processes the aim of this review paper is to summarize results from the current literature by summing up the current definitions for dom in sludge identifying dom composition evaluating the advantages and limitations of current means for dom analysis discussing the potential limitations for the sum parameters of dom as well as deciphering dom migration and fate during different sludge treatments particularly the mechanisms behind dom transformation during different sludge treatment processes are summarized and future developments for sludge treatment methods are proposed based on comprehensive dom characterization 2 the definition of dom in sludge the definition of dom in aquatic systems like rivers lakes oceans groundwater wastewater or process water has been well stated by frimmel and abbt braun 2009 that those organic substances of the total organic carbon in aqueous solutions passing through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm this operationally based definition can also be applied for dom in sludge including raw sludge pretreated sludge etc passing of the sludge supernatant through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm fig 2 a which differentiates between particulate organic matter retained in a 0 45 µm filter pore and colloidal organic matter sizes between 1 nm and 1 µm artifon et al 2019 however a detailed description of how the liquid fraction of the sludge sample is collected is very often not given different from aqueous samples sludge is a semi solid slurry containing both liquid and solid material the total dry solid content of sludge varies due to different types of sludge primary sludge total solids of 5 9 secondary sludge total solids of 0 8 1 2 tyagi and lo 2013 to obtain the dissolved fraction the direct filtration of sludge through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm filter is difficult due to the presence of sludge solids a prior centrifugation separation of sludge with a relative centrifugation force which is not inducing cell lysis is often needed in the studies of yu et al 2008 sludge biomass is priorly centrifugated at 4 000 g to obtain the bulk liquid in other studies the sludge supernatant is also regarded as the slime or the soluble eps fraction as a consequence an additional extraction step is included for loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps of sludge samples by the chemical methods like addition of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid glutaraldehyde and physical methods like sonication cation exchange resin and heating are used comte et al 2006 these pretreatments can destruct the connection of bound eps onto sludge flocs to obtain bulk liquids for example the cation exchange resin can remove cations e g ca2 from the sludge matrix thus destructing the flocs and resulting in a subsequent release of eps these specific fractions extracted from the particulate parts of sludge should not be considered as dom of sludge as the liquid fraction also contains bound extracellular organic matter qu et al 2012 however the definition of dom based on the operational filtration processes also has its limitation the characteristics of the membrane filters and the filtration process e g type surface tension pretreatment of filters and pressure during the filtration process as well as pore blocking caused by colloidal and particulate matter in the sludge supernatant can impact the final solution frimmel and abbt braun 2009 karanfil et al 2003 centrifugation as pretreatment using a centrifugation force of 4 000 g can achieve a good liquid and solid separation along with no interferences with cell lysis for most sludge samples although it is not a golden rule and does not work for sludge with low settleability and filterability in addition the colloidal fraction with sizes between 1 nm and 1 µm of sludge overlapping the dissolved fraction the fraction that passes through 0 45 µm filter and particulate fraction retained in a 0 45 µm filter pore arbitrarily defined can also affect dom artifon et al 2019 but is ignored in this definition therefore a precise definition of dom in sludge concerning defined operational experimental steps of sample treatment is needed in future studies 3 physicochemical properties of dom in sludge 3 1 dom composition the first step to link dom properties and sludge treatment efficiencies and microbial communities is to understand dom composition tran et al 2015 defined dom composition in wastewater as a complex heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds with functional groups like carboxylic carbonyl methoxyl hydroxyl and phenolic functional groups they further divided dom into subunits based on the biodegradability the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties the distribution of molecular weight and size and the fluorescence characteristics the description of the structural dom composition can vary beyond what is reported due to the inconsistencies of analysis methods and data interpretation a unified description for the exact composition of dom is still lacking and due the heterogeneous and complex character of dom in sludge the description of molecular structures of all subunits of the dom will not be possible in the near future considering that sludge samples are byproducts of various physical chemical and biochemical reactions in wastewater treatment and based on the current literature the most important subunits of dom in sludge can be summarized as proteinaceous compounds proteins and amino acids carbohydrates polysaccharides and monosaccharides humic substances humic acids and fulvic acids lipids lignins organic acids and organic micropollutants fig 3 these compounds are located in the slime layer or soluble eps layer of the sludge flocs figs 2b c in the following sections the main subunits of dom in sludge samples which have been reported in literature till now will be reviewed whereupon their characteristics will be discussed 3 1 1 proteinaceous compounds proteins apportion to about 40 50 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc shier and purwono 1994 xiao et al 2016a proteins with molecular weight less than 20 kilo dalton kda dominated in 20 different sludge samples xiao et al 2017c as the polypeptide backbone the protein conformation determines the detailed function of protein molecules wang et al 2016a the protein secondary structures in sludge samples were identified as α helix β sheet aggregated strands random coil 3 turnhelix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands with α helix and β sheet often predominated you et al 2017 when the ratio of the content of α helix to the contents of both β sheet and random coil gets lower the structure of proteins becomes looser you et al 2017 wu et al 2017a used the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation itraq to investigate protein types in waste activated sludge their results indicated that most proteins originated from the intracellular non membrane bounded organelle of bacteria forming sludge flocs and could be divided into three types based on their gene ontology cellular components molecular function and biological processes wu et al 2017a due to differences in chemical composition whether simple complex or conjugated shape whether fibrous or globular and biological functions whether enzymes and structural storage or transport proteins proteins play several different functions during sludge treatments amino acids are simple molecules containing at least one amine r nh2 and one carboxyl group r cooh and act as the building blocks of peptides and proteins artifon et al 2019 the amount of amino acids accounts for about 2 3 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc zhu et al 2020 compared with the numerous studies investigating proteins polysaccharides and humic substances in dom of sludge samples the content of amino acids is often overlooked in recent years their role in dewatering and anaerobic digestion has been recognized wu et al 2017a free amino acids are in the three dimensional structure of peptides and their types and compositional distributions are determining factors for protein physicochemical characteristics subrahmanyam et al 1960 amino acids are more easily degraded by microorganisms compared with their parental compounds of proteins artifon et al 2019 due to the amphoteric character amino acids also show affinity to water ubukata 1998 about 17 types of amino acids are present in sludge samples including essential and non essential amino acids liu et al 2009 the 17 naturally occurring amino acids can be classified into three groups hydrophilic glycine serine threonine and cysteine hydrophobic alanine valine leucine isoleucine phenylalanine tyrosine methionine and proline and acid alkaline aspartic glutamic lysine histidine and arginine meirovitch et al 1980 the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups can significantly affect the hydrophobicity of proteins as well as their surface properties when the amino acid in the polypeptide chain reverses its overall direction and the number of amino acid residues forming the turn is less than six a tight turn structure of amino acid can be formed chou 2000 this tight turn structure can control molecular recognition enzymatic activity and nucleation of folding franklin and slusky 2018 for the predominance of amino acids in sludge samples zhao et al 2018a found that phenylalanine leucine alanine threonine glycine glutamic and valine determine the biosynthesis of extracellular proteins cai et al 2016b reported that tryptophan and tyrosine were degraded during the thermophilic phase of sludge bio drying hou et al 2015 showed that hydrophobic amino acids affect aggregation of anammox sludge chen et al 2019a investigated the types and concentrations of amino acids during anaerobic digestion and their results indicated that thermal pretreatment at 120 or 160 c can promote the degradation of amino acids with the clostridiales order as the responsible microorganism via the stickland pathway 3 1 2 carbohydrates carbohydrates are polyhydroxyl carbonyl compounds containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms artifon et al 2019 the amount of carbohydrates accounts for about 10 15 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc xiao et al 2016a polysaccharides like cellulose and hemicellulose are hydrophilic carbohydrates distributed evenly in different fractions of sludge flocs shao et al 2009 thomas et al 2010 with molecular weights in two ranges 1 kda christophe et al 2005 or 100 2000 kda in sludge samples flemming and wingender 2010 meng et al 2011 most polysaccharides are linear or branched attached to the cell surface thus forming complex networks seviour et al 2019 typically the linkage nature of polysaccharides e g α oxygen or β oxygen is related with the glycosidic carbon jiao et al 2010 the content of polysaccharides in sludge has been reported to affect adsorption flocculation and settleability of sludge samples zhao et al 2017 monosaccharides can be linked by glycosidic bonds to generate larger carbohydrates like disaccharides oligosaccharides or polysaccharides li et al 2008 monosaccharides can be generated from the hydrolysis of macromolecules like starch cellulose and hemicellulose li et al 2008 some monosaccharides like mannose rhamnose arabinose galacturonic acid xylose gluconic acid ribose glucose fucose and galactose have also been identified in waste activated sludge samples chen et al 2020 and aerobic granular sludge felz et al 2020 3 1 3 humic substances humic substances in sludge account for about 10 15 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc li et al 2013 xiao et al 2016a based on the definition of humic substances by the international humic substances society ihss 2016 humic substances refer to complex and heterogeneous mixtures of poly dispersed materials formed in soils sediments and natural waters humic substances are operationally divided into humic acids base soluble fulvic acids soluble at all ph conditions and humus insoluble at any ph and only available in soil abbt braun et al 2004 olk et al 2019 considering the insolubility of humus in water at any ph the humic substances related to dom in sludge herein only denote fulvic acids and humic acids as can be seen in a book describing humic substances the fields of soil aquatic systems rhizosphere and atmosphere particles senesi et al 2009 the detailed definition composition and structural characteristics isolation and analysis and pathways for humic substances formation have been systematically stated both humic acids and fulvic acids show complex structures which consist of aromatic heterocyclic alicyclic poly aliphatic and poly aromatic structures in addition the occurrence of carboxylic and o alkylic groups is most obvious among other functional groups e g phenolic carbonyl ester ketones aldehydes and amide groups abbt braun et al 2004 the functional groups of humic and fulvic acids which are consisting of aromatic ring structures can determine the electron transfer capacities senesi et al 2009 it has been widely accepted that humic substances are the biochemical and chemical refractory decomposition products of biological materials and are also often called biochemical and chemical refractory organic substances abbt braun et al 2004 however scientists still fail to identify the exact structure of humic substances macromolecules due to their complex heterogeneous structures as for sludge samples researchers often use the terms humus humic acid and fulvic acid without consistency and without giving defined experimental protocols that how the fractions have been extracted from the sludge samples this vague terminology may lead to misunderstanding and wrong interpretation in one of the studies the content of humus in dom of sludge samples was investigated by a revised lowry s method frølund et al 1995 and their results indicated that humus in sludge was relatively easy to be released into the mixed liquid during air disturbance and water flow in the reactor xuan et al 2010 according to the definitions given ahead it is more likely that humic acid or fulvic acid fractions might be the term to be used others analyzed the concentration of humic acid of sludge samples pretreated at ph of 2 by a modified lowry s method after filtering sludge samples through 0 45 µm cellulose membrane filters xiao et al 2016a and their results showed that the content of humic acid increased in soluble eps and decreased in tb eps xiao et al 2016a however considering the ph of 2 used in their study it might be clearer to use the term humic substances or fulvic acids in fact a variety of terminologies have been used to describe humic substances such as biochemical and chemical refractory organic substances soil organic matter natural organic matter and dissolved organic matter one always needs to keep the operational definitions based on fractionation procedures in mind while using humic acid fulvic acid and humus as well as the different origin of the samples e g soils and sediments aqueous environments rhizosphere and atmosphere particles currently the researchers often use the xad 8 a registered trademark of the dow chemical company method the widely used amberlite xad 8 resin is no longer commercially available and supelite dax 8 resin has been substituted in recent research for the isolation of humic substances in sludge dom aiken et al 1992 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b which is similar to those used for aqueous samples and or for soil samples after alkaline extraction as developed by the international humic substances society ihss 2016 xu et al 2020 used the xad 8 method for the characterization of humic substances and found that humic substances may interact with biopolymers in sludge to form a dense granular aggregate through decreasing active sites for enzyme activities thus inhibiting sludge solubilization and the subsequent anaerobic digestion lu et al 2018a also followed this method and pointed out that humic substances were the main identified non biodegradable residues of dom during anaerobic digestion the unique semi solid properties of sludge make humic substances in sludge dom decisively different from those in bulk soils or aquatic sources from a chemical physical and biological point of view hence the characteristic of humic substances in dom from sludge samples compared to those originating from typical natural systems needs to be investigated in future studies 3 1 4 lipids lipids are consisting of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur artifon et al 2019 which may originate from the cell envelops composed of phospholipid layers the amount of lipids accounts for about 3 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc yuan et al 2019 the structural characteristics of lipids like the length of carbonic chain unsaturation degree surface charges polarity size of the head group and hydrogen bonding capability often determine their functions during sludge treatments kimura et al 2016 the lipids in sludge include cellular lipids free fatty acids and wax or gum zhu et al 2017 the cellular lipids species in sludge contain triglycerides diglycerides monoglycerides phospholipids and sterols dufreche et al 2007 olkiewicz et al 2014 siddiquee and rohani 2011 the free fatty acids are monocarboxylic structures with an aliphatic chain and even numbers of carbon c16 and c18 bianchi and canuel 2011 phospholipids account for about 24 25 wt of the total lipids jardé et al 2005 while fatty acids sterols and some aliphatic fractions collectively account for up to 36 8 of the total lipids jardé et al 2005 the characteristics of lipids in dom originating from estuary mannino and harvey 1999 coastal waters zou et al 2004 soil jandl et al 2002 food waste jiang et al 2014 and wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 have been widely studied as to lipids in sludge dom yuan et al 2019 found that lipids were the predominant dom in waste activated sludge samples as identified by the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms technique lipid types like cellular lipids free fatty acids fats greases and steroids have been detected in sludge dom zhu et al 2017 these lipids may suffer from significant changes during different sludge treatment processes for example ma et al 2019a found that alkaline treatment at ph 10 caused the degradation of biodegradable lipid like compounds in sludge dom lu et al 2018a identified the residual dom after anaerobic digestion and their results indicated that lipids particularly flavonoids steroids and their derivatives were the predominant residual sludge dom 3 1 5 lignins lignins are complex heteropolymers consisting of phenylpropanoid units of monolignols coniferyl sinapyl and p coumaryl alcohols and aromatic residues that form key structural materials in the support of vascular plant cell wall terashima and fukushima 1988 the amount of lignins accounts for about 3 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc hao et al 2016 functional groups of methoxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic are found in lignins structures zevallos et al 2020 lignins derivatives are major components in dom of sludge streams particularly generated in pulp and paper mill raj et al 2007 the complex mixtures of dissolved lignins fragments in the residual sludge dom differ from native lignins in functional groups chemical composition molecular weight and physicochemical characteristics due to prior different treatments processes applied in commercial pulping operations sierra alvarez and lettinga 1991 due to their high molecular weights chemical heterogeneities and absence of hydrolysable inter monomeric linkages the presence of lignins in sludge dom is a major source of organic matter resistant to biological treatments the aerobic degradation of lignins becomes possible only limited to fungi like the white rot fungi in highly aerobic environments sierra alvarez and lettinga 1991 in sharp contrast high molecular weight lignins 1000 da are not mono anaerobically degradable and cause severe inhibition on methane yield while only monomers and oligomers of lignins 600 da can be mineralized kirk and farrell 1987 chen et al 2019a evaluated the degradability of sludge with different lignocellulosic components and also found that lignins in sludge showed invisible degradability pretreatments like acid alkali thermal and ultrasonic methods were therefore applied to destroy the lignins prior to exposing to anaerobic digestion as noted by a degradation efficiency of 15 4 33 7 for lignins during anaerobic digestion of excess sludge containing lignins hu et al 2016 3 1 6 organic acids different from the foregoing high molecular weight fractions of humic acids and fulvic acids low molecular weight organic acids molecular weight less than 350 da based on the total mass balance of doc herein particularly have been identified as important fractions of dom brinkmann et al 2003 the amount of low molecular weight organic acids accounts for about 2 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc xiao et al 2016a xiao et al 2017b especially the following acids have been identified formic acetic pyruvic oxalic malonic citric lactic malonic oxalic and succinic acids dinsdale et al 2000 they are weak acids and do not dissociate completely in water and their acidities are associated with their carboxyl groups of cooh chung et al 2009 they are high soluble in sludge and can be the degradation products of various large molecular weight substances which are subject to biological and chemical treatments for example these low molecular weight organic acids are key intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles they are also active intermediates for the conversion of large molecular biopolymers into methane and carbon dioxide during anaerobic digestion tran et al 2015 the low molecular weight organic acids account for about 2 10 of the carbon in organic forest floor layer leachates kaiser et al 2001 soil herbert and bertsch 1995 aquatic systems aiken et al 1992 and rhizosphere pires et al 2007 as to the presence of low molecular weight organic acids in sludge dom zhao et al 2018a adapted the methods of nakasaki et al 2013 which was originally used for the identification in the yeast strain pichia kudriavzevii rb1 to investigate the presence of low molecular weight organic acids during sludge composting their results indicated that the concentrations of acetic acid and tartaric acid affected the shift of the bacteria community as well as the maturity during sludge composting the low molecular weight organic acids may suffer from various fates like sorption metal complexation and degradation during composting zhao et al 2018a moreover a relatively high concentration of organic acids may inhibit the microbial activities cheung et al 2010 xiao et al 2016a used the liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond technique to follow the fraction of the low molecular weight organic acids during sludge dewatering their studies showed that higher concentrations of mono protic organic acids increased the zeta potential values of the sludge flocs and facilitated sludge re coagulation as the acids can donate protons while they are dissociated 3 1 7 organic micropollutants the amount of organic micropollutants accounts for about 1 2 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc díaz et al 2020 the organic micropollutants in sludge can be categorized into different types like persistent organic pollutants pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds perfluorinated compounds brominated flame retardants organotin derivates benzotriazoles phthalate acid esters and surfactants based on their physicochemical properties of lipophilicity solubility and vapour pressure rivas et al 2015 more than 700 different organic compounds have been reported in sludge dom michael kordatou et al 2015 these organic micropollutants have been detected in sludge dom at the ng l to the mg l level díaz et al 2020 and most of organic micropollutants in sludge dom are hydrophobic present inside or on surface of sludge microorganisms compounds like sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate nonylphenol dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride triclosan galaxolide diclofenac carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole estrone bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate perfluorooctanoic acid bis tributyltin oxide tetrabromobisphenol a and benzotriazole are typical representatives threshold numbers are specified for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nonyl phenols when spreading the sludge in agricultural application liu et al 2018 mailler et al 2017 investigated 71 organic micropollutants in different sludge samples raw sludge digested sludge thermally pretreated sludge and dewatered sludge cake and the data showed same concentrations in similar types of sludge from different wastewater treatment plants wwtps díaz et al 2020 reported that organic micropollutants in dom only accounted for 10 compared to the total amount in the sludge sample as most of the compounds were adsorbed into the solid fraction of sludge rivas et al 2015 anaerobic digestion can remove 50 of organic micropollutants by degradation while 48 of them end up into the biosolids by adsorption and the remaining 2 are returned in the liquors from thickening and dewatering processes harb et al 2019 biotransformation through methanogenesis can degrade organic micropollutants to phenolic and aminated aromatic compounds harb et al 2019 improving physical retention mechanisms during anaerobic treatment like addition of sorption enhancing materials can be applied to enhance the removal efficiencies of organic micropollutants in sludge dom 3 2 dom characterization sludge samples show semi solid properties hence a specific pretreatment of sludge samples by centrifugation for solid liquid separation is normally needed the liquid phase is further treated by different isolation and or extraction methods in order to obtain dom fractions for specific analysis techniques like membrane filtration sorption and desorption on nonionic macro porous resins ion exchange resins freeze drying sorbent extraction activated alumina activated carbon and co precipitation were usually used to isolate dom from the sludge supernatant a more detailed summary including working mechanisms advantages and disadvantages of each method and selected references is listed in table s1 supporting information well established sum parameters are used to quantify dom for describing dom concentration in sludge parameters used in drinking water and wastewater analysis like doc cod permanganate index pmc bod and uv absorbance uva are often used a brief summary of sum and common surrogate parameters including definition and limitations and selected references is given in table s2 supporting information the number of publications showing methods for characterization of dom is huge but limited for dom in sludge samples abbt braun et al 2004 frimmel and abbt braun 2010 although reporting specific methods used for aqueous samples form terrestrial and aqueous environment will not be the intention of this review many different physical chemical and spectroscopic methods as well as fractionation by chromatography and specific degradation treatments have been used to characterize dom in sludge samples uv and visible spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy ir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts raman spectroscopy ft icr ms and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy capillary electrophoresis ce gel permeation or size exclusion chromatography reverse phase c18 chromatography field flow fractionation fff tangential flow filtration tff oxidative reductive and thermal degradation chemical and or enzymatic hydrolysis these methods can be used to characterize the optical sensitivity the molecular weight and size the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties the molecular formula based on mass to charge values from ms the biodegradability and the volatile and non volatile compounds of dom a more detailed overview is presented in table 1 physical and chemical analysis like elemental analysis amir et al 2004 and acid base titration d abzac et al 2010 plaza et al 2006 reveal the elemental composition and the proton capacity the absorption in the uv and visible range can be used to get information about specific functional groups for example the amount of carboxylic and phenolic like groups in dom can be estimated by calculating the differential slope of the log transformed dom absorbance in the wavelength region of 350 400 nm liu et al 2018 the fluorescence spectroscopy is based on the different fluorophoric groups present in dom the excitation emission matrix eem has become a popular tool for tracking the fate of dom in sludge samples guo et al 2014 yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 through assigning eem spectra by comparing with the fluorescence of defined molecules several different groups of dom compounds can be assigned in sludge samples 1 tyrosine like proteins 2 tryptophan like proteins 3 fulvic acid like compounds 4 microbial by product like matter and 5 humic acid like organic compounds xiao et al 2016a many different methods like fluorescence index parallel factor analysis parafac with a toolbox from matlab software yu et al 2019 fluorescence regional integration li et al 2016 peak position zhu et al 2012 and ratios of peak intensities chen et al 2016 have been used for the data interpretation however often an inconsistency among different data interpretation methods occurs and may result in incompatible results moreover the presence of fluorescence quenchers like heavy metals high temperature and micropollutants e g dicamba and phenanthrene in dom of sludge may quench fluorescence intensities and affect the final results pan et al 2010a pan et al 2010b ruan et al 2013 theoretically an eem can be decomposed with its components by a linear regression when there are no interferences from the foregoing factors qian et al 2019 based on this theory qian et al 2019 tried to diagnose the unexpected fluorescence of contaminants e g 1 2 naphthoquinone 4 sulfonic acid sodium salt using a prior linear decomposition pld method as trained and tested by a back propagation network their results indicated that the pld method offered a more accurate result than that of parafac for aquatic samples however its feasibility in identifying fluorescence intensity for dom in sludge is unknown the ir ftir and drifts techniques can characterize part of the dom structure by identifying functional groups mao et al 2003 wang et al 2016b xu et al 2018b but they fail in quantifying and need additional sample preparation there are many overlapping absorption bands with inorganic compounds and for the data interpretation many often data from other techniques are associated e g proton capacity by acid base titration abbt braun et al 2004 the raman spectroscopy can qualitatively determine functional groups of dom in sludge with rapid data generation in situ analysis and rich data profiles due to numerous spectra collected from a single map wang et al 2016b it allows only the measurement of small sample volumes due to the laser spot size during the last ten years ft icr ms has been used as a powerful and advanced technique to characterize dom in sludge yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 the ft icr ms technique can provide information for the mass to charge ratio of ions and then molecular formulas can be calculated by using specific software the generated molecular formula were then validated by setting reasonable signal to noise ratio atomic o c h c and n c ratios and element counts via van krevelen diagrams xu et al 2018a yuan et al 2019 based on the circular movement of charged particles in a strong magnetic field cyclotron movement and with the aid of ft icr ms dom in sludge can be categorized 1 lipids h c 1 5 2 0 o c 0 0 3 2 proteins h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 3 0 7 3 lignins or carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules like structures h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 7 4 carbohydrates h c 1 5 2 4 o c 0 7 1 2 5 unsaturated hydrocarbons h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 0 1 6 condensed aromatic compounds h c 0 2 0 7 o c 0 0 7 and 7 tannins h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 7 1 2 ma et al 2019b however this technique does not allow a complete comprehension or interpretation of the structural assignments along with uncertainty intervals of the analysis results prior sample acidification is needed and only salt free samples can be measured moreover the acquisition and maintenance of the ft icr ms technique are expensive compared to other techniques yuan et al 2019 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy can quantitatively determine functional groups of dom maqbool et al 2020 paneque et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019a however when broad and overlapping peaks occur the nmr technique is limited in obtaining high resolution data and thus failing to quantify dom molecular moieties this technique also requires freeze dried dom samples which are free of inorganic impurities capillary electrophoresis can be used to analyze inorganic anions organic acids amino acids nucleotides carbohydrates and other anionic compounds in dom ishii and takii 2003 reverse phase c18 chromatography separates dom according to hydrophobic interactions with the column material ling et al 2005 whereas gel permeation chromatography gpc or size exclusion chromatography sec can measure both molecular weight and size of dom in sludge wang et al 2017 in general the elution volumes or the retention time of the compounds separated are reversely correlated with the molecular size and by this in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted dom substances ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 although interactions of dom such as adsorption on the column resin as well as electrostatic and hydrophobic effects with the resin material also may lead to an advanced or delayed retention behavior in addition the lack of authentic standards representing the compounds of sludge related dom compounds for molecular weight and size calibration are restricting the validity a detailed description of the analytical protocol for the set up calibration method and calibration standards used is a prerequisite to be able to compare elution volumes and nominal molecular weights from different studies size exclusion chromatography coupled with online detection of organic carbon specific wavelengths e g 254 nm and nitrogen in general named as lc ocd ond is often used to characterize dom in sludge xiao et al 2017b zhu et al 2020 the method is assigning the chromatographical fractions with increasing retention time as follows 1 biopolymers 20 kda 2 doc hydrophobic and hydrophilic 3 protein like substances 4 humic substances 5 building blocks 6 low molecular weight neutrals 350 da and 7 low molecular weight acids 350 da xiao et al 2017b here the calibration for molecular weights is based on standards isolated from the international humic substance society suwannee river standard ii humic acid and fulvic acid and the exclusion and permeations volume of the sec column huber et al 2011 sec can also be used in the high performance liquid chromatography hplc scale as high pressure psize exclusion chromatography hpsec to characterize dom in sludge with refractive index detector and uv254 detector tian et al 2015 for a detailed interpretation of chemical compounds in the different fractions a combination of sec with mass spectrometry such as ft icr ms should be performed yuan et al 2019 the fff technique can fractionate dom in sludge and then the fractograms can be integrated over smaller size ranges such as the 0 5 4 nm 4 20 nm and 20 nm exner et al 2000 this method is particularly useful for resolving molecules of different sizes e g monomer dimer etc and it is a rather gentle separation with a minimum of interference as no shear forces or interactions with a stationary phase are involved however it only shows information of relative size distribution which cannot be easily converted to an absolute size the tff technique is separating dom into four size fractions 1 less than 1 kda 2 1 5 kda 3 5 30 kda and 4 30 kda 0 45 µm adjalle et al 2009 this method is faster and more efficient than fff separation but it fails to identify polymers with overlapping size ranges exner et al 2000 the advantages of using chromatographic methods are a relatively high sample throughput with a high degree of automation and only small sample volumes pretreatments of the sludge samples like oxidative reductive and thermal degradation methods and a subsequent gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis can provide important compositional and structural information of dom lu et al 2020 the following non polar and relatively volatile compounds after dom degradation can be identified by gc ms phenols amino acids alcohols esters glycoproteins fatty acids alkenes ceramides steroids and their derivatives flavonoids sphingolipids diglycerides quinones hydroquinones and glycerophospholipids lu et al 2018b the non volatile and thermo stable components of dom are mainly attributed to hexoses benzenoid acids medium chain fatty acids fatty acyls and dipeptides as identified by the ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms lu et al 2018b other degradation methods like chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis in association with ion exchange separation gc ce nmr or hplc can be used to determine amino acids short chain acids lignin like substances and monosaccharides in dom of sludge samples zhao et al 2018b zhu et al 2020 some compounds can be used to get information on the source and genesis of dom amino acids or monosaccharides may be used as the biomarkers however denaturation of the dom structure due to the pretreatment reactions limits the application of the degradation methods multiple complementary techniques benefit to get a broader information of dom information in sludge ma et al 2019b used a combination of three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem ftir and ft icr ms to characterize dom in terms of compounds showing fluorophoric groups functional groups and moieties in sludge alkaline fermentation additional information can be acquired that protein like substances with molecular weight less than 1 kda of dom can be observed in sludge alkaline fermentation xiao et al 2016a applied 3d eem and lc ocd ond to investigate the types and molecular weights of dom in sludge samples during dewatering and the results were consistent in terms of the key hydrophilic dom in addition extra information can be obtained from sec that proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weights of 103 5 104 kda were the key organic compounds deteriorating sludge dewaterability yuan et al 2019 linked ft icr ms and 3d eem to determine the elemental and molecular compositions of dom to provide advanced molecular insights into the role of dom during different pretreatments of sludge it was obvious that proteins and compounds showing lignins and carboxylic rich alicyclic units were the predominant dom fractions released by the thermal alkaline pretreatment lu et al 2018a used the results from lc ocd ond and pyrolysis gc ms py gc ms to investigate the transformation of dom during anaerobic sludge digestion and to identify the anaerobic digestion refractory compounds they could show that the hydrophobic part of dom characterized by lc ocd ond particularly higher molecular weight residual compounds e g polar metabolites and non polar lipids identified by py gc ms were the dominant anaerobic digestion refractory components the multi method approaches finally raise an ultimate question how can we achieve a full understanding of the dynamics of dom in sludge samples from the diversified and various collected data moreover the inconsistency between different characterization methods may result in incompatible interpretations of the data which may be related to non comparable sample treatment before analysis and or sensitivity of the analytical tools for individual chemical compounds 4 dom changes during different sludge treatment processes 4 1 dom changes during anaerobic digestion dom is crucial for anaerobic digestion due to its role as direct carbon and energy source for microorganisms typically organic compounds from the cell lysis and solubilization of particulate parts of sludge will be released into the liquid phase as dom lin et al 2019 the metabolic pathway of dom is largely dependent on the inherent characteristics and changes of dom it can be assumed that the concentration type and quality of dom can be used as key parameters for evaluating and optimizing the operation performance of anaerobic digestion for anaerobic digestion hydrolysis of the waste activated sludge flocs is the limiting step due to the low accessibility of the sludge matrix to microbes benneouala et al 2017 therefore promoting solubilization and liquefaction of macromolecular organic compounds by different pretreatments is often necessary prior to anaerobic digestion based on the definition of dom in section 2 dom in sludge was mainly related to soluble organic or readily soluble organic compounds rather than the particulate parts during sludge pretreatments the transformation of dom mainly includes the solubilization of organic compounds from sludge however there are also transformations triggered by chemical reactions during chemical pretreatment thermal degradation during thermal hydrolysis and biochemical enzymatic reactions while during anaerobic digestion of sludge the transformation of dom mainly means the changes of inherent dom of sludge and or those solubilized from sludge after pretreatments during hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes of anaerobic digestion during anaerobic digestion the summaric quantification of proteins and humic acids the term humic substances is more suitable herein rather than humic acids based on forgoing definition is often measured by the modified lowry s method frølund et al 1995 and the quantification of carbohydrates is measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 gonzalez et al 2018 summarized the effects of different pretreatments on the release of dom from sludge samples including physical chemical and biological methods for the physical methods such as ultrasonic ball mining and homogenization pretreatments an effective solubilization of the organic matter in sludge can be achieved when dom shows high concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates the concentration of proteins solubilized from sludge flocs has been consistently reported to be higher than those of carbohydrates elalami et al 2019 with a homogenization pretreatment at 0 52 mpa the concentrations of proteins increased by 72 dhar et al 2012 yan et al 2010 reported that the ultrasonic pretreatment with a specific energy input at 26 000 kj kg dry solids can promote sludge solubilization while the protein concentration was increased by 462 mg l however a maximum value is reached when the energy input is increased continuously as the maximum solubilization extent of proteins and carbohydrates was limited to about 17 of their total fractions at a pressure of 80 mpa and a specific energy input of 53 510 kj kg dry solids zhang et al 2012 chemical pretreatments like thermal acid or alkaline and advanced oxidation processes were often used the thermal pretreatment can be divided into low temperature 150 c and high temperature 150 c processes as the temperature increased from 50 to 160 c proportional increases of soluble carbohydrates proteins and humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead were observed with a relatively higher solubilization of proteins compared to humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead and carbohydrates eskicioglu et al 2006 particularly proteins can be denatured at a medium water content of 5 and at temperatures of about 75 c under these conditions proteins are more accessible to biodegradation and at temperatures more than 100 c they become more soluble de graaf 2000 for example a high concentration of soluble protein of about 30 g l was observed while pretreating sludge total solids of 16 7 with a high temperature thermal hydrolysis at 180 c for 180 min xue et al 2015 most carbohydrates become soluble at temperature as high as 130 c liu et al 2012 however caramelization of the carbohydrates may occur when temperature is higher than 170 c buera et al 1987 moreover the reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars namely maillard reaction is inclined to take place at temperatures from 140 to 165 c rather than at lower temperatures of less than 100 c dwyer et al 2008 the structural changes of humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead were indiscernible as temperature in range of 25 80 c zhen et al 2012 however the decomposition and dissociation of humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead would occur at temperature 110 c and at 150 to 180 c respectively kolokassidou et al 2007 for chemical pretreatment alkaline pretreatment has been consistently reported to be more effective for solubilizing particulate flocs into proteins carbohydrates and humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead than acid pretreatment chen et al 2007 alkaline solutions can damage microbial cells solubilize membrane proteins and saponify membrane lipids mehdizadeh et al 2013 xiao et al 2017b reported that alkaline pretreatment at ph 12 increased the soluble protein concentration 23 times compared to that without pretreatment this was much higher than those with ultrasonic pretreatment at 1 w ml 11 times and thermal pretreatment at 80 c 12 times naoh was more effective than calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 due to its less binding and connection with eps hence more dom remained in the liquid phase rather than to be re coagulated li et al 2008 sludge pretreatment with acids such as hydrochloric acid hcl sulphuric acid h2so4 and phosphoric acid h3po4 is also effective in solubilizing proteins and carbohydrates from sludge flocs the optimum solubilization can be achieved at ph of 1 to 2 devlin et al 2011 in recent years the efficiency of free nitrous acid fna in accelerating the disruption of sludge flocs has been reported at fna concentration of 1 38 mg l the solubilization degree can be 12 5 after an incubation period of 72 h wang et al 2018 a ph adjustment can be also used to mediate the solubility of organic matter as already mentioned above humic acids are inclined to precipitate at ph less than 2 however proteins remain soluble in the solution through adjusting ph to less than 2 the previous non biodegradable complex of protein humic acid can become more accessible to microbes by releasing proteins at low ph values zahmatkesh et al 2016 similar to the acid and alkaline pretreatments advanced oxidation processes aop e g fenton fe ii ion activated sulfate oxone oxidation can increase the solubilization of proteins carbohydrates and humic substances from the sludge matrix however compared with other treatment processes organic compounds can be easily converted into carbon dioxide if the oxidation agent is over dosed which may result in less accessible substrates to methanogens for the biogas production déléris et al 2000 braguglia et al 2012 also found that an oxidant dose of less than 70 mg ozone g total solids showed invisible mineralization but an oxidant dose of more than 200 mg ozone g dry solids can cause significant mineralization mineralization was more discernible when oxidizing pretreated sludge than raw waste activated sludge xiao et al 2017b for the biological pretreatment enzymes and microbes were often used yu et al 2013 found that sludge solubilization increased by 78 2 after an incubation with endogenous amylase for 7 h liu et al 2019b found that proteins of 792 5 mg l and carbohydrates of 133 5 mg l in sludge flocs were released after pretreatment with lysozyme yi et al 2014 also noted that the concentration of humic acids increased from 361 to 1108 mg l after destructing the proteins humic acids complex by addition of protease kavitha et al 2013 improved the soluble protein concentration by 150 mg l through adding strains like bacillus jerish as already noted the changes of dom are particularly dependent on the types of enzymes or microbes used for the biological pretreatment by comparing physical chemical and biological pretreatment techniques the efficiency of sludge solubilization by the physical and biological pretreatment was often lower than that of the chemical method if equivalent energy inputs were used braguglia et al 2012 most of the literature focused on investigating the changes in dom concentration e g by analyzing the concentrations of proteins carbohydrates and humic substances using the photometric methods during different pretreatments with relatively less information about the molecular characteristics of dom recently some researchers have started to investigate the changes of the structural composition in dom wu et al 2017b found that uv activated calcium peroxide oxidation can destruct the secondary structure of proteins particularly the α helix wang et al 2016b reported that a combined thermal pretreatment at 120 c for 30 min and alkaline pretreatment at ph 12 for 24 h can also decrease the content of α helix of protein secondary structure by 34 8 however it would increase the unordered shape by 18 along with the cleavage of disulphate bonds and change of s s stretching pattern chen et al 2017 found that a step wise alkaline pretreatment at ph 9 can particularly release proteins with molecular weight less than 20 kda similarly lu et al 2018b also noticed that a high temperature pretreatment at 172 c can particularly release proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weight less than 20 kda during anaerobic digestion the released dom can be later fermented to vfas fig 4 reports about the changes of vfas and biogas and the correlation with the variations of dom characteristics are increasing bozkurt and apul 2020 zhang et al 2017 during the production of methane the degradation sequence of dom was protein like compounds were degraded firstly followed by carboxylic acids and aromatic structures as indicated by the technique of ft icr ms li et al 2014 moreover data from eem fluorescence spectra showed that protein like compounds particularly tyrosine like and tryptophan like compounds are the major substrates for acidogenesis li et al 2014 the amounts of tryptophan like compounds have been found to be linearly correlated with the degradation rate of readily biodegradable substances wu et al 2006 in contrast lignin like substances and lipid like dom cannot be degraded as easily as protein like compounds during anaerobic digestion usman khan and kiaer ahring 2020 and this hard biodegradability was correlated with their molecular characteristics as lignin like substances are consisting of polyphenolic oligomers while lipid like dom type often includes aliphatic hydrocarbons esters and sterols lutze and engelhart 2020 accumulation of long chain fatty acids has been deemed as the biggest obstacle for anaerobic lipid degradation as it may inhibit methanogenic activities and cause sludge foaming by this the degradability of dom can be used to evaluate sludge degradability xiao et al 2016c in recent years some researchers further analyzed the residual dom present in anaerobic digestate for example lu et al 2018a determined low molecular weight compounds like steroid like and aromatic compounds and higher molecular weight compounds like benzenoids and their derivatives as the residual compounds after anaerobic digestion of thermal pretreated sludge while biochemical and chemical refractory humic substances and hydrophobic dissolved organic compounds particularly polycyclic steroid like compounds were the main components of the residual dom after anaerobic digestion of alkaline ultrasonic pretreated sludge fig 4 lu et al 2018b higher molecular weight residual compounds like polar metabolites dipeptides and substituted derivatives and non polar lipids contributed to the residual compounds lu et al 2018b these residual dom compounds may pose difficulties for the post treatment of anaerobic digestate considering their insusceptibility of part of the dom to biological degradation future work can be beneficial to reuse or recycle these non biodegradable substances like humic substances proteins polysaccharides and lipids in residual dom a possible application of residual dom has been investigated by scaglia et al 2017 they reported that dom in anaerobic digestate particularly hydrophobic dom fractions showed significant auxin like activity as bio stimulants to improve plant health the interplay among microbial community changes in the dom characteristics and operational process variables have been investigated during anaerobic digestion of sludge by many researchers dom properties are known to affect the biological utilization of sludge and mediate the microbial community and vice versa laera et al 2019 the microbial diversity network and functional analysis of the microorganisms may explain the impact on dom composition ma et al 2019a showed that the predominance of firmicutes and actinobacteria was beneficial for the degradation of proteins lipids and polysaccharides chen et al 2017 found that more low molecular weight dom 20 kda rather than high molecular weight dom 20 kda was produced when increasing ph values from 7 to 10 actinobacteria and proteobacteria were responsible for the increased hydrolysis degree he et al 2019 investigated the addition of benzalkonium chlorides on anaerobic digestion of sludge this addition increased the release of soluble polysaccharides 42 6 to 55 7 and soluble proteins 11 5 to 19 4 moreover the predominance of firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and actinobacteria decreased yu et al 2015 found that the addition of ferric chloride contributed to the anaerobic sludge digestion process by enriching coprothermobacter for proteins fermentation and methanosarcina for methanogenesis chen et al 2018 found that the optimum solid retention time was 6 days for a thermophilic 65 c single stage waste activated sludge digester and the long solid retention time conditions of 7 5 days and 10 days promoted the release of recalcitrant compounds building blocks according to sec characterization and impaired acidification moreover under these long solid retention time conditions the predominant pathway for methane production was shifted from acetoclastic methanogens to the syntrophic activities of acetate oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens pang et al 2020 found that the enrichment of hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria like succinispira ruminococcaceae ucg 009 ruminococcaceae ucg 002 escherichia shigella were responsible for the biodegradation of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins and other organic compounds like amino acids aliphatic and metabolic intermediates during cation exchange resin induced hydrolysis of waste activated sludge ruan et al 2019 also found that the enrichment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria like alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were responsible for the release of dom like proteins and polysaccharides during micro aeration enhanced methane production of anaerobic sludge digestion 4 2 dom changes during different sludge dewatering processes an optimum sludge handling process includes three tenets 1 high dewatering rate 2 low conditioner dose and 3 a low sludge mass for disposal mikkelsen and keiding 2002 to achieve this aim the removal of water in sludge is a key issue water in sludge can be classified into free water 70 of total mass fraction and bound water 30 of total mass fraction yuan et al 2017 free water includes bulk water and interstitial water while bound water refers to water which cannot be mechanically removed including surface water osmotic water and intracellular water yuan et al 2017 it has been widely accepted that dom showed strong affinities towards water and that chemical composition of dom can significantly affect sludge dewaterability jørgensen et al 2017 niu et al 2013 numerous statistical methods such as pearson s correlation principal component analysis and multilinear regression methods have been applied for the data gained from sophisticated dom analysis to identify the key compounds in dom related with the deteriorated sludge dewaterability generally proteins polysaccharides humic substances and amino acids can deteriorate sludge dewaterability while mono protic organic acids can improve sludge dewaterability by neutralizing negative charges of sludge surface and causing aggregation of sludge flocs through reducing the repulsive forces xiao et al 2017c to be exemplified the molecular structure and spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups like carbonyl and amino groups in proteins can bind hydration water via hydrogen bonds wu et al 2017b the hydration water can form a two dimensional hydrogen bond network around proteins khoshtariya et al 2003 damaging the hydration shell surrounding the protein surface is a prerequisite for enhancing sludge dewaterability xu et al 2018b a significant concentration of polysaccharides can also make sludge dewaterability worse neyens et al 2004 polysaccharides are consisting of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonded sugar chains shao et al 2009a the carboxyl groups in polysaccharides like pectin could form gel like substances via ionic linkages and thus hindering water removal from sludge chen et al 2020 humic substances containing aromatic structures and carboxylic groups are sticky biopolymers and can cause difficulties in the separation of water and solids xiao et al 2017d however so far no detailed kinetic studies have been conducted to corroborate the results summarized above shao et al 2009 it seems that dom conformation especially the conformation of proteins can also affect the sludge dewaterability according to the findings of you et al 2017 the secondary structures of proteins can determine sludge hydrophobicity and a low content of α helix and high contents of β sheet and random coil are indicators of sludge loose structure and can cause poor sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b fractionized dom from a sludge filtration process using size exclusion chromatography lc ocd ond and sec hplc to understand the impacts of different sizes and weight fractions of dom on the dewatering process proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weights in range of nominal weights of 106 5 107 da in lb eps were identified as the key factors worsening sludge dewaterability in their studies calibration of sec was done using polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide standards with molecular weights of 500 kda 70 kda 4 kda 600 da and 106 da tian et al 2015 through devastating or removing the polymers in lb eps hydrogen bonds between hydrophilic compounds and the sludge matrix can be damaged and bound water can be released into free water thus ameliorating sludge filterability xiao et al 2017d zhu et al 2020 systematically investigated the profiles of amino acids and their relationships with proteinaceous compounds during fenton treatment for enhanced sludge dewaterability their results showed that hydroxyl radicals can damage the membrane and ribosomal proteins a higher release of tryptophane was beneficial for enhanced sludge dewaterability by resulting in more hydrophobic interactions otherwise a higher amount of lysine deteriorated sludge dewaterability by causing more necessary energy barriers for aggregation of sludge particles the water content of the dewatered sludge cake the vacuum filtered sludge cake after filtration bound water content srf and cst are often used to evaluate sludge dewaterability to enhance sludge dewaterability different methods have been conducted as listed in details in table 2 the methods were effective in removing certain types of hydrophilic compounds the combined ultrasonic and acid treatment can damage proteins and polysaccharides more effectively than any individual treatment of acid or ultrasonication xiao et al 2016a the removal of hydrophilic substances for enhancing sludge dewaterability has also been reported when using the following techniques enzymatic treatment chen et al 2015 calcium peroxide pre oxidation and chemical re flocculation chen et al 2016 aluminum salt coagulation cao et al 2016 peracetic acid pre oxidation and chemical re flocculation zhang et al 2016 and addition of oxalic acid chen et al 2020 combined lysozyme and cationic polyacrylamide lin et al 2019 modified phosphogypsum dai et al 2018 and polyaluminium chloride yang et al 2019 table 2 acid pretreatment can improve sludge dewaterability by ionizing the carboxyl groups in sludge through donating hydrogen ions to form more mono protic organic acids zhang et al 2019 as a consequence the zeta potential becomes less negative and causes aggregation of sludge flocs by reducing the repulsive forces the alkaline treatment can solubilize more peptide chains of proteins and glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides particularly those with low molecular weights from sludge flocs than thermal and ultrasonic treatments with the similar energy inputs ruiz hernando et al 2015 these features make alkaline pretreatment appealing as a prior treatment in sludge dewatering through being combined with the subsequent anaerobic digestion for more degradation of these hydrophilic compounds shao et al 2012 the aop methods have received attentions recently due to their excellent effects in enhancing sludge dewaterability aop methods used are fenton process fe ii ion activated oxone hydrogen peroxide or sulfate xiao et al 2017b thermal activated oxone hydrogen peroxide or sulfate chen et al 2016 xiao et al 2017d and fe 0 or fe ii ions activated ozone treatment zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 the dewatering mechanism in the aop process typically includes two steps at first parts of the organic compounds are oxidized and degraded and the bound water is released into the free water phase summarized in fig 4 typically hydroxyl or sulfate radicals are generated during the oxidation step the reactivity of these radicals is dependent on the molecular properties of the oxidized compounds radicals are prone to react with aromatic and unsaturated compounds than with saturated compounds and organic acids are generated by hydrogen elimination as indicated by the higher reaction rates haag and yao 1992 extracellular polymers are susceptible to oxidative reductive depolymerization which results in cleavage of linkages in polymeric backbones neyens et al 2004 in the second step re coagulation step the generated and or extra added fe iii or al iii ions agglomerate smaller particles to larger aggregates which result in a partial dom removal xiao et al 2017b moreover the fe iii and or al iii ions can also act as flocculants or coagulants to bind with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in exopolymers steiner et al 1976 moreover proteins show a higher tendency to bind with heavy metals than humic substances and polysaccharides zhang et al 2016 an appropriate oxidation degree is needed for enhancing sludge dewaterability insufficient oxidation cannot effectively destroy the hydrophilic dom along with converting bound water to free water on the other hand excessive oxidation can release too much hydrophilic dom which is causing difficulties in removing these compounds by the subsequent re coagulation lv et al 2019 moreover the strong oxidation effect may pierce into the microorganism cell walls and damage microbial cells accompanied with releasing indigenous compounds present in the intracellular parts within the microbial cells xiao et al 2017b besides the foregoing methods sludge bio drying is also an efficient method for water removal by means of heat generated from the aerobic degradation of organic compounds the working principles of sludge bio drying are similar to aerobic composting but the aim is focused on water removal zhang et al 2015 other novel methods towards removing dom to enhance sludge dewaterability have been proposed recently among others xu et al 2018b used the polar hydrophilic reagent methanol to denature proteins and disrupt the hydration shell of proteins thus causing protein aggregation and improving sludge dewaterability methanol treatment decreased the water content of the sludge cake by 80 compared to those conditioned with traditional conditioners of poly aluminum chloride or ferric chloride chen et al 2019b developed a method to enhance sludge dewaterability by dissolving hydrophilic organic compounds with liquified dimethyl ether chen et al 2020 used oxalic acid to enhance sludge dewaterability by chelating with calcium ions present in pectin gels thus destroying the gel structure of monosaccharides 4 3 dom transformation during aerobic treatment of sludge the characteristics and transformation of dom can deliver useful information for evaluating the final humification degree of sludge yu et al 2019 for example abbt braun et al 2001 found that even when the concentration of doc followed a similar pattern during the thermophilic stage of composting the chemical composition of dom still kept on changing during the maturation phase the analysis of dom during composting of sludge is conducted by extracting the aqueous compounds from the compost huang et al 2010 the stability and maturity of final compost are always important parameters to evaluate the operation of composting wei et al 2020 different methods have been introduced for the evaluation of these two parameters they can be classified into four groups 1 empirical judgement like temperature color odor and texture are giving a general idea of the decomposition stage reached tambone et al 2010 but are giving little knowledge on the degree of maturity 2 physicochemical analysis of principal components and the derived ratios c n or nh4 no3 microbial respiration and enzyme activities in the solid compost tang et al 2019 3 analyzing dom of the aqueous compounds extracted from the solid compost by colorimetric and spectroscopic methods uv ftir and nmr fischer et al 2018 4 germination index test kebibeche et al 2019 in many studies the correlation between dom properties in the aqueous phase extracted from the compost and the humification index are used to indicate the maturity and the stability degrees of the compost nigussie et al 2017 straathof and comans 2015 zmora nahum et al 2005 during sludge composting proteins celluloses and hemicelluloses were degraded to compounds with less structural complexity like amino acids and monomers and or dimers of carbohydrates amir et al 2010 typically aliphatic substances like hemicelluloses were degraded firstly followed by proteinaceous compounds kulikowska 2016 these substances can be either used as carbon and or nitrogen sources mineralized for the generation of carbon dioxide and ammonia or act as building blocks for the formation of humus wright et al 2008 the polymerization of c o bonds of polysaccharide like structures and carboxylic and or phenolic groups is a main key factor for the formation of humus yu et al 2019 the increase of humic substances and the related species transformation from easily degradable to decomposition resistant can reflect compost maturity zhao et al 2018a the changes of dom during composting of sewage sludge included two phases 1 decomposition of organic compounds and 2 polymerization of organic compounds in phase 1 better easily degradable sources such as glucoses amino acids and organic acids are available and can be directly used as soluble compounds by bacteria zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 the decomposition period of easily biodegradable compounds lasts for 14 to 21 days zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 during this phase organic acids were predominantly generated through the degradation of organic compounds and the metabolism from microorganisms the accumulation of organic acids may cause a decrease in ph and inhibit the microbial activities thus reducing the effectiveness of composts and the quality of final composting products plachá et al 2013 in phase 2 secondary sources such as celluloses hemicelluloses and lipids are hydrolyzed or degraded prior to use finally the humification of organic compounds occurs accompanied with the production of poly condensed and humic like substances zhao et al 2018a this process lasts for 14 days followed by the stabilization of organic compounds and decreased microbial activity zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 due to its relatively high moisture content sludge typically cannot be composted individually the addition of bulking agents can solve this issue through providing structural support by generating interparticle voids to decrease the moisture content permit sufficient gas exchange and to prevent inordinate compaction of substrate zhao et al 2016 moreover bulking agents can change the quality of the composting substrate by altering mechanical structure c n ratio density ph of the leachate solution and finally affect the dom degradation pathway for example ingelmo et al 2012 showed that the addition of wood into sludge can polymerize humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead by ligno cellulosic derivates originating from wood degradation thus promoting the formation of humus the functional groups of the dom compounds can also affect the bio accessibility of heavy metals during sludge composting tang et al 2019 found that dom with more amide bonds of proteinaceous compounds can decrease the bio and or phyto accessibility of cr vi while the degradation of aromatic compounds and the increase of carboxyl groups can control the bio accessibility of pb ii studies using 3d eem showed that an increase of tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances and the degradation of humic like substance can decrease the bio accessibility of zn ii as is reported there were significant correlations between bacterial community and diverse subunits of dom zhao et al 2018a and part of the dom compounds were degraded by microorganisms during sludge composting some of dom like phospholipid fatty acid neutral lipid fatty acid and sterol were essential components of all living biomass showing significant structural changes and great biological specificity and they can be used as indicators for the activities of various microorganisms during sludge composting amir et al 2008 hence understanding the mutual effects between dom composition and the microbial metabolic functions is beneficial to control the composting process ueno et al 2001 for example zhu et al 2019 showed that the key microorganisms stabilizing organic compounds during composting were prosthecobacter paenalcaligenes and solibacillus through converting high molecular weight dom 10 kda into lower molecular weight dom 650 da whereas robledo et al 2020 found that pedomicrobium ureibacillus and tepidomicrobium can be indicators for the stabilization of organic compounds during sludge composting in fact the degree of organic matter stability affected the activities of enzymes like alkaline phosphatase dehydrogenase and β glucosidase robledo mahón et al 2018 and the amounts of these enzymes showed correlations with the quantities of actinomycetales and bacillales with actinomycetales on average more predominant at the beginning of sludge composting process and bacillales on average more predominant at the end of sludge composting process robledo mahón et al 2018 moreover actinobacteria and proteobacteria were associated with cellulose degradation during sludge composting liu et al 2020 while thermobifida fusca was associated with lignocellulose degradation during the composting of sludge containing high levels of lipids and fibers nakasaki et al 2009 the ammonium assimilating bacillus improved the decomposition of dom by converting ammonia n to cell protein thus mitigating ammonia emission in sludge composting shou et al 2019 the microbial driven degradation of dom by proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi controlled the phytoavailability of residual heavy metals in municipal sludge compost e g cr and pb tang et al 2019 it is also noted that the dominance of distinct microbial communities was strongly related with substrates operational variables and inocula and it cannot be ignored that monitoring the changes of dom composition and their interrelation with microbial communities and operational variables can better mediate the sludge composting process 4 4 dom changes during sludge landfill treatment although landfill treatment of sludge has been prohibited in many countries due to its negative environmental impacts there are still old landfills in denmark spain france italy the united kingdom de albuquerque et al 2018 and china yang et al 2017 the main aims for sludge landfill treatment are sludge reduction and stabilization and concurrently the need to meet the discharge standards for the residual emissions in a long term run ni et al 2011 during landfill treatment anaerobic digestion of sludge can occur to degrade organic compounds therein wu et al 2019b consequently the composition of dom in sludge samples during landfill treatments is linked to the stabilization of sanitary landfill and the final characteristics of leachate sözen et al 2014 weis et al 1989 noted that the humic like substances extracted from landfill leachate showed higher contents of carbon hydrogen and sulphur than those extracted from soil and bog lake water the increased amount of humic substances in the final refuse of sludge landfill can be a key parameter for the stabilization of sanitary landfill filip and küster 1979 he et al 2006 found that dom in landfill leachate mainly included the higher molecular weight humic acids 10 kda lower molecular weight fulvic acids 50 kda and hydrophilic fractions 4 kda the molecular weights of the different fractions were analyzed using membrane filtration methods the molecular weight cutoffs at 100 50 10 4 and 1 kda were used as standards in their recent findings they investigated the structural features and molecular compositions of dom with a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap lc ms a solid phase extraction was conducted for dom isolation information like h c n c and o c atomic ratios molecular weights and the mass peak intensity weighted average of the double bond equivalents can be obtained van krevelen diagrams were used to identify internal discrepancies between leachate dom and different waste age more than 6 000 ion peaks could be identified with the molecular formula and 57 peaks showed strong correlations with the waste age of leachate qiu et al 2020 one directive imposed by european regulations states that the concentration of dom in the leachate from sludge landfills should be less than 80 mg l doc kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 the use of coagulation sedimentation process is often used to remove dom in landfill leachate he et al 2006 however the results of sözen et al 2014 found that the observed doc levels of most leachate generated failed to meet this requirement moreover higher doc concentration can increase heavy metal migration and mobility due to the complexation reactions especially the capability of humic substances in complexing metals has received numerous attentions during sludge landfill treatment eem in combination with fluorescence quenching has been used to study the interaction between hg ii and dom extracted from landfill leachate he et al 2010 and the complex formation between cu ii pb ii zn ii and humic like and fulvic like components of bulk dom in leachate wu et al 2011 trost and filip 1985 investigated complexation of humic substances with cu ii and fe iii in landfill refuse the complexation between metal ions and dom is shown in fig 4 several studies showed that reducing the content of doc was one of the effective ways to control migration and leaching of metals weis et al 1989 besides metals the interaction of sludge derived organic micropollutants with dom in landfill leachate can also affect the final quality by increasing the mobility of these compounds larsen et al 1992 found that hexachlorobenzene and benzo a pyrene some of the most abundant sludge derived micropollutants worldwide are often determined in landfill leachate numerous reviews have described the distribution and transformation of micropollutants and other dom in aquatic systems sedlak et al 2000 and soil stangroom et al 2000a stangroom et al 2000b in detail less reviews in the field of sludge are published the similarities and dissimilarities of the reaction mechanisms between micropollutants and other dom in sludge and other systems like soil and aquatic systems need to be better clarified in the future work 5 discussion and outlook to date results for dom studies in sludge demonstrated that specific dom fractions can be used as an indicator revealing the efficiencies of different sludge treatment processes cai et al 2016a narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 in anaerobic digestion of sludge anaerobic digestion refractory compounds can be generated after pretreatment particularly high molecular weight compounds like polycyclic steroid like substances alkanes aromatic compounds and lipids lu et al 2018a in sludge dewatering processes low molecular weight proteins 20 kda have been noted to deteriorate sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b concerning sludge composting decomposition and polymerization of organic compounds occur accompanied with dom humification and formation of poly condensed humic substances generally speaking dom is degraded by microorganisms during sludge composting in the following order aliphatic substances proteinaceous compounds carbohydrates zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 during sludge landfill treatment particularly humic substances can affect the mobility of heavy metals in the landfill leachate he et al 2010 currently many sophisticated methods have been used to identify dom in sludge samples however the inconsistency between different methods may result in incompatible interpretations of the data lu et al 2018a ma et al 2019b xiao et al 2016a yuan et al 2019 in future studies validation followed by standardization of analytical methods for dom in sludge samples including sample preparation and fractionation sample analysis and data integration need to be established moreover due to the limitation of current analysis techniques a more detailed view of the molecular basis of the main compound classes such as proteins lipids carbohydrates and humic substances could be reached with an enhanced further development and adaption of techniques available besides their application in aqueous system derrien et al 2017 the use of biomarkers e g lipid biomarkers like n alkanes fatty acids and sterols for analysis followed by numerical modelling e g neural network analysis multilinear regression and principal component analysis should be also applied for a better understanding of the processes related with sludge dom sources the subsequent measurement of dom in sludge should always be coupled with its physical and chemical characteristics type conformation molecular weight and size polarity hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity and electron accepting capacity including origin sampling and pretreatment and concentration however currently most studies focused on the concentrations of dom fractions like proteins carbohydrates and humic substances analyzed either by doc or by using the summaric photometric methods maspolim et al 2015b xiao et al 2016c results from sum or surrogate parameters fail to reflect changes in the chemical composition therefore future studies should combine results from basic sum parameters quantity with additional characteristic dom quality data and sludge treatment efficiencies for biological sludge treatment anaerobic digestion or composting the link between dom microbial communities and performance variables has been investigated in some studies chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 ma et al 2019a although there are many open questions due to large variations in microbial population especially between those which are anaerobic and those which are aerobic and the changes of operational conditions the core microbes responsible for certain types of dom degradation remains still inconsistent and unclear during sludge dewatering the removal of water trapped in hydrophilic dom is the key step niu et al 2013 a more detailed knowledge about the dynamics for the degradation of key hydrophilic dom and the associated water release is needed moreover besides dom it is also noted that floc structure itself is of most importance during sludge water separation processes xiao et al 2017c the presence and or absence of dom on the behavior of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering also need to be investigated in the future work during sludge landfill treatment it remains unclear whether the driving complexing force between the metals and dom in the leachate is exothermic or thermodynamic in future isothermal titration calorimetry could be used to estimate the thermodynamic parameters e g binding capacity binding constant and binding enthalpy for the binding of metal ions onto dom sheng et al 2013 other techniques such as xanes can be used to decipher the local structure of dom metal complex xu et al 2016 as such the driving binding force for the complexation process whether hydrogen bond electrostatic interaction or hydrophobic interaction can be identified finally for a throughout understanding of dom changes during different sludge treatment processes more attention should be paid to identify the correlations between dom properties andsludge treatment performance to be one step further these correlations need to be quantified for the future design of on line sensors to understand dom changes so as to better control and optimize sludge treatments processes by way of learning from the use of real time monitors reflecting dom changes in aqueous samples niu et al 2014 summative analyses should be complemented by identifying the different dom components in associated with engineered parameters for different sludge treatments and more knowledge of dom characteristics and transformation can push forward the development of sludge treatment technology for sludge reduction and stabilization 6 conclusion the characteristics of dom can be used as an indicator revealing the efficiencies of different sludge treatment processes this study has systematically summarized the fate of dom during different sludge treatment processes focusing on the changes of dom subunits the main conclusions of this review paper can be put forward as follows 1 although numerous methods have been used for extraction isolation quantification of dom how to select the proper method to characterize dom remains unclear validation followed by standardization of analytical methods for dom in sludge samples including sample preparation and fractionation sample analysis and data integration need to be established we propose that the differences of dom in sludge compared with other aquatic and soil samples always need to be considered while choosing a proper method for dom characterization in sludge moreover due to the limitation of current analysis techniques a more detailed view of the molecular basis of dom subunits could be reached with an enhanced further development and adaption of techniques available the use of biomarkers for analysis followed by numerical modelling should be applied for a better understanding of the processes related with sludge dom sources 2 dom transformation during different sludge treatment processes was presented in anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion refractory organic matters particularly compounds showing polycyclic steroid like alkane and aromatic structures can be generated after pretreatment during dewatering the dom fraction of low molecular weight proteins 20 000 da is the key parameter deteriorating sludge dewaterability during composting decomposition and polymerization of dom occur followed by the formation of humic substances during landfill treatment the composition of dom particularly humic substances are related with leachate quality 3 in future work for biological sludge treatment like anaerobic digestion or composting more attention should be paid to the core microbes responsible for certain types of dom degradation during sludge dewatering the physiochemical mechanism for the degradation of key hydrophilic dom and the associated water holding capacity of dom need to be investigated and more attention should be paid to the presence and or absence of dom on the behavior of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering during sludge landfill treatment it remains unclear whether the driving complexing force between the metals and dom in the leachate is exothermic or thermodynamic 4 for a throughout understanding of dom changes during different sludge treatment processes more attention should be paid to identify the correlations between dom properties and sludge treatment performance on line monitors to understand dom changes so as to better control and optimize sludge treatments processes can be developed the different dom components in associated with engineered parameters for different sludge treatments can be identified by summative analyses

subsequent sludge reduction and stabilization numerous approaches have been proposed for sludge treatment such as anaerobic digestion dewatering composting and landfill treatment zhen et al 2017 in recent years dissolved organic matter dom in sludge has received much attention during these treatments the web of science database shows that the number of publications per year with dissolved organic matter searching with the word of dissolved organic matter as topic increased sharply only 587 papers in 2000 over 1000 papers per year since 2007 and up to 2462 papers in 2019 by specific search with the word of dissolved organic matter in sludge the numbers increased from 17 papers in 2000 to 155 papers in 2019 supporting information figure s1 the researchers from china based on the country name of the first affiliation address where the authors come from published the highest number of papers 37 followed by those from the united states 11 and spain 6 this shows the ever growing importance of dom studies during sludge treatment processes dom in sludge often originates from influent wastewater cell lysis and hydrolysis of particulate compounds during biological wastewater treatment and non biodegradable residues of some biochemical and chemical refractory compounds cai et al 2016a the composition of dom in the influent of wastewater treatment plants varies due to the different sources as shown in fig 1 during pretreatments with screening and de gritting and gravitational sedimentation in the preliminary sedimentation tank part of the dom is removed due to sorption to particulate matter and biodegradation xue et al 2017 and about 20 30 of organic matter in terms of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc can be removed carstea et al 2016 the main processes for organic matter removal accounting for about 55 60 of total bod5 cod or toc removal during wastewater treatment are biodegradation biotransformation and sorption to activated sludge in the biological steps like activated sludge clarification anoxic aerobic aerobic aerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactors and membrane bioreactors carstea et al 2016 xue et al 2017 after secondary sedimentation further tertiary and quaternary treatment can remove about another 5 8 of total bod5 cod or toc by processes like soil aquifer infiltration filtration flocculation and clarification oxidation and filtration stabilization in ponds ultra violet uv disinfection and or chlorination ou et al 2014 reynolds 2002 yu et al 2014 partial soluble microbial products originating from the activated sludge treatment higher molecular weight substances formed due to polymerization during degradation processes and trace organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin may be discharged into the effluent finally michael kordatou et al 2015 wang and chen 2018b during anaerobic digestion dom in sludge is an important regulator for the microbial communities since the insoluble substrates can only become accessible to microbes after being solubilized to dom narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 if considering the initial content of volatile solids in sludge is 100 about 40 60 of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded during the anaerobic digestion process if mechanical thermal chemical and biological pretreatments are applied maspolim et al 2015a zhen et al 2017 in brief as is known the hydrolysis of complex organic matter particularly the insoluble organic matter of sludge into dom is the first and the rate limiting step of anaerobic sludge digestion alvarado et al 2021 more knowledge about the dom characteristics is essential to understand the hydrolysis features of sludge subsequently the biodegradable dom fraction can be fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas and vfas are subsequently converted to biogas by methanogens while the anaerobic digestion refractory part still remains in both the liquid and solid phase of the anaerobic digestate hence understanding the composition of the biodegradable and anaerobic digestion refractory parts of dom is particularly important in the anaerobic digestion process when dewatering with traditional polymers the water content of the sludge cake is very often in the range of 75 85 w w and fails to meet the strict regulations of a content of less than 60 w w for the subsequent sludge treatment and disposal in landfill zhang et al 2010 to achieve this target the bound water trapped in sludge dom and extracellular polymeric substances eps needs to be removed about 25 50 of dom in terms of bod5 cod or dissolved organic carbon doc can be shifted from the inner eps layer into the outer eps layer by chemical degradation and mineralization through advanced oxidation treatment xiao et al 2016a xiao et al 2017b thus knowledge of the composition molecular size and weight conformation structure and aggregation of dom can significantly help to improve sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2016a during sludge composting about 30 40 of volatile solids in terms of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded zheng et al 2020 as dom is considered as an important source of organic carbon in sludge composting the dom characteristics can impact the decomposition and polymerization processes as well as the degree of final humification yu et al 2019 during landfill treatment about 10 20 of volatile solids in sludge in terms of bod5 cod or toc can be degraded during the aerobic or anaerobic processes lo et al 2002 parravicini et al 2008 the composition and structural characteristics of dom are considered to impact biological stability as most changes of organic matter occur in the water soluble phase during landfill stabilization he et al 2011 liu et al 2019a in addition sludge incineration has received attractively growing attention due to its volume reduction organic pollutant destruction and energy recovery features hao et al 2020 sludge pyrolysis is another thermal treatment method which often converts organic material into char oil and or wax tar and syngas in the absence of oxygen li et al 2020 during these two processes sludge is typically exposed to dewatering and or drying prior to incineration or pyrolysis numerous studies have reported the changes in the sludge composition during incineration and pyrolysis which mostly impacts proteins lipids carbohydrates and amino acids bahadur et al 1995 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 however most of the studies used the whole sludge sample both solid and liquid fraction hence the results cannot be transferred directly to the changes in the dom composition during the pyrolysis and incineration processes given this background understanding how the characteristic of dom is changing during anaerobic digestion dewatering composting and landfill treatment has required efforts to probe into its composition and molecular characteristics it is necessary to decipher the dom composition in order to understand how dom is degraded removed and finally what makes organic compounds biochemical and chemical refractory after exposing to different sludge treatment methods moreover the characteristic of dom is often related with the efficiencies of these processes and in some cases is combined with environmental pollutions such as malodor water pollution and soil contamination if treated improperly and vice versa dignac et al 2000 sludge properties like hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity aggregation ability degradability and settleability can be determined by means of dom characterization shakeri et al 2012a yet numerous studies tended to focus on improving treatment efficiencies by developing new process methods changing operational ways or simply combining different process methods rather than to control key compounds of dom during the processes bozkurt and apul 2020 huang et al 2017 in all these studies the performance was typically evaluated in terms of engineering parameters e g methane production for anaerobic digestion xiao et al 2016b sludge dewaterability in terms of capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf bound water content shear sensitivity cake dry matter content lv et al 2019 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 compost stability stable organic matter and maturity the absence of phytotoxic compounds and plant or animal pathogens for plant growth potential for composting wei et al 2020 leachate characteristics and the stability of landfill piles lou et al 2015 current standards and evaluation methods for sludge treatment focused almost on these engineering parameters whether certain ranges are fulfilled or not but in fact only process efficiencies can be inferred from such studies similarly the community physiological profiles can only show the predominant microbial communities during the degradation of nutrient sources in sludge but will not directly elucidate what kind of substrates and to which degree it is used maspolim et al 2015b a more detailed characterization of the dom composition can act as a bridge linking both engineering performance and microbial community together and by this more in depth understanding of different treatment process can be achieved li et al 2014 undoubtedly revealing the underlying mechanism and how and why these performances of sludge treatment are changed in terms of dom always needs to be in the first place this type of bottom up analysis is necessary as the changes in the dom characteristics in sludge are concomitant results of changes in microbial communities and sludge treatment efficiencies thus the question arises as to a better understanding of dom composition for sludge produced during the different sludge treatment processes according to literature in the past years the dom analysis methods developed have shifted from simple chemical analysis like uv and visible absorbance measurements xiao et al 2016c to more sophisticated techniques like mass spectrometry ms maspolim et al 2015a and x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes shakeri et al 2012b among other methods which allow a more detailed view in the structural changes of dom during different sludge treatment processes in the past ten years several state of the art overviews have been published related to dom present in different environments selected references are dom in natural environments frimmel and abbt braun 2009 in aquatic systems aiken 2014 in sea water perdue and benner 2009 natural organic matter nom in atmospheric particles duarte and duarte 2009 dom in soil concerning storage and turnover torn et al 2009 and dom in wastewater carstea et al 2016 chon et al 2017 tran et al 2015 currently limited studies have discussed or reviewed dom in sludge and sludge related processes the aim of this review paper is to summarize results from the current literature by summing up the current definitions for dom in sludge identifying dom composition evaluating the advantages and limitations of current means for dom analysis discussing the potential limitations for the sum parameters of dom as well as deciphering dom migration and fate during different sludge treatments particularly the mechanisms behind dom transformation during different sludge treatment processes are summarized and future developments for sludge treatment methods are proposed based on comprehensive dom characterization 2 the definition of dom in sludge the definition of dom in aquatic systems like rivers lakes oceans groundwater wastewater or process water has been well stated by frimmel and abbt braun 2009 that those organic substances of the total organic carbon in aqueous solutions passing through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm this operationally based definition can also be applied for dom in sludge including raw sludge pretreated sludge etc passing of the sludge supernatant through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm fig 2 a which differentiates between particulate organic matter retained in a 0 45 µm filter pore and colloidal organic matter sizes between 1 nm and 1 µm artifon et al 2019 however a detailed description of how the liquid fraction of the sludge sample is collected is very often not given different from aqueous samples sludge is a semi solid slurry containing both liquid and solid material the total dry solid content of sludge varies due to different types of sludge primary sludge total solids of 5 9 secondary sludge total solids of 0 8 1 2 tyagi and lo 2013 to obtain the dissolved fraction the direct filtration of sludge through a membrane filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm filter is difficult due to the presence of sludge solids a prior centrifugation separation of sludge with a relative centrifugation force which is not inducing cell lysis is often needed in the studies of yu et al 2008 sludge biomass is priorly centrifugated at 4 000 g to obtain the bulk liquid in other studies the sludge supernatant is also regarded as the slime or the soluble eps fraction as a consequence an additional extraction step is included for loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps of sludge samples by the chemical methods like addition of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid glutaraldehyde and physical methods like sonication cation exchange resin and heating are used comte et al 2006 these pretreatments can destruct the connection of bound eps onto sludge flocs to obtain bulk liquids for example the cation exchange resin can remove cations e g ca2 from the sludge matrix thus destructing the flocs and resulting in a subsequent release of eps these specific fractions extracted from the particulate parts of sludge should not be considered as dom of sludge as the liquid fraction also contains bound extracellular organic matter qu et al 2012 however the definition of dom based on the operational filtration processes also has its limitation the characteristics of the membrane filters and the filtration process e g type surface tension pretreatment of filters and pressure during the filtration process as well as pore blocking caused by colloidal and particulate matter in the sludge supernatant can impact the final solution frimmel and abbt braun 2009 karanfil et al 2003 centrifugation as pretreatment using a centrifugation force of 4 000 g can achieve a good liquid and solid separation along with no interferences with cell lysis for most sludge samples although it is not a golden rule and does not work for sludge with low settleability and filterability in addition the colloidal fraction with sizes between 1 nm and 1 µm of sludge overlapping the dissolved fraction the fraction that passes through 0 45 µm filter and particulate fraction retained in a 0 45 µm filter pore arbitrarily defined can also affect dom artifon et al 2019 but is ignored in this definition therefore a precise definition of dom in sludge concerning defined operational experimental steps of sample treatment is needed in future studies 3 physicochemical properties of dom in sludge 3 1 dom composition the first step to link dom properties and sludge treatment efficiencies and microbial communities is to understand dom composition tran et al 2015 defined dom composition in wastewater as a complex heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds with functional groups like carboxylic carbonyl methoxyl hydroxyl and phenolic functional groups they further divided dom into subunits based on the biodegradability the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties the distribution of molecular weight and size and the fluorescence characteristics the description of the structural dom composition can vary beyond what is reported due to the inconsistencies of analysis methods and data interpretation a unified description for the exact composition of dom is still lacking and due the heterogeneous and complex character of dom in sludge the description of molecular structures of all subunits of the dom will not be possible in the near future considering that sludge samples are byproducts of various physical chemical and biochemical reactions in wastewater treatment and based on the current literature the most important subunits of dom in sludge can be summarized as proteinaceous compounds proteins and amino acids carbohydrates polysaccharides and monosaccharides humic substances humic acids and fulvic acids lipids lignins organic acids and organic micropollutants fig 3 these compounds are located in the slime layer or soluble eps layer of the sludge flocs figs 2b c in the following sections the main subunits of dom in sludge samples which have been reported in literature till now will be reviewed whereupon their characteristics will be discussed 3 1 1 proteinaceous compounds proteins apportion to about 40 50 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc shier and purwono 1994 xiao et al 2016a proteins with molecular weight less than 20 kilo dalton kda dominated in 20 different sludge samples xiao et al 2017c as the polypeptide backbone the protein conformation determines the detailed function of protein molecules wang et al 2016a the protein secondary structures in sludge samples were identified as α helix β sheet aggregated strands random coil 3 turnhelix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands with α helix and β sheet often predominated you et al 2017 when the ratio of the content of α helix to the contents of both β sheet and random coil gets lower the structure of proteins becomes looser you et al 2017 wu et al 2017a used the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation itraq to investigate protein types in waste activated sludge their results indicated that most proteins originated from the intracellular non membrane bounded organelle of bacteria forming sludge flocs and could be divided into three types based on their gene ontology cellular components molecular function and biological processes wu et al 2017a due to differences in chemical composition whether simple complex or conjugated shape whether fibrous or globular and biological functions whether enzymes and structural storage or transport proteins proteins play several different functions during sludge treatments amino acids are simple molecules containing at least one amine r nh2 and one carboxyl group r cooh and act as the building blocks of peptides and proteins artifon et al 2019 the amount of amino acids accounts for about 2 3 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc zhu et al 2020 compared with the numerous studies investigating proteins polysaccharides and humic substances in dom of sludge samples the content of amino acids is often overlooked in recent years their role in dewatering and anaerobic digestion has been recognized wu et al 2017a free amino acids are in the three dimensional structure of peptides and their types and compositional distributions are determining factors for protein physicochemical characteristics subrahmanyam et al 1960 amino acids are more easily degraded by microorganisms compared with their parental compounds of proteins artifon et al 2019 due to the amphoteric character amino acids also show affinity to water ubukata 1998 about 17 types of amino acids are present in sludge samples including essential and non essential amino acids liu et al 2009 the 17 naturally occurring amino acids can be classified into three groups hydrophilic glycine serine threonine and cysteine hydrophobic alanine valine leucine isoleucine phenylalanine tyrosine methionine and proline and acid alkaline aspartic glutamic lysine histidine and arginine meirovitch et al 1980 the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups can significantly affect the hydrophobicity of proteins as well as their surface properties when the amino acid in the polypeptide chain reverses its overall direction and the number of amino acid residues forming the turn is less than six a tight turn structure of amino acid can be formed chou 2000 this tight turn structure can control molecular recognition enzymatic activity and nucleation of folding franklin and slusky 2018 for the predominance of amino acids in sludge samples zhao et al 2018a found that phenylalanine leucine alanine threonine glycine glutamic and valine determine the biosynthesis of extracellular proteins cai et al 2016b reported that tryptophan and tyrosine were degraded during the thermophilic phase of sludge bio drying hou et al 2015 showed that hydrophobic amino acids affect aggregation of anammox sludge chen et al 2019a investigated the types and concentrations of amino acids during anaerobic digestion and their results indicated that thermal pretreatment at 120 or 160 c can promote the degradation of amino acids with the clostridiales order as the responsible microorganism via the stickland pathway 3 1 2 carbohydrates carbohydrates are polyhydroxyl carbonyl compounds containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms artifon et al 2019 the amount of carbohydrates accounts for about 10 15 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc xiao et al 2016a polysaccharides like cellulose and hemicellulose are hydrophilic carbohydrates distributed evenly in different fractions of sludge flocs shao et al 2009 thomas et al 2010 with molecular weights in two ranges 1 kda christophe et al 2005 or 100 2000 kda in sludge samples flemming and wingender 2010 meng et al 2011 most polysaccharides are linear or branched attached to the cell surface thus forming complex networks seviour et al 2019 typically the linkage nature of polysaccharides e g α oxygen or β oxygen is related with the glycosidic carbon jiao et al 2010 the content of polysaccharides in sludge has been reported to affect adsorption flocculation and settleability of sludge samples zhao et al 2017 monosaccharides can be linked by glycosidic bonds to generate larger carbohydrates like disaccharides oligosaccharides or polysaccharides li et al 2008 monosaccharides can be generated from the hydrolysis of macromolecules like starch cellulose and hemicellulose li et al 2008 some monosaccharides like mannose rhamnose arabinose galacturonic acid xylose gluconic acid ribose glucose fucose and galactose have also been identified in waste activated sludge samples chen et al 2020 and aerobic granular sludge felz et al 2020 3 1 3 humic substances humic substances in sludge account for about 10 15 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc li et al 2013 xiao et al 2016a based on the definition of humic substances by the international humic substances society ihss 2016 humic substances refer to complex and heterogeneous mixtures of poly dispersed materials formed in soils sediments and natural waters humic substances are operationally divided into humic acids base soluble fulvic acids soluble at all ph conditions and humus insoluble at any ph and only available in soil abbt braun et al 2004 olk et al 2019 considering the insolubility of humus in water at any ph the humic substances related to dom in sludge herein only denote fulvic acids and humic acids as can be seen in a book describing humic substances the fields of soil aquatic systems rhizosphere and atmosphere particles senesi et al 2009 the detailed definition composition and structural characteristics isolation and analysis and pathways for humic substances formation have been systematically stated both humic acids and fulvic acids show complex structures which consist of aromatic heterocyclic alicyclic poly aliphatic and poly aromatic structures in addition the occurrence of carboxylic and o alkylic groups is most obvious among other functional groups e g phenolic carbonyl ester ketones aldehydes and amide groups abbt braun et al 2004 the functional groups of humic and fulvic acids which are consisting of aromatic ring structures can determine the electron transfer capacities senesi et al 2009 it has been widely accepted that humic substances are the biochemical and chemical refractory decomposition products of biological materials and are also often called biochemical and chemical refractory organic substances abbt braun et al 2004 however scientists still fail to identify the exact structure of humic substances macromolecules due to their complex heterogeneous structures as for sludge samples researchers often use the terms humus humic acid and fulvic acid without consistency and without giving defined experimental protocols that how the fractions have been extracted from the sludge samples this vague terminology may lead to misunderstanding and wrong interpretation in one of the studies the content of humus in dom of sludge samples was investigated by a revised lowry s method frølund et al 1995 and their results indicated that humus in sludge was relatively easy to be released into the mixed liquid during air disturbance and water flow in the reactor xuan et al 2010 according to the definitions given ahead it is more likely that humic acid or fulvic acid fractions might be the term to be used others analyzed the concentration of humic acid of sludge samples pretreated at ph of 2 by a modified lowry s method after filtering sludge samples through 0 45 µm cellulose membrane filters xiao et al 2016a and their results showed that the content of humic acid increased in soluble eps and decreased in tb eps xiao et al 2016a however considering the ph of 2 used in their study it might be clearer to use the term humic substances or fulvic acids in fact a variety of terminologies have been used to describe humic substances such as biochemical and chemical refractory organic substances soil organic matter natural organic matter and dissolved organic matter one always needs to keep the operational definitions based on fractionation procedures in mind while using humic acid fulvic acid and humus as well as the different origin of the samples e g soils and sediments aqueous environments rhizosphere and atmosphere particles currently the researchers often use the xad 8 a registered trademark of the dow chemical company method the widely used amberlite xad 8 resin is no longer commercially available and supelite dax 8 resin has been substituted in recent research for the isolation of humic substances in sludge dom aiken et al 1992 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b which is similar to those used for aqueous samples and or for soil samples after alkaline extraction as developed by the international humic substances society ihss 2016 xu et al 2020 used the xad 8 method for the characterization of humic substances and found that humic substances may interact with biopolymers in sludge to form a dense granular aggregate through decreasing active sites for enzyme activities thus inhibiting sludge solubilization and the subsequent anaerobic digestion lu et al 2018a also followed this method and pointed out that humic substances were the main identified non biodegradable residues of dom during anaerobic digestion the unique semi solid properties of sludge make humic substances in sludge dom decisively different from those in bulk soils or aquatic sources from a chemical physical and biological point of view hence the characteristic of humic substances in dom from sludge samples compared to those originating from typical natural systems needs to be investigated in future studies 3 1 4 lipids lipids are consisting of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur artifon et al 2019 which may originate from the cell envelops composed of phospholipid layers the amount of lipids accounts for about 3 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc yuan et al 2019 the structural characteristics of lipids like the length of carbonic chain unsaturation degree surface charges polarity size of the head group and hydrogen bonding capability often determine their functions during sludge treatments kimura et al 2016 the lipids in sludge include cellular lipids free fatty acids and wax or gum zhu et al 2017 the cellular lipids species in sludge contain triglycerides diglycerides monoglycerides phospholipids and sterols dufreche et al 2007 olkiewicz et al 2014 siddiquee and rohani 2011 the free fatty acids are monocarboxylic structures with an aliphatic chain and even numbers of carbon c16 and c18 bianchi and canuel 2011 phospholipids account for about 24 25 wt of the total lipids jardé et al 2005 while fatty acids sterols and some aliphatic fractions collectively account for up to 36 8 of the total lipids jardé et al 2005 the characteristics of lipids in dom originating from estuary mannino and harvey 1999 coastal waters zou et al 2004 soil jandl et al 2002 food waste jiang et al 2014 and wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 have been widely studied as to lipids in sludge dom yuan et al 2019 found that lipids were the predominant dom in waste activated sludge samples as identified by the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms technique lipid types like cellular lipids free fatty acids fats greases and steroids have been detected in sludge dom zhu et al 2017 these lipids may suffer from significant changes during different sludge treatment processes for example ma et al 2019a found that alkaline treatment at ph 10 caused the degradation of biodegradable lipid like compounds in sludge dom lu et al 2018a identified the residual dom after anaerobic digestion and their results indicated that lipids particularly flavonoids steroids and their derivatives were the predominant residual sludge dom 3 1 5 lignins lignins are complex heteropolymers consisting of phenylpropanoid units of monolignols coniferyl sinapyl and p coumaryl alcohols and aromatic residues that form key structural materials in the support of vascular plant cell wall terashima and fukushima 1988 the amount of lignins accounts for about 3 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc hao et al 2016 functional groups of methoxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic are found in lignins structures zevallos et al 2020 lignins derivatives are major components in dom of sludge streams particularly generated in pulp and paper mill raj et al 2007 the complex mixtures of dissolved lignins fragments in the residual sludge dom differ from native lignins in functional groups chemical composition molecular weight and physicochemical characteristics due to prior different treatments processes applied in commercial pulping operations sierra alvarez and lettinga 1991 due to their high molecular weights chemical heterogeneities and absence of hydrolysable inter monomeric linkages the presence of lignins in sludge dom is a major source of organic matter resistant to biological treatments the aerobic degradation of lignins becomes possible only limited to fungi like the white rot fungi in highly aerobic environments sierra alvarez and lettinga 1991 in sharp contrast high molecular weight lignins 1000 da are not mono anaerobically degradable and cause severe inhibition on methane yield while only monomers and oligomers of lignins 600 da can be mineralized kirk and farrell 1987 chen et al 2019a evaluated the degradability of sludge with different lignocellulosic components and also found that lignins in sludge showed invisible degradability pretreatments like acid alkali thermal and ultrasonic methods were therefore applied to destroy the lignins prior to exposing to anaerobic digestion as noted by a degradation efficiency of 15 4 33 7 for lignins during anaerobic digestion of excess sludge containing lignins hu et al 2016 3 1 6 organic acids different from the foregoing high molecular weight fractions of humic acids and fulvic acids low molecular weight organic acids molecular weight less than 350 da based on the total mass balance of doc herein particularly have been identified as important fractions of dom brinkmann et al 2003 the amount of low molecular weight organic acids accounts for about 2 5 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc xiao et al 2016a xiao et al 2017b especially the following acids have been identified formic acetic pyruvic oxalic malonic citric lactic malonic oxalic and succinic acids dinsdale et al 2000 they are weak acids and do not dissociate completely in water and their acidities are associated with their carboxyl groups of cooh chung et al 2009 they are high soluble in sludge and can be the degradation products of various large molecular weight substances which are subject to biological and chemical treatments for example these low molecular weight organic acids are key intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles they are also active intermediates for the conversion of large molecular biopolymers into methane and carbon dioxide during anaerobic digestion tran et al 2015 the low molecular weight organic acids account for about 2 10 of the carbon in organic forest floor layer leachates kaiser et al 2001 soil herbert and bertsch 1995 aquatic systems aiken et al 1992 and rhizosphere pires et al 2007 as to the presence of low molecular weight organic acids in sludge dom zhao et al 2018a adapted the methods of nakasaki et al 2013 which was originally used for the identification in the yeast strain pichia kudriavzevii rb1 to investigate the presence of low molecular weight organic acids during sludge composting their results indicated that the concentrations of acetic acid and tartaric acid affected the shift of the bacteria community as well as the maturity during sludge composting the low molecular weight organic acids may suffer from various fates like sorption metal complexation and degradation during composting zhao et al 2018a moreover a relatively high concentration of organic acids may inhibit the microbial activities cheung et al 2010 xiao et al 2016a used the liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond technique to follow the fraction of the low molecular weight organic acids during sludge dewatering their studies showed that higher concentrations of mono protic organic acids increased the zeta potential values of the sludge flocs and facilitated sludge re coagulation as the acids can donate protons while they are dissociated 3 1 7 organic micropollutants the amount of organic micropollutants accounts for about 1 2 of the total sludge dom based on the mass balance of doc díaz et al 2020 the organic micropollutants in sludge can be categorized into different types like persistent organic pollutants pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disrupting compounds perfluorinated compounds brominated flame retardants organotin derivates benzotriazoles phthalate acid esters and surfactants based on their physicochemical properties of lipophilicity solubility and vapour pressure rivas et al 2015 more than 700 different organic compounds have been reported in sludge dom michael kordatou et al 2015 these organic micropollutants have been detected in sludge dom at the ng l to the mg l level díaz et al 2020 and most of organic micropollutants in sludge dom are hydrophobic present inside or on surface of sludge microorganisms compounds like sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate nonylphenol dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride triclosan galaxolide diclofenac carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole estrone bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate perfluorooctanoic acid bis tributyltin oxide tetrabromobisphenol a and benzotriazole are typical representatives threshold numbers are specified for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nonyl phenols when spreading the sludge in agricultural application liu et al 2018 mailler et al 2017 investigated 71 organic micropollutants in different sludge samples raw sludge digested sludge thermally pretreated sludge and dewatered sludge cake and the data showed same concentrations in similar types of sludge from different wastewater treatment plants wwtps díaz et al 2020 reported that organic micropollutants in dom only accounted for 10 compared to the total amount in the sludge sample as most of the compounds were adsorbed into the solid fraction of sludge rivas et al 2015 anaerobic digestion can remove 50 of organic micropollutants by degradation while 48 of them end up into the biosolids by adsorption and the remaining 2 are returned in the liquors from thickening and dewatering processes harb et al 2019 biotransformation through methanogenesis can degrade organic micropollutants to phenolic and aminated aromatic compounds harb et al 2019 improving physical retention mechanisms during anaerobic treatment like addition of sorption enhancing materials can be applied to enhance the removal efficiencies of organic micropollutants in sludge dom 3 2 dom characterization sludge samples show semi solid properties hence a specific pretreatment of sludge samples by centrifugation for solid liquid separation is normally needed the liquid phase is further treated by different isolation and or extraction methods in order to obtain dom fractions for specific analysis techniques like membrane filtration sorption and desorption on nonionic macro porous resins ion exchange resins freeze drying sorbent extraction activated alumina activated carbon and co precipitation were usually used to isolate dom from the sludge supernatant a more detailed summary including working mechanisms advantages and disadvantages of each method and selected references is listed in table s1 supporting information well established sum parameters are used to quantify dom for describing dom concentration in sludge parameters used in drinking water and wastewater analysis like doc cod permanganate index pmc bod and uv absorbance uva are often used a brief summary of sum and common surrogate parameters including definition and limitations and selected references is given in table s2 supporting information the number of publications showing methods for characterization of dom is huge but limited for dom in sludge samples abbt braun et al 2004 frimmel and abbt braun 2010 although reporting specific methods used for aqueous samples form terrestrial and aqueous environment will not be the intention of this review many different physical chemical and spectroscopic methods as well as fractionation by chromatography and specific degradation treatments have been used to characterize dom in sludge samples uv and visible spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy ir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts raman spectroscopy ft icr ms and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy capillary electrophoresis ce gel permeation or size exclusion chromatography reverse phase c18 chromatography field flow fractionation fff tangential flow filtration tff oxidative reductive and thermal degradation chemical and or enzymatic hydrolysis these methods can be used to characterize the optical sensitivity the molecular weight and size the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties the molecular formula based on mass to charge values from ms the biodegradability and the volatile and non volatile compounds of dom a more detailed overview is presented in table 1 physical and chemical analysis like elemental analysis amir et al 2004 and acid base titration d abzac et al 2010 plaza et al 2006 reveal the elemental composition and the proton capacity the absorption in the uv and visible range can be used to get information about specific functional groups for example the amount of carboxylic and phenolic like groups in dom can be estimated by calculating the differential slope of the log transformed dom absorbance in the wavelength region of 350 400 nm liu et al 2018 the fluorescence spectroscopy is based on the different fluorophoric groups present in dom the excitation emission matrix eem has become a popular tool for tracking the fate of dom in sludge samples guo et al 2014 yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 through assigning eem spectra by comparing with the fluorescence of defined molecules several different groups of dom compounds can be assigned in sludge samples 1 tyrosine like proteins 2 tryptophan like proteins 3 fulvic acid like compounds 4 microbial by product like matter and 5 humic acid like organic compounds xiao et al 2016a many different methods like fluorescence index parallel factor analysis parafac with a toolbox from matlab software yu et al 2019 fluorescence regional integration li et al 2016 peak position zhu et al 2012 and ratios of peak intensities chen et al 2016 have been used for the data interpretation however often an inconsistency among different data interpretation methods occurs and may result in incompatible results moreover the presence of fluorescence quenchers like heavy metals high temperature and micropollutants e g dicamba and phenanthrene in dom of sludge may quench fluorescence intensities and affect the final results pan et al 2010a pan et al 2010b ruan et al 2013 theoretically an eem can be decomposed with its components by a linear regression when there are no interferences from the foregoing factors qian et al 2019 based on this theory qian et al 2019 tried to diagnose the unexpected fluorescence of contaminants e g 1 2 naphthoquinone 4 sulfonic acid sodium salt using a prior linear decomposition pld method as trained and tested by a back propagation network their results indicated that the pld method offered a more accurate result than that of parafac for aquatic samples however its feasibility in identifying fluorescence intensity for dom in sludge is unknown the ir ftir and drifts techniques can characterize part of the dom structure by identifying functional groups mao et al 2003 wang et al 2016b xu et al 2018b but they fail in quantifying and need additional sample preparation there are many overlapping absorption bands with inorganic compounds and for the data interpretation many often data from other techniques are associated e g proton capacity by acid base titration abbt braun et al 2004 the raman spectroscopy can qualitatively determine functional groups of dom in sludge with rapid data generation in situ analysis and rich data profiles due to numerous spectra collected from a single map wang et al 2016b it allows only the measurement of small sample volumes due to the laser spot size during the last ten years ft icr ms has been used as a powerful and advanced technique to characterize dom in sludge yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 the ft icr ms technique can provide information for the mass to charge ratio of ions and then molecular formulas can be calculated by using specific software the generated molecular formula were then validated by setting reasonable signal to noise ratio atomic o c h c and n c ratios and element counts via van krevelen diagrams xu et al 2018a yuan et al 2019 based on the circular movement of charged particles in a strong magnetic field cyclotron movement and with the aid of ft icr ms dom in sludge can be categorized 1 lipids h c 1 5 2 0 o c 0 0 3 2 proteins h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 3 0 7 3 lignins or carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules like structures h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 7 4 carbohydrates h c 1 5 2 4 o c 0

complete comprehension or interpretation of the structural assignments along with uncertainty intervals of the analysis results prior sample acidification is needed and only salt free samples can be measured moreover the acquisition and maintenance of the ft icr ms technique are expensive compared to other techniques yuan et al 2019 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy can quantitatively determine functional groups of dom maqbool et al 2020 paneque et al 2017 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019a however when broad and overlapping peaks occur the nmr technique is limited in obtaining high resolution data and thus failing to quantify dom molecular moieties this technique also requires freeze dried dom samples which are free of inorganic impurities capillary electrophoresis can be used to analyze inorganic anions organic acids amino acids nucleotides carbohydrates and other anionic compounds in dom ishii and takii 2003 reverse phase c18 chromatography separates dom according to hydrophobic interactions with the column material ling et al 2005 whereas gel permeation chromatography gpc or size exclusion chromatography sec can measure both molecular weight and size of dom in sludge wang et al 2017 in general the elution volumes or the retention time of the compounds separated are reversely correlated with the molecular size and by this in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted dom substances ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 although interactions of dom such as adsorption on the column resin as well as electrostatic and hydrophobic effects with the resin material also may lead to an advanced or delayed retention behavior in addition the lack of authentic standards representing the compounds of sludge related dom compounds for molecular weight and size calibration are restricting the validity a detailed description of the analytical protocol for the set up calibration method and calibration standards used is a prerequisite to be able to compare elution volumes and nominal molecular weights from different studies size exclusion chromatography coupled with online detection of organic carbon specific wavelengths e g 254 nm and nitrogen in general named as lc ocd ond is often used to characterize dom in sludge xiao et al 2017b zhu et al 2020 the method is assigning the chromatographical fractions with increasing retention time as follows 1 biopolymers 20 kda 2 doc hydrophobic and hydrophilic 3 protein like substances 4 humic substances 5 building blocks 6 low molecular weight neutrals 350 da and 7 low molecular weight acids 350 da xiao et al 2017b here the calibration for molecular weights is based on standards isolated from the international humic substance society suwannee river standard ii humic acid and fulvic acid and the exclusion and permeations volume of the sec column huber et al 2011 sec can also be used in the high performance liquid chromatography hplc scale as high pressure psize exclusion chromatography hpsec to characterize dom in sludge with refractive index detector and uv254 detector tian et al 2015 for a detailed interpretation of chemical compounds in the different fractions a combination of sec with mass spectrometry such as ft icr ms should be performed yuan et al 2019 the fff technique can fractionate dom in sludge and then the fractograms can be integrated over smaller size ranges such as the 0 5 4 nm 4 20 nm and 20 nm exner et al 2000 this method is particularly useful for resolving molecules of different sizes e g monomer dimer etc and it is a rather gentle separation with a minimum of interference as no shear forces or interactions with a stationary phase are involved however it only shows information of relative size distribution which cannot be easily converted to an absolute size the tff technique is separating dom into four size fractions 1 less than 1 kda 2 1 5 kda 3 5 30 kda and 4 30 kda 0 45 µm adjalle et al 2009 this method is faster and more efficient than fff separation but it fails to identify polymers with overlapping size ranges exner et al 2000 the advantages of using chromatographic methods are a relatively high sample throughput with a high degree of automation and only small sample volumes pretreatments of the sludge samples like oxidative reductive and thermal degradation methods and a subsequent gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis can provide important compositional and structural information of dom lu et al 2020 the following non polar and relatively volatile compounds after dom degradation can be identified by gc ms phenols amino acids alcohols esters glycoproteins fatty acids alkenes ceramides steroids and their derivatives flavonoids sphingolipids diglycerides quinones hydroquinones and glycerophospholipids lu et al 2018b the non volatile and thermo stable components of dom are mainly attributed to hexoses benzenoid acids medium chain fatty acids fatty acyls and dipeptides as identified by the ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms lu et al 2018b other degradation methods like chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis in association with ion exchange separation gc ce nmr or hplc can be used to determine amino acids short chain acids lignin like substances and monosaccharides in dom of sludge samples zhao et al 2018b zhu et al 2020 some compounds can be used to get information on the source and genesis of dom amino acids or monosaccharides may be used as the biomarkers however denaturation of the dom structure due to the pretreatment reactions limits the application of the degradation methods multiple complementary techniques benefit to get a broader information of dom information in sludge ma et al 2019b used a combination of three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem ftir and ft icr ms to characterize dom in terms of compounds showing fluorophoric groups functional groups and moieties in sludge alkaline fermentation additional information can be acquired that protein like substances with molecular weight less than 1 kda of dom can be observed in sludge alkaline fermentation xiao et al 2016a applied 3d eem and lc ocd ond to investigate the types and molecular weights of dom in sludge samples during dewatering and the results were consistent in terms of the key hydrophilic dom in addition extra information can be obtained from sec that proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weights of 103 5 104 kda were the key organic compounds deteriorating sludge dewaterability yuan et al 2019 linked ft icr ms and 3d eem to determine the elemental and molecular compositions of dom to provide advanced molecular insights into the role of dom during different pretreatments of sludge it was obvious that proteins and compounds showing lignins and carboxylic rich alicyclic units were the predominant dom fractions released by the thermal alkaline pretreatment lu et al 2018a used the results from lc ocd ond and pyrolysis gc ms py gc ms to investigate the transformation of dom during anaerobic sludge digestion and to identify the anaerobic digestion refractory compounds they could show that the hydrophobic part of dom characterized by lc ocd ond particularly higher molecular weight residual compounds e g polar metabolites and non polar lipids identified by py gc ms were the dominant anaerobic digestion refractory components the multi method approaches finally raise an ultimate question how can we achieve a full understanding of the dynamics of dom in sludge samples from the diversified and various collected data moreover the inconsistency between different characterization methods may result in incompatible interpretations of the data which may be related to non comparable sample treatment before analysis and or sensitivity of the analytical tools for individual chemical compounds 4 dom changes during different sludge treatment processes 4 1 dom changes during anaerobic digestion dom is crucial for anaerobic digestion due to its role as direct carbon and energy source for microorganisms typically organic compounds from the cell lysis and solubilization of particulate parts of sludge will be released into the liquid phase as dom lin et al 2019 the metabolic pathway of dom is largely dependent on the inherent characteristics and changes of dom it can be assumed that the concentration type and quality of dom can be used as key parameters for evaluating and optimizing the operation performance of anaerobic digestion for anaerobic digestion hydrolysis of the waste activated sludge flocs is the limiting step due to the low accessibility of the sludge matrix to microbes benneouala et al 2017 therefore promoting solubilization and liquefaction of macromolecular organic compounds by different pretreatments is often necessary prior to anaerobic digestion based on the definition of dom in section 2 dom in sludge was mainly related to soluble organic or readily soluble organic compounds rather than the particulate parts during sludge pretreatments the transformation of dom mainly includes the solubilization of organic compounds from sludge however there are also transformations triggered by chemical reactions during chemical pretreatment thermal degradation during thermal hydrolysis and biochemical enzymatic reactions while during anaerobic digestion of sludge the transformation of dom mainly means the changes of inherent dom of sludge and or those solubilized from sludge after pretreatments during hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes of anaerobic digestion during anaerobic digestion the summaric quantification of proteins and humic acids the term humic substances is more suitable herein rather than humic acids based on forgoing definition is often measured by the modified lowry s method frølund et al 1995 and the quantification of carbohydrates is measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 gonzalez et al 2018 summarized the effects of different pretreatments on the release of dom from sludge samples including physical chemical and biological methods for the physical methods such as ultrasonic ball mining and homogenization pretreatments an effective solubilization of the organic matter in sludge can be achieved when dom shows high concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates the concentration of proteins solubilized from sludge flocs has been consistently reported to be higher than those of carbohydrates elalami et al 2019 with a homogenization pretreatment at 0 52 mpa the concentrations of proteins increased by 72 dhar et al 2012 yan et al 2010 reported that the ultrasonic pretreatment with a specific energy input at 26 000 kj kg dry solids can promote sludge solubilization while the protein concentration was increased by 462 mg l however a maximum value is reached when the energy input is increased continuously as the maximum solubilization extent of proteins and carbohydrates was limited to about 17 of their total fractions at a pressure of 80 mpa and a specific energy input of 53 510 kj kg dry solids zhang et al 2012 chemical pretreatments like thermal acid or alkaline and advanced oxidation processes were often used the thermal pretreatment can be divided into low temperature 150 c and high temperature 150 c processes as the temperature increased from 50 to 160 c proportional increases of soluble carbohydrates proteins and humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead were observed with a relatively higher solubilization of proteins compared to humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead and carbohydrates eskicioglu et al 2006 particularly proteins can be denatured at a medium water content of 5 and at temperatures of about 75 c under these conditions proteins are more accessible to biodegradation and at temperatures more than 100 c they become more soluble de graaf 2000 for example a high concentration of soluble protein of about 30 g l was observed while pretreating sludge total solids of 16 7 with a high temperature thermal hydrolysis at 180 c for 180 min xue et al 2015 most carbohydrates become soluble at temperature as high as 130 c liu et al 2012 however caramelization of the carbohydrates may occur when temperature is higher than 170 c buera et al 1987 moreover the reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars namely maillard reaction is inclined to take place at temperatures from 140 to 165 c rather than at lower temperatures of less than 100 c dwyer et al 2008 the structural changes of humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead were indiscernible as temperature in range of 25 80 c zhen et al 2012 however the decomposition and dissociation of humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead would occur at temperature 110 c and at 150 to 180 c respectively kolokassidou et al 2007 for chemical pretreatment alkaline pretreatment has been consistently reported to be more effective for solubilizing particulate flocs into proteins carbohydrates and humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead than acid pretreatment chen et al 2007 alkaline solutions can damage microbial cells solubilize membrane proteins and saponify membrane lipids mehdizadeh et al 2013 xiao et al 2017b reported that alkaline pretreatment at ph 12 increased the soluble protein concentration 23 times compared to that without pretreatment this was much higher than those with ultrasonic pretreatment at 1 w ml 11 times and thermal pretreatment at 80 c 12 times naoh was more effective than calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 due to its less binding and connection with eps hence more dom remained in the liquid phase rather than to be re coagulated li et al 2008 sludge pretreatment with acids such as hydrochloric acid hcl sulphuric acid h2so4 and phosphoric acid h3po4 is also effective in solubilizing proteins and carbohydrates from sludge flocs the optimum solubilization can be achieved at ph of 1 to 2 devlin et al 2011 in recent years the efficiency of free nitrous acid fna in accelerating the disruption of sludge flocs has been reported at fna concentration of 1 38 mg l the solubilization degree can be 12 5 after an incubation period of 72 h wang et al 2018 a ph adjustment can be also used to mediate the solubility of organic matter as already mentioned above humic acids are inclined to precipitate at ph less than 2 however proteins remain soluble in the solution through adjusting ph to less than 2 the previous non biodegradable complex of protein humic acid can become more accessible to microbes by releasing proteins at low ph values zahmatkesh et al 2016 similar to the acid and alkaline pretreatments advanced oxidation processes aop e g fenton fe ii ion activated sulfate oxone oxidation can increase the solubilization of proteins carbohydrates and humic substances from the sludge matrix however compared with other treatment processes organic compounds can be easily converted into carbon dioxide if the oxidation agent is over dosed which may result in less accessible substrates to methanogens for the biogas production déléris et al 2000 braguglia et al 2012 also found that an oxidant dose of less than 70 mg ozone g total solids showed invisible mineralization but an oxidant dose of more than 200 mg ozone g dry solids can cause significant mineralization mineralization was more discernible when oxidizing pretreated sludge than raw waste activated sludge xiao et al 2017b for the biological pretreatment enzymes and microbes were often used yu et al 2013 found that sludge solubilization increased by 78 2 after an incubation with endogenous amylase for 7 h liu et al 2019b found that proteins of 792 5 mg l and carbohydrates of 133 5 mg l in sludge flocs were released after pretreatment with lysozyme yi et al 2014 also noted that the concentration of humic acids increased from 361 to 1108 mg l after destructing the proteins humic acids complex by addition of protease kavitha et al 2013 improved the soluble protein concentration by 150 mg l through adding strains like bacillus jerish as already noted the changes of dom are particularly dependent on the types of enzymes or microbes used for the biological pretreatment by comparing physical chemical and biological pretreatment techniques the efficiency of sludge solubilization by the physical and biological pretreatment was often lower than that of the chemical method if equivalent energy inputs were used braguglia et al 2012 most of the literature focused on investigating the changes in dom concentration e g by analyzing the concentrations of proteins carbohydrates and humic substances using the photometric methods during different pretreatments with relatively less information about the molecular characteristics of dom recently some researchers have started to investigate the changes of the structural composition in dom wu et al 2017b found that uv activated calcium peroxide oxidation can destruct the secondary structure of proteins particularly the α helix wang et al 2016b reported that a combined thermal pretreatment at 120 c for 30 min and alkaline pretreatment at ph 12 for 24 h can also decrease the content of α helix of protein secondary structure by 34 8 however it would increase the unordered shape by 18 along with the cleavage of disulphate bonds and change of s s stretching pattern chen et al 2017 found that a step wise alkaline pretreatment at ph 9 can particularly release proteins with molecular weight less than 20 kda similarly lu et al 2018b also noticed that a high temperature pretreatment at 172 c can particularly release proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weight less than 20 kda during anaerobic digestion the released dom can be later fermented to vfas fig 4 reports about the changes of vfas and biogas and the correlation with the variations of dom characteristics are increasing bozkurt and apul 2020 zhang et al 2017 during the production of methane the degradation sequence of dom was protein like compounds were degraded firstly followed by carboxylic acids and aromatic structures as indicated by the technique of ft icr ms li et al 2014 moreover data from eem fluorescence spectra showed that protein like compounds particularly tyrosine like and tryptophan like compounds are the major substrates for acidogenesis li et al 2014 the amounts of tryptophan like compounds have been found to be linearly correlated with the degradation rate of readily biodegradable substances wu et al 2006 in contrast lignin like substances and lipid like dom cannot be degraded as easily as protein like compounds during anaerobic digestion usman khan and kiaer ahring 2020 and this hard biodegradability was correlated with their molecular characteristics as lignin like substances are consisting of polyphenolic oligomers while lipid like dom type often includes aliphatic hydrocarbons esters and sterols lutze and engelhart 2020 accumulation of long chain fatty acids has been deemed as the biggest obstacle for anaerobic lipid degradation as it may inhibit methanogenic activities and cause sludge foaming by this the degradability of dom can be used to evaluate sludge degradability xiao et al 2016c in recent years some researchers further analyzed the residual dom present in anaerobic digestate for example lu et al 2018a determined low molecular weight compounds like steroid like and aromatic compounds and higher molecular weight compounds like benzenoids and their derivatives as the residual compounds after anaerobic digestion of thermal pretreated sludge while biochemical and chemical refractory humic substances and hydrophobic dissolved organic compounds particularly polycyclic steroid like compounds were the main components of the residual dom after anaerobic digestion of alkaline ultrasonic pretreated sludge fig 4 lu et al 2018b higher molecular weight residual compounds like polar metabolites dipeptides and substituted derivatives and non polar lipids contributed to the residual compounds lu et al 2018b these residual dom compounds may pose difficulties for the post treatment of anaerobic digestate considering their insusceptibility of part of the dom to biological degradation future work can be beneficial to reuse or recycle these non biodegradable substances like humic substances proteins polysaccharides and lipids in residual dom a possible application of residual dom has been investigated by scaglia et al 2017 they reported that dom in anaerobic digestate particularly hydrophobic dom fractions showed significant auxin like activity as bio stimulants to improve plant health the interplay among microbial community changes in the dom characteristics and operational process variables have been investigated during anaerobic digestion of sludge by many researchers dom properties are known to affect the biological utilization of sludge and mediate the microbial community and vice versa laera et al 2019 the microbial diversity network and functional analysis of the microorganisms may explain the impact on dom composition ma et al 2019a showed that the predominance of firmicutes and actinobacteria was beneficial for the degradation of proteins lipids and polysaccharides chen et al 2017 found that more low molecular weight dom 20 kda rather than high molecular weight dom 20 kda was produced when increasing ph values from 7 to 10 actinobacteria and proteobacteria were responsible for the increased hydrolysis degree he et al 2019 investigated the addition of benzalkonium chlorides on anaerobic digestion of sludge this addition increased the release of soluble polysaccharides 42 6 to 55 7 and soluble proteins 11 5 to 19 4 moreover the predominance of firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and actinobacteria decreased yu et al 2015 found that the addition of ferric chloride contributed to the anaerobic sludge digestion process by enriching coprothermobacter for proteins fermentation and methanosarcina for methanogenesis chen et al 2018 found that the optimum solid retention time was 6 days for a thermophilic 65 c single stage waste activated sludge digester and the long solid retention time conditions of 7 5 days and 10 days promoted the release of recalcitrant compounds building blocks according to sec characterization and impaired acidification moreover under these long solid retention time conditions the predominant pathway for methane production was shifted from acetoclastic methanogens to the syntrophic activities of acetate oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens pang et al 2020 found that the enrichment of hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria like succinispira ruminococcaceae ucg 009 ruminococcaceae ucg 002 escherichia shigella were responsible for the biodegradation of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins and other organic compounds like amino acids aliphatic and metabolic intermediates during cation exchange resin induced hydrolysis of waste activated sludge ruan et al 2019 also found that the enrichment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria like alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were responsible for the release of dom like proteins and polysaccharides during micro aeration enhanced methane production of anaerobic sludge digestion 4 2 dom changes during different sludge dewatering processes an optimum sludge handling process includes three tenets 1 high dewatering rate 2 low conditioner dose and 3 a low sludge mass for disposal mikkelsen and keiding 2002 to achieve this aim the removal of water in sludge is a key issue water in sludge can be classified into free water 70 of total mass fraction and bound water 30 of total mass fraction yuan et al 2017 free water includes bulk water and interstitial water while bound water refers to water which cannot be mechanically removed including surface water osmotic water and intracellular water yuan et al 2017 it has been widely accepted that dom showed strong affinities towards water and that chemical composition of dom can significantly affect sludge dewaterability jørgensen et al 2017 niu et al 2013 numerous statistical methods such as pearson s correlation principal component analysis and multilinear regression methods have been applied for the data gained from sophisticated dom analysis to identify the key compounds in dom related with the deteriorated sludge dewaterability generally proteins polysaccharides humic substances and amino acids can deteriorate sludge dewaterability while mono protic organic acids can improve sludge dewaterability by neutralizing negative charges of sludge surface and causing aggregation of sludge flocs through reducing the repulsive forces xiao et al 2017c to be exemplified the molecular structure and spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups like carbonyl and amino groups in proteins can bind hydration water via hydrogen bonds wu et al 2017b the hydration water can form a two dimensional hydrogen bond network around proteins khoshtariya et al 2003 damaging the hydration shell surrounding the protein surface is a prerequisite for enhancing sludge dewaterability xu et al 2018b a significant concentration of polysaccharides can also make sludge dewaterability worse neyens et al 2004 polysaccharides are consisting of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonded sugar chains shao et al 2009a the carboxyl groups in polysaccharides like pectin could form gel like substances via ionic linkages and thus hindering water removal from sludge chen et al 2020 humic substances containing aromatic structures and carboxylic groups are sticky biopolymers and can cause difficulties in the separation of water and solids xiao et al 2017d however so far no detailed kinetic studies have been conducted to corroborate the results summarized above shao et al 2009 it seems that dom conformation especially the conformation of proteins can also affect the sludge dewaterability according to the findings of you et al 2017 the secondary structures of proteins can determine sludge hydrophobicity and a low content of α helix and high contents of β sheet and random coil are indicators of sludge loose structure and can cause poor sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b fractionized dom from a sludge filtration process using size exclusion chromatography lc ocd ond and sec hplc to understand the impacts of different sizes and weight fractions of dom on the dewatering process proteins and polysaccharides with molecular weights in range of nominal weights of 106 5 107 da in lb eps were identified as the key factors worsening sludge dewaterability in their studies calibration of sec was done using polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide standards with molecular weights of 500 kda 70 kda 4 kda 600 da and 106 da tian et al 2015 through devastating or removing the polymers in lb eps hydrogen bonds between hydrophilic compounds and the sludge matrix can be damaged and bound water can be released into free water thus ameliorating sludge filterability xiao et al 2017d zhu et al 2020 systematically investigated the profiles of amino acids and their relationships with proteinaceous compounds during fenton treatment for enhanced sludge dewaterability their results showed that hydroxyl radicals can damage the membrane and ribosomal proteins a higher release of tryptophane was beneficial for enhanced sludge dewaterability by resulting in more hydrophobic interactions otherwise a higher amount of lysine deteriorated sludge dewaterability by causing more necessary energy barriers for aggregation of sludge particles the water content of the dewatered sludge cake the vacuum filtered sludge cake after filtration bound water content srf and cst are often used to evaluate sludge dewaterability to enhance sludge dewaterability different methods have been conducted as listed in details in table 2 the methods were effective in removing certain types of hydrophilic compounds the combined ultrasonic and acid treatment can damage proteins and polysaccharides more effectively than any individual treatment of acid or ultrasonication xiao et al 2016a the removal of hydrophilic substances for enhancing sludge dewaterability has also been reported when using the following techniques enzymatic treatment chen et al 2015 calcium peroxide pre oxidation and chemical re flocculation chen et al 2016 aluminum salt coagulation cao et al 2016 peracetic acid pre oxidation and chemical re flocculation zhang et al 2016 and addition of oxalic acid chen et al 2020 combined lysozyme and cationic polyacrylamide lin et al 2019 modified phosphogypsum dai et al 2018 and polyaluminium chloride yang et al 2019 table 2 acid pretreatment can improve sludge dewaterability by ionizing the carboxyl groups in sludge through donating hydrogen ions to form more mono protic organic acids zhang et al 2019 as a consequence the zeta potential becomes less negative and causes aggregation of sludge flocs by reducing the repulsive forces the alkaline treatment can solubilize more peptide chains of proteins and glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides particularly those with low molecular weights from sludge flocs than thermal and ultrasonic treatments with the similar energy inputs ruiz hernando et al 2015 these features make alkaline pretreatment appealing as a prior treatment in sludge dewatering through being combined with the subsequent anaerobic digestion for more degradation of these hydrophilic compounds shao et al 2012 the aop methods have received attentions recently due to their excellent effects in enhancing sludge dewaterability aop methods used are fenton process fe ii ion activated oxone hydrogen peroxide or sulfate xiao et al 2017b thermal activated oxone hydrogen peroxide or sulfate chen et al 2016 xiao et al 2017d and fe 0 or fe ii ions activated ozone treatment zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 the dewatering mechanism in the aop process typically includes two steps at first parts of the organic compounds are oxidized and degraded and the bound water is released into the free water phase summarized in fig 4 typically hydroxyl or sulfate radicals are generated during the oxidation step the reactivity of these radicals is dependent on the molecular properties of the oxidized compounds radicals are prone to react with aromatic and unsaturated compounds than with saturated compounds and organic acids are generated by hydrogen elimination as indicated by the higher reaction rates haag and yao 1992 extracellular polymers are susceptible to oxidative reductive depolymerization which results in cleavage of linkages in polymeric backbones neyens et al 2004 in the second step re coagulation step the generated and or extra added fe iii or al iii ions agglomerate smaller particles to larger aggregates which result in a partial dom removal xiao et al 2017b moreover the fe iii and or al iii ions can also act as flocculants or coagulants to bind with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in exopolymers steiner et al 1976 moreover proteins show a higher tendency to bind with heavy metals than humic substances and polysaccharides zhang et al 2016 an appropriate oxidation degree is needed for enhancing sludge dewaterability insufficient oxidation cannot effectively destroy the hydrophilic dom along with converting bound water to free water on the other hand excessive oxidation can release too much hydrophilic dom which is causing difficulties in removing these compounds by the subsequent re coagulation lv et al 2019 moreover the strong oxidation effect may pierce into the microorganism cell walls and damage microbial cells accompanied with releasing indigenous compounds present in the intracellular parts within the microbial cells xiao et al 2017b besides the foregoing methods sludge bio drying is also an efficient method for water removal by means of heat generated from the aerobic degradation of organic compounds the working principles of sludge bio drying are similar to aerobic composting but the aim is focused on water removal zhang et al 2015 other novel methods towards removing dom to enhance sludge dewaterability have been proposed recently among others xu et al 2018b used the polar hydrophilic reagent methanol to denature proteins and disrupt the hydration shell of proteins thus causing protein aggregation and improving sludge dewaterability methanol treatment decreased the water content of the sludge cake by 80 compared to those conditioned with traditional conditioners of poly aluminum chloride or ferric chloride chen et al 2019b developed a method to enhance sludge dewaterability by dissolving hydrophilic organic compounds with liquified dimethyl ether chen et al 2020 used oxalic acid to enhance sludge dewaterability by chelating with calcium ions present in pectin gels thus destroying the gel structure of monosaccharides 4 3 dom transformation during aerobic treatment of sludge the characteristics and transformation of dom can deliver useful information for evaluating the final humification degree of sludge yu et al 2019 for example abbt braun et al 2001 found that even when the concentration of doc followed a similar pattern during the thermophilic stage of composting the chemical composition of dom still kept on changing during the maturation phase the analysis of dom during composting of sludge is conducted by extracting the aqueous compounds from the compost huang et al 2010 the stability and maturity of final compost are always important parameters to evaluate the operation of composting wei et al 2020 different methods have been introduced for the evaluation of these two parameters they can be classified into four groups 1 empirical judgement like temperature color odor and texture are giving a general idea of the decomposition stage reached tambone et al 2010 but are giving little knowledge on the degree of maturity 2 physicochemical analysis of principal components and the derived ratios c n or nh4 no3 microbial respiration and enzyme activities in the solid compost tang et al 2019 3 analyzing dom of the aqueous compounds extracted from the solid compost by colorimetric and spectroscopic methods uv ftir and nmr fischer et al 2018 4 germination index test kebibeche et al 2019 in many studies the correlation between dom properties in the aqueous phase extracted from the compost and the humification index are used to indicate the maturity and the stability degrees of the compost nigussie et al 2017 straathof and comans 2015 zmora nahum et al 2005 during sludge composting proteins celluloses and hemicelluloses were degraded to compounds with less structural complexity like amino acids and monomers and or dimers of carbohydrates amir et al 2010 typically aliphatic substances like hemicelluloses were degraded firstly followed by proteinaceous compounds kulikowska 2016 these substances can be either used as carbon and or nitrogen sources mineralized for the generation of carbon dioxide and ammonia or act as building blocks for the formation of humus wright et al 2008 the polymerization of c o bonds of polysaccharide like structures and carboxylic and or phenolic groups is a main key factor for the formation of humus yu et al 2019 the increase of humic substances and the related species transformation from easily degradable to decomposition resistant can reflect compost maturity zhao et al 2018a the changes of dom during composting of sewage sludge included two phases 1 decomposition of organic compounds and 2 polymerization of organic compounds in phase 1 better easily degradable sources such as glucoses amino acids and organic acids are available and can be directly used as soluble compounds by bacteria zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 the decomposition period of easily biodegradable compounds lasts for 14 to 21 days zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 during this phase organic acids were predominantly generated through the degradation of organic compounds and the metabolism from microorganisms the accumulation of organic acids may cause a decrease in ph and inhibit the microbial activities thus reducing the effectiveness of composts and the quality of final composting products plachá et al 2013 in phase 2 secondary sources such as celluloses hemicelluloses and lipids are hydrolyzed or degraded prior to use finally the humification of organic compounds occurs accompanied with the production of poly condensed and humic like substances zhao et al 2018a this process lasts for 14 days followed by the stabilization of organic compounds and decreased microbial activity zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 due to its relatively high moisture content sludge typically cannot be composted individually the addition of bulking agents can solve this issue through providing structural support by generating interparticle voids to decrease the moisture content permit sufficient gas exchange and to prevent inordinate compaction of substrate zhao et al 2016 moreover bulking agents can change the quality of the composting substrate by altering mechanical structure c n ratio density ph of the leachate solution and finally affect the dom degradation pathway for example ingelmo et al 2012 showed that the addition of wood into sludge can polymerize humic acids or humic substances according to the definition introduced ahead by ligno cellulosic derivates originating from wood degradation thus promoting the formation of humus the functional groups of the dom compounds can also affect the bio accessibility of heavy metals during sludge composting tang et al 2019 found that dom with more amide bonds of proteinaceous compounds can decrease the bio and or phyto accessibility of cr vi while the degradation of aromatic compounds and the increase of carboxyl groups can control the bio accessibility of pb ii studies using 3d eem showed that an increase of tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances and the degradation of humic like substance can decrease the bio accessibility of zn ii as is reported there were significant correlations between bacterial community and diverse subunits of dom zhao et al 2018a and part of the dom compounds were degraded by microorganisms during sludge composting some of dom like phospholipid fatty acid neutral lipid fatty acid and sterol were essential components of all living biomass showing significant structural changes and great biological specificity and they can be used as indicators for the activities of various microorganisms during sludge composting amir et al 2008 hence understanding the mutual effects between dom composition and the microbial metabolic functions is beneficial to control the composting process ueno et al 2001 for example zhu et al 2019 showed that the key microorganisms stabilizing organic compounds during composting were prosthecobacter paenalcaligenes and solibacillus through converting high molecular weight dom 10 kda into lower molecular weight dom 650 da whereas robledo et al 2020 found that pedomicrobium ureibacillus and tepidomicrobium can be indicators for the stabilization of organic compounds during sludge composting in fact the degree of organic matter stability affected the activities of enzymes like alkaline phosphatase dehydrogenase and β glucosidase robledo mahón et al 2018 and the amounts of these enzymes showed correlations with the quantities of actinomycetales and bacillales with actinomycetales on average more predominant at the beginning of sludge composting process and bacillales on average more predominant at the end of sludge composting process robledo mahón et al 2018 moreover actinobacteria and proteobacteria were associated with cellulose degradation during sludge composting liu et al 2020 while thermobifida fusca was associated with lignocellulose degradation during the composting of sludge containing high levels of lipids and fibers nakasaki et al 2009 the ammonium assimilating bacillus improved the decomposition of dom by converting ammonia n to cell protein thus mitigating ammonia emission in sludge composting shou et al 2019 the microbial driven degradation of dom by proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi controlled the phytoavailability of residual heavy metals in municipal sludge compost e g cr and pb tang et al 2019 it is also noted that the dominance of distinct microbial communities was strongly related with substrates operational variables and inocula and it cannot be ignored that monitoring the changes of dom composition and their interrelation with microbial communities and operational variables can better mediate the sludge composting process 4 4 dom changes during sludge landfill treatment although landfill treatment of sludge has been prohibited in many countries due to its negative environmental impacts there are still old landfills in denmark spain france italy the united kingdom de albuquerque et al 2018 and china yang et al 2017 the main aims for sludge landfill treatment are sludge reduction and stabilization and concurrently the need to meet the discharge standards for the residual emissions in a long term run ni et al 2011 during landfill treatment anaerobic digestion of sludge can occur to degrade organic compounds therein wu et al 2019b consequently the composition of dom in sludge samples during landfill treatments is linked to the stabilization of sanitary landfill and the final characteristics of leachate sözen et al 2014 weis et al 1989 noted that the humic like substances extracted from landfill leachate showed higher contents of carbon hydrogen and sulphur than those extracted from soil and bog lake water the increased amount of humic substances in the final refuse of sludge landfill can be a key parameter for the stabilization of sanitary landfill filip and küster 1979 he et al 2006 found that dom in landfill leachate mainly included the higher molecular weight humic acids 10 kda lower molecular weight fulvic acids 50 kda and hydrophilic fractions 4 kda the molecular weights of the different fractions were analyzed using membrane filtration methods the molecular weight cutoffs at 100 50 10 4 and 1 kda were used as standards in their recent findings they investigated the structural features and molecular compositions of dom with a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap lc ms a solid phase extraction was conducted for dom isolation information like h c n c and o c atomic ratios molecular weights and the mass peak intensity weighted average of the double bond equivalents can be obtained van krevelen diagrams were used to identify internal discrepancies between leachate dom and different waste age more than 6 000 ion peaks could be identified with the molecular formula and 57 peaks showed strong correlations with the waste age of leachate qiu et al 2020 one directive imposed by european regulations states that the concentration of dom in the leachate from sludge landfills should be less than 80 mg l doc kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 the use of coagulation sedimentation process is often used to remove dom in landfill leachate he et al 2006 however the results of sözen et al 2014 found that the observed doc levels of most leachate generated failed to meet this requirement moreover higher doc concentration can increase heavy metal migration and mobility due to the complexation reactions especially the capability of humic substances in complexing metals has received numerous attentions during sludge landfill treatment eem in combination with fluorescence quenching has been used to study the interaction between hg ii and dom extracted from landfill leachate he et al 2010 and the complex formation between cu ii pb ii zn ii and humic like and fulvic like components of bulk dom in leachate wu et al 2011 trost and filip 1985 investigated complexation of humic substances with cu ii and fe iii in landfill refuse the complexation between metal ions and dom is shown in fig 4 several studies showed that reducing the content of doc was one of the effective ways to control migration and leaching of metals weis et al 1989 besides metals the interaction of sludge derived organic micropollutants with dom in landfill leachate can also affect the final quality by increasing the mobility of these compounds larsen et al 1992 found that hexachlorobenzene and benzo a pyrene some of the most abundant sludge derived micropollutants worldwide are often determined in landfill leachate numerous reviews have described the distribution and transformation of micropollutants and other dom in aquatic systems sedlak et al 2000 and soil stangroom et al 2000a stangroom et al 2000b in detail less reviews in the field of sludge are published the similarities and dissimilarities of the reaction mechanisms between micropollutants and other dom in sludge and other systems like soil and aquatic systems need to be better clarified in the future work 5 discussion and outlook to date results for dom studies in sludge demonstrated that specific dom fractions can be used as an indicator revealing the efficiencies of different sludge treatment processes cai et al 2016a narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 in anaerobic digestion of sludge anaerobic digestion refractory compounds can be generated after pretreatment particularly high molecular weight compounds like polycyclic steroid like substances alkanes aromatic compounds and lipids lu et al 2018a in sludge dewatering processes low molecular weight proteins 20 kda have been noted to deteriorate sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b concerning sludge composting decomposition and polymerization of organic compounds occur accompanied with dom humification and formation of poly condensed humic substances generally speaking dom is degraded by microorganisms during sludge composting in the following order aliphatic substances proteinaceous compounds carbohydrates zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 during sludge landfill treatment particularly humic substances can affect the mobility of heavy metals in the landfill leachate he et al 2010 currently many sophisticated methods have been used to identify dom in sludge samples however the inconsistency between different methods may result in incompatible interpretations of the data lu et al 2018a ma et al 2019b xiao et al 2016a yuan et al 2019 in future studies validation followed by standardization of analytical methods for dom in sludge samples including sample preparation and fractionation sample analysis and data integration need to be established moreover due to the limitation of current analysis techniques a more detailed view of the molecular basis of the main compound classes such as proteins lipids carbohydrates and humic substances could be reached with an enhanced further development and adaption of techniques available besides their application in aqueous system derrien et al 2017 the use of biomarkers e g lipid biomarkers like n alkanes fatty acids and sterols for analysis followed by numerical modelling e g neural network analysis multilinear regression and principal component analysis should be also applied for a better understanding of the processes related with sludge dom sources the subsequent measurement of dom in sludge should always be coupled with its physical and chemical characteristics type conformation molecular weight and size polarity hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity and electron accepting capacity including origin sampling and pretreatment and concentration however currently most studies focused on the concentrations of dom fractions like proteins carbohydrates and humic substances analyzed either by doc or by using the summaric photometric methods maspolim et al 2015b xiao et al 2016c results from sum or surrogate parameters fail to reflect changes in the chemical composition therefore future studies should combine results from basic sum parameters quantity with additional characteristic dom quality data and sludge treatment efficiencies for biological sludge treatment anaerobic digestion or composting the link between dom microbial communities and performance variables has been investigated in some studies chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 ma et al 2019a although there are many open questions due to large variations in microbial population especially between those which are anaerobic and those which are aerobic and the changes of operational conditions the core microbes responsible for certain types of dom degradation remains still inconsistent and unclear during sludge dewatering the removal of water trapped in hydrophilic dom is the key step niu et al 2013 a more detailed knowledge about the dynamics for the degradation of key hydrophilic dom and the associated water release is needed moreover besides dom it is also noted that floc structure itself is of most importance during sludge water separation processes xiao et al 2017c the presence and or absence of dom on the behavior of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering also need to be investigated in the future work during sludge landfill treatment it remains unclear whether the driving complexing force between the metals and dom in the leachate is exothermic or thermodynamic in future isothermal titration calorimetry could be used to estimate the thermodynamic parameters e g binding capacity binding constant and binding enthalpy for the binding of metal ions onto dom sheng et al 2013 other techniques such as xanes can be used to decipher the local structure of dom metal complex xu et al 2016 as such the driving binding force for the complexation process whether hydrogen bond electrostatic interaction or hydrophobic interaction can be identified finally for a throughout understanding of dom changes during different sludge treatment processes more attention should be paid to identify the correlations between dom properties andsludge treatment performance to be one step further these correlations need to be quantified for the future design of on line sensors to understand dom changes so as to better control and optimize sludge treatments processes by way of learning from the use of real time monitors reflecting dom changes in aqueous samples niu et al 2014 summative analyses should be complemented by identifying the different dom components in associated with engineered parameters for different sludge treatments and more knowledge of dom characteristics and transformation can push forward the development of sludge treatment technology for sludge reduction and stabilization 6 conclusion the characteristics of dom can be used as an indicator revealing the efficiencies of different sludge treatment processes this study has systematically summarized the fate of dom during different sludge treatment processes focusing on the changes of dom subunits the main conclusions of this review paper can be put forward as follows 1 although numerous methods have been used for extraction isolation quantification of dom how to select the proper method to characterize dom remains unclear validation followed by standardization of analytical methods for dom in sludge samples including sample preparation and fractionation sample analysis and data integration need to be established we propose that the differences of dom in sludge compared with other aquatic and soil samples always need to be considered while choosing a proper method for dom characterization in sludge moreover due to the limitation of current analysis techniques a more detailed view of the molecular basis of dom subunits could be reached with an enhanced further development and adaption of techniques available the use of biomarkers for analysis followed by numerical modelling should be applied for a better understanding of the processes related with sludge dom sources 2 dom transformation during different sludge treatment processes was presented in anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion refractory organic matters particularly compounds showing polycyclic steroid like alkane and aromatic structures can be generated after pretreatment during dewatering the dom fraction of low molecular weight proteins 20 000 da is the key parameter deteriorating sludge dewaterability during composting decomposition and polymerization of dom occur followed by the formation of humic substances during landfill treatment the composition of dom particularly humic substances are related with leachate quality 3 in future work for biological sludge treatment like anaerobic digestion or composting more attention should be paid to the core microbes responsible for certain types of dom degradation during sludge dewatering the physiochemical mechanism for the degradation of key hydrophilic dom and the associated water holding capacity of dom need to be investigated and more attention should be paid to the presence and or absence of dom on the behavior of sludge flocs during sludge dewatering during sludge landfill treatment it remains unclear whether the driving complexing force between the metals and dom in the leachate is exothermic or thermodynamic 4 for a throughout understanding of dom changes during different sludge treatment processes more attention should be paid to identify the correlations between dom properties and sludge treatment performance on line monitors to understand dom changes so as to better control and optimize sludge treatments processes can be developed the different dom components in associated with engineered parameters for different sludge treatments can be identified by summative analyses

17472,wastewater and waste management sectors alone account for 18 of the anthropogenic methane ch4 emissions this study presents a critical overview of methanotrophs methane oxidizing microorganisms for valorizing typically discarded ch4 from environmental engineering applications focusing on wastewater treatment plants methanotrophs can convert ch4 into valuable bioproducts including chemicals biodiesel dc electricity polymers and s layers all under ambient conditions as discarded ch4 and its oxidation products can also be used as a carbon source in nitrification and annamox processes here we discuss modes of ch4 assimilation by methanotrophs in both natural and engineered systems we also highlight the technical challenges and technological breakthroughs needed to enable targeted ch4 oxidation in wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemistry environmental engineering methane wastewater landfills shale gas 1 introduction methane ch4 a key component of natural gas can be used for generating heat and power however the the undesirable emissions of ch4 into atmosphere resulted in a 34 fold increase in global warming over 100 years epa 2010 agriculture energy wastewater and solid waste sectors account for 60 of the global anthropogenic ch4 emissions 359 tg ch4 per year saunois et al 2020 nearly 9 of these emissions

effluent liu et al 2014 eventually being released into the atmosphere anaerobic digestor ad thickener buffering tank sludge dewatering combined heat and power plant and flare unit yoshida et al 2014 of a wwtp contribute to ch4 emissions the biogas emissions from the ad units account for 26 of a wwtp s carbon c footprint 36 kg co2e pe a parravicini et al 2016 0 4 of which turns into fugitive ch4 emissions although biogas can be used to fuel gas turbines steam boilers and residential cooking and heating systems a complex collection and purification infrastructure is needed to purify biogas the conversion efficiency of combustion engines fed with biogas is also quite low 33 explaining why biogas at many wwtps and landfills continues to be flared the purpose of ad units is often being limited to control odor and generate carbon credits oil and gas production along with mining activities account for 86 of the ch4 emissions from the energy sector nearly 467 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas is being flared annually u s energy information administration 2019 primarily due to lack of direct market access transportation and refinery infrastructure for the gas along with reasons related to safety economics and operational expediency for example 35 of the as producednatural gas 485 million ft3 d 58 ch4 from the fractured bakken shale in north dakota united states is being flared due to the lack of adequate pipelines ports and refineries shrestha et al 2017 with a goal of reducing the carbon footprint due to ch4 emissions from energy and waste sectors this study explores feasibility of biogas oxidation by methanotrophs for generating chemicals e g ethanol volatile fatty acids extracellular polymeric substances biopolymers and single cell protein such an initiative would open new avenues for reusing ch4 in environmental engineering applications the remaining part of this study will focus on aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways of methanotrophs section 2 point sources of ch4 section 3 bioproducts and bioprocesses driven by ch4 oxidation section 4 and notable challenges and needed technical breakthroughs to sustain ch4 fed biotechnology applications section 5 and conclusions section 6 we provide a case study on potential uses of methanotrophs for valorizing typically discarded natural gas ch4 from hydraulically fractured oil fields 2 legacy of methanotrophs from a biology perspective methanotrophs use ch4 as a c source to meet their own metabolic needs or sustain syntrophic bioprocesses within their ecosystem from an environmental engineering perspective they turn ch4 fraction of biogas into valuable bioproducts ch4 and its oxidation products volatile fatty acids and methanol can be used as c substrates in denitrification annamox and biological phosphorus removal bpr bioprocesses in wwtps while methylotrophs use single c compounds including ch4 alcohols aldehydes and acids as carbon substrates methanotrophs prefer ch4 substrates methanotrophs fall under γ proteobacteria group i α proteobacteria group ii or verrucomicrobia class group iii based on their formaldehyde hcho assimilation pathways morphological properties and biochemical characteristics group i methanotrophs use a ribulose monophosphate pathway for assimilating hcho while group ii members use serine pathway group ii members account for 90 of the known methanotrophs which have been typically isolated from the accessible regions of the earth s crust bender and conrad 1992 recently psychrophiles islam et al 2020 thermophiles tsubota et al 2005 acidophiles dunfield et al 2007 halophiles heyer et al 2005 and alkaliphiles kaluzhnaya et al 2001 have been reported to display ch4 oxidation capabilities most of these extremophiles belong to group iii although the verrucomicrobia members mostly live under aerobic conditions their ability to grow under o2 limiting conditions justify their ability to survive harsh acidic ph 1 0 thermophilic 80 c and salty conditions sharp et al 2014 for example both group i and ii methanotrophs were found in lake constance migmatite rock bed olkiluoto site finland pester et al 2004 and evander south africa ward et al 2004 which are characterized by anoxic and volcanic conditions respectively 2 1 c substrates and a methane monooxygenase mmo enzyme methanotrophs use the mmo enzyme to assimilate ch4 as well as to oxidize ammonia using ch4 as a co metabolic substrate carlsen et al 1991 hoefman et al 2014 the mmo enzyme occurs in a soluble form smmo within the cytoplasm as well as in particulate form pmmo within an intracellular membrane compared to pmmo smmo uses a wide range of c substrates e g propene butane cyclohexane chlorotrifluoroethylene toluene naphthalene chloroform diethyl ether and co jiang et al 2010 however pmmo can oxidize complex c substrates including c1 c5 n alkanes and terminal alkanes sirajuddin and rosenzweig 2015 while pmmo is expressed by both the group i and ii members smmo is expressed only by specific members including methylocella spp theisen et al 2005 from the environmental engineering perspective methylomicrobium album methylomicrobium alcaliphilum and methylomonas methanica group i and methylosinus sporium methylocella tundrae methyloferula stellate group ii are important as they can use biogas as the c source under aerobic conditions knief 2015

oxidation of ch4 aom wang et al 2017 bennett et al 2018 via a reverse methanogenesis process wang et al 2014 archaeal species that display aom pathways possess homologous enzymes typical to those involved in methanogenesis except for the n5 n10 methylene tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt reductase mer anaerobic methanotrophs anme the archaeal partners of syntrophic aom use a homolog of nickel containing methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr as an enzyme for activating ch4 scheller et al 2010 3 point sources of discarded methane in environmental engineering applications agriculture 53 energy 28

wwtps and energy sectors mining oil and gas industry fig 2 many of these infrastructure components including landfills already contain a well engineered gas collection system their typical life ranges from 20 to 50 years representing them as a consistent source of ch4 for subsequent use by methanotrophs for instance landfills generate ch4 throughout its lifetime 30 years as well as during the post closure period 30 50 years 67 although ch4 emission vary with changes in the climate and the age of landfills engineered landfills have been reported to yield biogas consistently with ch4 composition of 75 to 95 around 18 26 of the captured ch4 can be used to meet heating and energy requirements of ch4 fed biorefineries and the remaining 74 82 for producing bioproducts chidambarampadmavathy et al

bioconversion of ch4 into bioproducts which can be categorized under 1 carbohydrates 2 fuels power 3 biomolecules and 4 proteins fig 4 tables 1a and 1b provide examples of aerobic anaerobic and electrogenic forms of methanotrophic species their preferences for electron donors and electron acceptors all in a context of targeted bioconversion of ch4 in wwtps 4 2 thermodynamics and kinetic considerations many methanotrophs require a high concentration of ch4 due to their low affinity towards gaseous substrates saari et al 2004 baani and liesack 2008 in general ch4 oxidation by methanotrophs follow michaelis menten kinetics steenbergh et al 2010 from a thermodynamics perspective ch4 oxidation entails a two step mechanism both of which are irreversible 1 c h 4 o 2 c h 3 oh c o 2 the rate constants k 1 and k 2 represent the conversion of ch4 to ch3oh step i and subsequently into co2 step ii respectively ch3oh a desired bioproduct for environmental engineering applications is thus a transient intermediate hydrogen abstraction from ch4 to ch3oh has often been observed to be a rate limiting step for both the processes also the rate constant ratio k 2 k 1 can be rewritten as 2 k 2 k 1 e δ g t 3 δ g δ g ch 4 δ g ch 3 oh table 2 provides an overview of thermodynamics parameters for methanol and other typical bioproducts from ch4 oxidation owing to numerous pathways of dehydrogenation of ch4 activation in biochemical system via radical formation a best case scenario where ch4 is fully converted into ch3oh was assumed likewise bond energies were also considered for the calculations of the thermodynamics of the reaction in case of a complete ch4 oxidation reaction 170 kcal mol excess energy is released than is consumed resulting in production of the heat i e

technical challenges to ch4 valorization in wwtps potential solutions table 4 provides an overview of technical challenges and potential solutions for enabling the use of biogas as a c substrate by methanotrophs ch4 is a non polar substance which does not interact with other compounds its ch links are the strongest among the alkanes thus ch4 fed bioreactors can be expected to be challenged by mass transfer limitations low volumetric productivity and slow biomass growth rates latimer et al 2018 here we discuss three emerging strategies for enabling ch4 oxidation by methanotrophs they include 1 biotechnological interventions for manipulating competing pathways of ch4 oxidation including denitrification and anammox processes 2 plasma technologies for ch4 oxidation 3 material surface modification approaches for enhancing biofilm growth 5 1 metabolic engineering biotechnological interventions can activate the key gene regulatory networks needed by methanotrophs to produce desired bioproduct haynes and gonzalez 2014 omics approaches can be used to enhance ch4 uptake alter metabolic fluxes and suppress competing pathways fei et al 2014 fei et al 2018 other intervening strategies to maximize ch4 oxidation include activation of acetyl coa pathway enzymes blocking of genes proteins involved in competing pathways and adaptive evolution based strain engineering activating key precursors including acetyl coa and pyruvate via genetic engineering approaches kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 can yield high efficiency methanotrophs table 5 shows an overview of key gene regulatory targets and desired bioproducts a triple knock out of methylomicrobium buryatense has been reported to enhance the lipid content by 90 via blocking of two glycogen synthase genes and a sucrose synthase genes fei et al 2018 altered phenotype of increased ch4 oxygen uptake has also been observed suggesting an increased c assimilation by the mutant strains recently an adaptive evolution based engineered mutants were developed using methylomicrobium alcaliphilum for putrescine biosynthesis from ch4 and tolerance by eliminating putrescine utilization pathway and expressing ornithine decarboxylase nguyen and lee 2019 also the plasmid free production strain of methylomonas sp was developed by integrating a cassette encoding gene for astaxanthin and hemoglobin enhancing astaxanthin production by 80 of total carotenoids tao et al 2007 the secondary carotenoid production in methylomonas sp has been reported to be imparied due to reduced o2 availability moreover the colorless methylomonas sp was conjugated with carotenogenic biosynthetic genes viz beta carotene ketolase and beta carotene hydrolase 95 of carotenoid as astaxanthin with the sufficient oxygen supply ye and kelly 2012 these results corroborate that the low o2 levels would hamper astaxanthin accumulation and instead promotes the formation of intermediates a us patent application on metabolic engineering of methanotrophs for lactic acid production from methane has been reported recently subbian 2015 for synthesis of phb by inserting artificial metabolic pathways in methanotrophic cells a precursor molecule viz 1 4 butanediol could be synthesized which in turn gets converted into the short chain pha molecules fig 1 in another approach lactate a bioproduct that has been reported to be a suitable c substrate for phb synthesis lactate could easily be converted into pha via a two step reaction using two different recombinant enzymes i e pct and pha synthase fig 1 a similar strategy could also be applied to produce organic acid i e malate synthesized by type ii methanotrophs possessing a complete serine cycle to increase the phb via ch4 oxidation a continuous stir tank reactor configurations have been used increasing the phb yield to 60 w w chidambarampadmavathy et al 2015 optimizing the c to microbe ratio while increasing the n to microbe ratio has been reported to support the growth of type ii methanotrophs used for phb synthesis adequate attention should be given towards the n source as any accumulation of nitrate as n source will support the growth of type i methanotrophs degrading the quality of produced phb the x ome technologies including metabolome transcriptome proteome and fluxome approaches along with genome scale metabolic modeling could be used to rewire the genetic mechanism of methanotrophs since the essential biotechnology parameters including genetic tractability growth and nutrient uptake have been reported for well characterized methanotrophs like methylocystis sp methylosinus trichosporium ob3b and methylococcus capsulatus bath the genomic tools could be established widely for other non model methanotrophs however with the recent explorations of novel halophilic psychrophilic acidophilic alkaliphilic and extremely thermophilic methanotrophs could further augment the genomic insights for their biotechnological potential 5 2 plasma technology plasma referred to as the fourth state of matter which includes negative ions positive ions neutral species and electrons can be used to oxidize ch4 effectively zakaria and kamarudin 2016 under ambient conditions and with low specific input energy electrical input energy per unit mass of the material gas okumoto and mizuno 2001 to address the issue of low ch4 solubility methane hydrates can be used to enhance ch4 solubility during the plasma assisted bioconversion process zakaria and kamarudin 2016 the synergistic effect of heterogenous catalyst activated plasma technology using pt fe2o3 and ceo2 is another effective way to enhance ch4 conversion efficiency chen et al 2009 holmen 2009 reddy et al 2013 5 3 surface modification techniques surface modification techniques could be used to promote dissociation of ch bonds in ch4 and render its amenability to subsequent conversion into bioproducts here we focus on the use of surface modification techniques to enhance bio electrochemical oxidation of ch4 instead of relying upon expensive catalysts e g ni pt al2o3 zro2 etc that require high temperatures methanotrophs can be used to convert ch4 into methanol and subsequently into other bioproducts chemical functionalization techniques can be used to tune material surface properties and render them suitable for the growth of electrogenic methanotrophs in bess the bio electrocatalytic activity of the working electrode we in bess largely depends upon its surface properties the biofilm growth interactions between the biofilm and we surface and the resulting biofilm phenotypes are influenced by the chemical composition of electrode surface charge surface area surface roughness wettability and porosity surfactants immobilized on the we surfaces can enhance its effective surface area reduce the impedance and improve the overall kinetics pertinent to bioelectrochemical oxidation of ch4 table s3 provides an overview of surface modification methods for enhancing catalytic activity and biofilm growth recently we demonstrated the use of a multilayered reduced graphene oxide rgo to achieve super hydrophilic nickel electrode surfaces which were found to yield electrogenic biofilms of rhodobacter sphaeroides spp in mfcs islam et al 2020 similarly glassy carbon electrode surfaces modified with oh ch3 so3 and n ch3 3 groups via electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts have been found to yield suitable surface properties for promoting the growth of geobacter biofilms guo et al 2013 positively charged hydrophilic surfaces promote the biofilm growth when compared to negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces surface roughness and porosity of the electrode also influences bio electrochemical impedance in mfcs ye et al 2013 the rougher the electrode surface the lower the overall bio electrochemical impedance of the bes systems 5 4 a case study on the use of valorization of stranded methane in the oil industry horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have enabled oil production from previously inaccessible tight shale oil deposits including the mississippian age bakken shale which extends into montana and the canadian provinces of saskatchewan and manitoba while the oil production from the bakken shale has been a major economic driver it has attracted a significant number of foods energy and water few nexus challenges as discussed in shrestha et al 2017 and depicted in fig 6 natural gas a byproduct of the crude oil production is flared in open atmosphere due to lack of transportation and refinery infrastructure fig 6 hydraulic fracturing also generates a hypersaline oil and gas wastewater produced water that is currently being piped and permanently injected into class ii injection wells causing undesirable spills and contamination of nearby agricultural and water resources here we will discuss the potential use of methanotrophs for valorizing a commonly stranded natural gas in the oil fields as shown in fig 6 methanotrophs can use methane fraction of the stranded gas as a c source produced water can be desalinated and treated in a microbial capacitive deionization mcdc unit shrestha et al 2018 and used to provide macro micro nutrients and trace elements to support physiological growth of methanotrophs the average volume of produced water in the bakken shale alone is 2 31 mgal year shrestha et al 2017 which will produce an adequate amount of electrolyte to sustain methane based bioreactors throughout the year indigenous methanotrophs present in drilling mud geological formation fluid amendments handling water infrastructure and produced water can be used as inoculum in methanotrophic bioreactors thus the development of methanotrophic processes for in situ reuse and recycling of produced water and the simultaneous treatment of stranded methane is beneficial in our earlier study we have demonstrated the proof of concept for mfcs and mcdc technologies to treat and desalinate produced water shrestha et al 2018 thus it is also plausible to enrich methanotrophs for treating dissolved methane in produced water while accomplishing the typical cod removal fig 7 as discussed in the subsequent paragraphs the natural gas stream that is currently being openly flared could be used to supersaturate the produced water with dissolved methane as the primary chemical constituent of natural gas 70 90 by volume raw natural gas from the well methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that can significantly impact global atmospheric chemistry increasing crude oil production has also resulted in the increasing air pollution primarily due to the open flaring of natural gas which results in emissions of air pollutants including vocs pm co etc the problem with flaring is that it doesn t burn all the vocs and some escape into the atmosphere we could recycle some of the ch4 from the natural gas and treat it in the methanotroph based bioprocesses the desalinated water from mcdc can be used as the electrolyte for ch4 fed bioreactors methanotrophs can use stranded ch4 as the sole carbon source the indigenous methanotrophic consortia can turn the produced water treatment system into a biorefinery platform for generating a range of value products shown in fig 4 for instance it is viable to set up bioreactor systems to convert ch4 into methanol using methanotrophs methylomicrobium album and methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 1 5 mg of dry cell mass ml and 20 of ch4 as a feed patel et al 2016 was able to produce methanol 3 43 and 3 73 mm under optimum conditions ph 7 0 30 c and 175 rpm with the efficiency of 51 61 production of methanol in batch cultures was evaluated in 120 ml serum bottles containing 20 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm with 10 μm of fe ii and 5 μm of cu ii hence a 10 000 l fermenter could be designed to generate 7000 l of methanol methanotrophs could be enriched using the ch4 gas and accumulated cells could be used as a protein source if all the currently flared ch4 is efficiently used in a fermenting 10 000 l 2282 t of methanotrophic cells could be generated that could be used as cattle feed ch4 derived bioproducts can be used at various unit operations at different treatment levels of the wastewater treatment systems as shown in table 6 also detailed investigations on each bioproduct derived from various methanotrophs and their technical challenges were described in section 4 6 conclusions we conclude that methanotrophs and their recombinant enzymes provide excellent opportunities for treating commonly discarded ch4 a series of further studies are warranted to unlock their potential for treating and recycling unprocessed ch4 in real time systems especially at wastewater treatment plants from a biology standpoint there is a need to decode key mechanisms of ch4 assimilation under semi aerobic or anaerobic conditions that may be beneficial for treating ch4 collected from rising sewers anaerobic digesters landfills and other point sources in environmental engineering applications advanced immune labeling techniques are required to enable precise characterization of the intracytoplasmic membranes of methanotrophs from a modeling standpoint computational models describing the active sites of pmmo smmo and amo genes will enable the development of robust microbes via genome editing techniques these models could also be used to trace electron transfer routes during ch4 oxidation within wastewater treatment systems integrated with microbial fuel cells mfcs versus using methanotrophs to treat ch4 in separate mfc units a random in vitro protein engineering techniques could improve the biotransformation efficiency of large multi subunit proteins viz mmos from an engineering standpoint novel approaches based on a combination of advanced gas phase bioreactor technology novel materials and robust methanotrophs are required to address challenges with low

emissions although biogas can be used to fuel gas turbines steam boilers and residential cooking and heating systems a complex collection and purification infrastructure is needed to purify biogas the conversion efficiency of combustion engines fed with biogas is also quite low 33 explaining why biogas at many wwtps and landfills continues to be flared the purpose of ad units is often being limited to control odor and generate carbon credits oil and gas production along with mining activities account for 86 of the ch4 emissions from the energy sector nearly 467 2 billion cubic feet of natural

would open new avenues for reusing ch4 in environmental engineering applications the remaining part of this study will focus on aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways of methanotrophs section 2 point sources of ch4 section 3 bioproducts and bioprocesses driven by ch4 oxidation section 4 and notable challenges and needed technical breakthroughs to sustain ch4 fed biotechnology applications section 5 and conclusions section 6 we provide a case study on potential uses of methanotrophs for valorizing typically discarded natural gas ch4 from hydraulically fractured oil fields 2 legacy of methanotrophs from a biology perspective methanotrophs use ch4 as a c source to meet their own metabolic needs or sustain syntrophic bioprocesses within their ecosystem from an environmental engineering perspective they turn ch4 fraction of biogas into valuable bioproducts ch4 and its oxidation products volatile fatty acids and methanol can be used as c substrates in denitrification annamox and biological phosphorus removal bpr bioprocesses in wwtps while methylotrophs use single c compounds including ch4 alcohols aldehydes and acids as carbon substrates methanotrophs prefer ch4 substrates methanotrophs fall under γ proteobacteria group i α proteobacteria group ii or verrucomicrobia class group iii based on their formaldehyde hcho assimilation pathways morphological properties and biochemical characteristics group i methanotrophs use a ribulose monophosphate pathway for assimilating hcho while group ii members use serine pathway group ii members account for 90 of the known methanotrophs which have been typically isolated from the accessible regions of the earth s crust bender and conrad 1992 recently psychrophiles islam et al 2020 thermophiles tsubota et al 2005 acidophiles dunfield et al 2007 halophiles heyer et al 2005 and alkaliphiles kaluzhnaya et al 2001 have been reported to display ch4 oxidation capabilities most of these extremophiles belong to group iii although the verrucomicrobia members mostly live under aerobic conditions their ability to grow under o2 limiting conditions justify their ability to survive harsh acidic ph 1 0 thermophilic 80 c and salty conditions sharp et al 2014 for example both group i and ii methanotrophs were found in lake constance migmatite rock bed olkiluoto site finland pester et al 2004 and evander south

methanotrophs follow michaelis menten kinetics steenbergh et al 2010 from a thermodynamics perspective ch4 oxidation entails a two step mechanism both of which are irreversible 1 c h 4 o 2 c h 3 oh c o 2 the rate constants k 1 and k 2 represent the conversion of ch4 to ch3oh step i and subsequently into co2 step ii respectively ch3oh a desired bioproduct for environmental engineering applications is thus a transient intermediate hydrogen abstraction from ch4 to ch3oh has often been observed to be a rate limiting step for both the processes also the rate constant ratio k 2 k 1 can be rewritten

phb synthesis lactate could easily be converted into pha via a two step reaction using two different recombinant enzymes i e pct and pha synthase fig 1 a similar strategy could also be applied to produce organic acid i e malate synthesized by type ii methanotrophs possessing a complete serine cycle to increase the phb via ch4 oxidation a continuous stir tank reactor configurations have been used increasing the phb yield to 60 w w chidambarampadmavathy et al 2015 optimizing the c to microbe ratio while increasing the n to microbe ratio has been reported to support the growth of type ii methanotrophs used for phb synthesis adequate attention should be given towards the n source as any accumulation of nitrate as n source will support the growth of type i methanotrophs degrading the quality of produced phb the x ome technologies including metabolome transcriptome proteome and fluxome approaches along with genome scale metabolic modeling could be used to rewire the genetic mechanism of methanotrophs since the essential biotechnology parameters including genetic tractability growth and nutrient uptake have been reported for well characterized methanotrophs like methylocystis sp methylosinus trichosporium ob3b and methylococcus capsulatus bath the genomic tools could be established widely for other non model methanotrophs however with the recent explorations of novel halophilic psychrophilic acidophilic alkaliphilic and extremely thermophilic methanotrophs could further augment the genomic insights for their biotechnological potential 5 2 plasma technology plasma referred to as the fourth state of matter which includes negative ions positive ions neutral species and electrons can be used to oxidize ch4 effectively zakaria and kamarudin 2016 under ambient conditions and with low specific input energy electrical input energy per unit mass of the material gas okumoto and mizuno 2001 to address the issue of low ch4 solubility methane hydrates can be used to enhance ch4 solubility during the plasma assisted bioconversion process zakaria and kamarudin 2016 the synergistic effect of heterogenous catalyst activated plasma technology using pt fe2o3 and ceo2 is another effective way to enhance ch4 conversion efficiency chen et al 2009 holmen 2009 reddy et al 2013 5 3 surface modification techniques surface modification techniques could be used to promote dissociation of ch bonds in ch4 and render its amenability to subsequent conversion into bioproducts here we focus on the use of surface modification techniques to enhance bio electrochemical oxidation of ch4 instead of relying upon expensive catalysts e g ni pt al2o3 zro2 etc that require high temperatures methanotrophs can be used to convert ch4 into methanol and subsequently into other bioproducts chemical functionalization techniques can be used to tune material surface properties and render them suitable for the growth of electrogenic methanotrophs in bess the bio electrocatalytic activity of the working electrode we in bess largely depends upon its surface properties the biofilm growth interactions between the biofilm and we surface and the resulting biofilm phenotypes are influenced by the chemical composition of electrode surface charge surface area surface roughness wettability and porosity surfactants immobilized on the we surfaces can enhance its effective surface area reduce the impedance and improve the overall kinetics pertinent to bioelectrochemical oxidation of ch4 table s3 provides an overview of surface modification methods for enhancing catalytic activity and biofilm growth recently we demonstrated the use of a multilayered reduced graphene oxide rgo to achieve super hydrophilic nickel electrode surfaces which were found to yield electrogenic biofilms of rhodobacter sphaeroides spp in mfcs islam et al 2020 similarly glassy carbon electrode surfaces modified with oh ch3 so3 and n ch3 3 groups via electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts have been found to yield suitable surface properties for promoting the growth of geobacter biofilms guo et al 2013 positively charged hydrophilic surfaces promote the biofilm growth when compared to negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces surface roughness and porosity of the electrode also influences bio electrochemical impedance in mfcs ye et al 2013 the rougher the electrode surface the lower the overall bio electrochemical impedance of the bes systems 5 4 a case study on the use of valorization of stranded methane in the oil industry horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have enabled oil production from previously inaccessible tight shale oil deposits including the mississippian age bakken shale which extends into montana and the canadian provinces of saskatchewan and manitoba while the oil production from the bakken shale has been a major economic driver it has attracted a significant number of foods energy and water few nexus challenges as discussed in shrestha et al 2017 and depicted in fig 6 natural gas a byproduct of the crude oil production is flared in open atmosphere due to lack of transportation and refinery infrastructure fig 6 hydraulic fracturing also generates a hypersaline oil and gas wastewater produced water that is currently being piped and permanently injected into class ii injection wells causing undesirable spills and contamination of nearby agricultural and water resources here we will discuss the potential use of methanotrophs for valorizing a commonly stranded natural gas in the oil fields as shown in fig 6 methanotrophs can use methane fraction of the stranded gas as a c source produced water can be desalinated and treated in a microbial capacitive deionization mcdc unit shrestha et al 2018 and used to provide macro micro nutrients and trace elements to support physiological growth of methanotrophs the average volume of produced water in the bakken shale alone is 2 31 mgal year shrestha et al 2017 which will produce an adequate amount of electrolyte to sustain methane based bioreactors throughout the year indigenous methanotrophs present in drilling mud geological formation fluid amendments handling water infrastructure and produced water can be used as inoculum in methanotrophic bioreactors thus the development of methanotrophic processes for in situ reuse and recycling of produced water and the simultaneous treatment of stranded methane is beneficial in our earlier study we have demonstrated the proof of concept for mfcs and mcdc technologies to treat and desalinate produced water shrestha et al 2018 thus it is also plausible to enrich methanotrophs for treating dissolved methane in produced water while accomplishing the typical cod removal fig 7 as discussed in the subsequent paragraphs the natural gas stream that is currently being openly flared could be used to supersaturate the produced water with dissolved methane as the primary chemical constituent of natural gas 70 90 by volume raw natural gas from the well methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that can significantly impact global atmospheric chemistry increasing crude oil production has also resulted in the increasing air pollution primarily due to the open flaring of natural gas which results in emissions of air pollutants including vocs pm co etc the problem with flaring is that it doesn t burn all the vocs and some escape into the atmosphere we could recycle some of the ch4 from the natural gas and treat it in the methanotroph based bioprocesses the desalinated water from mcdc can be used as the electrolyte for ch4 fed bioreactors methanotrophs can use stranded ch4 as the sole carbon source the indigenous methanotrophic consortia can turn the produced water treatment system into a biorefinery platform for generating a range of value products shown in fig 4 for instance it is viable to set up bioreactor systems to convert ch4 into methanol using methanotrophs methylomicrobium album and methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 1 5 mg of dry cell mass ml and 20 of ch4 as a feed patel et al 2016 was able to produce methanol 3 43 and 3 73 mm under optimum conditions ph 7 0 30 c and 175 rpm with the efficiency of 51 61 production of methanol in batch cultures was evaluated in 120 ml serum bottles containing 20 ml of phosphate buffer 100 mm with 10 μm of fe ii and 5 μm of cu ii hence a 10 000 l fermenter could be designed to generate 7000 l of methanol methanotrophs could be enriched using the ch4 gas and accumulated cells could be used as a protein source if all the currently flared ch4 is efficiently used in a fermenting 10 000 l 2282 t of methanotrophic cells could be generated that could be used as cattle feed ch4 derived bioproducts can be used at various unit operations at different treatment levels of the wastewater treatment systems as shown in table 6 also detailed investigations on each bioproduct derived from various methanotrophs and their technical challenges were described in section 4 6 conclusions we conclude that methanotrophs and their recombinant enzymes provide excellent opportunities for treating commonly discarded ch4 a series of further studies are warranted to unlock their potential for treating and recycling unprocessed ch4 in real time systems especially at wastewater treatment plants from a biology standpoint there is a need to decode key mechanisms of ch4 assimilation under semi aerobic or anaerobic conditions that may be beneficial for treating ch4 collected from rising sewers anaerobic digesters landfills and other point sources in environmental engineering applications advanced immune labeling techniques are required to enable precise characterization of the intracytoplasmic membranes of methanotrophs from a modeling standpoint computational models describing the active sites of pmmo smmo and amo genes will enable the development of robust microbes via genome editing techniques these models could also be used to trace electron transfer routes during ch4 oxidation within wastewater treatment systems integrated with microbial fuel cells mfcs versus using methanotrophs to treat ch4 in separate mfc units a random in vitro protein engineering techniques could improve the biotransformation efficiency of large multi subunit proteins viz mmos from an engineering standpoint novel approaches based on a combination of advanced gas phase bioreactor technology novel materials and robust methanotrophs are required to address challenges with low solubility thermodynamic stability and inertness of ch4 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

17473,the treatment and disposal of waste activated sludge was has become one of the major challenges for the wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to large output high treatment costs and enriched substantial emerging contaminants ecs therefore reducing sludge volume recovering energy and resource from was and removing ecs and decreasing environmental risk have gained increasing attentions calcium peroxide cao2 a versatile and safe peroxide has been widely applied in terms of was treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic sludge fermentation due to its specific properties such as generating free radicals and alkali etc providing supports for sludge reduction recycling and risk mitigation this review outlines comprehensively the recent progresses and breakthroughs of cao2 in the fields of sludge treatment in particular the relevant mechanisms of cao2 enhancing was dewaterability methane production from anaerobic digestion short chain fatty acids scfa and hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation and the removal of ecs in was and role of experiment parameters are systematically elucidated and discussed respectively finally the knowledge gaps and opportunities in cao2 based sludge treatment technologies that need to be focused in the future are prospected the review presented can supply a theoretical basis and technical reference for the application of cao2 for improving the treatment of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge calcium peroxide sludge treatment extracellular polymeric substances resource recovery risk mitigation 1 introduction activated sludge process effective to clean wastewater has been widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps ping et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 however this biological process is inevitably accompanied by the generation of huge quantities of by product i e waste activated sludge was zhang et al 2020a generally was has a high water content more than 95 which is inconvenient for further treatment transportation and final disposal he et al 2015 at the same time with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization the influent quality of sewage treatment plants is becoming more and more complicated considerable toxic and harmful emerging contaminants ecs e g endocrine disrupting compounds edcs norfloxacin triclocarban and heavy metals therefore is concentrated into was duan et al 2016 cheng et al 2014 xu et al 2017 these contaminants pose a huge potential environmental risk if was is not handled properly appels et al 2008 liu et al 2019 consequently the treatment and disposal of was has become a global public challenge wu et al 2017a wu et al 2019a on the other hand was as a heterogeneous and colloidal complex also contains considerable and abundant organics such as proteins and carbohydrates luo et al 2018 with the growing crisis of energy and resources worldwide it has been recognized that was is not just waste but a vast reservoir of renewable resource which should be reutilized to recover resource and energy dai et al 2015 wei et al 2017a luo et al 2019 as a result numerous researchers and engineers have conducted extensive research on the treatment of was yuan et al 2019 currently several technologies such as sludge dewatering anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation have been widely investigated and accepted as effective methods for sludge treatment during which sludge reduction contaminants removal or conversion of organics matter into high value added products can be realized xiao et al 2016 wei et al 2017b ni et al 2019 however due to the difficulty of disintegrating was and shortcomings of these treatment technologies such as inability to effectively remove ecs above technologies are usually difficult to obtain satisfactory performance of sludge treatment and ecs removal saveyn et al 2008 czajka and londry 2006 xu et al 2019 in order to improve the treatment of was before it final disposal many treatment methods e g chemical treatment physical treatment and biological treatment have been applied in sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic sludge fermentation li et al 2020a wang 2017a liu et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 among these methods advanced oxidation processes aops treatment that belongs to chemical treatment not only can achieve excellent sludge reduction and recycle of organics matter but also better enhance recalcitrant ecs removal and risk mitigation thus it has attracted a lot of attentions li et al 2020b yang et al 2019 zhang and li 2014 calcium peroxide cao2 a good thermal stability versatile and environmental friendliness inorganic peroxides is identified as an effective solid source of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ma et al 2007 massalimov et al 2010 cao2 has high energy peroxide covalent bond ma et al 2007 on the other hand it can slowly liberate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 o2 and ca oh 2 at a controlled rate when contacting with hydrous medium detailed as shown in eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2015 thani et al 2016 during which h2o2 can further generate free radicals including oh ho2 and o2 see eqs 3 5 for details zhang et al 2015a due to this stable oxidation capability cao2 as a new additive for sludge pretreatment has been used in different kinds of sludge treatment processes chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 wang and li 2016 wang et al 2019a 1 cao2 2h2o ca oh 2 h2o2 2 2cao2 2h2o 2ca oh 2 o2 3 h2o2 e oh oh 4 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 5 ho2 o2 h for sludge dewatering the released free radicals from cao2 induce the disruption of sludge colloidal flocs which facilitate the release of interstitial water from sludge meanwhile the generated oh can reduce the hydrophilic functional groups in extracellular polymeric substances eps contributing to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability wu and chai 2016 in anaerobic sludge digestion although cao2 reaction residues suppress the activity of the hydrolytic microbes acidogenesis microbes and methanogens related to anaerobic digestion to some extents the generated ca oh 2 oh and o2 not only can facilitate the release of biodegradable substances e g proteins and polysaccharides via enhancing sludge disintegration but also promote the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics e g humus and lignocellulose into degradable organics thus supplying more soluble biodegradable organics for anaerobic digestion and enhancing methane production wang et al 2019a when cao2 is added to anaerobic fermentation of sludge cao2 induced alkaline conditions and oxidation accelerate the solubilization of sludge simultaneously cao2 addition improves the activities and abundance of hydrolytic microbes and acidogenesis microbes therefore the microbes can utilize the abundant soluble organics to produce more short chain fatty acids scfa additionally the consumption of scfa i e methanogenesis process is significantly inhibited resulting in the accumulation of scfa and further improving the yield of scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 in addition to scfa cao2 addition also can promote hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge the presence of cao2 not only provides more biodegradable organic matter for bio process of hydrogen production but also severely inhibits the bio process of hydrogen consumption thereby increasing the accumulative hydrogen production wang et al 2019b apart from above mentioned benefits it has been found that the removal performance of ecs in the sludge can also be improved when cao2 is applied to the treatment of sludge zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2017b the cao2 induced peroxidation can damage the binding of eps to metal ions promoting the release of sludge borne heavy metals into aqueous phase and increasing its soluble fractions wu et al 2017b it is conducive to remove heavy metals from sludge before final disposal of sludge moreover the generated free radicals during the cao2 oxidation can effectively remove recalcitrant organic ecs from was and efficiently inactivate pathogen combined with alkaline action zhang et al 2015a liu et al 2019 in recent years there is an increasing attention to the research of different sludge treatment methods based on cao2 chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 wang and li 2016 nevertheless there is still a lack of comprehensive summary of the key advances in cao2 based sludge treatment technologies herein this review article firstly concludes the current researches of cao2 in improving sludge treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion anaerobic sludge fermentation and recalcitrant contaminants removal meanwhile relevant mechanisms of above applied processes are systematically discussed furthermore the outlook for current research gaps and future investigation in cao2 based sludge treatment is also proposed this review would provide theoretical basis and technical guide to some extent for the potential engineering applications of cao2 for improving sludge treatments in the future 2 the use of cao2 for improving was dewatering the tremendous volume of sludge posed severe challenge for its further treatment and disposal wu et al 2018a to reduce the volume sludge dewatering process has been widely applied in wwtps jin et al 2014 yang et al 2015 however eps in sludge feature high hydration and negative charge making the sludge to bind large amounts of water within the sludge flocs which greatly increases the difficulty of separating bio colloids and liquids from sludge christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 conventional mechanical dewatering method extensively used at present cannot effectively release bound water from sludge flocs due to the difficulty to destroy the binding effect of eps and water thereby achieving the unsatisfactory sludge reduction zhen et al 2013 guan et al 2012 besides with regard to the pressure filtration process of sludge the high compressibility of sludge also results in the low permeability of the formed sludge cake which blocks filtration media thereby hindering the bound water removal and deteriorating the dewatering the performance qi et al 2011 therefore sludge dewatering is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks for the complete sludge treatment and disposal process wu et al 2020 cao2 and its combined methods can induce the enhancement of sludge dewaterability the radical oxidation induced by cao2 and the activated method based on cao2 can effectively promote the disruption of sludge floc structure resulting in the transformation of interstitial water trapped inside the floc into free water chen et al 2016 boran et al 2017 besides the released oh can not only enhance the solubilization of eps from the tightly bound tb layers to the loosely bound lb and soluble layers but also oxidize and remove the hydrophilic functional groups in eps reducing the binding water capacity of eps wu et al 2017b moreover the binding affinity of the released ca2 to eps compressed the electric double layer of sludge transforming interfacial water into free water wu and chai 2016 all of the above acts to reduce the water holding capacity of sludge colloid promoting the sludge dewaterability mechanism of improving sludge dewaterability by cao2 based methods is presented in fig 1 and the corresponding dewatering performance are concluded in table 1 the enhancement of sludge dewaterability using sole cao2 treatment is limited which is mainly related to the oxidizability of cao2 chen et al 2016 investigated the influence of cao2 treatment on sludge filtration performance srf that is one of the important indicators for evaluating sludge dewaterability the srf value decreased firstly and then rose with the increase of cao2 dosage and the optimal filtration performance was observed in the presence of 20 mg cao2 g tss with srf reduction of 16 34 table 1 at lower dosages the absence of oxidation can t effectively destroy sludge floc to improve filtration performance and excessive oxidizability induced by higher dosages can increase protein like substances content in soluble eps seps and lb eps deteriorating the filtration performance zhang et al 2015b moreover the srf value of the optimal performance still can t reach standard of good dewaterability 0 4 1012 cm g boran et al 2017 also found that 10 mg g tss cao2 under the ph of 5 only reduced srf by 12 1 therefore in the sludge dewatering cao2 is often used as a as a peroxidant activated application or pre oxidation combined with other methods wu et al 2018b chen et al 2016 cao2 activated by ferrous ions fe ii works well in improving sludge dewatering wu and chai 2016 investigated the influence of fe ii activated cao2 on sludge dewatering the srf decreased from 2 29 1012 cm g to 1 69 1011 cm g at initial ph 2 with 0 625 mmol g tss of fe ii and 0 05 g g tss cao2 meanwhile capillary suction time cst another important indicator for evaluating sludge dewaterability showed a similar trend with 85 7 reduction cao2 is first dissolved in water for producing h2o2 eq 1 then the coexisting fe ii and h2o2 can initiate a series of reactions as described by eqs 6 12 for producing oh ho2 and o2 pignatello et al 2006 the generated radicals among which the dominant role is oh not only disrupt the sludge flocs but also reduce hydrophilic functional groups of lb eps facilitating the release of interstitial water and enhancing dewatering of sludge wu et al 2017b guibaud et al 2012 an interesting phenomenon deserves our attention although fe ii activated cao2 treatment also increased the protein like substances content in seps and lb eps like cao2 treatment alone no deterioration in dewatering performance was observed chen et al 2016 wu and chai 2016 excitation emission matrix eem spectra of eps fractions showed that a blue shift in the emission wavelength was observed in the lb eps with fe ii activated cao2 treatment compared with raw sludge fig s1 which indicated the oxidation induced by fe ii activated cao2 could eliminate the specific hydrophilic groups of lb eps e g carbonyl hydroxyl and amine groups and reduce the number of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in the chain structure wang et al 2009a liu et al 2011 thereby eliminating the deterioration of the dewatering performance caused by the increased lb eps and improving sludge dewaterability moreover the variation of ph values can affect the sludge dewaterability using fe ii activated cao2 it was reported that the cst and srf increased rapidly as the initial ph increased from 2 to 6 indicating that the dewatering performance was deteriorated at higher initial ph values wu and chai 2016 this could be due to that the production of h2o2 was restrained by the slower dissolution rate of cao2 at higher initial ph values olyaie et al 2012 resulting in less generation of the oh radical which therefore cannot effectively reduce the cst and srf 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 7 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 8 ho2 o2 h pk a 4 8 9 o2 fe3 fe2 o2 10 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 11 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 12 ho2 h2o2 oh h2o o2 the combination of filter aids and cao2 is also considered as a useful method for assisting sludge dewatering after addition of filter aids cao2 could be catalyzed for producing oh which can destroy the sludge floc structure and reduce the content of hydrophilic protein in tb eps eliminating the water holding capacity of sludge and accordingly enhancing sludge dewatering boran et al 2017 wu et al 2018a moreover the porous structure of the filter aid play the role of draining medium improving interstitial water removal qi et al 2011 boran et al 2017 investigated the influence of montmorillonite supported nano cao2 on sludge dewaterability 0 1 g montmorillonite g tss and 10 mg cao2 g tss reduced srf by about 40 and 12 1 respectively when the combination of 0 1 g montmorillonite g tss and 3 33 mg cao2 g tss i e 0 1 g g tss montmorillonite nano cao2 was used to treat sludge 62 2 reductions of srf was obtained when the dosage of montmorillonite nano cao2 increased to 0 5 g g tss the srf further decrease to 8 47 1011 cm g achieving the maximal srf reduction of 70 1 the dewatered sludge itself can also act as a filter aid after proper modification wu et al 2018b developed a fe doped sludge derived mesoporous material sdmm which was modified using the combination of h2so4 hno3 and thermal reflux method and accordingly used as the template to load cao2 for sludge dewatering as a result the srf decreased distinctly by 64 1 when 0 5 g g tss sdmm and 0 5 g g tss cao2 supported on fe doped sdmm were combined to pretreat sludge the enhancement of sludge dewatering can be attributed to the combined effect of filtration aid and peroxidation wu et al 2018b inorganic coagulants and flocculants have been extensively used in improving the dewatering performance of sludge because they can rapidly increase the sludge floc size through bridging and charge neutralization and then strip the water in the sludge through double electric layer compression improving the stability and dewaterability of sludge higgins and novak 1997 cheng et al 2012 therefore the influences of inorganic coagulants or flocculants in combination with cao2 pre oxidation on sludge dewatering have been studied chen et al 2016 reported that the sludge dewatering performance was significantly improved using cao2 in combination with inorganic coagulants e g polyaluminium chloride pacl ferric iron fecl3 and flocculant e g polyacrylamide pam compared with sole cao2 inorganic coagulants and flocculant addition when cao2 pre oxidation was combined with 15 mg g tss pacl 15 mg g tss fecl3 and 15 mg g tss pam the srf value significantly decreased to 3 55 1012 4 36 1012 and 2 75 1012 m kg respectively therefore srf reduction respectively reached 76 78 cao2 pacl 71 50 cao2 fecl3 and 98 20 cao2 pam table 1 meanwhile the water content wc one of the important indicators for evaluating sludge dewaterability was respectively decreased from 98 30 of raw sludge to 79 46 79 27 and 81 32 on the one hand cao2 oxidation facilitated the transformation from bound water to free water making it easier to remove from sludge flocs neyens et al 2004 moreover pacl and fecl3 can enhance density of sludge flocs benefiting the removal of free water in sludge eps through double electric layer compression niu et al 2013 meanwhile the hydrolyzate of pacl and fecl3 can be used as a framework builder to reconstruct the sludge floc enhancing the floc strength and reducing the compressibility of the sludge chen et al 2016 with regard to pam it can make sludge flocs larger but loose with good settling performance via bridging and sweeping wong et al 2006 all above these make the combination of cao2 pre oxidation and inorganic coagulants or flocculant pose a positive effect on improving the sludge dewaterability chen et al 2016 in addition thermo also have a positive effect in assisting cao2 for sludge dewatering yu et al 2018 found that wc was decreased from 85 2 1 4 of raw sludge to 63 4 4 4 after thermo cao2 pretreatment this could be due to that divalent ions such as calcium generated by thermo cao2 can bridge the negatively charged sites on the eps thus promoting the transfer of water wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2018 3 the use of cao2 for improving anaerobic digestion of was anaerobic digestion is considered to be an effective energy recovery of sludge and pollution control technology during which biodegradable organic matters of sludge are mainly utilized to produce methane and large amount of pathogens are inactivated liu et al 2020a therefore the stabilization and reduction of sludge are achieved however the methane production from anaerobic digestion of was are generally restricted by the following two main factors the first one is low disintegration rates of was due to protection of sludge eps and cell membranes resulting in low release and utilization of abundant organics in the was which is known as a typical rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion wang et al 2013 he et al 2018a the second one is that the substantial non biodegradable organic matters in sludge e g humus and lignocellulose accounting for 20 50 of the total sludge organics can t be effectively utilized and among of them such as humic acid is demonstrated to suppress the production of methane li et al 2014a hu et al 2016 li et al 2019a all above these caused unsatisfied methane yield from conventional anaerobic digestion of was accordingly not achieving efficient resource utilization from sludge in order to promote the production of methane cao2 has been introduced into anaerobic digestion as a was pretreatment method the generated oh and o2 from cao2 decomposition enhances the disruption of eps and cell membrane facilitating the transfer of tb eps to seps and the release of intracellular organic matters to the extracellular ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 therefore large quality of organics such as proteins and polysaccharides are released from solid phase of sludge into liquid phase meanwhile substantial alkali produced by the decomposition of cao2 is also conducive to sludge disintegration wang et al 2019b the enhancement of was disintegration induced by oh o2 and alkali can provide more soluble organics for subsequent process relevant to methane production which is one reason why cao2 pretreatment increases the yield of methane from anaerobic digestion of was wang et al 2019a moreover cao2 pretreatment can enhance the cleavage of unsaturated conjugated bonds and reduce the aromaticity of humus and lignocellulose thereby promoting the degradation of humus and lignocellulose and providing more biodegradable substances for microorganism responsible for producing methane which is another reason that the increased methane yield is achieved with cao2 pretreatment wang et al 2019a mechanism of enhancing methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion by cao2 is illustrated in fig 2 the effects of cao2 and its combined methods in anaerobic digestion are summarized in table 2 wang et al 2019a explored the influences of cao2 on anaerobic digestion of was after 2 d pretreatment the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod concentration of was increased from 1600 to 3400 mg l with an increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g volatile suspended solids vss meanwhile both contents of humus including humic acid fulvic acid and humin and lignocellulose including lignin cellulose and hemicellulose in the sludge with cao2 pretreatment were lower than that sludge without cao2 pretreatment the presence of cao2 destroyed substantially benzene ring and c c bond of humus and lignocellulose degraded part of humus and lignocellulose into organics with small molecule weights and accordingly improving the biodegradability of the released organics wang et al 2019a as a result cao2 pretreatment provided organic matters with high content and high biodegradability for methanogenic microbes the yield of methane from was increased to 215 9 ml g vss with 0 14 g g vss cao2 pretreatment after 14 d digestion which was 1 3 times that was without cao2 pretreatment wang et al 2019a in the research of li et al 2019b 0 1 g g vss cao2 pretreatment increased the scod in the was to 1693 2 77 mg l which was only 708 9 37 mg l without cao2 pretreatment under this condition the methane yield was increased from 156 09 to 175 84 ml g vss after 36 d digestion however the dosage of cao2 pretreatment should be controlled although high dosage of cao2 provided more biodegradable substrates for anaerobic digestion the residual free radicals such as oh and o2 inevitably entered into anaerobic digestion system and then significantly suppressed the activities of microorganisms relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes because strong oxidative properties of free radicals could inactivate microorganisms thereby inhibiting the production of methane from was wang et al 2019a tokumura et al 2009 according to the study of wang et al 2019a the improvement of methane production from was using 0 26 g g vss cao2 pretreatment declined compared with 0 14 g g vss cao2 pretreatment furthermore the methane production from was was more strongly suppressed without adjusting ph after cao2 pretreatment resulting in reduced methane yield ping et al 2018 reported that the methane yield from was in the presence of 0 2 g g vss cao2 addition was significantly lower than that in the absence of cao2 addition at different temperature and no methane was even produced at ambient temperature table 2 this is because in addition to the above mentioned free radicals the high alkaline ph 9 generated by cao2 addition also severely inhibits the activity of methanogens which are sensitive to external environmental factors such as ph and could only maintain good activity only under neutral ph conditions yuan et al 2006 ping et al 2018 ultrasonic us microwave mw and ultraviolet light uv combined with cao2 pretreatment have also been demonstrated to promote methane production from anaerobic digestion of was in us cao2 process instantaneous high temperature and high pressure generated by us accelerated cao2 decomposition to produce h2o2 which could generate more free radicals such as oh and o2 under us irradiation zhang et al 2011 strong oxidative of free radicals accelerated and facilitated disruption of sludge eps and cell membrane eswari et al 2016 therefore was disintegration rate was improved thus providing more substrates for enhancing anaerobic digestion efficacy li et al 2019b compared the influences of us cao2 and us cao2 pretreatment on the methane production from anaerobic digestion of was after sole pretreatment of us 1 w ml 10 min and cao2 0 1 g g vss the concentration of scod in was increased to 1693 2 77 and 1782 1 87 mg l which was only 708 9 37 mg l in the was without any pretreatment when us cao2 was applied to pretreat was the concentration of scod in was reached 3014 8 116 mg l increasing 78 and 69 compared to sole us and cao2pretreatment respectively under this condition 211 90 8 6 ml g vss of methane was obtained in us cao2 pretreatment after 36 d digestion which was respectively improved by 36 26 and 19 compared to the original sludge without pretreatment us and cao2 li et al 2019b hence a synergistic effect on the biochemical methane potential occurred when the combination of us and cao2 was conducted to pretreat was similar phenomenon was also observed in the mw cao2 and uv cao2 processes research by wang and li showed that mw irradiation facilitated the o2 generation from cao2 more oxidizing agent were therefore used to promote the solubilization of was eskicioglu et al 2008 wang and li 2016 the scod concentration in mw cao2 process 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and mw 480 w 2 min reached 5002 120 mg l which were respectively 1002 78 2800 201 and 2730 134 mg l in the was without pretreatment with cao2 pretreatment and with mw pretreatment wang and li 2016 the methane production after mw cao2 pretreatment was significantly improved by 80 2 compared to blank sludge without pretreatment while it was enhanced by only 23 9 after mw pretreatment and inhibited after cao2 pretreatment in addition to the enhancement of was disintegration the activities of enzymes responsible for hydrolytic i e protease and α amylase and acid forming i e phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase and the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea relevant to acetate utilization and h2 co2 utilization were all improved after a lag period wang and li 2016 therefore enhancing methane production from was anaerobic digestion in mw cao2 process could attribute to its induced synergistic effect of chemical and biological both of uv and cao2 pretreatment could destroy the sludge flocs and cells and accelerate the solubilization of was promoting the release of extracellular and intercellular organics from sludge into the aqueous phase wang and li 2016 when uv and cao2 was combined the was disintegration and dissolution was further enhanced thereby more soluble organics were released and provided for anaerobic methane production zheng et al 2021 as a result the methane production in uv cao2 pretreatment 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and uv 2 h was greater than that under other conditions including control without any pretratment sole uv 2h and sole cao2 0 1 g g vss pretreatments furthermore the final increase in methane production by uv cao2 pretreatment was higher than the sum of sole uv and sole cao2 pretreatments which suggested that uv cao2 pretreatment showed a synergistic effect in was anaerobic digestion in addition the final increase in methane production by uv cao2 pretreatment was also greater than that of the sum of sole uv sole cao2 decomposition i e ca oh 2 and h2o2 and the sum of their combinations i e uv ca oh 2 uv h2o2 indicating a comprehensive synergy of ca oh 2 h2o2 and uv during uv cao2 pretreatment zheng et al 2021 4 the use of cao2 for improving anaerobic fermentation of was apart from the treatment and disposal of was many wwtps such as in southern china hungary and warsaw poland also face the problem of insufficient influent carbon source oleszkiewicz et al 2004 he et al 2016 wang et al 2017b weinpel et al 2018 hence extra carbon sources e g sodium acetate glucose alcohol and glycerol are normally replenished into the influent to meet the needs of wastewater biological nutrient removal guerrero et al 2012 tang et al 2018 although this method is beneficial for maintaining the performance of nutrient removal it will inevitably increase the operating cost of wwtps posing a significant challenge to its long term operation he et al 2018b zhang et al 2018b recently was anaerobic fermentation has gained enormous interest because the generated scfa not only could make up for the shortage of influent carbon source but also could be used to produce high value product i e biodegradable plastic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha jiang et al 2009 li et al 2011 both carbon source in situ production in wwtps and resource and energy recovery from was could be realized via anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2020b he et al 2019 however substantial organic matters in was can t be effectively released for scfa production and the produced scfa can be rapidly consumed by methanogenic archaea which together leads to low scfa yield from was chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2017 cao2 addition can significantly enhance the production of scfa from was anaerobic fermentation long period of alkaline condition produced by cao2 continuously facilitate the disruption of was structure including eps and cell membranes which can be further solubilized by the generated oxidative environment from cao2 li et al 2011 sheng et al 2020 this synergistic chemical effect promotes the release of organics present in the solid phase of the was into the liquid phase more substrates could be therefore utilized by microorganisms responsible for scfa production li et al 2015 furthermore chemical conditions generated from cao2 not only promotes the activities of key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis but also increased the relative abundances of corresponding microorganisms facilitating the metabolism of organic matters to produce scfa ping et al 2020 however the presence of cao2 significantly inhibits the activity of methanogens and decreases the abundances of scfa consumers i e methanogens reducing the consumption of scfa and accordingly enhancing the accumulation of scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 both chemical and biological effects induced by cao2 contribute to the improvement of scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation thereby recycling available resources from was mechanism of promoting scfa production from was anaerobic fermentation with cao2 addition is displayed in fig 3 the effects of cao2 on anaerobic fermentation are concluded in table 3 li et al 2015 firstly applied cao2 to was anaerobic fermentation after cao2 addition ca oh 2 oh and o2 are released from the decomposition of cao2 eqs 1 5 ca oh 2 can notably promote the disruption of sludge cells li et al 2014b meanwhile oh and o2 as strong chemical oxidant could attack sludge eps and cell membranes wang et al 2009b zhang et al 2015c consequently the maximum scod content in sludge without cao2 was 1890 72 mg l within the first 4 days while it increased to 4193 28 mg l with addition of 0 2 cao2 g g vss and the corresponding vss reduction increased from 22 0 to 49 2 li et al 2015 therefore more substrates could be utilized in acidogenesis process to generate scfa the scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation increased from 58 to 284 mg cod g vss as the cao2 dosage increase from 0 to 0 2 g g vss li et al 2015 biological effects also play an important role in the enhancement of scfa production by cao2 the relative activities of key enzymes involved in scfa production including protease α amylase acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase butyrate kinase phosphotransbutyrylase and oxaloacetate transcarboxylase as well as coa transferase were all enhanced when using 0 2 cao2 g g vss in anaerobic fermentation thus obviously promoting pathways relevant to hydrolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis e g amino acid metabolism citrate cycle fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation as well as glycolysis similar improvement was also made on the distributions of microorganisms in the anaerobic fermentation responsible for organic compounds hydrolysis and acid generation li et al 2015 ping et al 2020 in anaerobic fermentation the generated scfa can be further utilized for methane production by methanogens preventing the effective accumulation of scfa wu et al 2019b luo et al 2020a the addition of 0 1 g g vss of cao2 decreased the activity of coenzyme f420 to 34 of that in the control test without cao2 addition when cao2 addition increased to 0 2 g g vss the relative activities of coenzyme f420 were further inhibited by 93 moreover the abundances of phylum euryarchaeota to which methanogens belong in the presence of 0 2 g cao2 g vss decreased by 38 9 li et al 2015 above results indicated that the presence of cao2 addition significantly inhibited the activity of coenzyme f420 associated with methanogenesis and decreased the distribution of methanogens which was due to that methanogens had poor tolerance to alkaline and other extreme conditions such as oxidative environment li et al 2015 chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019a hence less scfa were consumed to produce methane in the presence of cao2 and methane yield decreased with an increase in the cao2 dosage thereby accumulating more scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 because of the quick reaction rate of cao2 in aqueous solution the effective time of cao2 enhancing scfa production was very limited zhang et al 2020b found that steel slag premodified with salicylic acid methanol sam ss can cooperate with cao2 for prolonging the effect of cao2 on improvement of scfa production in sam ss cao2 process 0 3 g g vss of cao2 and 0 714 g g vss of sam ss stronger intensity of oh and longer period of alkalinity are generated due to the slow release and synergetic reaction between cao2 and sam ss which leads to stronger and more durable inhibition of the activities of some scfa consuming bacteria zhang et al 2020b as a result the concentration of scfa in the presence of sam ss cao2 was maintained above 1000 mg l in 9 days by contrast in the test of cao2 the concentration of scfa gradually decreased from the 3rd day and to 285 mg l on the 10th day a similar phenomenon was also observed in the concentration of acetic acid that can be utilized for methane production by methanogens in the cao2 test the acetic acid concentration began to drop from 5th day however the concentration of acetic acid in the sam ss cao2 test continuously increased and maintained for a longer time to the 9th day zhang et al 2020b nevertheless the dosage of cao2 used in was anaerobic fermentation should be controlled within the appropriate range li et al 2015 found that cao2 addition at 0 3 g g vss almost completely suppressed scfa production from was compared with the promotion effect at cao2 dosage of 0 2 g g vss resulting in scfa concentration below 10 mg cod g vss which was even lower than the case without cao2 addition this is mainly due to that too high dosage of cao2 e g 0 3 g g vss kills most microbial cells significantly inhibiting microbial activity such as the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and acid forming enzymes responsible for scfa production li et al 2015 moreover fermentation temperature also affects the role of cao2 in promoting scfa production from was in the research of ping et al 2018 the production of scfa was significantly enhanced with 0 2 g cao2 g vss addition at both 25 c and 35 c however cao2 addition inhibited the production of scfa within the first 6 days when the temperature further increased to 55 c and the corresponding maximum scfa concentration was lower than the sample at 55 c in the absence of cao2 both high temperature and high ph generated by adding cao2 at 55 c could cause the accumulation of free ammonia fa with the maximal concentration being 823 mg l within the first 6 days lübken et al 2015 ping et al 2018 fa at ppm level has been demonstrated to exert a strong biocidal effect on a wide range of microorganisms involved in was treatment chen et al 2008a dai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a therefore cao2 addition at fermentation temperature of 55 c inhibited scfa production due to the enhanced toxicity induced by high concentration of fa although cao2 has a great contribution to promoting scfa production the dosage of cao2 used under optimal condition is high such as 0 2 g g vss which inevitably generates high operating cost and accordingly obstacle large scale application in real wwtps to reduce the dosage of cao2 while maintaining the effect of enhancing scfa production some economic and sustainable methods were introduced to in combination with cao2 in heat cao2 process the combined effect of heat alkali oh and h2o2 accelerated the disruption of sludge eps and cell membranes facilitating the release of solid organics into the liquid phase farno et al 2015 abelleira peraira et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 the soluble cod concentration with heat cao2 pretreatment heat of 67 41 c 18 97 h and 0 12 g cao2 g vss addition was 224 2 mg cod g vss which was higher than that of the case without pretreatment 12 2 mg cod g vss sole cao2 pretreatment 94 5 mg cod g vss and sole heat pretreatment 146 0 mg cod g vss meanwhile the most significant improvement in the activities of protease and acetate kinase involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis process was obtained in the presence of heat cao2 compared to sole heat and sole cao2 liu et al 2019 similar phenomena was observed in the inhibition of coenzyme f420 involved in methanogenesis the maximum scfa yield in heat cao2 process reached 336 5 mg cod g vss after 5 day of fermentation increasing 584 45 and 61 compared to the case without pretreatment sole heat and sole cao2 liu et al 2019 in addition to the potential benefits of scfa mentioned above heat cao2 pretreatment of was anaerobic fermentation can also improve sludge dewaterability and sludge reduction reducing the cost of subsequent sludge dewatering and final disposal yu et al 2018 the economic feasibility evaluation based on pilot scale 100 tons d of dewatered sludge with 80 water content indicated heat cao2 for was fermentation could generate a net profits of 38 69 usd ton when considering the various costs and incomes of fermentation as compared with the traditional sludge treatment paradigm yu et al 2018 fa a strong biocidal agent can inhibit the activity of methanogenic belmonte et al 2011 nakakubo et al 2008 when cao2 is combined with fa synergistic inhibition of methanogens activity is achieved which significantly reduces scfa consumption wang et al 2018b confirmed the feasibility of cao2 combined with fa pretreatment to increase scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation the presence of 0 05 g cao2 g vss and 180 fa mg l respectively reduced the relative activities of methanogens by 10 33 and 48 26 this inhibition was further extended to 72 40 in 0 05 g cao2 g vss 180 mg fa l process moreover cao2 combined with fa benefited the disruption of sludge eps and cell envelop leading to the soluble cod content increase to 6264 121 mg l wang et al 2018 the scfa yield with 0 05 g cao2 g vss 180 mg fa l pretreatment was improved by about 7 4 times compared to blank sludge without pretreatment while it were only enhanced by about 4 06 and 4 89 times with sole cao2 or sole fa pretreatment respectively wang et al 2018 fa could be in situ generated from fermentation liquor in wwtps zhang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 therefore this cao2 fa strategy not only can reduce the dosage of cao2 at a very low cost but also enhance scfa production and resource recovery from was generating potential economic benefits it was estimated by wang et al 2018 that this combination of cao2 and fa would save approximately 1 900 000 yearly in a wwtp q 105 m3 d compared to traditional wwtp operation modes apart from scfa hydrogen is also one of the important products of was anaerobic fermentation process wang et al 2019c as a clean energy source hydrogen can save fossil fuels with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions the generation of hydrogen from was dark fermentation has thereby also gained a huge amount of interest li et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 but like the production of scfa from was the production of hydrogen is also generally constrained by the low disintegration rate of was li et al 2020c besides hydrogen is easily consumed by methanogens homoacetogenic bacteria or sulfate reducing bacteria also causing low yield niu et al 2019 the hydrogen yield from was can be improved by cao2 addition through facilitating the disintegration of was and inhibiting hydrogen consumption wang et al 2019b revealed the influence of cao2 on hydrogen production from was the alkali oh and o2 generated in the process of cao2 decomposition accelerated the destruction of sludge cells wang et al 2009b li et al 2014b zhang et al 2015c the released ratios of soluble proteins increased from 1 02 0 19 to 16 06 1 1 when the cao2 dosage was increased from 0 to 0 25 g g vss wang et al 2019b accordingly more the released substrates could be utilized by hydrogen forming microorganisms with regard to hydrogen consumption process cao2 addition significantly inhibited the activities of hydrogen consuming microorganisms which were decreased by 56 52 and 73 91 in the presence of 0 1 and 0 2 g cao2 g vss wang et al 2019b all these contribute to the enhancement of hydrogen yield and the maximum yield of 10 55 ml g vss was achieved at cao2 dosage of 0 25 g g vss which was approximately 13 7 times higher than that from the case without pretreatment wang et al 2019b interestingly the promoting effect of alkali oh and o2 on was disintegration reflected by soluble cod content and vss reduction was corresponded with the tendency of their impact on the performance of dark fermentation the main contribution of cao2 decomposition products to hydrogen production is in turn alkali o2 and oh during sludge disintegration the conversion of sludge eps and intracellular organic matters into soluble organic matters can minimize sludge zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2019 therefore in addition to promoting the recovery of resource and energy i e scfa hydrogen and methane sludge minimization can be also obtained due to the enhancement of sludge disintegration or solubilization caused by alkaline and free radical oxidation when cao2 is applied to treat sludge during anaerobic digestion and fermentation the corresponding sludge minimization effects with cao2 treatment are concluded in table 4 5 the use of cao2 for improving the removal of contaminants in was with the rapid development of global industrialization and the continuous improvement of human living standards lots of ecs e g heavy metals organic contaminants and antibiotic resistance genes args are released into wastewater sun et al 2017 subedi et al 2014 su et al 2017 yang et al 2020 wwtps as a collection point of various kinds of wastewater are therefore considered as the main hotspot where ecs exist rosal et al 2010 traditional wwtps are mainly designed for the treatment of conventional pollutants e g easily degradable organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus and other inorganic substances and there is no specific unit for degrading ecs xu et al 2020 therefore in the process of wastewater treatment most of ecs cannot be effectively degraded but are mainly removed by activated sludge which could be attribute to the strong adsorption and relatively long sludge age resulting in substantial ecs to be concentrated and enriched in the was tran et al 2018 luo et al 2020b for instance cadmium a typical heavy metal nonylphenols a typical edcs and triclocarban a typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps contents in sludge were found to reach 1 mg g vss 200 mg kg tss and 50 mg kg tss chen et al 2008b duan et al 2016 wang et al 2019d however due to strong adsorption capacity of eps and the difficult biodegradability of the contaminants these toxic and harmful ecs are generally difficult to be effectively removed or degraded from sludge in the process of conventional sludge treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation wu et al 2017b golet et al 2003 wang et al 2017c for example liang et al 2020 found that the concentration of heavy metals as and pb in the liquid phase of sludge treated by pam was low which was only 0 0088 mg l and 0 0003 mg l higher than that of the undewatered sludge respectively in terms of the typical organic ecs norfloxacin and fluoxetine were demonstrated to be degraded by only 10 in the conventional was anaerobic digestion process low degradation rate 10 was also made on triclocarban during the was anaerobic fermentation golet et al 2003 zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2017c the residual ecs inevitably will be released into natural environment with the further disposal of was posing a huge potential risk to human health and the ecological environment muller et al 2010 therefore pertinent treatment is urgently needed to remove or degrade ecs from was before they enter the natural environment when cao2 treats was it can significantly improve the removal of heavy metals wu et al 2017b found that the transformation of heavy metals from the bound state to the free state was promoted with fe ii activated cao2 process under the condition of 0 0906 g g tss cao2 0 9969 mmol g tss fe2 and ph 5 59 organically bound plumbum pb copper cu and zinc zn as well as arsenic as were respectively removed by 68 3 54 9 31 8 and 31 2 while the corresponding soluble fractions increased from 10 4 4 9 12 0 and 0 to 30 27 5 250 7 and 13 6 respectively wu et al 2017b similar observation was also made in the cao2 treatment in the study of yuan et al 2020 after 60 min treatment of 1 cao2 the removal rates of pb zn and cu were 53 58 3 and 63 8 respectively the peroxidation induced by cao2 treatment decrease sludge eps conditional stability and molecular polarity by decomposing eps structure accordingly damaging the binding capacity of sludge eps with metal ions and facilitating the release of heavy metals from the sludge into the supernatant bouda et al 2009 guibaud et al 2012 this could provide convenient conditions for the further leached removal of heavy metals for example yuan et al 2020 found that when the supernatant was treated with 1 cao after oxidation with cao2 the removal rates of pb and zn exceeded 30 moreover as iii in sludge treated by fe ii activated cao2 was almost converted to as v reducing the toxicity of as wu et al 2017b martinson and reddy 2009 above results suggested that the potential risk of heavy metal in sludge could be efficiently mitigated using cao2 based treatment benefiting the further utilization and disposal of sludge edcs as a typical of persistent organic pollutant are demonstrated to potentially pose adverse influences on humans and wildlife wee and aris 2017 during the sludge treatment with cao2 the generated free radical as strong chemical oxidant can efficiently degrade edcs zhang et al 2015a found that cao2 oxidation dominated by oh radicals showed good removal performance for six edcs including estrone e1 17b estradiol e2 estriol e3 17a ethinylestradiol ee2 4 nonylphenols np and bisphenol a bpa more cao2 would generate more h2o2 and release more oh radicals eq 1 3 to oxidize edcs resulting in a dose dependent removal effect with increase of cao2 dosage from 0 034 to 0 66 g g tss the removal rates of above mentioned six edcs increased from 50 24 41 25 12 and 9 to 80 76 79 75 69 and 75 respectively meanwhile cao2 oxidation could effectively destroy phenol structures of edcs weakening estrogenic activities and mitigating potential risks zhang et al 2015a the abundant metal ions in was could have positive effect on the degradation of edcs during cao2 oxidation these metal ions e g fe cu and zn could participate in modified fenton reactions using cao2 for generating oh radicals eqs 6 14 improving edcs removal nam et al 2001 zhang and li 2014 in addition ph can affect the effect of cao2 oxidation on the one hand high ph could increases the electrostatic repulsion on the surface of sludge cells resulting in desorption of edcs from eps and accordingly increasing the contacts with cao2 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 on the other hand high ph could disrupt sludge eps and cell membranes and more intracellular material e g organic acids amino acids and hydroxamate siderophores which may function as chelating agents were released into supernatant xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a chelating agents were demonstrated to be effective in sustaining the chemical oxidation of contaminants by modified fenton chemistry utilizing cao2 ndjou ou and cassidy 2006 these chelating agents released under high ph conditions could therefore promote the production rate of oh radicals posing positive effects on the degradation of contaminants by cao2 oxidation zhang et al 2015a hence the better removal performance of edcs with cao2 was obtained at higher ph under condition of initial ph 12 the removal rates of e1 e2 e3 ee2 np and bpa after 7 d 0 66 g g tss of cao2 treatment respectively reached 99 91 93 86 83 and 89 zhang et al 2015a 13 cu h2o2 cu2 ho ho 14 zn h2o2 h zn2 ho h2o additionally cao2 can enhance the degradation of ppcps in was making up for the lack of biodegradation in the study of wang et al 2019b after 2 d cao2 pretreatment the levels of four ppcps in was including triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone significantly decreased as compared with the absence of cao2 pretreatment meanwhile the removal performance was also dosage dependent when the cao2 dosage increased from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the degradation rate of triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone increased to 37 8 34 5 32 9 and 19 6 and further increased to 57 4 52 3 55 0 and 37 8 when cao2 dosage at 0 26 g g vss was used wang et al 2019b above four ppcps were also demonstrated to inhibit the activities of microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion which inhibited methane production tang et al 2019 faberova et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 therefore the enhanced degradation of above ppcps could not only reduce their potential environmental risks but also mitigate their inhibitory effects on anaerobic microbes relevant to methane production improving methane yield from was anaerobic digestion wang et al 2019b moreover cao2 can be used in combination with other methods to remove ppcps and other organic contaminants from sludge zheng et al 2019 investigated the effect of medium pressure uv mp uv cao2 process in the removal of two ppcps i e carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd mp uv can activate h2o2 released from cao2 for accelerating the generation of oh eq 15 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 moreover the alkali generated by cao2 decomposition can improve the release of cbz and pmd from was through facilitating sludge solubilization which cause more cbz and pmd exposed to mp uv increasing mp uv utilization efficiency in mp uv cao2 process reactive radicals dominated by oh attacked both the olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring and two outside aromatic rings of cbz and both the pyrimidine ring and the aromatic ring of pmd hu et al 2009 tang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 after a series of hydroxylated and hydrolysis reactions refractory cbz and pmd were finally degraded into hydroxyacridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic oh or acridine ai and 4 hydroxyphenobarbital pbb 4oh respectively achieving the conversion of refractory organic contaminants into harmless small molecules biodegradable substances furthermore cao2 dosage and initial vss concentration can affect the removal performance under mp uv cao2 treatment the degradation efficiency of cbz and pmd increased with the increase of cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 2 g g vss under same irradiation time however further increasing the dosage of cao2 to 0 5 g g vss did not further significantly improve the degradation efficiency zheng et al 2019 excessive cao2 caused was to release more dissolved organic matter which could compete with cbz and pmd for limited uv light and oxidants retarding the increase of degradation rates qiu et al 2019 moreover oh cannot form linearly with the increase of cao2 under constant uv intensity more importantly higher ph value caused by the over addition of cao2 could accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 eq 16 resulting in lower level of oh eqs 17 20 and accordingly reducing its oxidation potential hence 0 2 g g vss of cao2 was regarded as the appropriate dosage to degrade cbz and pmd and 92 3 cbz degradation and 90 3 pmd degradation were achieved when in combination with 7 h mp uv irradiation zheng et al 2019 the increased vss concentration weakened uv irradiation due to the screening effect at the same time the increase in vss could release more dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions which may compete with target contaminants for free radicals generated by mp uv cao2 qiu et al 2019 above factors may lead to the increased concentration of vss suppressing the degradation of cbz and pmd in mp uv cao2 process zheng et al 2019 in addition to above cbz and pmd uv cao2 pretreatment can also effectively degrade many trace organic contaminants torcs in was it was reported that 19 of torcs including cbz i e acesulfame benzophenone n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet diclofenac diphenhydramine diltiazem fluoxetine gemfibrozil hydrochlorothiazide iohexol iopamidol iopromide meprobamate propranolol simazine sulfamethoxazole triclosan trimethoprim were with degradation efficiency 50 under the pretreatment of 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and uv 2 h which was only 11 species in uv 2 h pretreatment zheng et al 2021 in order to predict torcs attenuation under the pretreatment of uv cao2 zheng et al 2021 established a typical torcs photolysis model via uv direct and free reactive species frs indirect photolysis based on photochemical principals from schwarzenbach et al 2016 when cbz was selected as an indicator of refractory torcs the proposed predictive model expressed a good prediction with the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 at 0 94 and pearson product moment correlation coefficient pearson s r at 0 98 and all the differences between the predicted and measured degradation efficiency were less than 27 3 zheng et al 2021 us combined with cao2 has also obtained great results for removing refractory organic contaminants in sludge li et al 2019b found that the organic compound species and the total detection frequency of digested sludge supernatant determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were respectively 10 and 26 with the pretreatment of us 1 w ml 10 min cao2 0 1 g g vss which was much less than that of raw sludge 21 and 113 control sludge without any pretreatment 20 and 97 us 19 and 79 and cao2 15 and 48 this inferred that the potential refractory organic contaminants risk may be efficiently reduced under us cao2 treatment overall the mechanism of cao2 removing contaminants from was is presented in fig 4 table 5 summarizes the corresponding removal performance of contaminants using cao2 15 h2o2 hv 2 oh 16 2h2o2 2h2o o2 17 oh oh o h2o 18 oh o ho2 k 2

removal of args in was liu et al 2019 compared the effects of heat pretreatment 67 4 c 19 h cao2 pretreatment 0 12 g g vss and heat cao2 pretreatment on the fecal coliform a pathogen indicator the original fecal coliform was 4 8 log mpn g tss the fecal coliform content in the control sludge without any pretreatment increased to 7 3 log mpn g tss after 5 d of was anaerobic fermentation however the corresponding content in the sludge with sole heat pretreatment and sole cao2 pretreatment respectively decreased to 3 4 and 2 4 log mpn g tss when heat and cao2 were combined to pretreat sludge the fecal coliform content further reduced to 1 1 log mpn g tss liu et al 2019 the damage and lethal effect of the alkali and free radicals e g oh and o2 released from cao2 on sludge cells may be the main reason for inactivating pathogen in sludge wang et al 2019b moreover the presence of heat pretreatment can enhance the inactivation effect of sole cao2 pretreatment generating a synergistic effect the presence or residual of args in sludge has posed potential risks to the environment and human health huang et al 2016 cao2 decomposition products e g oh o2 and alkali were demonstrated to be effective in reducing args from wastewater and was respectively zhou et al 2020 huang et al 2017 in the study by yu et al 2020 the addition of cao2 reduced the abundance of args during bioelectrochemically assisted excess dewatered sludge anaerobic composting after 42 d composting as cao2 increased to 0 5 g g vss the total args abundance decreased from 1 2 1 7 10 1 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of the raw excess dewatered sludge to 2 9 3 2 10 2 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of 0 4 g cao2 g vss and 2 3 2 4 10 2 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of 0 5 g cao2 g vss similar attenuation was also observed in the abundance of some mobile genetic elements mges including plasmids insert sequences and integrons their abundances were lowest at the cao2 dose of 0 5 g cao2 g vss indicating that cao2 addition could affect the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args which might be one of the reasons for cao2 to promote the attenuation of args yu et al 2020 6 knowledge gaps and opportunities 6 1 improvement of sludge dewatering mechanism some mechanisms of cao2 affecting sludge dewatering are conflict with others and even speculative and remain to be investigated generally the increased concentration of lb eps is detrimental to the sludge dewatering because of hydrophilicity jin et al 2004 wu and chai 2016 found that this negative influence can be controlled in fe ii activated cao2 process through accelerating the degradation of lb eps while wu et al 2018b reported that the increased lb eps is conducive to sludge dewatering in fe doped sdmm activated cao2 cao2 fe sdmm process meanwhile the positive impact reported by wu et al 2018b is not supported by experimental data but only by citing references more studies are therefore required to clarify this contradictory conclusion moreover major contribution to enhanced dewaterability in fe ii activated cao2 process i e the reduction of hydrophilic functional groups in lb eps is inferred indirectly from the result of eem spectra rather than directly supported by functional group data to offer a better understanding more methods for directly analyzing functional groups of eps such as fourier transform infrared ftir spectra and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps should to be used finally due to fe ii and fe iii of alleviating electrostatic repulsions and compressing double electric layer whether iron species flocculation contributes to sludge dewatering in fe ii activated cao2 process should be also therefore clarified 6 2 effect of cao2 on methanogens in anaerobic digestion while cao2 sludge pretreatment is an effective method to recovery energy and resource from anaerobic digestion the effect of pretreatment on methanogens key microorganisms involved in methane production is insufficient generally the cao2 decomposition products e g oh and o2 and alkali were considered to be hostile to methanogens wang et al 2019a wang and li 2016 also found that mw cao2 pretreatment suppressed the activity of methanogens however the relative abundance of methanogens was increased with mw cao2 pretreatment wang and li 2016 therefore the detailed microorganism information in anaerobic sludge digestion system before and after cao2 pretreatment should be investigated which not only can cover the knowledge gap in biological mechanism of cao2 sludge pretreatment enhancing methane production but also reveal whether cao2 pretreatment caused the different effect on the activity and distribution of methanogens 6 3 potential contribution of cao2 decomposition products and solid cao2 adsorption to the sludge treatment processes the contribution of cao2 decomposition products including free radicals oxygen and alkali and solid cao2 adsorption to the sludge treatment processes has not been fully clarified and remains to be investigated previous study showed that small amounts of oxygen can enhance the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins due to the production of exoenzymes by aerobic microorganisms lim and wang 2013 however to date only limited studies have mentioned the potential role of oxygen among the many studies on the application of cao2 in the treatment of was and these reports are only simple discussions in conjunction with the literatures without experimental data support li et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b therefore the potential contribution of oxygen released from cao2 to sludge treatment processes including anaerobic digestion and fermentation still needs further experimental verification besides although studies have observed free radicals and alkali could promote was disintegration and inhibit the activity of methanogens in anaerobic digestion wang et al 2019a 2019b yuan et al 2006 their real contribution based on comprehensive consideration of positive effect and negative effect methane production remains indistinct more studies are therefore required to investigate the major contributor of cao2 pretreatment enhancing methane production furthermore while studies have observed that cao2 nanoparticles can be used as an adsorbent for the removal of organic contaminants and heavy metals from aqueous solution madan et al 2016 massalimov et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b no relevant studies have been reported in the removal of contaminants from sludge whether the adsorption effects of solid cao2 affects the removal of ecs in the sludge remains indistinct further investigations are needed to clarify the potential contribution of the adsorption effects of solid cao2 to the contaminants removal which will provide a more comprehensive explanation for cao2 improving the ecs removal from sludge 6 4 comprehensive evaluation of economic and ecological benefits in pilot scale trial in addition to the use of thermo cao2 in anaerobic sludge fermentation system other cao2 research were all carried out in laboratories some limitations of lab scale research should be recognized in lab scale anaerobic digester or fermenter operation with cao2 based method treated sludge although real sludge obtained from wwtps was employed the small volumes of treatment and anaerobic reactors may not represent larger scale trial because that the difference of hydraulic dynamics between lab scale reactors and larger scale reactors could lead to different mass transfer and the effectiveness of cao2 based sludge treatment therefore current estimated economic analysis according to laboratory results may not be convincing moreover most of the current studies on cao2 promoting the removal of ecs are carried out separately according to the contaminants category in addition to the reported ecs cao2 also has the potential to enhance the removal of other common contaminants in sludge theses research gaps that need to be filled inevitably leads to incomplete evaluation of the ecological benefits of cao2 in reducing the risk of ecs therefore the comprehensive evaluation of economic and ecological benefits in pilot scale trial is still required to fully reveal the feasibility of cao2 based methods before it full scale applications 6 5 intrinsic limitations and opportunities there are certain limitations in cao2 based sludge treatment and the combination with other methods may be a promising solution for example the addition of low dosage cao2 assisted sludge dewatering is not expected to improve srf to meet the standard of good dewaterability because of the limited enhancement to eps disintegration research demonstrated utilizing fe ii activate low dosage cao2 significantly enhanced the disintegration of eps and accordingly improved sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017b moreover while cao2 and its combined methods e g us cao2 mw cao2 mp uv cao2 has been used to pretreat was to promote recycling of resource and energy methane scfa and hydrogen and risk mitigation anaerobic digestion and fermentation it inevitably consumes substantial chemicals and energy which inevitably reduces the potential economic benefits achieved by cao2 based sludge treatment in this regard cao2 combination with other low cost and in situ methods e g free nitrous acid fna and fa seems to be nice option study has explored the possibility of using lower dosage cao2 in combination with fa to achieve enhanced scfa production performance similar to higher dosage cao2 alone wang et al 2018 therefore more research could be performed in this direction in the future 7 conclusions this review covers recent studies of applying cao2 in improving the treatment of was in cao2 based treatment the generated free radicals and alkali from cao2 decomposition play an important role in sludge treatment the main conclusions are as follows in sludge dewatering the radical oxidation can destroy structures of sludge floc and highly hydrated eps promoting the release of interstitial water from sludge in anaerobic digestion the free radicals and alkali not only can accelerate the disruption of eps and cell membrane but also degrade non biodegradable organic matters in sludge providing more biodegradable substances for improving methane production in anaerobic fermentation the alkaline condition and oxidative environment can increase organic matters supply and utilization efficiency for the producers of scfa and hydrogen while suppress the consumption of scfa and hydrogen thereby enhancing the accumulation of scfa and hydrogen from was in the process of cao2 enhancing anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation more organic matters in the was solid phase is released into the supernatant therefore sludge minimization is also promoted the oh and alkali can damage the binding capacity of sludge eps with ecs via the destruction of eps structure thus transiting bound ecs into a free state for further removal the strong oxidative oh can effectively degrade organic ecs and inactivate pathogens and remove args in sludge although significant progresses have been made in recent years it should be recognized that there are still some knowledge gaps to be investigated for the application of cao2 based sludge treatment 1 more comprehensive sludge dewatering mechanism 2 microbiological insight on

17473,the treatment and disposal of waste activated sludge was has become one of the major challenges for the wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to large output high treatment costs and enriched substantial emerging contaminants ecs therefore reducing sludge volume recovering energy and resource from was and removing ecs and decreasing environmental risk have gained increasing attentions calcium peroxide cao2 a versatile and safe peroxide has been widely applied in terms of was treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic sludge fermentation due to its specific properties such as generating free radicals and alkali etc providing supports for sludge reduction recycling and risk mitigation this review outlines comprehensively the recent progresses and breakthroughs of cao2 in the fields of sludge treatment in particular the relevant mechanisms of cao2 enhancing was dewaterability methane production from anaerobic digestion short chain fatty acids scfa and hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation and the removal of ecs in was and role of experiment parameters are systematically elucidated and discussed respectively finally the knowledge gaps and opportunities in cao2 based sludge treatment technologies that need to be focused in the future are prospected the review presented can supply a theoretical basis and technical reference for the application of cao2 for improving the treatment of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge calcium peroxide sludge treatment extracellular polymeric substances resource recovery risk mitigation 1 introduction activated sludge process effective to clean wastewater has been widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps ping et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 however this biological process is inevitably accompanied by the generation of huge quantities of by product i e waste activated sludge was zhang et al 2020a generally was has a high water content more than 95 which is inconvenient for further treatment transportation and final disposal he et al 2015 at the same time with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization the influent quality of sewage treatment plants is becoming more and more complicated considerable toxic and harmful emerging contaminants ecs e g endocrine disrupting compounds edcs norfloxacin triclocarban and heavy metals therefore is concentrated into was duan et al 2016 cheng et al 2014 xu et al 2017 these contaminants pose a huge potential environmental risk if was is not handled properly appels et al 2008 liu et al 2019 consequently the treatment and disposal of was has become a global public challenge wu et al 2017a wu et al 2019a on the other hand was as a heterogeneous and colloidal complex also contains considerable and abundant organics such as proteins and carbohydrates luo et al 2018 with the growing crisis of energy and resources worldwide it has been recognized that was is not just waste but a vast reservoir of renewable resource which should be reutilized to recover resource and energy dai et al 2015 wei et al 2017a luo et al 2019 as a result numerous researchers and engineers have conducted extensive research on the treatment of was yuan et al 2019 currently several technologies such as sludge dewatering anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation have been widely investigated and accepted as effective methods for sludge treatment during which sludge reduction contaminants removal or conversion of organics matter into high value added products can be realized xiao et al 2016 wei et al 2017b ni et al 2019 however due to the difficulty of disintegrating was and shortcomings of these treatment technologies such as inability to effectively remove ecs above technologies are usually difficult to obtain satisfactory performance of sludge treatment and ecs removal saveyn et al 2008 czajka and londry 2006 xu et al 2019 in order to improve the treatment of was before it final disposal many treatment methods e g chemical treatment physical treatment and biological treatment have been applied in sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic sludge fermentation li et al 2020a wang 2017a liu et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 among these methods advanced oxidation processes aops treatment that belongs to chemical treatment not only can achieve excellent sludge reduction and recycle of organics matter but also better enhance recalcitrant ecs removal and risk mitigation thus it has attracted a lot of attentions li et al 2020b yang et al 2019 zhang and li 2014 calcium peroxide cao2 a good thermal stability versatile and environmental friendliness inorganic peroxides is identified as an effective solid source of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ma et al 2007 massalimov et al 2010 cao2 has high energy peroxide covalent bond ma et al 2007 on the other hand it can slowly liberate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 o2 and ca oh 2 at a controlled rate when contacting with hydrous medium detailed as shown in eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2015 thani et al 2016 during which h2o2 can further generate free radicals including oh ho2 and o2 see eqs 3 5 for details zhang et al 2015a due to this stable oxidation capability cao2 as a new additive for sludge pretreatment has been used in different kinds of sludge treatment processes chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 wang and li 2016 wang et al 2019a 1 cao2 2h2o ca oh 2 h2o2 2 2cao2 2h2o 2ca oh 2 o2 3 h2o2 e oh oh 4 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 5 ho2 o2 h for sludge dewatering the released free radicals from cao2 induce the disruption of sludge colloidal flocs which facilitate the release of interstitial water from sludge meanwhile the generated oh can reduce the hydrophilic functional groups in extracellular polymeric substances eps contributing to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability wu and chai 2016 in anaerobic sludge digestion although cao2 reaction residues suppress the activity of the hydrolytic microbes acidogenesis microbes and methanogens related to anaerobic digestion to some extents the generated ca oh 2 oh and o2 not only can facilitate the release of biodegradable substances e g proteins and polysaccharides via enhancing sludge disintegration but also promote the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics e g humus and lignocellulose into degradable organics thus supplying more soluble biodegradable organics for anaerobic digestion and enhancing methane production wang et al 2019a when cao2 is added to anaerobic fermentation of sludge cao2 induced alkaline conditions and oxidation accelerate the solubilization of sludge simultaneously cao2 addition improves the activities and abundance of hydrolytic microbes and acidogenesis microbes therefore the microbes can utilize the abundant soluble organics to produce more short chain fatty acids scfa additionally the consumption of scfa i e methanogenesis process is significantly inhibited resulting in the accumulation of scfa and further improving the yield of scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 in addition to scfa cao2 addition also can promote hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge the presence of cao2 not only provides more biodegradable organic matter for bio process of hydrogen production but also severely inhibits the bio process of hydrogen consumption thereby increasing the accumulative hydrogen production wang et al 2019b apart from above mentioned benefits it has been found that the removal performance of ecs in the sludge can also be improved when cao2 is applied to the treatment of sludge zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2017b the cao2 induced peroxidation can damage the binding of eps to metal ions promoting the release of sludge borne heavy metals into aqueous phase and increasing its soluble fractions wu et al 2017b it is conducive to remove heavy metals from sludge before final disposal of sludge moreover the generated free radicals during the cao2 oxidation can effectively remove recalcitrant organic ecs from was and efficiently inactivate pathogen combined with alkaline action zhang et al 2015a liu et al 2019 in recent years there is an increasing attention to the research of different sludge treatment methods based on cao2 chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 wang and li 2016 nevertheless there is still a lack of comprehensive summary of the key advances in cao2 based sludge treatment technologies herein this review article firstly concludes the current researches of cao2 in improving sludge treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic sludge digestion anaerobic sludge fermentation and recalcitrant contaminants removal meanwhile relevant mechanisms of above applied processes are systematically discussed furthermore the outlook for current research gaps and future investigation in cao2 based sludge treatment is also proposed this review would provide theoretical basis and technical guide to some extent for the potential engineering applications of cao2 for improving sludge treatments in the future 2 the use of cao2 for improving was dewatering the tremendous volume of sludge posed severe challenge for its further treatment and disposal wu et al 2018a to reduce the volume sludge dewatering process has been widely applied in wwtps jin et al 2014 yang et al 2015 however eps in sludge feature high hydration and negative charge making the sludge to bind large amounts of water within the sludge flocs which greatly increases the difficulty of separating bio colloids and liquids from sludge christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 conventional mechanical dewatering method extensively used at present cannot effectively release bound water from sludge flocs due to the difficulty to destroy the binding effect of eps and water thereby achieving the unsatisfactory sludge reduction zhen et al 2013 guan et al 2012 besides with regard to the pressure filtration process of sludge the high compressibility of sludge also results in the low permeability of the formed sludge cake which blocks filtration media thereby hindering the bound water removal and deteriorating the dewatering the performance qi et al 2011 therefore sludge dewatering is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks for the complete sludge treatment and disposal process wu et al 2020 cao2 and its combined methods can induce the enhancement of sludge dewaterability the radical oxidation induced by cao2 and the activated method based on cao2 can effectively promote the disruption of sludge floc structure resulting in the transformation of interstitial water trapped inside the floc into free water chen et al 2016 boran et al 2017 besides the released oh can not only enhance the solubilization of eps from the tightly bound tb layers to the loosely bound lb and soluble layers but also oxidize and remove the hydrophilic functional groups in eps reducing the binding water capacity of eps wu et al 2017b moreover the binding affinity of the released ca2 to eps compressed the electric double layer of sludge transforming interfacial water into free water wu and chai 2016 all of the above acts to reduce the water holding capacity of sludge colloid promoting the sludge dewaterability mechanism of improving sludge dewaterability by cao2 based methods is presented in fig 1 and the corresponding dewatering performance are concluded in table 1 the enhancement of sludge dewaterability using sole cao2 treatment is limited which is mainly related to the oxidizability of cao2 chen et al 2016 investigated the influence of cao2 treatment on sludge filtration performance srf that is one of the important indicators for evaluating sludge dewaterability the srf value decreased firstly and then rose with the increase of cao2 dosage and the optimal filtration performance was observed in the presence of 20 mg cao2 g tss with srf reduction of 16 34 table 1 at lower dosages the absence of oxidation can t effectively destroy sludge floc to improve filtration performance and excessive oxidizability induced by higher dosages can increase protein like substances content in soluble eps seps and lb eps deteriorating the filtration performance zhang et al 2015b moreover the srf value of the optimal performance still can t reach standard of good dewaterability 0 4 1012 cm g boran et al 2017 also found that 10 mg g tss cao2 under the ph of 5 only reduced srf by 12 1 therefore in the sludge dewatering cao2 is often used as a as a peroxidant activated application or pre oxidation combined with other methods wu et al 2018b chen et al 2016 cao2 activated by ferrous ions fe ii works well in improving sludge dewatering wu and chai 2016 investigated the influence of fe ii activated cao2 on sludge dewatering the srf decreased from 2 29 1012 cm g to 1 69 1011 cm g at initial ph 2 with 0 625 mmol g tss of fe ii and 0 05 g g tss cao2 meanwhile capillary suction time cst another important indicator for evaluating sludge dewaterability showed a similar trend with 85 7 reduction cao2 is first dissolved in water for producing h2o2 eq 1 then the coexisting fe ii and h2o2 can initiate a series of reactions as described by eqs 6 12 for producing oh ho2 and o2 pignatello et al 2006 the generated radicals among which the dominant role is oh not only disrupt the sludge flocs but also reduce hydrophilic functional groups of lb eps facilitating the release of interstitial water and enhancing dewatering of sludge wu et al 2017b guibaud et al 2012 an interesting phenomenon deserves our attention although fe ii activated cao2 treatment also increased the protein like substances content in seps and lb eps like cao2 treatment alone no deterioration in dewatering performance was observed chen et al 2016 wu and chai 2016 excitation emission matrix eem spectra of eps fractions showed that a blue shift in the emission wavelength was observed in the lb eps with fe ii activated cao2 treatment compared with raw sludge fig s1 which indicated the oxidation induced by fe ii activated cao2 could eliminate the specific hydrophilic groups of lb eps e g carbonyl hydroxyl and amine groups and reduce the number of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in the chain structure wang et al 2009a liu et al 2011 thereby eliminating the deterioration of the dewatering performance caused by the increased lb eps and improving sludge dewaterability moreover the variation of ph values can affect the sludge dewaterability using fe ii activated cao2 it was reported that the cst and srf increased rapidly as the initial ph increased from 2 to 6 indicating that the dewatering performance was deteriorated at higher initial ph values wu and chai 2016 this could be due to that the production of h2o2 was restrained by the slower dissolution rate of cao2 at higher initial ph values olyaie et al 2012 resulting in less generation of the oh radical which therefore cannot effectively reduce the cst and srf 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 7 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 8 ho2 o2 h pk a 4 8 9 o2 fe3 fe2 o2 10 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 11 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 12 ho2 h2o2 oh h2o o2 the combination of filter aids and cao2 is also considered as a useful method for assisting sludge dewatering after addition of filter aids cao2 could be catalyzed for producing oh which can destroy the sludge floc structure and reduce the content of hydrophilic protein in tb eps eliminating the water holding capacity of sludge and accordingly enhancing sludge dewatering boran et al 2017 wu et al 2018a moreover the porous structure of the filter aid play the role of draining medium improving interstitial water removal qi et al 2011 boran et al 2017 investigated the influence of montmorillonite supported nano cao2 on sludge dewaterability 0 1 g montmorillonite g tss and 10 mg cao2 g tss reduced srf by about 40 and 12 1 respectively when the combination of 0 1 g montmorillonite g tss and 3 33 mg cao2 g tss i e 0 1 g g tss montmorillonite nano cao2 was used to treat sludge 62 2 reductions of srf was obtained when the dosage of montmorillonite nano cao2 increased to 0 5 g g tss the srf further decrease to 8 47 1011 cm g achieving the maximal srf reduction of 70 1 the dewatered sludge itself can also act as a filter aid after proper modification wu et al 2018b developed a fe doped sludge derived mesoporous material sdmm which was modified using the combination of h2so4 hno3 and thermal reflux method and accordingly used as the template to load cao2 for sludge dewatering as a result the srf decreased distinctly by 64 1 when 0 5 g g tss sdmm and 0 5 g g tss cao2 supported on fe doped sdmm were combined to pretreat sludge the enhancement of sludge dewatering can be attributed to the combined effect of filtration aid and peroxidation wu et al 2018b inorganic coagulants and flocculants have been extensively used in improving the dewatering performance of sludge because they can rapidly increase the sludge floc size through bridging and charge neutralization and then strip the water in the sludge through double electric layer compression improving the stability and dewaterability of sludge higgins and novak 1997 cheng et al 2012 therefore the influences of inorganic coagulants or flocculants in combination with cao2 pre oxidation on sludge dewatering have been studied chen et al 2016 reported that the sludge dewatering performance was significantly improved using cao2 in combination with inorganic coagulants e g polyaluminium chloride pacl ferric iron fecl3 and flocculant e g polyacrylamide pam compared with sole cao2 inorganic coagulants and flocculant addition when cao2 pre oxidation was combined with 15 mg g tss pacl 15 mg g tss fecl3 and 15 mg g tss pam the srf value significantly decreased to 3 55 1012 4 36 1012 and 2 75 1012 m kg respectively therefore srf reduction respectively reached 76 78 cao2 pacl 71 50 cao2 fecl3 and 98 20 cao2 pam table 1 meanwhile the water content wc one of the important indicators for evaluating sludge dewaterability was respectively decreased from 98 30 of raw sludge to 79 46 79 27 and 81 32 on the one hand cao2 oxidation facilitated the transformation from bound water to free water making it easier to remove from sludge flocs neyens et al 2004 moreover pacl and fecl3 can enhance density of sludge flocs benefiting the removal of free water in sludge eps through double electric layer compression niu et al 2013 meanwhile the hydrolyzate of pacl and fecl3 can be used as a framework builder to reconstruct the sludge floc enhancing the floc strength and reducing the compressibility of the sludge chen et al 2016 with regard to pam it can make sludge flocs larger but loose with good settling performance via bridging and sweeping wong et al 2006 all above these make the combination of cao2 pre oxidation and inorganic coagulants or flocculant pose a positive effect on improving the sludge dewaterability chen et al 2016 in addition thermo also have a positive effect in assisting cao2 for sludge dewatering yu et al 2018 found that wc was decreased from 85 2 1 4 of raw sludge to 63 4 4 4 after thermo cao2 pretreatment this could be due to that divalent ions such as calcium generated by thermo cao2 can bridge the negatively charged sites on the eps thus promoting the transfer of water wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2018 3 the use of cao2 for improving anaerobic digestion of was anaerobic digestion is considered to be an effective energy recovery of sludge and pollution control technology during which biodegradable organic matters of sludge are mainly utilized to produce methane and large amount of pathogens are inactivated liu et al 2020a therefore the stabilization and reduction of sludge are achieved however the methane production from anaerobic digestion of was are generally restricted by the following two main factors the first one is low disintegration rates of was due to protection of sludge eps and cell membranes resulting in low release and utilization of abundant organics in the was which is known as a typical rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion wang et al 2013 he et al 2018a the second one is that the substantial non biodegradable organic matters in sludge e g humus and lignocellulose accounting for 20 50 of the total sludge organics can t be effectively utilized and among of them such as humic acid is demonstrated to suppress the production of methane li et al 2014a hu et al 2016 li et al 2019a all above these caused unsatisfied methane yield from conventional anaerobic digestion of was accordingly not achieving efficient resource utilization from sludge in order to promote the production of methane cao2 has been introduced into anaerobic digestion as a was pretreatment method the generated oh and o2 from cao2 decomposition enhances the disruption of eps and cell membrane facilitating the transfer of tb eps to seps and the release of intracellular organic matters to the extracellular ping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 therefore large quality of organics such as proteins and polysaccharides are released from solid phase of sludge into liquid phase meanwhile substantial alkali produced by the decomposition of cao2 is also conducive to sludge disintegration wang et al 2019b the enhancement of was disintegration induced by oh o2 and alkali can provide more soluble organics for subsequent process relevant to methane production which is one reason why cao2 pretreatment increases the yield of methane from anaerobic digestion of was wang et al 2019a moreover cao2 pretreatment can enhance the cleavage of unsaturated conjugated bonds and reduce the aromaticity of humus and lignocellulose thereby promoting the degradation of humus and lignocellulose and providing more biodegradable substances for microorganism responsible for producing methane which is another reason that the increased methane yield is achieved with cao2 pretreatment wang et al 2019a mechanism of enhancing methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion by cao2 is illustrated in fig 2 the effects of cao2 and its combined methods in anaerobic digestion are summarized in table 2 wang et al 2019a explored the influences of cao2 on anaerobic digestion of was after 2 d pretreatment the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod concentration of was increased from 1600 to 3400 mg l with an increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g volatile suspended solids vss meanwhile both contents of humus including humic acid fulvic acid and humin and lignocellulose including lignin cellulose and hemicellulose in the sludge with cao2 pretreatment were lower than that sludge without cao2 pretreatment the presence of cao2 destroyed substantially benzene ring and c c bond of humus and lignocellulose degraded part of humus and lignocellulose into organics with small molecule weights and accordingly improving the biodegradability of the released organics wang et al 2019a as a result cao2 pretreatment provided organic matters with high content and high biodegradability for methanogenic microbes the yield of methane from was increased to 215 9 ml g vss with 0 14 g g vss cao2 pretreatment after 14 d digestion which was 1 3 times that was without cao2 pretreatment wang et al 2019a in the research of li et al 2019b 0 1 g g vss cao2 pretreatment increased the scod in the was to 1693 2 77 mg l which was only 708 9 37 mg l without cao2 pretreatment under this condition the methane yield was increased from 156 09 to 175 84 ml g vss after 36 d digestion however the dosage of cao2 pretreatment should be controlled although high dosage of cao2 provided more biodegradable substrates for anaerobic digestion the residual free radicals such as oh and o2 inevitably entered into anaerobic digestion system and then significantly suppressed the activities of microorganisms relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes because strong oxidative properties of free radicals could inactivate microorganisms thereby inhibiting the production of methane from was wang et al 2019a tokumura et al 2009 according to the study of wang et al 2019a the improvement of methane production from was using 0 26 g g vss cao2 pretreatment declined compared with 0 14 g g vss cao2 pretreatment furthermore the methane production from was was more strongly suppressed without adjusting ph after cao2 pretreatment resulting in reduced methane yield ping et al 2018 reported that the methane yield from was in the presence of 0 2 g g vss cao2 addition was significantly lower than that in the absence of cao2 addition at different temperature and no methane was even produced at ambient temperature table 2 this is because in addition to the above mentioned free radicals the high alkaline ph 9 generated by cao2 addition also severely inhibits the activity of methanogens which are sensitive to external environmental factors such as ph and could only maintain good activity only under neutral ph conditions yuan et al 2006 ping et al 2018 ultrasonic us microwave mw and ultraviolet light uv combined with cao2 pretreatment have also been demonstrated to promote methane production from anaerobic digestion of was in us cao2 process instantaneous high temperature and high pressure generated by us accelerated cao2 decomposition to produce h2o2 which could generate more free radicals such as oh and o2 under us irradiation zhang et al 2011 strong oxidative of free radicals accelerated and facilitated disruption of sludge eps and cell membrane eswari et al 2016 therefore was disintegration rate was improved thus providing more substrates for enhancing anaerobic digestion efficacy li et al 2019b compared the influences of us cao2 and us cao2 pretreatment on the methane production from anaerobic digestion of was after sole pretreatment of us 1 w ml 10 min and cao2 0 1 g g vss the concentration of scod in was increased to 1693 2 77 and 1782 1 87 mg l which was only 708 9 37 mg l in the was without any pretreatment when us cao2 was applied to pretreat was the concentration of scod in was reached 3014 8 116 mg l increasing 78 and 69 compared to sole us and cao2pretreatment respectively under this condition 211 90 8 6 ml g vss of methane was obtained in us cao2 pretreatment after 36 d digestion which was respectively improved by 36 26 and 19 compared to the original sludge without pretreatment us and cao2 li et al 2019b hence a synergistic effect on the biochemical methane potential occurred when the combination of us and cao2 was conducted to pretreat was similar phenomenon was also observed in the mw cao2 and uv cao2 processes research by wang and li showed that mw irradiation facilitated the o2 generation from cao2 more oxidizing agent were therefore used to promote the solubilization of was eskicioglu et al 2008 wang and li 2016 the scod concentration in mw cao2 process 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and mw 480 w 2 min reached 5002 120 mg l which were respectively 1002 78 2800 201 and 2730 134 mg l in the was without pretreatment with cao2 pretreatment and with mw pretreatment wang and li 2016 the methane production after mw cao2 pretreatment was significantly improved by 80 2 compared to blank sludge without pretreatment while it was enhanced by only 23 9 after mw pretreatment and inhibited after cao2 pretreatment in addition to the enhancement of was disintegration the activities of enzymes responsible for hydrolytic i e protease and α amylase and acid forming i e phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase and the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea relevant to acetate utilization and h2 co2 utilization were all improved after a lag period wang and li 2016 therefore enhancing methane production from was anaerobic digestion in mw cao2 process could attribute to its induced synergistic effect of chemical and biological both of uv and cao2 pretreatment could destroy the sludge flocs and cells and accelerate the solubilization of was promoting the release of extracellular and intercellular organics from sludge into the aqueous phase wang and li 2016 when uv and cao2 was combined the was disintegration and dissolution was further enhanced thereby more soluble organics were released and provided for anaerobic methane production zheng et al 2021 as a result the methane production in uv cao2 pretreatment 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and uv 2 h was greater than that under other conditions including control without any pretratment sole uv 2h and sole cao2 0 1 g g vss pretreatments furthermore the final increase in methane production by uv cao2 pretreatment was higher than the sum of sole uv and sole cao2 pretreatments which suggested that uv cao2 pretreatment showed a synergistic effect in was anaerobic digestion in addition the final increase in methane production by uv cao2 pretreatment was also greater than that of the sum of sole uv sole cao2 decomposition i e ca oh 2 and h2o2 and the sum of their combinations i e uv ca oh 2 uv h2o2 indicating a comprehensive synergy of ca oh 2 h2o2 and uv during uv cao2 pretreatment zheng et al 2021 4 the use of cao2 for improving anaerobic fermentation of was apart from the treatment and disposal of was many wwtps such as in southern china hungary and warsaw poland also face the problem of insufficient influent carbon source oleszkiewicz et al 2004 he et al 2016 wang et al 2017b weinpel et al 2018 hence extra carbon sources e g sodium acetate glucose alcohol and glycerol are normally replenished into the influent to meet the needs of wastewater biological nutrient removal guerrero et al 2012 tang et al 2018 although this method is beneficial for maintaining the performance of nutrient removal it will inevitably increase the operating cost of wwtps posing a significant challenge to its long term operation he et al 2018b zhang et al 2018b recently was anaerobic fermentation has gained enormous interest because the generated scfa not only could make up for the shortage of influent carbon source but also could be used to produce high value product i e biodegradable plastic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha jiang et al 2009 li et al 2011 both carbon source in situ production in wwtps and resource and energy recovery from was could be realized via anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2020b he et al 2019 however substantial organic matters in was can t be effectively released for scfa production and the produced scfa can be rapidly consumed by methanogenic archaea which together leads to low scfa yield from was chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2017 cao2 addition can significantly enhance the production of scfa from was anaerobic fermentation long period of alkaline condition produced by cao2 continuously facilitate the disruption of was structure including eps and cell membranes which can be further solubilized by the generated oxidative environment from cao2 li et al 2011 sheng et al 2020 this synergistic chemical effect promotes the release of organics present in the solid phase of the was into the liquid phase more substrates could be therefore utilized by microorganisms responsible for scfa production li et al 2015 furthermore chemical conditions generated from cao2 not only promotes the activities of key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis but also increased the relative abundances of corresponding microorganisms facilitating the metabolism of organic matters to produce scfa ping et al 2020 however the presence of cao2 significantly inhibits the activity of methanogens and decreases the abundances of scfa consumers i e methanogens reducing the consumption of scfa and accordingly enhancing the accumulation of scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 both chemical and biological effects induced by cao2 contribute to the improvement of scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation thereby recycling available resources from was mechanism of promoting scfa production from was anaerobic fermentation with cao2 addition is displayed in fig 3 the effects of cao2 on anaerobic fermentation are concluded in table 3 li et al 2015 firstly applied cao2 to was anaerobic fermentation after cao2 addition ca oh 2 oh and o2 are released from the decomposition of cao2 eqs 1 5 ca oh 2 can notably promote the disruption of sludge cells li et al 2014b meanwhile oh and o2 as strong chemical oxidant could attack sludge eps and cell membranes wang et al 2009b zhang et al 2015c consequently the maximum scod content in sludge without cao2 was 1890 72 mg l within the first 4 days while it increased to 4193 28 mg l with addition of 0 2 cao2 g g vss and the corresponding vss reduction increased from 22 0 to 49 2 li et al 2015 therefore more substrates could be utilized in acidogenesis process to generate scfa the scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation increased from 58 to 284 mg cod g vss as the cao2 dosage increase from 0 to 0 2 g g vss li et al 2015 biological effects also play an important role in the enhancement of scfa production by cao2 the relative activities of key enzymes involved in scfa production including protease α amylase acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase butyrate kinase phosphotransbutyrylase and oxaloacetate transcarboxylase as well as coa transferase were all enhanced when using 0 2 cao2 g g vss in anaerobic fermentation thus obviously promoting pathways relevant to hydrolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis e g amino acid metabolism citrate cycle fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation as well as glycolysis similar improvement was also made on the distributions of microorganisms in the anaerobic fermentation responsible for organic compounds hydrolysis and acid generation li et al 2015 ping et al 2020 in anaerobic fermentation the generated scfa can be further utilized for methane production by methanogens preventing the effective accumulation of scfa wu et al 2019b luo et al 2020a the addition of 0 1 g g vss of cao2 decreased the activity of coenzyme f420 to 34 of that in the control test without cao2 addition when cao2 addition increased to 0 2 g g vss the relative activities of coenzyme f420 were further inhibited by 93 moreover the abundances of phylum euryarchaeota to which methanogens belong in the presence of 0 2 g cao2 g vss decreased by 38 9 li et al 2015 above results indicated that the presence of cao2 addition significantly inhibited the activity of coenzyme f420 associated with methanogenesis and decreased the distribution of methanogens which was due to that methanogens had poor tolerance to alkaline and other extreme conditions such as oxidative environment li et al 2015 chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019a hence less scfa were consumed to produce methane in the presence of cao2 and methane yield decreased with an increase in the cao2 dosage thereby accumulating more scfa li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 because of the quick reaction rate of cao2 in aqueous solution the effective time of cao2 enhancing scfa production was very limited zhang et al 2020b found that steel slag premodified with salicylic acid methanol sam ss can cooperate with cao2 for prolonging the effect of cao2 on improvement of scfa production in sam ss cao2 process 0 3 g g vss of cao2 and 0 714 g g vss of sam ss stronger intensity of oh and longer period of alkalinity are generated due to the slow release and synergetic reaction between cao2 and sam ss which leads to stronger and more durable inhibition of the activities of some scfa consuming bacteria zhang et al 2020b as a result the concentration of scfa in the presence of sam ss cao2 was maintained above 1000 mg l in 9 days by contrast in the test of cao2 the concentration of scfa gradually decreased from the 3rd day and to 285 mg l on the 10th day a similar phenomenon was also observed in the concentration of acetic acid that can be utilized for methane production by methanogens in the cao2 test the acetic acid concentration began to drop from 5th day however the concentration of acetic acid in the sam ss cao2 test continuously increased and maintained for a longer time to the 9th day zhang et al 2020b nevertheless the dosage of cao2 used in was anaerobic fermentation should be controlled within the appropriate range li et al 2015 found that cao2 addition at 0 3 g g vss almost completely suppressed scfa production from was compared with the promotion effect at cao2 dosage of 0 2 g g vss resulting in scfa concentration below 10 mg cod g vss which was even lower than the case without cao2 addition this is mainly due to that too high dosage of cao2 e g 0 3 g g vss kills most microbial cells significantly inhibiting microbial activity such as the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and acid forming enzymes responsible for scfa production li et al 2015 moreover fermentation temperature also affects the role of cao2 in promoting scfa production from was in the research of ping et al 2018 the production of scfa was significantly enhanced with 0 2 g cao2 g vss addition at both 25 c and 35 c however cao2 addition inhibited the production of scfa within the first 6 days when the temperature further increased to 55 c and the corresponding maximum scfa concentration was lower than the sample at 55 c in the absence of cao2 both high temperature and high ph generated by adding cao2 at 55 c could cause the accumulation of free ammonia fa with the maximal concentration being 823 mg l within the first 6 days lübken et al 2015 ping et al 2018 fa at ppm level has been demonstrated to exert a strong biocidal effect on a wide range of microorganisms involved in was treatment chen et al 2008a dai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a therefore cao2 addition at fermentation temperature of 55 c inhibited scfa production due to the enhanced toxicity induced by high concentration of fa although cao2 has a great contribution to promoting scfa production the dosage of cao2 used under optimal condition is high such as 0 2 g g vss which inevitably generates high operating cost and accordingly obstacle large scale application in real wwtps to reduce the dosage of cao2 while maintaining the effect of enhancing scfa production some economic and sustainable methods were introduced to in combination with cao2 in heat cao2 process the combined effect of heat alkali oh and h2o2 accelerated the disruption of sludge eps and cell membranes facilitating the release of solid organics into the liquid phase farno et al 2015 abelleira peraira et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 the soluble cod concentration with heat cao2 pretreatment heat of 67 41 c 18 97 h and 0 12 g cao2 g vss addition was 224 2 mg cod g vss which was higher than that of the case without pretreatment 12 2 mg cod g vss sole cao2 pretreatment 94 5 mg cod g vss and sole heat pretreatment 146 0 mg cod g vss meanwhile the most significant improvement in the activities of protease and acetate kinase involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis process was obtained in the presence of heat cao2 compared to sole heat and sole cao2 liu et al 2019 similar phenomena was observed in the inhibition of coenzyme f420 involved in methanogenesis the maximum scfa yield in heat cao2 process reached 336 5 mg cod g vss after 5 day of fermentation increasing 584 45 and 61 compared to the case without pretreatment sole heat and sole cao2 liu et al 2019 in addition to the potential benefits of scfa mentioned above heat cao2 pretreatment of was anaerobic fermentation can also improve sludge dewaterability and sludge reduction reducing the cost of subsequent sludge dewatering and final disposal yu et al 2018 the economic feasibility evaluation based on pilot scale 100 tons d of dewatered sludge with 80 water content indicated heat cao2 for was fermentation could generate a net profits of 38 69 usd ton when considering the various costs and incomes of fermentation as compared with the traditional sludge treatment paradigm yu et al 2018 fa a strong biocidal agent can inhibit the activity of methanogenic belmonte et al 2011 nakakubo et al 2008 when cao2 is combined with fa synergistic inhibition of methanogens activity is achieved which significantly reduces scfa consumption wang et al 2018b confirmed the feasibility of cao2 combined with fa pretreatment to increase scfa yield from was anaerobic fermentation the presence of 0 05 g cao2 g vss and 180 fa mg l respectively reduced the relative activities of methanogens by 10 33 and 48 26 this inhibition was further extended to 72 40 in 0 05 g cao2 g vss 180 mg fa l process moreover cao2 combined with fa benefited the disruption of sludge eps and cell envelop leading to the soluble cod content increase to 6264 121 mg l wang et al 2018 the scfa yield with 0 05 g cao2 g vss 180 mg fa l pretreatment was improved by about 7 4 times compared to blank sludge without pretreatment while it were only enhanced by about 4 06 and 4 89 times with sole cao2 or sole fa pretreatment respectively wang et al 2018 fa could be in situ generated from fermentation liquor in wwtps zhang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 therefore this cao2 fa strategy not only can reduce the dosage of cao2 at a very low cost but also enhance scfa production and resource recovery from was generating potential economic benefits it was estimated by wang et al 2018 that this combination of cao2 and fa would save approximately 1 900 000 yearly in a wwtp q 105 m3 d compared to traditional wwtp operation modes apart from scfa hydrogen is also one of the important products of was anaerobic fermentation process wang et al 2019c as a clean energy source hydrogen can save fossil fuels with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions the generation of hydrogen from was dark fermentation has thereby also gained a huge amount of interest li et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 but like the production of scfa from was the production of hydrogen is also generally constrained by the low disintegration rate of was li et al 2020c besides hydrogen is easily consumed by methanogens homoacetogenic bacteria or sulfate reducing bacteria also causing low yield niu et al 2019 the hydrogen yield from was can be improved by cao2 addition through facilitating the disintegration of was and inhibiting hydrogen consumption wang et al 2019b revealed the influence of cao2 on hydrogen production from was the alkali oh and o2 generated in the process of cao2 decomposition accelerated the destruction of sludge cells wang et al 2009b li et al 2014b zhang et al 2015c the released ratios of soluble proteins increased from 1 02 0 19 to 16 06 1 1 when the cao2 dosage was increased from 0 to 0 25 g g vss wang et al 2019b accordingly more the released substrates could be utilized by hydrogen forming microorganisms with regard to hydrogen consumption process cao2 addition significantly inhibited the activities of hydrogen consuming microorganisms which were decreased by 56 52 and 73 91 in the presence of 0 1 and 0 2 g cao2 g vss wang et al 2019b all these contribute to the enhancement of hydrogen yield and the maximum yield of 10 55 ml g vss was achieved at cao2 dosage of 0 25 g g vss which was approximately 13 7 times higher than that from the case without pretreatment wang et al 2019b interestingly the promoting effect of alkali oh and o2 on was disintegration reflected by soluble cod content and vss reduction was corresponded with the tendency of their impact on the performance of dark fermentation the main contribution of cao2 decomposition products to hydrogen production is in turn alkali o2 and oh during sludge disintegration the conversion of sludge eps and intracellular organic matters into soluble organic matters can minimize sludge zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2019 therefore in addition to promoting the recovery of resource and energy i e scfa hydrogen and methane sludge minimization can be also obtained due to the enhancement of sludge disintegration or solubilization caused by alkaline and free radical oxidation when cao2 is applied to treat sludge during anaerobic digestion and fermentation the corresponding sludge minimization effects with cao2 treatment are concluded in table 4 5 the use of cao2 for improving the removal of contaminants in was with the rapid development of global industrialization and the continuous improvement of human living standards lots of ecs e g heavy metals organic contaminants and antibiotic resistance genes args are released into wastewater sun et al 2017 subedi et al 2014 su et al 2017 yang et al 2020 wwtps as a collection point of various kinds of wastewater are therefore considered as the main hotspot where ecs exist rosal et al 2010 traditional wwtps are mainly designed for the treatment of conventional pollutants e g easily degradable organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus and other inorganic substances and there is no specific unit for degrading ecs xu et al 2020 therefore in the process of wastewater treatment most of ecs cannot be effectively degraded but are mainly removed by activated sludge which could be attribute to the strong adsorption and relatively long sludge age resulting in substantial ecs to be concentrated and enriched in the was tran et al 2018 luo et al 2020b for instance cadmium a typical heavy metal nonylphenols a typical edcs and triclocarban a typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps contents in sludge were found to reach 1 mg g vss 200 mg kg tss and 50 mg kg tss chen et al 2008b duan et al 2016 wang et al 2019d however due to strong adsorption capacity of eps and the difficult biodegradability of the contaminants these toxic and harmful ecs are generally difficult to be effectively removed or degraded from sludge in the process of conventional sludge treatment including sludge dewatering anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation wu et al 2017b golet et al 2003 wang et al 2017c for example liang et al 2020 found that the concentration of heavy metals as and pb in the liquid phase of sludge treated by pam was low which was only 0 0088 mg l and 0 0003 mg l higher than that of the undewatered sludge respectively in terms of the typical organic ecs norfloxacin and fluoxetine were demonstrated to be degraded by only 10 in the conventional was anaerobic digestion process low degradation rate 10 was also made on triclocarban during the was anaerobic fermentation golet et al 2003 zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2017c the residual ecs inevitably will be released into natural environment with the further disposal of was posing a huge potential risk to human health and the ecological environment muller et al 2010 therefore pertinent treatment is urgently needed to remove or degrade ecs from was before they enter the natural environment when cao2 treats was it can significantly improve the removal of heavy metals wu et al 2017b found that the transformation of heavy metals from the bound state to the free state was promoted with fe ii activated cao2 process under the condition of 0 0906 g g tss cao2 0 9969 mmol g tss fe2 and ph 5 59 organically bound plumbum pb copper cu and zinc zn as well as arsenic as were respectively removed by 68 3 54 9 31 8 and 31 2 while the corresponding soluble fractions increased from 10 4 4 9 12 0 and 0 to 30 27 5 250 7 and 13 6 respectively wu et al 2017b similar observation was also made in the cao2 treatment in the study of yuan et al 2020 after 60 min treatment of 1 cao2 the removal rates of pb zn and cu were 53 58 3 and 63 8 respectively the peroxidation induced by cao2 treatment decrease sludge eps conditional stability and molecular polarity by decomposing eps structure accordingly damaging the binding capacity of sludge eps with metal ions and facilitating the release of heavy metals from the sludge into the supernatant bouda et al 2009 guibaud et al 2012 this could provide convenient conditions for the further leached removal of heavy metals for example yuan et al 2020 found that when the supernatant was treated with 1 cao after oxidation with cao2 the removal rates of pb and zn exceeded 30 moreover as iii in sludge treated by fe ii activated cao2 was almost converted to as v reducing the toxicity of as wu et al 2017b martinson and reddy 2009 above results suggested that the potential risk of heavy metal in sludge could be efficiently mitigated using cao2 based treatment benefiting the further utilization and disposal of sludge edcs as a typical of persistent organic pollutant are demonstrated to potentially pose adverse influences on humans and wildlife wee and aris 2017 during the sludge treatment with cao2 the generated free radical as strong chemical oxidant can efficiently degrade edcs zhang et al 2015a found that cao2 oxidation dominated by oh radicals showed good removal performance for six edcs including estrone e1 17b estradiol e2 estriol e3 17a ethinylestradiol ee2 4 nonylphenols np and bisphenol a bpa more cao2 would generate more h2o2 and release more oh radicals eq 1 3 to oxidize edcs resulting in a dose dependent removal effect with increase of cao2 dosage from 0 034 to 0 66 g g tss the removal rates of above mentioned six edcs increased from 50 24 41 25 12 and 9 to 80 76 79 75 69 and 75 respectively meanwhile cao2 oxidation could effectively destroy phenol structures of edcs weakening estrogenic activities and mitigating potential risks zhang et al 2015a the abundant metal ions in was could have positive effect on the degradation of edcs during cao2 oxidation these metal ions e g fe cu and zn could participate in modified fenton reactions using cao2 for generating oh radicals eqs 6 14 improving edcs removal nam et al 2001 zhang and li 2014 in addition ph can affect the effect of cao2 oxidation on the one hand high ph could increases the electrostatic repulsion on the surface of sludge cells resulting in desorption of edcs from eps and accordingly increasing the contacts with cao2 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 on the other hand high ph could disrupt sludge eps and cell membranes and more intracellular material e g organic acids amino acids and hydroxamate siderophores which may function as chelating agents were released into supernatant xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a chelating agents were demonstrated to be effective in sustaining the chemical oxidation of contaminants by modified fenton chemistry utilizing cao2 ndjou ou and cassidy 2006 these chelating agents released under high ph conditions could therefore promote the production rate of oh radicals posing positive effects on the degradation of contaminants by cao2 oxidation zhang et al 2015a hence the better removal performance of edcs with cao2 was obtained at higher ph under condition of initial ph 12 the removal rates of e1 e2 e3 ee2 np and bpa after 7 d 0 66 g g tss of cao2 treatment respectively reached 99 91 93 86 83 and 89 zhang et al 2015a 13 cu h2o2 cu2 ho ho 14 zn h2o2 h zn2 ho h2o additionally cao2 can enhance the degradation of ppcps in was making up for the lack of biodegradation in the study of wang et al 2019b after 2 d cao2 pretreatment the levels of four ppcps in was including triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone significantly decreased as compared with the absence of cao2 pretreatment meanwhile the removal performance was also dosage dependent when the cao2 dosage increased from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the degradation rate of triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone increased to 37 8 34 5 32 9 and 19 6 and further increased to 57 4 52 3 55 0 and 37 8 when cao2 dosage at 0 26 g g vss was used wang et al 2019b above four ppcps were also demonstrated to inhibit the activities of microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion which inhibited methane production tang et al 2019 faberova et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 therefore the enhanced degradation of above ppcps could not only reduce their potential environmental risks but also mitigate their inhibitory effects on anaerobic microbes relevant to methane production improving methane yield from was anaerobic digestion wang et al 2019b moreover cao2 can be used in combination with other methods to remove ppcps and other organic contaminants from sludge zheng et al 2019 investigated the effect of medium pressure uv mp uv cao2 process in the removal of two ppcps i e carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd mp uv can activate h2o2 released from cao2 for accelerating the generation of oh eq 15 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 moreover the alkali generated by cao2 decomposition can improve the release of cbz and pmd from was through facilitating sludge solubilization which cause more cbz and pmd exposed to mp uv increasing mp uv utilization efficiency in mp uv cao2 process reactive radicals dominated by oh attacked both the olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring and two outside aromatic rings of cbz and both the pyrimidine ring and the aromatic ring of pmd hu et al 2009 tang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 after a series of hydroxylated and hydrolysis reactions refractory cbz and pmd were finally degraded into hydroxyacridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic oh or acridine ai and 4 hydroxyphenobarbital pbb 4oh respectively achieving the conversion of refractory organic contaminants into harmless small molecules biodegradable substances furthermore cao2 dosage and initial vss concentration can affect the removal performance under mp uv cao2 treatment the degradation efficiency of cbz and pmd increased with the increase of cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 2 g g vss under same irradiation time however further increasing the dosage of cao2 to 0 5 g g vss did not further significantly improve the degradation efficiency zheng et al 2019 excessive cao2 caused was to release more dissolved organic matter which could compete with cbz and pmd for limited uv light and oxidants retarding the increase of degradation rates qiu et al 2019 moreover oh cannot form linearly with the increase of cao2 under constant uv intensity more importantly higher ph value caused by the over addition of cao2 could accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 eq 16 resulting in lower level of oh eqs 17 20 and accordingly reducing its oxidation potential hence 0 2 g g vss of cao2 was regarded as the appropriate dosage to degrade cbz and pmd and 92 3 cbz degradation and 90 3 pmd degradation were achieved when in combination with 7 h mp uv irradiation zheng et al 2019 the increased vss concentration weakened uv irradiation due to the screening effect at the same time the increase in vss could release more dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions which may compete with target contaminants for free radicals generated by mp uv cao2 qiu et al 2019 above factors may lead to the increased concentration of vss suppressing the degradation of cbz and pmd in mp uv cao2 process zheng et al 2019 in addition to above cbz and pmd uv cao2 pretreatment can also effectively degrade many trace organic contaminants torcs in was it was reported that 19 of torcs including cbz i e acesulfame benzophenone n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet diclofenac diphenhydramine diltiazem fluoxetine gemfibrozil hydrochlorothiazide iohexol iopamidol iopromide meprobamate propranolol simazine sulfamethoxazole triclosan trimethoprim were with degradation efficiency 50 under the pretreatment of 0 1 g g vss of cao2 and uv 2 h which was only 11 species in uv 2 h pretreatment zheng et al 2021 in order to predict torcs attenuation under the pretreatment of uv cao2 zheng et al 2021 established a typical torcs photolysis model via uv direct and free reactive species frs indirect photolysis based on photochemical principals from schwarzenbach et al 2016 when cbz was selected as an indicator of refractory torcs the proposed predictive model expressed a good prediction with the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 at 0 94 and pearson product moment correlation coefficient pearson s r at 0 98 and all the differences between the predicted and measured degradation efficiency were less than 27 3 zheng et al 2021 us combined with cao2 has also obtained great results for removing refractory organic contaminants in sludge li et al 2019b found that the organic compound species and the total detection frequency of digested sludge supernatant determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were respectively 10 and 26 with the pretreatment of us 1 w ml 10 min cao2 0 1 g g vss which was much less than that of raw sludge 21 and 113 control sludge without any pretreatment 20 and 97 us 19 and 79 and cao2 15 and 48 this inferred that the potential refractory organic contaminants risk may be efficiently reduced under us cao2 treatment overall the mechanism of cao2 removing contaminants from was is presented in fig 4 table 5 summarizes the corresponding removal performance of contaminants using cao2 15 h2o2 hv 2 oh 16 2h2o2 2h2o o2 17 oh oh o h2o 18 oh o ho2 k 2 1010 l mol 1s 1 19 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o o2 h h2o 20 oh ho2 oh ho2 o2 h h2o in addition to heavy metals and refractory organic contaminants cao2 also can enhance the inactivation of the pathogens and the removal of args in was liu et al 2019 compared the effects of heat pretreatment 67 4 c 19 h cao2 pretreatment 0 12 g g vss and heat cao2 pretreatment on the fecal coliform a pathogen indicator the original fecal coliform was 4 8 log mpn g tss the fecal coliform content in the control sludge without any pretreatment increased to 7 3 log mpn g tss after 5 d of was anaerobic fermentation however the corresponding content in the sludge with sole heat pretreatment and sole cao2 pretreatment respectively decreased to 3 4 and 2 4 log mpn g tss when heat and cao2 were combined to pretreat sludge the fecal coliform content further reduced to 1 1 log mpn g tss liu et al 2019 the damage and lethal effect of the alkali and free radicals e g oh and o2 released from cao2 on sludge cells may be the main reason for inactivating pathogen in sludge wang et al 2019b moreover the presence of heat pretreatment can enhance the inactivation effect of sole cao2 pretreatment generating a synergistic effect the presence or residual of args in sludge has posed potential risks to the environment and human health huang et al 2016 cao2 decomposition products e g oh o2 and alkali were demonstrated to be effective in reducing args from wastewater and was respectively zhou et al 2020 huang et al 2017 in the study by yu et al 2020 the addition of cao2 reduced the abundance of args during bioelectrochemically assisted excess dewatered sludge anaerobic composting after 42 d composting as cao2 increased to 0 5 g g vss the total args abundance decreased from 1 2 1 7 10 1 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of the raw excess dewatered sludge to 2 9 3 2 10 2 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of 0 4 g cao2 g vss and 2 3 2 4 10 2 arg copy 16s rrna gene copy of 0 5 g cao2 g vss similar attenuation was also observed in the abundance of some mobile genetic elements mges including plasmids insert sequences and integrons their abundances were lowest at the cao2 dose of 0 5 g cao2 g vss indicating that cao2 addition could affect the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args which might be one of the reasons for cao2 to promote the attenuation of args yu et al 2020 6 knowledge gaps and opportunities 6 1 improvement of sludge dewatering mechanism some mechanisms of cao2 affecting sludge dewatering are conflict with others and even speculative and remain to be investigated generally the increased concentration of lb eps is detrimental to the sludge dewatering because of hydrophilicity jin et al 2004 wu and chai 2016 found that this negative influence can be controlled in fe ii activated cao2 process through accelerating the degradation of lb eps while wu et al 2018b reported that the increased lb eps is conducive to sludge dewatering in fe doped sdmm activated cao2 cao2 fe sdmm process meanwhile the positive impact reported by wu et al 2018b is not supported by experimental data but only by citing references more studies are therefore required to clarify this contradictory conclusion moreover major contribution to enhanced dewaterability in fe ii activated cao2 process i e the reduction of hydrophilic functional groups in lb eps is inferred indirectly from the result of eem spectra rather than directly supported by functional group data to offer a better understanding more methods for directly analyzing functional groups of eps such as fourier transform infrared ftir spectra and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps should to be used finally due to fe ii and fe iii of alleviating electrostatic repulsions and compressing double electric layer whether iron species flocculation contributes to sludge dewatering in fe ii activated cao2 process should be also therefore clarified 6 2 effect of cao2 on methanogens in anaerobic digestion while cao2 sludge pretreatment is an effective method to recovery energy and resource from anaerobic digestion the effect of pretreatment on methanogens key microorganisms involved in methane production is insufficient generally the cao2 decomposition products e g oh and o2 and alkali were considered to be hostile to methanogens wang et al 2019a wang and li 2016 also found that mw cao2 pretreatment suppressed the activity of methanogens however the relative abundance of methanogens was increased with mw cao2 pretreatment wang and li 2016 therefore the detailed microorganism information in anaerobic sludge digestion system before and after cao2 pretreatment should be investigated which not only can cover the knowledge gap in biological mechanism of cao2 sludge pretreatment enhancing methane production but also reveal whether cao2 pretreatment caused the different effect on the activity and distribution of methanogens 6 3 potential contribution of cao2 decomposition products and solid cao2 adsorption to the sludge treatment processes the contribution of cao2 decomposition products including free radicals oxygen and alkali and solid cao2 adsorption to the sludge treatment processes has not been fully clarified and remains to be investigated previous study showed that small amounts of oxygen can enhance the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins due to the production of exoenzymes by aerobic microorganisms lim and wang 2013 however to date only limited studies have mentioned the potential role of oxygen among the many studies on the application of cao2 in the treatment of was and these reports are only simple discussions in conjunction with the literatures without experimental data support li et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b therefore the potential contribution of oxygen released from cao2 to sludge treatment processes including anaerobic digestion and fermentation still needs further experimental verification besides although studies have observed free radicals and alkali could promote was disintegration and inhibit the activity of methanogens in anaerobic digestion wang et al 2019a 2019b yuan et al 2006 their real contribution based on comprehensive consideration of positive effect and negative effect methane production remains indistinct more studies are therefore required to investigate the major contributor of cao2 pretreatment enhancing methane production furthermore while studies have observed that cao2 nanoparticles can be used as an adsorbent for the removal of organic contaminants and heavy metals from aqueous solution madan et al 2016 massalimov et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b no relevant studies have been reported in the removal of contaminants from sludge whether the adsorption effects of solid cao2 affects the removal of ecs in the sludge remains indistinct further investigations are needed to clarify the potential contribution of the adsorption effects of solid cao2 to the contaminants removal which will provide a more comprehensive explanation for cao2 improving the ecs removal from sludge 6 4 comprehensive evaluation of economic and ecological benefits in pilot scale trial in addition to the use of thermo cao2 in anaerobic sludge fermentation system other cao2 research were all carried out in laboratories some limitations of lab scale research should be recognized in lab scale anaerobic digester or fermenter operation with cao2 based method treated sludge although real sludge obtained from wwtps was employed the small volumes of treatment and anaerobic reactors may not represent larger scale trial because that the difference of hydraulic dynamics between lab scale reactors and larger scale reactors could lead to different mass transfer and the effectiveness of cao2 based sludge treatment therefore current estimated economic analysis according to laboratory results may not be convincing moreover most of the current studies on cao2 promoting the removal of ecs are carried out separately according to the contaminants category in addition to the reported ecs cao2 also has the potential to enhance the removal of other common contaminants in sludge theses research gaps that need to be filled inevitably leads to incomplete evaluation of the ecological benefits of cao2 in reducing the risk of ecs therefore the comprehensive evaluation of economic and ecological benefits in pilot scale trial is still required to fully reveal the feasibility of cao2 based methods before it full scale applications 6 5 intrinsic limitations and opportunities there are certain limitations in cao2 based sludge treatment and the combination with other methods may be a promising solution for example the addition of low dosage cao2 assisted sludge dewatering is not expected to improve srf to meet the standard of good dewaterability because of the limited enhancement to eps disintegration research demonstrated utilizing fe ii activate low dosage cao2 significantly enhanced the disintegration of eps and accordingly improved sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017b moreover while cao2 and its combined methods e g us cao2 mw cao2 mp uv cao2 has been used to pretreat was to promote recycling of resource and energy methane scfa and hydrogen and risk mitigation anaerobic digestion and fermentation it inevitably consumes substantial chemicals and energy which inevitably reduces the potential economic benefits achieved by cao2 based sludge treatment in this regard cao2 combination with other low cost and in situ methods e g free nitrous acid fna and fa seems to be nice option study has explored the possibility of using lower dosage cao2 in combination with fa to achieve enhanced scfa production performance similar to higher dosage cao2 alone wang et al 2018 therefore more research could be performed in this direction in the future 7 conclusions this review covers recent studies of applying cao2 in improving the treatment of was in cao2 based treatment the generated free radicals and alkali from cao2 decomposition play an important role in sludge treatment the main conclusions are as follows in sludge dewatering the radical oxidation can destroy structures of sludge floc and highly hydrated eps promoting the release of interstitial water from sludge in anaerobic digestion the free radicals and alkali not only can accelerate the disruption of eps and cell membrane but also degrade non biodegradable organic matters in sludge providing more biodegradable substances for improving methane production in anaerobic fermentation the alkaline condition and oxidative environment can increase organic matters supply and utilization efficiency for the producers of scfa and hydrogen while suppress the consumption of scfa and hydrogen thereby enhancing the accumulation of scfa and hydrogen from was in the process of cao2 enhancing anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation more organic matters in the was solid phase is released into the supernatant therefore sludge minimization is also promoted the oh and alkali can damage the binding capacity of sludge eps with ecs via the destruction of eps structure thus transiting bound ecs into a free state for further removal the strong oxidative oh can effectively degrade organic ecs and inactivate pathogens and remove args in sludge although significant progresses have been made in recent years it should be recognized that there are still some knowledge gaps to be investigated for the application of cao2 based sludge treatment 1 more comprehensive sludge dewatering mechanism 2 microbiological insight on the effect of cao2 on methanogens 3 potential contribution of cao2 properties and its decomposition products 4 economic and ecological benefits evaluation in pilot scale and 5 intrinsic limitations of

17474,the discovery and evolution of antibiotics for humans and animals are among the most significant milestones of the 20th century however antibiotics play a significant role in the induction and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in groundwater that has recently become the primary environmental concern they are administrated to humans and animals on a large scale and are persistent in the environment long term impacts of antibiotics in the ecological environment are not still clearly understood and their occurrence and consequences have become an important research topic worldwide the hotspot reservoirs of antibiotics and args include medical facilities livestock farming aquaculture landfills on site sanitation systems sewage and wastewater treatment plants our meta analysis demonstrated that antibiotics including ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and tetracycline were found at high concentrations while sulfonamide and tetracycline args were more prevalent in groundwater moreover the highest reported concentrations of targeted antibiotics were used to calculate hazard quotient hq and risk quotient rq in global groundwater bodies to estimate environmental and human health risks respectively due to limited available ecotoxicity data rq and hq can only be calculated for a few antibiotics in groundwater the risk assessment of antibiotics demonstrated that antibiotics with their current groundwater levels pose no human health risks whereas only ciprofloxacin erythromycin flumequine and sulfamethoxazole revealed moderate to low risks to aquatic species the occurrence of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs in groundwater is also not likely to pose human health risk but consumption of groundwater contaminated with args and arbs might contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance in humans the present review also sheds light on the relationship between args antibiotics microbial communities and environmental factors in groundwater and reported a significant correlation between them it also addresses prospects for future outlooks into further areas of relevant research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria groundwater human health environmental risk 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of freshwater globally which accounts for 97 of available freshwater on earth while the remaining 3 is primarily surface water jurado et al 2019 it is considered as the most vital source of public water supply in many regions of the world szekeres et al 2018 however anthropogenic activities mainly industrial and agricultural threaten groundwater quality because many pollutants can potentially reach the aquifers jurado et al 2019 some newly recognized classes of environmental contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have become a subject of scientific and public concern because of their potential bioactive properties and unknown effects on the water environment pompei et al 2019 among ppcps antibiotics are a widely studied class that prevents or hinders microorganism s growth e g bacteria fungi and protozoa liu et al 2019 the major antibiotics classification and their representative drugs are displayed in table s1 antibiotics can accumulate in water bodies because they are only partially degraded in the environment and pose ecological and human health risks kümmerer 2009 various veterinary and human drugs are continuously released into the environment during manufacturing disposal or metabolic excretions sharma et al 2019 the antibiotics detected in groundwater from various regions vary in concentrations suggesting different consumption patterns the consumption pattern of antibiotics in household and agriculture sectors differs across regions and nations in the developing world and even antibiotics banned in developed countries are still being utilized in developing nations adebowale et al 2016 the assessment of the antibiotic consumption of 76 countries found that the global consumption rate increased by 39 during the period 2000 2015 to 42 3 billion defined daily dose ddds klein et al 2018 in high income countries an increase of 6 from 9 7 to 10 3 billion ddds in antibiotic consumption has been observed from 2000 to 2015 whereas a modest drop of 4 from 26 8 to 25 7 ddds in the consumption rate was reported for every 1000 inhabitants day however the low to middle income countries observed an increase of 114 from 11 4 to 24 5 billion ddds in antibiotic consumption and for every 1000 inhabitants day the antibiotic consumption rate showed an increase of 77 from 7 6 to 13 5 ddds zhang et al 2018 therefore per capita antibiotic consumption was reported to be high in high income countries but comparatively less in low and middle income countries for instance in brazil china and india dai et al 2019 the continuous release of these antibiotics into groundwater select for antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and antibiotic resistance genes args which exhibit significant ecological and human health concerns worldwide gao et al 2020 resistant bacteria and genes when entering a healthy organism tend to proliferate in there increasing in number therefore forming a resistance module against the antibiotic within the organisms singer et al 2016 as a result the curative abilities of the antibiotics are reduced also other methods like sewage sludge and animal manure that are used in agricultural lands need to be looked into to control the levels of arbs and args that find their way to the healthy organisms gao et al 2012 studies have shown that antibiotics make their way into the water reservoirs and aquatic environments due to the inability of treatment plants to remove them altogether ebele et al 2017 they have been detected in various environmental matrices especially in the aquatic environment they possess high biological activity even at low concentrations and can cause toxic effects to human and aquatic life it has been reported that even low level exposure ng l shows significant impacts in impairing the normal body function especially if the dose was administered without necessity ahmed et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 therapeutic drugs like antibiotics may retain their properties or convert into more active compounds in the aquatic environment their use is unlikely to be restricted owing to the benefits they provide yang et al 2017 however the absence of advanced treatment processes and the unregulated use and sale of such products in developing countries further aggravates the problem kumar et al 2019 as a way forward it is essential to develop a correlation between antibiotics their metabolites and conventional water quality parameters yang et al 2013 antibiotics susceptibility to various chemical biological and physical treatment processes varies due to the diverse nature of their chemical classes this requires further comprehensive studies to understand better their behaviour in aquatic environment and treatment processes required for abatement le minh et al 2010 no comprehensive review on the occurrence of antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater has been conducted until now in this review we collate the knowledge on the timeline of antibiotics and resistance development sources consumption occurrence dissemination and risk of antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater the objectives were 1 to summarise the sources exposure pathways and factors affecting the transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater 2 to investigate the contamination profiles of antibiotics and args with high concentrations in groundwater through meta analysis 3 to understand the occurrence distribution and potential drivers of arbs in groundwater 4 to elucidate the potential relationship between antibiotics args arbs and environmental factors in groundwater and 5 to estimate the environmental risks against different aquatic species and human health risks linked with exposure to antibiotics args and arbs through groundwater

and resistance development the first effective antibiotics were introduced in 1937 davies and davies 2010 with the discovery of new antibiotics and their overuse throughout history various resistance mechanisms have emerged and evolved limiting antibiotics application ventola 2015 fig 1 depicts the order of discovery and resistance development for primary antibiotics antibiotic resistance is considered as an apocalyptic threat to living beings because of the risk of returning to the pre antibiotics era carvalho and santos 2016 the detailed reviews on antibiotics discovery and their resistance timeline have been published in many literatures davies and davies 2010 ventola 2015 danso et al 2019 4 sources and exposure pathways of antibiotics and args in groundwater the primary exposure pathways of antibiotics and args in groundwater are displayed in fig 2 antibiotics may enter groundwater through leaky sewerage or manure storage wastewater effluent landfill leachate livestock farming discharges from hospitals industrial premises and animal production facilities runoff from aquaculture and agricultural areas treated with manure or wastewater gao et al 2020 sui et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2020 the occurrence of args in groundwater nearby landfills provides evidence that landfills are an underappreciated hotspot of antibiotic resistance causing args dissemination via flowing contaminated groundwater chen et al 2017 it was observed that long term aquaculture activities in the honghu lake china had impacted on the dissemination of some antibiotics and their associated args tetg tetq and tetx in the groundwater fishponds or aquafarms can act as reservoirs for antibiotics and args eventually reaching groundwater tong et al 2020 swine farming was reported to be a major source of args spread in groundwater bodies gao et al 2020 awad et al 2014 li et al 2018 chee sanford et al 2001 resistant bacteria are expected to follow the route of dispersal similar to antibiotics berglund 2015 this can result in resistance hotspot environments where antibiotics args resistant bacteria and environmental bacterial flora potential arbs are mixed horizontal gene transfer hgt in such hotspots is a major factor for forming new resistant strains wellington et al 2013 it is the main mechanism of args transfer among the diversity of bacteria including environmental non pathogenic human pathogenic gram positive and negative via mobile dna elements such as plasmids and transposons either with or without mobile integrons aminov 2011 mobile integrons can recognize and acquire gene cassettes containing args while chromosomal integrons carry a large number of gene cassettes khan et al 2013 args spread due to class1 integrons in pathogens is a serious challenge to clinical therapy stalder et al 2012 humans can be exposed to resistant bacteria by numerous routes including consumption of contaminated crops drinking contaminated groundwater etc in humans resistant bacteria can spread args to the human microbiome wellington et al 2013 allen et al 2010 5 factors affecting transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater the transport and transformation of antibiotics in groundwater are primarily influenced by several environmental factors and physicochemical properties of the compounds boy roura et al 2018 the vital factors involved in the transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater are portrayed in fig 3 5 1 reactivity factors 5 1 1 sorption sorption is critical in controlling the passage of antibiotics to groundwater yang et al 2017 the distribution coefficient kd characterizes the sorptive exchange of antibiotics between water and solid phases the kd for organic compounds varies with soil type and its organic carbon water partition coefficient koc boy roura et al 2018 antibiotics are complex molecules and their sorption behavior can be determined considering the initial concentration ionic strength solid to liquid ratio temperature ph and octanol water partition coefficient kow loftin et al 2008 5 1 2 biodegradation antibiotics biodegradability is determined by their molecular structure and physicochemical properties e g sulfamethoxazole experienced less biodegradability than other antibiotics in microcosm studies boy roura et al 2018 a study on anaerobic biodegradation of antibiotics showed 85 and 62 removal of ciprofloxacin under sulfate and nitrate reducing environments respectively while sulfamethoxazole exhibited no biodegradability martins et al 2018 redox conditions also control pharmaceuticals biodegradation in groundwater redox dependent biodegradation via tank aeration experiments showed an efficient removal of doxycycline under aerobic conditions whereas for clarithromycin clindamycin and roxithromycin only under anaerobic conditions gartiser et al 2007 moreover anaerobic conditions are also reported to be prevalent in the groundwater environment which can play a significant role in the biodegradation of antibiotics as previously reported for wwtps zhao et al 2020 environmental conditions also show various influences on antibiotics biodegradation sui et al showed dissimilarity in tetracycline and chlortetracycline biodegradation at varying temperatures and ph whereas the degradation of sulfonamides was less affected by changes in temperature and ph signifying groundwater removal mechanisms might not be ph dependent reactions i e hydrolysis sui et al 2015 microorganisms in groundwater are not abundant and diverse as compared to those present in soil lapworth et al 2012 hence antibiotics in groundwater might undergo incomplete degradation and potentially convert to hazardous metabolites or remain unchanged in groundwater for a long time sui et al 2015 the study conducted by galán et al highlighted the occurrence of five acetylated metabolites of sulfonamides in groundwater of spain it was found that sulfamerazine metabolite n 4 acetylsulfamerazine occurred more frequently than their parent compound sulfamerazine with the maximum concentration of 18 ng l furthermore the occurrence of n 4 acetylsulfapyridine metabolite of sulfapyridine was also reported to be higher in the groundwater this study further showed that antibiotics metabolites are more soluble and exhibit higher stability than their parent compounds garcía galán et al 2011 5 1 3 hydrochemical conditions hydrochemistry of groundwater plays a vital role in antibiotics behavior in groundwater menció and mas pla 2019 sulfamethoxazole showed greater mobility in groundwater than ciprofloxacin under the effects of ionic strength and ph chen et al 2011 transportation of reactive components of antibiotics has significance in their existence in groundwater thus the retardation factor provides a quantitative idea of antibiotics migration rate concerning groundwater flow boy roura et al 2018 5 2 physicochemical factors selective pressure is the main contributor in hgt of args and their distribution in groundwater allen et al 2010 amarasiri et al 2019 the exponential increase in production and usage of antibiotics for various purposes including the treatment of ailments and growth enhancement are the major causal factors of this selective pressure zhang et al 2009 an increase in such selective pressure has been found to facilitate bacteria in the attainment of args further facilitating args spread luo et al 2005 the antibiotics found at low sub inhibitory concentrations lead to an increase in args spread in the water environment greenfield et al 2018 for instance sulfamethoxazole slightly increased antibiotic resistance s transfer frequency at sub inhibitory concentration of antibiotics in an aquatic environment jutkina et al 2018 the role of metals e g hg zn cu and cd in the co selection of antibiotic resistance might be another important factor contributing towards args spread amarasiri et al 2019 compared with control areas bacteria in metal contaminated environments easily obtain antibiotic resistance phenotypes zhang et al 2009 co selection mechanisms include co resistance and cross resistance co resistance occurs when a single genetic element carries various resistance determinants whereas in cross resistance a single genetic determinant leads to antibiotic as well as metal resistance thus metal contamination is a major contributor to antibiotic resistance and is crucial in environmental and clinical settings baker austin et al 2006 since the literature on fate and transport of args in groundwater is limited more comprehensive research is needed to identify the key factors influencing args spread 5 3 hydrogeological factors aquifers geological features and hydrological sources contribute to its recharge and antibiotic content menció and mas pla 2019 streamflow of the river is also expected to contribute to antibiotic content in wells nearby rainfall recharge infiltrates manure that applied as fertilizer to crops causing pollutants to enter the vadose zone and later the aquifer partially saturated zones temporally retain pollutants and progressively leach them to groundwater by gravity flow after precipitation boy roura et al 2018 k oreje et al 2020 rainfall is also an important factor that plays a vital role in the dissemination of args in groundwater the study conducted by huang and colleagues reported that high intensity rainfall drove the dissemination of tetracycline and sulfonamide args to groundwater with the assistance of a stream huang et al 2019 6 occurrence and spatial distribution of antibiotics and args in groundwater a global scenario studies on the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and args in the groundwater have been conducted in many regions worldwide carvalho and santos 2016 liu and wong 2013 the levels of antibiotics and args in groundwater vary across the countries and amongst different regions of the same country for developed regions data on antibiotics and args groundwater contamination are more prevalent in europe and the united states whereas in developing regions the data is more prevalent in china in asia china is the only country with well established literature on the occurrence of antibiotics and their related genes in groundwater liu and wong 2013 whereas in the american continent the united states has the highest number of published studies on the groundwater level of antibiotics and args chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 mackie et al 2006 the data on the occurrence of antibiotics in africa is scarce due to the limited availability of analytical techniques k oreje et al 2020 however considerable data is available in europe compared to other countries carvalho and santos 2016 this review compares the reported concentrations of sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and tetracyclines antibiotics in groundwater globally table s2 the occurrence of args and methodologies used to detect args in groundwater have also been summarized in table 1 different types of args reported in the groundwater have been described in table s3 6 1 tetracyclines and associated args tetracyclines are a broad class of veterinary drugs extensively used worldwide dai et al 2019 the application of tetracycline antibiotics to animal feed additives was first approved by the us food and drug administration fda in 1950 daghrir and drogui 2013 it is ranked second in production and consumption worldwide whereas ranked first in china with respect to its usage kovalakova et al 2020 china and the us are the largest tetracycline producers due to increased animal farming and maximum use of associated antibiotics in the agricultural sector as a feed supplement to promote growth dai et al 2019 the global contamination level of tetracyclines in groundwater is shown in fig 4 a the elevated concentration of tetracyclines in groundwater was reported in the us and canada america followed by europe and asia fig 4 a among the tetracycline antibiotics tetracycline is the most prescribed veterinary antibiotic found with the highest concentration of approximately 400 ng l in groundwater of the us which were polluted by swine confinement facilities mackie et al 2006 tetracycline and its related args were also observed in groundwater of cluj napoca romania impacted by the swine farms with no proper waste handling system szekeres et al 2018 the existence of tetracycline args has been found more frequently in china s groundwater because of its highest production 97 000 tons year in the region followed by the us canada and spain dai et al 2019 according to chee sanford et al the presence of the tetracycline args in deep wells is higher than shallow wells this outlines that the impurities may get vertically distributed dependent on the hydrogeology of the location as a result the movement and seepage of the underlying inlets cause tetracycline args to enter groundwater the consumption of groundwater contaminated with tetracyclines provides a possible way by which args enter the human and animal food chains chee sanford et al 2001 groundwater wells next to swine production facilities contain high levels of tetracycline and associated args than the wells located more distant from swine farming production facilities koike et al 2007 it was found that swine production facilities are the potential source of tetracyclines and related genes in groundwater szekeres et al 2018 gao et al 2020 tong et al 2020 chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 mackie et al 2006 frey et al 2015 yao et al 2015 tong et al 2014 other than aquaculture tong et al 2020 yao et al 2017 and livestock production dai et al 2019 daghrir and drogui 2013 yao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 6 2 sulfonamides and associated args sulfonamides are one of the oldest antibiotic drugs which are still widely used nowadays boy roura et al 2018 it is one of the most extensively studied class of antibiotics and has been reported to be present at higher concentrations in several studies szekeres et al 2018 yao et al 2015 lin et al 2015 peng et al 2014 lópez serna et al 2013 fig 4 b highlights the relative distribution levels of sulfonamides in groundwater worldwide it was observed that the european groundwater is highly contaminated with sulfonamides among sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole is currently the most detected antibiotic in groundwater and its occurrence in the groundwater environment ranges from not detected to 1820 ng l displayed in table s2 this extremely high concentration of sulfamethoxazole was reported in shallow groundwater of taiwan which was significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities i e leakage of a landfill and wastewater discharge from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies lin et al 2015 the occurrence of 171 unique args in groundwater near municipal solid waste landfill has also been reported in which sul1 and sul2 sulfonamides args were among the most detected resistance genes after tetracycline args chen et al 2017 a significant abundance of sulfonamide args has also been observed in groundwater nearby sewage treatment plant and it was found that sul1 and sul2 had the maximum relative abundance in groundwater compared to other water bodies in beijing china liu et al 2019 the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 has also been observed in groundwater near a swine feedlot gao et al 2020 the widespread occurrence of sulfonamides in groundwater might be due to their weak sorption tendency to the soil low biodegradability and fast mobility which makes leaching of these antibiotics to groundwater easy boy roura et al 2018 6 3 quinolones and associated args the quinolone class of antibiotics was one of the most recent ones to be utilized in clinical practice carvalho and santos 2016 quinolones are polar generally amphoteric and display low water solubility at ph 6 8 boy roura et al 2018 they are utilized in human and veterinary drugs to treat bacterial infections carvalho and santos 2016 the relative distribution levels of quinolones in global groundwater are shown in fig 4 c which depicts the level of quinolones to be high in the groundwater of asia among the quinolone class ciprofloxacin is the most prescribed human antibiotic its groundwater occurrence has been reported at 14 000 ng l in samples collected from wells in villages falling within the proximity of effluent treatment plant that treats wastewater of nearly 90 bulk drug manufacturers fick et al 2009 the elevated concentrations of antibiotics in groundwater of barcelona spain revealed that groundwater samples were collected from the sites recharged by natural bank filtration that receives the highest percentage of effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps lopez et al 2015 the quinolones resistance genes qnrb and qnrs have been detected in brazil s unregistered housing estate wells tolentino et al 2019 the study conducted in china has also reported quinolone resistance genes qnra qnrb and qnrs in groundwater impacted by aqua farming tong et al 2020 although studies on groundwater contamination of quinolone args are scant the available literature suggests that quinolones have a high sorption tendency to soil and once they reach the groundwater their degradation rate slows down due to anaerobic conditions ma et al 2015 6 4 macrolides and associated args macrolides are clinically efficacious for treating common respiratory and dermal infections alvarez elcoro and enzler 1999 macrolides particularly erythromycin roxithromycin clarithromycin and azithromycin have been widely reported in groundwater bodies table s2 the relative distribution levels of macrolides in groundwater worldwide are summarized in fig 4 d when compared to other countries china has the highest data for macrolides concentration in groundwater however the concentrations of macrolides reported in other countries are higher than that of china reflecting different consumption behavior and their continuous input to the groundwater or its proximity to a point source on the contrary lower detection might be attributed to its less consumption or the geochemical processes limiting its transport to the groundwater carvalho and santos 2016 the study conducted by bartelt hunt et al reported the maximum concentration of erythromycin at 2380 ng l in shallow groundwater in the vicinity of two beef cattle amenities bartelt hunt et al 2011 the study demonstrated that groundwater underlying some livestock wastewater impoundments is prone to pharmaceutical contamination the data on the occurrence of azithromycin in groundwater is limited however the highest level of azithromycin was reported to be 1620 ng l in confined aquifers in spain the main contributors of pollution in this area were losses from the sewage system and water supply network lópez serna et al 2013 macrolide args have also been observed in groundwater and reported by many researchers szekeres et al 2018 chen et al 2017 tong et al 2020 böckelmann et al 2009 wu et al 2020 chen and colleagues found eight different erythromycin args in groundwater nearby municipal solid waste landfills in china chen et al 2017 the occurrence of macrolides in groundwater has been studied in france lopez et al 2015 germany lapworth et al 2012 and romania szekeres et al 2018 the erythromycin args e g erm b have also been observed in groundwater from rural and urban settings in romania contaminated by anthropogenic activities macrolides persistence in the water environment is attributable to their substantial and constant consumption in both human and veterinary medicines carvalho and santos 2016 more attention is now being focused on the presence of antibiotics in groundwater since the consumption of antibiotics is on the rise in animal production and human health across the world the increased emergence of args in groundwater is also an area of future research interest 7 occurrence of arbs in groundwater groundwater serves as a primary source of drinking water for billions of people around the world murphy et al 2017 perhaps finding the sources and identifying the pathways for arbs is critical little is known about their proliferation in groundwater gao et al 2020 andrade et al 2020 an analysis of the occurrence of arbs in the global groundwater samples showed that four fifths of the isolates obtained from samples were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents andrade et al 2020 a study conducted by akaniro and colleagues showed that about 86 of the isolates detected in groundwater samples were multidrug resistant the characterization and identification of these isolates showed that 30 different coliform bacteria belong to nine different genera namely salmonella citrobacter klebsiella aeromonas vibrio pseudomonas enterobacter escherichia and serratia the salmonella spp was highly prevalent with 23 3 abundance whereas enterobacter spp and pseudomonas spp were the isolates with the least occurrence having a prevalence of only 3 3 akaniro et al 2019 a study to investigate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant escherichia coli e coli isolated from the residential water wells in south central virginia showed that the contamination of groundwater not only poses a threat to the health of the potential users but also aggravates the problem by making treatment of the bacterial diseases difficult due presence of arbs kim et al 2018 the detection of a total of 92 strains obtained from well water showed that 65 of the bacterial strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 12 showed intermediate resistance the findings generated enough evidence to prove the prevalence of arbs in well water indicating that they are the reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes machado and bordalo 2014 the analysis of groundwater samples collected from the areas with relatively higher anthropogenic pressure showed a distinct bacterial community the taxonomic classification revealed the presence of 26 different phyla of which the most abundant ones include proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria szekeres et al 2018 the physicochemical analysis of the groundwater samples collected from uttar pradesh india showed it not to be suitable for drinking purposes the microbial analysis showed a high antibiotic resistance in e coli against amoxicillin and erythromycin moreover 12 isolates 75 were found to be multidrug resistant with index 20 sharma et al 2017 researchers tested the occurrence of enterococcus species resistant to various antibiotics in groundwater samples n 22 results indicated that 8 5 to 100 of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin penicillin g and vancomycin while 4 5 to 9 8 of the isolates were resistant to kanamycin and chloramphenicol ateba et al 2013 the isolates of vancomycin args indicated that these could pose a severe challenge to humans since infections caused by them are tough to cure ateba and maribeng 2011 a total of 101 isolates from groundwater were classified and tested for their resistance towards four commonly used antibiotics chloramphenicol tetracycline neomycin penicillin the study found 77 isolates to be resistant to penicillin 32 isolate to tetracycline and 18 to chloramphenicol el zanfaly et al 1988 a study conducted in the us isolated enterococcus spp which was resistant to erythromycin tetracycline and vancomycin in groundwater samples downstream and upstream of swine feedlots it was found that resistance to tetracycline and clindamycin was higher at the downgradient groundwater than that at the up gradient due to a malfunctioning septic tank up gradient sapkota et al 2007 dissemination and transport of bacteria into and within groundwater can be affected by various environmental factors such as characteristics of soil ph temperature nature and magnitude of organic matter redox potential water table depth salinity and other physiological parameters sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 chen and co workers observed inhibition of tetracycline bioavailability to e coli while exploring whole cell bioreporter and observed complexation of tetracycline with dissolved organic matter which led to a decrease in antibiotic resistance genes expression chen et al 2015 a study conducted to investigate the cell morphology found tetracycline susceptible bacteria to be less mobile in comparison to manure derived tetracycline resistant e coli walczak et al 2011 another research conducted on cell morphology suggests that bacteria s mobility has increased due to the enhanced forces of repulsion between the tetracycline resistant e coli and the sand quartz s anions despite both the strains being similar in sizes tetracycline resistant e coli proved to be more hydrophilic suggesting its ability to transport planktons in groundwater sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 walczak et al 2011 nevertheless there is a requirement for systematic studies on the impact of human activities such as septic tank livestock production facilities and environmental factors on transport and dissemination of arbs in groundwater especially in developing nations where consumption of untreated drinking water is common 8 nexus among antibiotics microbial communities environmental factors and args in groundwater 8 1 antibiotics vs args the correlation among antibiotics args microbial community and environmental factors in groundwater reported in various studies have been summarized in table 2 many studies have confirmed that antibiotics play an important role in inducing args qiao et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 nevertheless the existence of an expected correlation among antibiotics and args have not reached a uniform conclusion the study conducted by liu et al found significant positive correlations between the concentrations of antibiotics and their corresponding args in groundwater liu et al 2019 it was further revealed in other studies that antibiotics dispersion could contribute to disseminating resistance genes rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the tetracycline args tetg tetm and teto in village groundwater have been reported to be significantly correlated with the level of tetracycline at a given site it was suggested that hgt might play a role in args dissemination from wastewater to groundwater bodies li et al 2018 contrary to the above cited literature few studies also observed a zero correlation between antibiotic concentrations and arg abundance in groundwater szekeres et al 2018 tong et al 2020 8 2 args vs environmental factors the list of args correlated with environmental factors is summarized in table 2 a strong correlation exists between the abundance of args and environmental factors the study conducted by gao et al observed 74 4 of the variance for environmental factors and it was found that nutritional factors i e total organic carbon toc total phosphate tp total nitrogen tn and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n influenced args more than physicochemical parameters i e temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do gao et al 2020 a study reported a significant correlation between args and water quality parameters such as do nh4 n and toc which may be significantly affected by anthropogenic activities wu et al 2020 another study indicated that the detected args and their correlation with environmental factors were likely driven via surface groundwater interaction hence the relationship between args and environmental factors reflects the potential impacts of environmental factors on the dissemination of args in groundwater tong et al 2020 8 3 args vs microbial community the contamination profiles of args and microbial communities in groundwater have been investigated in a few studies szekeres et al 2018 gao et al 2020 tong et al 2020 a high correlation between args and 16s rrna gene was observed reflecting that pig farming causes args contamination in groundwater primarily through elevating the absolute abundance of microbes harboring args gao et al 2020 a strong connection was observed between erma and faecalibacterium genera in the groundwater of cluj napoca romania the study reported that resistance genes harbored the abundance of faecalibacterium in groundwater to 2 8 szekeres et al 2018 the occurrence of ermb and teto in the artificial groundwater recharge system also exhibited a correlation with the abundance of enterococci human pathogen with long survival capacity in water it was observed that 34 6 of enterococcus spp isolates were tetracycline resistant and 24 8 to erythromycin böckelmann et al 2009 a significant correlation was also observed between the args profile and microbial community it was revealed that microbial taxa might be a potential host of args chen et al 2017 9 ecological and human health implications of antibiotics args and arbs 9 1 environmental risks of antibiotics assessment of environmental risks has become imperative to estimate pharmaceuticals potential impacts on particular species in different environmental matrices ashfaq et al 2017 in this review ecological risk assessment of antibiotics is performed following the eu recognized standard method as a risk quotient approach by using measured environmental concentrations mec and predicted no effect concentrations pnec eq 1 the value of mec was obtained from the available literature table s2 in this review the highest reported concentrations of antibiotics were used to evaluate the worst case scenario of ecological risk associated with groundwater contamination according to generally used ranking criteria the value of hq 0 1 indicates a negligible risk to aquatic organisms 0 1 hq 1 implies moderate risk and hq 1 depicts high risk zhu et al 2019 1 hq mec pnec limited studies have reported the environmental risks associated with antibiotics groundwater contamination jurado et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 mutiyar and mittal 2014 here the acute toxicity data of the ten antibiotics tetracycline oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin norfloxacin ofloxacin enrofloxacin flumequine erythromycin and clarithromycin using different organisms p subcapitata algae d magna invertebrate and v fischeri bacteria was collected from the literature and toxicity database i e ecotox zhou et al 2019 the summary of acute ec50 values is given in table s4 an assessment factor with the value of 1000 was used for acute toxicity vestel et al 2016 pnecs were calculated by taking the acute ec50 value of antibiotics for the targeted species and dividing it by an assessment factor of 1000 the boxplots in fig 5 show that hq for most of antibiotics is very low indicating no risk to aquatic species table s5 however ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole pose medium to low risk hq 0 2 to p subcapitata fig 5 a while erythromycin exhibits moderate risk hq 0 5 to d magna fig 5 b furthermore flumequine also shows moderate risk hq 0 59 to v fischeri fig 5 c the hq estimated for different pharmaceuticals in spain s groundwater also indicated the negligible risk to aquatic organisms and for erythromycin it was reported as 0 46 which had medium to low risk for b calyciflorus and c dubia jurado et al 2019 another study also calculated hq for groundwater and reported minor to high risk for ciprofloxacin hq 0 1 to 23 jurado et al 2019 the contaminated groundwater is not likely to be the natural habitat of these species bacteria algae and invertebrates thus there is no direct exposure to antibiotic residues although the occurrence of antibiotics in groundwater did not pose a high risk compared to other environmental matrices their persistence in groundwater could promote resistance in bacteria scientific studies should be conducted to evaluate the chronic exposure of various antibiotics to humans via groundwater consumption moreover the remediation of contaminated groundwater is complicated because contaminants may persist in the underlying aquifers for an extended period jurado et al 2019 hence monitoring and control of antibiotics pollution in groundwater should be the prime concern among all the antibiotics consumed globally only three antibiotics from the macrolide class azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin were included in the first european union watch list of priority contaminants decision 2015 495 szekeres et al 2018 whereas in the second watch list only two antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin were categorized as priority pollutants for monitoring since these antibiotics are likely to reach groundwater bodies boy roura et al 2018 moreover owing to the diverse nature of pharmaceuticals and their anticipated risk to an aquatic environment the environmental agency for england and wales also proposed a ranking system for ten pollutants including only two antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole this categorization was based on their persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and occurrence from existing literature in various regions of the world and the availability of appropriate analytical methods for their estimation ebele et al 2017 9 2 human health risk assessment of antibiotics this review estimated the potential health risk of nine antibiotics ciprofloxacin norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine clarithromycin roxithromycin azithromycin tetracycline and oxytetracycline which have been frequently reported in groundwater of various regions in the world the risk quotient rq for each antibiotic was calculated by dividing the maximum measured concentration of antibiotics in groundwater by drinking water equivalent level dwel of seven categories of age from 1 year to 21 years eq 2 2 rq m c d w e l the guidelines from the world health organization who 2011 were followed to calculate dwel table s5 eq 3 3 dwel a d i b w d w i a b f o e where adi is the acceptable daily intake the dose which can be consumed daily over a lifetime having an insignificant risk of adverse effects table s6 bw is the body weight kg dwi is the volume of water drank per diem table s7 ab represents the portion of the substance ingested through consumption of water 1 for pharmaceutical drugs and foe is the exposure frequency 0 96 sharma et al 2019 the rq value 1 indicates the possibility of human health risk whereas a more comprehensive evaluation is required if the value ranges between 0 2 1 the rq value 0 2 is of no appreciable risk to human health sharma et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the rq calculated in this review for various antibiotics has been presented in fig 6 ciprofloxacin and azithromycin depicted relatively high human health risk as compared to other antibiotics among different age groups children 1 11 years had a higher risk followed by adults 20 years and adolescents 11 21 years nevertheless it is clear from the figure that potential health risk for all nine investigated antibiotics in groundwater is well below the 0 2 rq guideline this demonstrates that these antibiotics are unlikely to pose human health risks via drinking water consumption table s8 many other studies have also estimated the level of human health risk associated with groundwater and reported negligible risk to human health sharma et al 2019 riva et al 2018 therefore the human health risk assessment reported in studies to date showed that the concentration of different antibiotics present in groundwater is unlikely to pose potential risks to human health 9 3 human health implications of args and arbs the occurrence of antibiotics args and arbs in drinking water might disrupt the gastrointestinal microbiota balance and further affect human health becattini et al 2016 nevertheless it is still unclear whether arbs and args in groundwater have any substantial impact on humans exposure to arbs the human health risks are expected to be more distinct in developing nations than developed ones developing countries have inadequate health care systems characterized by an absence of necessary facilities and medications and elevated ailment burden which sequentially demands frequent use of antibiotics gwenzi et al 2018 the estimation of the human exposure risks to veterinary antibiotics args and bacteria like acinetobacter in the groundwater of jianzhong china found no immediate human health risks the study observed that an estimate of 10 billion magnitude cfu of acinetobacter would be ingested through drinking groundwater by a resident per day however it is still unclear whether environmental arbs and args in groundwater have any significant impact on human exposure to pathogenic arbs gao et al 2020 the study investigated the potential human health risks of antibiotic resistance in drinking water reported that the consumption of drinking water polluted with arbs and args might contribute to the growth of antibiotic resistance in humans sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 antibiotic resistance might result in enhanced virulence pathogenicity disease outbreaks and transmission which leads to prolonged morbidity and mortality berendonk et al 2015 since evidence on the implications of antibiotic resistance in the groundwater to human health remains limited several knowledge gaps still exist it calls for improvement in the risk assessment methodologies to address the potential link between antibiotic resistance and other environmental stressors 10 research challenges and future perspectives in recent years considerable concern has been made to promote the prudent use of antibiotics and control antibiotics resistance in aquatic environment but due to the lack of data and understanding on fate and potential risks of antibiotics occurrence in the groundwater their long term impacts in ecological environment are not clearly understood therefore the inescapable consequences of these antibiotics args and arbs have become a global challenge hence systematic studies should be conducted on the impacts of human activities and environmental factors associated with the transport of antibiotics and args in groundwater in this regard special consideration should be taken for developing regions where consumption of untreated drinking water is common and data is scant due to limited research facilities the occurrence of antibiotics metabolites has been reported to be higher than parent compounds in groundwater because of their higher solubility and persistence garcía galán et al 2011 considering the inevitable use of antibiotics and limited availability of data on hazardous effects of antibiotics metabolites this review highlights the importance of conducting studies to monitor and find methodologies to diminish the groundwater adulteration of antibiotics and their metabolites the occurrence of args in groundwater has not been screened in many developing and developed countries except china and the us hence a comprehensive regional and countrywide groundwater survey should be conducted to assess args occurrence and distribution in groundwater moreover mathematical modeling has played an essential role in improving our understanding of antibiotic resistance various studies have conducted modeling research to evaluate factors influencing the dissemination of resistant bacteria in the environment greenfield et al 2018 smith et al 2002 niewiadomska et al 2019 however with rising concern about the spread of antibiotics resistance and increased use of mathematical models to better understand the mechanisms behind args spread there is a need for the development of an advanced framework that can help guide model choice for future analyses furthermore the fate and transport of args should be quantitatively assessed through mathematical modeling approaches that consider args replication and hgt propagation dynamics as well as natural attenuation mechanisms e g hydrolysis photolysis and arg sedimentation the evidence about the dose response curves and exposure assessment data associated with arbs and args in groundwater is not developed yet therefore quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been recommended as a suitable method to evaluate and quantify the human health risk amarasiri et al 2019 certain studies offered findings on the presence of antibiotics in groundwater yet few emphasized args existence and the processes that influence their existence in the groundwater these investigations ignore the detailed analysis of the hydrogeological context of the research and the presence of antibiotics and args within groundwater using a regional hydrogeological point of view which is essential to deal with management strategies because of this complexity the status and entry of antibiotics into groundwater supplies are not clearly understood comprehensive research is required to understand better hydrogeology s effect on the distribution of antibiotics and the spread of args in groundwater in the extensive research that has been undertaken by various institutions it is noteworthy to mention that environmental reservoirs that house most of the groundwater are on the rise to be viewed as one of the most critical hotspots for various pathogens gaining antibiotic resistance therefore prescription of antibiotics can be rationalized based on the detection and identification of bacterial pathogens through the point of care poc thus can help in regulating and reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics which can further enhance and prolong the effectiveness of such antibiotics as the field of poc detection tests is growing and advancing reliance on empirical antimicrobial treatment is losing its efficacy therefore quick poc tests should be employed for bacterial infections diagnosis before antimicrobials are prescribed to patients improving the results and limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance reali et al 2019 the occurrence of arbs and args are reported in urban watersheds without point source adulteration signifying that naturally produced antimicrobials might act as selective agents for the resistance of antibiotics in the watersheds low et al 2016 therefore any water that has been linked with agricultural production units wwtps aquafarming swine production facilities or hospital waste where antibiotics are highly used should be extensively examined before reusing it moreover in developing regions due to the lack of proper waste handling systems comprehensive point and nonpoint source based monitoring of the groundwater and watersheds should be introduced to reap the benefits of good health 11 conclusions and take home message the current review provides comprehensive information about the occurrence pattern of most frequently detected antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater globally the reviewed studies suggested sulfonamides macrolides quinolones and tetracycline classes of antibiotics to be more prevalent in groundwater bodies owing to their significance in human and veterinary medicines and persistence in groundwater although these antibiotics classes are widely detected in groundwater the data on the occurrence of sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines is more prevalent in various regions of the world the literature on the occurrence of tetracyclines and sulfonamides resistance genes is more abundant reflecting their continuous input in the groundwater it was found that groundwater lying in nearby proximity of point sources such as landfill leachates wastewater discharge aquaculture runoff discharge from hospitals or drug manufacturing industries and discharge from swine production facilities are more contaminated with antibiotics residues resistance genes and resistant bacteria however it was observed that intensive swine farming is a significant source contributing to args and arbs in groundwater this review further collates the knowledge on the correlation between antibiotics args environmental factors and the microbial community the relationship between args and environmental factors reflects the potential impacts of environmental factors on disseminating args in groundwater the nexus between args profile and microbial community revealed that microbial taxa might be the potential host of args the relationship between antibiotics and args suggests that antibiotics dispersion in groundwater leads to the enhanced dissemination of args in groundwater to evaluate the worst case scenario the highest reported antibiotics values were selected from published literature to estimate ecological and human health risks the risk assessment showed the negligible risk to human health and medium to moderate ecological risks to antibiotics were estimated to aquatic species therefore human health and environmental risk from exposure to antibiotics may be of concern especially because groundwater is an essential source of drinking water in many regions of the world considering the inescapable use of antibiotics this review highlights the point and non point source based monitoring to reduce the groundwater adulteration with antibiotics args and arbs and support future regulatory measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17474,the discovery and evolution of antibiotics for humans and animals are among the most significant milestones of the 20th century however antibiotics play a significant role in the induction and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in groundwater that has recently become the primary environmental concern they are administrated to humans and animals on a large scale and are persistent in the environment long term impacts of antibiotics in the ecological environment are not still clearly understood and their occurrence and consequences have become an important research topic worldwide the hotspot reservoirs of antibiotics and args include medical facilities livestock farming aquaculture landfills on site sanitation systems sewage and wastewater treatment plants our meta analysis demonstrated that antibiotics including ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and tetracycline were found at high concentrations while sulfonamide and tetracycline args were more prevalent in groundwater moreover the highest reported concentrations of targeted antibiotics were used to calculate hazard quotient hq and risk quotient rq in global groundwater bodies to estimate environmental and human health risks respectively due to limited available ecotoxicity data rq and hq can only be calculated for a few antibiotics in groundwater the risk assessment of antibiotics demonstrated that antibiotics with their current groundwater levels pose no human health risks whereas only ciprofloxacin erythromycin flumequine and sulfamethoxazole revealed moderate to low risks to aquatic species the occurrence of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs in groundwater is also not likely to pose human health risk but consumption of groundwater contaminated with args and arbs might contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance in humans the present review also sheds light on the relationship between args antibiotics microbial communities and environmental factors in groundwater and reported a significant correlation between them it also addresses prospects for future outlooks into further areas of relevant research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria groundwater human health environmental risk 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of freshwater globally which accounts for 97 of available freshwater on earth while the remaining 3 is primarily surface water jurado et al 2019 it is considered as the most vital source of public water supply in many regions of the world szekeres et al 2018 however anthropogenic activities mainly industrial and agricultural threaten groundwater quality because many pollutants can potentially reach the aquifers jurado et al 2019 some newly recognized classes of environmental contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have become a subject of scientific and public concern because of their potential bioactive properties and unknown effects on the water environment pompei et al 2019 among ppcps antibiotics are a widely studied class that prevents or hinders microorganism s growth e g bacteria fungi and protozoa liu et al 2019 the major antibiotics classification and their representative drugs are displayed in table s1 antibiotics can accumulate in water bodies because they are only partially degraded in the environment and pose ecological and human health risks kümmerer 2009 various veterinary and human drugs are continuously released into the environment during manufacturing disposal or metabolic excretions sharma et al 2019 the antibiotics detected in groundwater from various regions vary in concentrations suggesting different consumption patterns the consumption pattern of antibiotics in household and agriculture sectors differs across regions and nations in the developing world and even antibiotics banned in developed countries are still being utilized in developing nations adebowale et al 2016 the assessment of the antibiotic consumption of 76 countries found that the global consumption rate increased by 39 during the period 2000 2015 to 42 3 billion defined daily dose ddds klein et al 2018 in high income countries an increase of 6 from 9 7 to 10 3 billion ddds in antibiotic consumption has been observed from 2000 to 2015 whereas a modest drop of 4 from 26 8 to 25 7 ddds in the consumption rate was reported for every 1000 inhabitants day however the low to middle income countries observed an increase of 114 from 11 4 to 24 5 billion ddds in antibiotic consumption and for every 1000 inhabitants day the antibiotic consumption rate showed an increase of 77 from 7 6 to 13 5 ddds zhang et al 2018 therefore per capita antibiotic consumption was reported to be high in high income countries but comparatively less in low and middle income countries for instance in brazil china and india dai et al 2019 the continuous release of these antibiotics into groundwater select for antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and antibiotic resistance genes args which exhibit significant ecological and human health concerns worldwide gao et al 2020 resistant bacteria and genes when entering a healthy organism tend to proliferate in there increasing in number therefore forming a resistance module against the antibiotic within the organisms singer et al 2016 as a result the curative abilities of the antibiotics are reduced also other methods like sewage sludge and animal manure that are used in agricultural lands need to be looked into to control the levels of arbs and args that find their way to the healthy organisms gao et al 2012 studies have shown that antibiotics make their way into the water reservoirs and aquatic environments due to the inability of treatment plants to remove them altogether ebele et al 2017 they have been detected in various environmental matrices especially in the aquatic environment they possess high biological activity even at low concentrations and can cause toxic effects to human and aquatic life it has been reported that even low level exposure ng l shows significant impacts in impairing the normal body function especially if the dose was administered without necessity ahmed et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 therapeutic drugs like antibiotics may retain their properties or convert into more active compounds in the aquatic environment their use is unlikely to be restricted owing to the benefits they provide yang et al 2017 however the absence of advanced treatment processes and the unregulated use and sale of such products in developing countries further aggravates the problem kumar et al 2019 as a way forward it is essential to develop a correlation between antibiotics their metabolites and conventional water quality parameters yang et al 2013 antibiotics susceptibility to various chemical biological and physical treatment processes varies due to the diverse nature of their chemical classes this requires further comprehensive studies to understand better their behaviour in aquatic environment and treatment processes required for abatement le minh et al 2010 no comprehensive review on the occurrence of antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater has been conducted until now in this review we collate the knowledge on the timeline of antibiotics and resistance development sources consumption occurrence dissemination and risk of antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater the objectives were 1 to summarise the sources exposure pathways and factors affecting the transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater 2 to investigate the contamination profiles of antibiotics and args with high concentrations in groundwater through meta analysis 3 to understand the occurrence distribution and potential drivers of arbs in groundwater 4 to elucidate the potential relationship between antibiotics args arbs and environmental factors in groundwater and 5 to estimate the environmental risks against different aquatic species and human health risks linked with exposure to antibiotics args and arbs through groundwater

and resistance development the first effective antibiotics were introduced in 1937 davies and davies 2010 with the discovery of new antibiotics and their overuse throughout history various resistance mechanisms have emerged and evolved limiting antibiotics application ventola 2015 fig 1 depicts the order of discovery and resistance development for primary antibiotics antibiotic resistance is considered as an apocalyptic threat to living beings because of the risk of returning to the pre antibiotics era carvalho and santos 2016 the detailed reviews on antibiotics discovery and their resistance timeline have been published in many literatures davies and davies 2010 ventola 2015 danso et al 2019 4 sources and exposure pathways of antibiotics and args in groundwater the primary exposure pathways of antibiotics and args in groundwater are displayed in fig 2 antibiotics may enter groundwater through leaky sewerage or manure storage wastewater effluent landfill leachate livestock farming discharges from hospitals industrial premises and animal production facilities runoff from aquaculture and agricultural areas treated with manure or wastewater gao et al 2020 sui et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2020 the occurrence of args in groundwater nearby landfills provides evidence that landfills are an underappreciated hotspot of antibiotic resistance causing args dissemination via flowing contaminated groundwater chen et al 2017 it was observed that long term aquaculture activities in the honghu lake china had impacted on the dissemination of some antibiotics and their associated args tetg tetq and tetx in the groundwater fishponds or aquafarms can act as reservoirs for antibiotics and args eventually reaching groundwater tong et al 2020 swine farming was reported to be a major source of args spread in groundwater bodies gao et al 2020 awad et al 2014 li et al 2018 chee sanford et al 2001 resistant bacteria are expected to follow the route of dispersal similar to antibiotics berglund 2015 this can result in resistance hotspot environments where antibiotics args resistant bacteria and environmental bacterial flora potential arbs are mixed horizontal gene transfer hgt in such hotspots is a major factor for forming new resistant strains wellington et al 2013 it is the main mechanism of args transfer among the diversity of bacteria including environmental non pathogenic human pathogenic gram positive and negative via mobile dna elements such as plasmids and transposons either with or without mobile integrons aminov 2011 mobile integrons can recognize and acquire gene cassettes containing args while chromosomal integrons carry a large number of gene cassettes khan et al 2013 args spread due to class1 integrons in pathogens is a serious challenge to clinical therapy stalder et al 2012 humans can be exposed to resistant bacteria by numerous routes including consumption of contaminated crops drinking contaminated groundwater etc in humans resistant bacteria can spread args to the human microbiome wellington et al 2013 allen et al 2010 5 factors affecting transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater the transport and transformation of antibiotics in groundwater are primarily influenced by several environmental factors and physicochemical properties of the compounds boy roura et al 2018 the vital factors involved in the transport and fate of antibiotics and args in groundwater are portrayed in fig 3 5 1 reactivity factors 5 1 1 sorption sorption is critical in controlling the passage of antibiotics to groundwater yang et al 2017 the distribution coefficient kd characterizes the sorptive exchange of antibiotics between water and solid phases the kd for organic compounds varies with soil type and its organic carbon water partition coefficient koc boy roura et al 2018 antibiotics are complex molecules and their sorption behavior can be determined considering the initial concentration ionic strength solid to liquid ratio temperature ph and octanol water partition coefficient kow loftin et al 2008 5 1 2 biodegradation antibiotics biodegradability is determined by their molecular structure and physicochemical properties e g sulfamethoxazole experienced less biodegradability than other antibiotics in microcosm studies boy roura et al 2018 a study on anaerobic biodegradation of antibiotics showed 85 and 62 removal of ciprofloxacin under sulfate and nitrate reducing environments respectively while sulfamethoxazole exhibited no biodegradability martins et al 2018 redox conditions also control pharmaceuticals biodegradation in groundwater redox dependent biodegradation via tank aeration experiments showed an efficient removal of doxycycline under aerobic conditions whereas for clarithromycin clindamycin and roxithromycin only under anaerobic conditions gartiser et al 2007 moreover anaerobic conditions are also reported to be prevalent in the groundwater environment which can play a significant role in the biodegradation of antibiotics as previously reported for wwtps zhao et al 2020 environmental conditions also show various influences on antibiotics biodegradation sui et al showed dissimilarity in tetracycline and chlortetracycline biodegradation at varying temperatures and ph whereas the degradation of sulfonamides was less affected by changes in temperature and ph signifying groundwater removal mechanisms might not be ph dependent reactions i e hydrolysis sui et al 2015 microorganisms in groundwater are not abundant and diverse as compared to those present in soil lapworth et al 2012 hence antibiotics in groundwater might undergo incomplete degradation and potentially convert to hazardous metabolites or remain unchanged in groundwater for a long time sui et al 2015 the study conducted by galán et al highlighted the occurrence of five acetylated metabolites of sulfonamides in groundwater of spain it was found that sulfamerazine metabolite n 4 acetylsulfamerazine occurred more frequently than their parent compound sulfamerazine with the maximum concentration of 18 ng l furthermore the occurrence of n 4 acetylsulfapyridine metabolite of sulfapyridine was also reported to be higher in the groundwater this study further showed that antibiotics metabolites are more soluble and exhibit higher stability than their parent compounds garcía galán et al 2011 5 1 3 hydrochemical conditions hydrochemistry of groundwater plays a vital role in antibiotics behavior in groundwater menció and mas pla 2019 sulfamethoxazole showed greater mobility in groundwater than ciprofloxacin under the effects of ionic strength and ph chen et al 2011 transportation of reactive components of antibiotics has significance in their existence in groundwater thus the retardation factor provides a quantitative idea of antibiotics migration rate concerning groundwater flow boy roura et al 2018 5 2 physicochemical factors selective pressure is the main contributor in hgt of args and their distribution in groundwater allen et al 2010 amarasiri et al 2019 the exponential increase in production and usage of antibiotics for various purposes including the treatment of ailments and growth enhancement are the major causal factors of this selective pressure zhang et al 2009 an increase in such selective pressure has been found to facilitate bacteria in the attainment of args further facilitating args spread luo et al 2005 the antibiotics found at low sub inhibitory concentrations lead to an increase in args spread in the water environment greenfield et al 2018 for instance sulfamethoxazole slightly increased antibiotic resistance s transfer frequency at sub inhibitory concentration of antibiotics in an aquatic environment jutkina et al 2018 the role of metals e g hg zn cu and cd in the co selection of antibiotic resistance might be another important factor contributing towards args spread amarasiri et al 2019 compared with control areas bacteria in metal contaminated environments easily obtain antibiotic resistance phenotypes zhang et al 2009 co selection mechanisms include co resistance and cross resistance co resistance occurs when a single genetic element carries various resistance determinants whereas in cross resistance a single genetic determinant leads to antibiotic as well as metal resistance thus metal contamination is a major contributor to antibiotic resistance and is crucial in environmental and clinical settings baker austin et al 2006 since the literature on fate and transport of args in groundwater is limited more comprehensive research is needed to identify the key factors influencing args spread 5 3 hydrogeological factors aquifers geological features and hydrological sources contribute to its recharge and antibiotic content menció and mas pla 2019 streamflow of the river is also expected to contribute to antibiotic content in wells nearby rainfall recharge infiltrates manure that applied as fertilizer to crops causing pollutants to enter the vadose zone and later the aquifer partially saturated zones temporally retain pollutants and progressively leach them to groundwater by gravity flow after precipitation boy roura et al 2018 k oreje et al 2020 rainfall is also an important factor that plays a vital role in the dissemination of args in groundwater the study conducted by huang and colleagues reported that high intensity rainfall drove the dissemination of tetracycline and sulfonamide args to groundwater with the assistance of a stream huang et al 2019 6 occurrence and spatial distribution of antibiotics and args in groundwater a global scenario studies on the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and args in the groundwater have been conducted in many regions worldwide carvalho and santos 2016 liu and wong 2013 the levels of antibiotics and args in groundwater vary across the countries and amongst different regions of the same country for developed regions data on antibiotics and args groundwater contamination are more prevalent in europe and the united states whereas in developing regions the data is more prevalent in china in asia china is the only country with well established literature on the occurrence of antibiotics and their related genes in groundwater liu and wong 2013 whereas in the american continent the united states has the highest number of published studies on the groundwater level of antibiotics and args chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 mackie et al 2006 the data on the occurrence of antibiotics in africa is scarce due to the limited availability of analytical techniques k oreje et al 2020 however considerable data is available in europe compared to other countries carvalho and santos 2016 this review compares the reported concentrations of sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and tetracyclines antibiotics in groundwater globally table s2 the occurrence of args and methodologies used to detect args in groundwater have also been summarized in table 1 different types of args reported in the groundwater have been described in table s3 6 1 tetracyclines and associated args tetracyclines are a broad class of veterinary drugs extensively used worldwide dai et al 2019 the application of tetracycline antibiotics to animal feed additives was first approved by the us food and drug administration fda in 1950 daghrir and drogui 2013 it is ranked second in production and consumption worldwide whereas ranked first in china with respect to its usage kovalakova et al 2020 china and the us are the largest tetracycline producers due to increased animal farming and maximum use of associated antibiotics in the agricultural sector as a feed supplement to promote growth dai et al 2019 the global contamination level of tetracyclines in groundwater is shown in fig 4 a the elevated concentration of tetracyclines in groundwater was reported in the us and canada america followed by europe and asia fig 4 a among the tetracycline antibiotics tetracycline is the most prescribed veterinary antibiotic found with the highest concentration of approximately 400 ng l in groundwater of the us which were polluted by swine confinement facilities mackie et al 2006 tetracycline and its related args were also observed in groundwater of cluj napoca romania impacted by the swine farms with no proper waste handling system szekeres et al 2018 the existence of tetracycline args has been found more frequently in china s groundwater because of its highest production 97 000 tons year in the region followed by the us canada and spain dai et al 2019 according to chee sanford et al the presence of the tetracycline args in deep wells is higher than shallow wells this outlines that the impurities may get vertically distributed dependent on the hydrogeology of the location as a result the movement and seepage of the underlying inlets cause tetracycline args to enter groundwater the consumption of groundwater contaminated with tetracyclines provides a possible way by which args enter the human and animal food chains chee sanford et al 2001 groundwater wells next to swine production facilities contain high levels of tetracycline and associated args than the wells located more distant from swine farming production facilities koike et al 2007 it was found that swine production facilities are the potential source of tetracyclines and related genes in groundwater szekeres et al 2018 gao et al 2020 tong et al 2020 chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 mackie et al 2006 frey et al 2015 yao et al 2015 tong et al 2014 other than aquaculture tong et al 2020 yao et al 2017 and livestock production dai et al 2019 daghrir and drogui 2013 yao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 6 2 sulfonamides and associated args sulfonamides are one of the oldest antibiotic drugs which are still widely used nowadays boy roura et al 2018 it is one of the most extensively studied class of antibiotics and has been reported to be present at higher concentrations in several studies szekeres et al 2018 yao et al 2015 lin et al 2015 peng et al 2014 lópez serna et al 2013 fig 4 b highlights the relative distribution levels of sulfonamides in groundwater worldwide it was observed that the european groundwater is highly contaminated with sulfonamides among sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole is currently the most detected antibiotic in groundwater and its occurrence in the groundwater environment ranges from not detected to 1820 ng l displayed in table s2 this extremely high concentration of sulfamethoxazole was reported in shallow groundwater of taiwan which was significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities i e leakage of a landfill and wastewater discharge from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies lin et al 2015 the occurrence of 171 unique args in groundwater near municipal solid waste landfill has also been reported in which sul1 and sul2 sulfonamides args were among the most detected resistance genes after tetracycline args chen et al 2017 a significant abundance of sulfonamide args has also been observed in groundwater nearby sewage treatment plant and it was found that sul1 and sul2 had the maximum relative abundance in groundwater compared to other water bodies in beijing china liu et al 2019 the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 has also been observed in groundwater near a swine feedlot gao et al 2020 the widespread occurrence of sulfonamides in groundwater might be due to their weak sorption tendency to the soil low biodegradability and fast mobility which makes leaching of these antibiotics to groundwater easy boy roura et al 2018 6 3 quinolones and associated args the quinolone class of antibiotics was one of the most recent ones to be utilized in clinical practice carvalho and santos 2016 quinolones are polar generally amphoteric and display low water solubility at ph 6 8 boy roura et al 2018 they are utilized in human and veterinary drugs to treat bacterial infections carvalho and santos 2016 the relative distribution levels of quinolones in global groundwater are shown in fig 4 c which depicts the level of quinolones to be high in the groundwater of asia among the quinolone class ciprofloxacin is the most prescribed human antibiotic its groundwater occurrence has been reported at 14 000 ng l in samples collected from wells in villages falling within the proximity of effluent treatment plant that treats wastewater of nearly 90 bulk drug manufacturers fick et al 2009 the elevated concentrations of antibiotics in groundwater of barcelona spain revealed that groundwater samples were collected from the sites recharged by natural bank filtration that receives the highest percentage of effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps lopez et al 2015 the quinolones resistance genes qnrb and qnrs have been detected in brazil s unregistered housing estate wells tolentino et al 2019 the study conducted in china has also reported quinolone resistance genes qnra qnrb and qnrs in groundwater impacted by aqua farming tong et al 2020 although studies on groundwater contamination of quinolone args are scant the available literature suggests that quinolones have a high sorption tendency to soil and once they reach the groundwater their degradation rate slows down due to anaerobic conditions ma et al 2015 6 4 macrolides and associated args macrolides are clinically efficacious for treating common respiratory and dermal infections alvarez elcoro and enzler 1999 macrolides particularly erythromycin roxithromycin clarithromycin and azithromycin have been widely reported in groundwater bodies table s2 the relative distribution levels of macrolides in groundwater worldwide are summarized in fig 4 d when compared to other countries china has the highest data for macrolides concentration in groundwater however the concentrations of macrolides reported in other countries are higher than that of china reflecting different consumption behavior and their continuous input to the groundwater or its proximity to a point source on the contrary lower detection might be attributed to its less consumption or the geochemical processes limiting its transport to the groundwater carvalho and santos 2016 the study conducted by bartelt hunt et al reported the maximum concentration of erythromycin at 2380 ng l in shallow groundwater in the vicinity of two beef cattle amenities bartelt hunt et al 2011 the study demonstrated that groundwater underlying some livestock wastewater impoundments is prone to pharmaceutical contamination the data on the occurrence of azithromycin in groundwater is limited however the highest level of azithromycin was reported to be 1620 ng l in confined aquifers in spain the main contributors of pollution in this area were losses from the sewage system and water supply network lópez serna et al 2013 macrolide args have also been observed in groundwater and reported by many researchers szekeres et al 2018 chen et al 2017 tong et al 2020 böckelmann et al 2009 wu et al 2020 chen and colleagues found eight different erythromycin args in groundwater nearby municipal solid waste landfills in china chen et al 2017 the occurrence of macrolides in groundwater has been studied in france lopez et al 2015 germany lapworth et al 2012 and romania szekeres et al 2018 the erythromycin args e g erm b have also been observed in groundwater from rural and urban settings in romania contaminated by anthropogenic activities macrolides persistence in the water environment is attributable to their substantial and constant consumption in both human and veterinary medicines carvalho and santos 2016 more attention is now being focused on the presence of antibiotics in groundwater since the consumption of antibiotics is on the rise in animal production and human health across the world the increased emergence of args in groundwater is also an area of future research interest 7 occurrence of arbs in groundwater groundwater serves as a primary source of drinking water for billions of people around the world murphy et al 2017 perhaps finding the sources and identifying the pathways for arbs is critical little is known about their proliferation in groundwater gao et al 2020 andrade et al 2020 an analysis of the occurrence of arbs in the global groundwater samples showed that four fifths of the isolates obtained from samples were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents andrade et al 2020 a study conducted by akaniro and colleagues showed that about 86 of the isolates detected in groundwater samples were multidrug resistant the characterization and identification of these isolates showed that 30 different coliform bacteria belong to nine different genera namely salmonella citrobacter klebsiella aeromonas vibrio pseudomonas enterobacter escherichia and serratia the salmonella spp was highly prevalent with 23 3 abundance whereas enterobacter spp and pseudomonas spp were the isolates with the least occurrence having a prevalence of only 3 3 akaniro et al 2019 a study to investigate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant escherichia coli e coli isolated from the residential water wells in south central virginia showed that the contamination of groundwater not only poses a threat to the health of the potential users but also aggravates the problem by making treatment of the bacterial diseases difficult due presence of arbs kim et al 2018 the detection of a total of 92 strains obtained from well water showed that 65 of the bacterial strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 12 showed intermediate resistance the findings generated enough evidence to prove the prevalence of arbs in well water indicating that they are the reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes machado and bordalo 2014 the analysis of groundwater samples collected from the areas with relatively higher anthropogenic pressure showed a distinct bacterial community the taxonomic classification revealed the presence of 26 different phyla of which the most abundant ones include proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria szekeres et al 2018 the physicochemical analysis of the groundwater samples collected from uttar pradesh india showed it not to be suitable for drinking purposes the microbial analysis showed a high antibiotic resistance in e coli against amoxicillin and erythromycin moreover 12 isolates 75 were found to be multidrug resistant with index 20 sharma et al 2017 researchers tested the occurrence of enterococcus species resistant to various antibiotics in groundwater samples n 22 results indicated that 8 5 to 100 of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin penicillin g and vancomycin while 4 5 to 9 8 of the isolates were resistant to kanamycin and chloramphenicol ateba et al 2013 the isolates of vancomycin args indicated that these could pose a severe challenge to humans since infections caused by them are tough to cure ateba and maribeng 2011 a total of 101 isolates from groundwater were classified and tested for their resistance towards four commonly used antibiotics chloramphenicol tetracycline neomycin penicillin the study found 77 isolates to be resistant to penicillin 32 isolate to tetracycline and 18 to chloramphenicol el zanfaly et al 1988 a study conducted in the us isolated enterococcus spp which was resistant to erythromycin tetracycline and vancomycin in groundwater samples downstream and upstream of swine feedlots it was found that resistance to tetracycline and clindamycin was higher at the downgradient groundwater than that at the up gradient due to a malfunctioning septic tank up gradient sapkota et al 2007 dissemination and transport of bacteria into and within groundwater can be affected by various environmental factors such as characteristics of soil ph temperature nature and magnitude of organic matter redox potential water table depth salinity and other physiological parameters sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 chen and co workers observed inhibition of tetracycline bioavailability to e coli while exploring whole cell bioreporter and observed complexation of tetracycline with dissolved organic matter which led to a decrease in antibiotic resistance genes expression chen et al 2015 a study conducted to investigate the cell morphology found tetracycline susceptible bacteria to be less mobile in comparison to manure derived tetracycline resistant e coli walczak et al 2011 another research conducted on cell morphology suggests that bacteria s mobility has increased due to the enhanced forces of repulsion between the tetracycline resistant e coli and the sand quartz s anions despite both the strains being similar in sizes tetracycline resistant e coli proved to be more hydrophilic suggesting its ability to transport planktons in groundwater sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 walczak et al 2011 nevertheless there is a requirement for systematic studies on the impact of human activities such as septic tank livestock production facilities and environmental factors on transport and dissemination of arbs in groundwater especially in developing nations where consumption of untreated drinking water is common 8 nexus among antibiotics microbial communities environmental factors and args in groundwater 8 1 antibiotics vs args the correlation among antibiotics args microbial community and environmental factors in groundwater reported in various studies have been summarized in table 2 many studies have confirmed that antibiotics play an important role in inducing args qiao et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 nevertheless the existence of an expected correlation among antibiotics and args have not reached a uniform conclusion the study conducted by liu et al found significant positive correlations between the concentrations of antibiotics and their corresponding args in groundwater liu et al 2019 it was further revealed in other studies that antibiotics dispersion could contribute to disseminating resistance genes rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the tetracycline args tetg tetm and teto in village groundwater have been reported to be significantly correlated with the level of tetracycline at a given site it was suggested that hgt might play a role in args dissemination from wastewater to groundwater bodies li et al 2018 contrary to the above cited literature few studies also observed a zero correlation between antibiotic concentrations and arg abundance in groundwater szekeres et al 2018 tong et al 2020 8 2 args vs environmental factors the list of args correlated with environmental factors is summarized in table 2 a strong correlation exists between the abundance of args and environmental factors the study conducted by gao et al observed 74 4 of the variance for environmental factors and it was found that nutritional factors i e total organic carbon toc total phosphate tp total nitrogen tn and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n influenced args more than physicochemical parameters i e temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do gao et al 2020 a study reported a significant correlation between args and water quality parameters such as do nh4 n and toc which may be significantly affected by anthropogenic activities wu et al 2020 another study indicated that the detected args and their correlation with environmental factors were likely driven via surface groundwater interaction hence the relationship between args and environmental factors reflects the potential impacts of environmental factors on the dissemination of args in groundwater tong et al 2020 8 3 args vs microbial community the contamination profiles of args and microbial communities in groundwater have been investigated in a few studies szekeres et al 2018 gao et al 2020 tong et al 2020 a high correlation between args and 16s rrna gene was observed reflecting that pig farming causes args contamination in groundwater primarily through elevating the absolute abundance of microbes harboring args gao et al 2020 a strong connection was observed between erma and faecalibacterium genera in the groundwater of cluj napoca romania the study reported that resistance genes harbored the abundance of faecalibacterium in groundwater to 2 8 szekeres et al 2018 the occurrence of ermb and teto in the artificial groundwater recharge system also exhibited a correlation with the abundance of enterococci human pathogen with long survival capacity in water it was observed that 34 6 of enterococcus spp isolates were tetracycline resistant and 24 8 to erythromycin böckelmann et al 2009 a significant correlation was also observed between the args profile and microbial community it was revealed that microbial taxa might be a potential host of args chen et al 2017 9 ecological and human health implications of antibiotics args and arbs 9 1 environmental risks of antibiotics assessment of environmental risks has become imperative to estimate pharmaceuticals potential impacts on particular species in different environmental matrices ashfaq et al 2017 in this review ecological risk assessment of antibiotics is performed following the eu recognized standard method as a risk quotient approach by using measured environmental concentrations mec and predicted no effect concentrations pnec eq 1 the value of mec was obtained from the available literature table s2 in this review the highest reported concentrations of antibiotics were used to evaluate the worst case scenario of ecological risk associated with groundwater contamination according to generally used ranking criteria the value of hq 0 1 indicates a negligible risk to aquatic organisms 0 1 hq 1 implies moderate risk and hq 1 depicts high risk zhu et al 2019 1 hq mec pnec limited studies have reported the environmental risks associated with antibiotics groundwater contamination jurado et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 mutiyar and mittal 2014 here the acute toxicity data of the ten antibiotics tetracycline oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin norfloxacin ofloxacin enrofloxacin flumequine erythromycin and clarithromycin using different organisms p subcapitata algae d magna invertebrate and v fischeri bacteria was collected from the literature and toxicity database i e ecotox zhou et al 2019 the summary of acute ec50 values is given in table s4 an assessment factor with the value of 1000 was used for acute toxicity vestel et al 2016 pnecs were calculated by taking the acute ec50 value of antibiotics for the targeted species and dividing it by an assessment factor of 1000 the boxplots in fig 5 show that hq for most of antibiotics is very low indicating no risk to aquatic species table s5 however ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole pose medium to low risk hq 0 2 to p subcapitata fig 5 a while erythromycin exhibits moderate risk hq 0 5 to d magna fig 5 b furthermore flumequine also shows moderate risk hq 0 59 to v fischeri fig 5 c the hq estimated for different pharmaceuticals in spain s groundwater also indicated the negligible risk to aquatic organisms and for erythromycin it was reported as 0 46 which had medium to low risk for b calyciflorus and c dubia jurado et al 2019 another study also calculated hq for groundwater and reported minor to high risk for ciprofloxacin hq 0 1 to 23 jurado et al 2019 the contaminated groundwater is not likely to be the natural habitat of these species bacteria algae and invertebrates thus there is no direct exposure to antibiotic residues although the occurrence of antibiotics in groundwater did not pose a high risk compared to other environmental matrices their persistence in groundwater could promote resistance in bacteria scientific studies should be conducted to evaluate the chronic exposure of various antibiotics to humans via groundwater consumption moreover the remediation of contaminated groundwater is complicated because contaminants may persist in the underlying aquifers for an extended period jurado et al 2019 hence monitoring and control of antibiotics pollution in groundwater should be the prime concern among all the antibiotics consumed globally only three antibiotics from the macrolide class azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin were included in the first european union watch list of priority contaminants decision 2015 495 szekeres et al 2018 whereas in the second watch list only two antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin were categorized as priority pollutants for monitoring since these antibiotics are likely to reach groundwater bodies boy roura et al 2018 moreover owing to the diverse nature of pharmaceuticals and their anticipated risk to an aquatic environment the environmental agency for england and wales also proposed a ranking system for ten pollutants including only two antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole this categorization was based on their persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and occurrence from existing literature in various regions of the world and the availability of appropriate analytical methods for their estimation ebele et al 2017 9 2 human health risk assessment of antibiotics this review estimated the potential health risk of nine antibiotics ciprofloxacin norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine clarithromycin roxithromycin azithromycin tetracycline and oxytetracycline which have been frequently reported in groundwater of various regions in the world the risk quotient rq for each antibiotic was calculated by dividing the maximum measured concentration of antibiotics in groundwater by drinking water equivalent level dwel of seven categories of age from 1 year to 21 years eq 2 2 rq m c d w e l the guidelines from the world health organization who 2011 were followed to calculate dwel table s5 eq 3 3 dwel a d i b w d w i a b f o e where adi is the acceptable daily intake the dose which can be consumed daily over a lifetime having an insignificant risk of adverse effects table s6 bw is the body weight kg dwi is the volume of water drank per diem table s7 ab represents the portion of the substance ingested through consumption of water 1 for pharmaceutical drugs and foe is the exposure frequency 0 96 sharma et al 2019 the rq value 1 indicates the possibility of human health risk whereas a more comprehensive evaluation is required if the value ranges between 0 2 1 the rq value 0 2 is of no appreciable risk to human health sharma et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the rq calculated in this review for various antibiotics has been presented in fig 6 ciprofloxacin and azithromycin depicted relatively high human health risk as compared to other antibiotics among different age groups children 1 11 years had a higher risk followed by adults 20 years and adolescents 11 21 years nevertheless it is clear from the figure that potential health risk for all nine investigated antibiotics in groundwater is well below the 0 2 rq guideline this demonstrates that these antibiotics are unlikely to pose human health risks via drinking water consumption table s8 many other studies have also estimated the level of human health risk associated with groundwater and reported negligible risk to human health sharma et al 2019 riva et al 2018 therefore the human health risk assessment reported in studies to date showed that the concentration of different antibiotics present in groundwater is unlikely to pose potential risks to human health 9 3 human health implications of args and arbs the occurrence of antibiotics args and arbs in drinking water might disrupt the gastrointestinal microbiota balance and further affect human health becattini et al 2016 nevertheless it is still unclear whether arbs and args in groundwater have any substantial impact on humans exposure to arbs the human health risks are expected to be more distinct in developing nations than developed ones developing countries have inadequate health care systems characterized by an absence of necessary facilities and medications and elevated ailment burden which sequentially demands frequent use of antibiotics gwenzi et al 2018 the estimation of the human exposure risks to veterinary antibiotics args and bacteria like acinetobacter in the groundwater of jianzhong china found no immediate human health risks the study observed that an estimate of 10 billion magnitude cfu of acinetobacter would be ingested through drinking groundwater by a resident per day however it is still unclear whether environmental arbs and args in groundwater have any significant impact on human exposure to pathogenic arbs gao et al 2020 the study investigated the potential human health risks of antibiotic resistance in drinking water reported that the consumption of drinking water polluted with arbs and args might contribute to the growth of antibiotic resistance in humans sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 antibiotic resistance might result in enhanced virulence pathogenicity disease outbreaks and transmission which leads to prolonged morbidity and mortality berendonk et al 2015 since evidence on the implications of antibiotic resistance in the groundwater to human health remains limited several knowledge gaps still exist it calls for improvement in the risk assessment methodologies to address the potential link between antibiotic resistance and other environmental stressors 10 research challenges and future perspectives in recent years considerable concern has been made to promote the prudent use of antibiotics and control antibiotics resistance in aquatic environment but due to the lack of data and understanding on fate and potential risks of antibiotics occurrence in the groundwater their long term impacts in ecological environment are not clearly understood therefore the inescapable consequences of these antibiotics args and arbs have become a global challenge hence systematic studies should be conducted on the impacts of human activities and environmental factors associated with the transport of antibiotics and args in groundwater in this regard special consideration should be taken for developing regions where consumption of untreated drinking water is common and data is scant due to limited research facilities the occurrence of antibiotics metabolites has been reported to be higher than parent compounds in groundwater because of their higher solubility and persistence garcía galán et al 2011 considering the inevitable use of antibiotics and limited availability of data on hazardous effects of antibiotics metabolites this review highlights the importance of conducting studies to monitor and find methodologies to diminish the groundwater adulteration of antibiotics and their metabolites the occurrence of args in groundwater has not been screened in many developing and developed countries except china and the us hence a comprehensive regional and countrywide groundwater survey should be conducted to assess args occurrence and distribution in groundwater moreover mathematical modeling has played an essential role in improving our understanding of antibiotic resistance various studies have conducted modeling research to evaluate factors influencing the dissemination of resistant bacteria in the environment greenfield et al 2018 smith et al 2002 niewiadomska et al 2019 however with rising concern about the spread of antibiotics resistance and increased use of mathematical models to better understand the mechanisms behind args spread there is a need for the development of an advanced framework that can help guide model choice for future analyses furthermore the fate and transport of args should be quantitatively assessed through mathematical modeling approaches that consider args replication and hgt propagation dynamics as well as natural attenuation mechanisms e g hydrolysis photolysis and arg sedimentation the evidence about the dose response curves and exposure assessment data associated with arbs and args in groundwater is not developed yet therefore quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been recommended as a suitable method to evaluate and quantify the human health risk amarasiri et al 2019 certain studies offered findings on the presence of antibiotics in groundwater yet few emphasized args existence and the processes that influence their existence in the groundwater these investigations ignore the detailed analysis of the hydrogeological context of the research and the presence of antibiotics and args within groundwater using a regional hydrogeological point of view which is essential to deal with management strategies because of this complexity the status and entry of antibiotics into groundwater supplies are not clearly understood comprehensive research is required to understand better hydrogeology s effect on the distribution of antibiotics and the spread of args in groundwater in the extensive research that has been undertaken by various institutions it is noteworthy to mention that environmental reservoirs that house most of the groundwater are on the rise to be viewed as one of the most critical hotspots for various pathogens gaining antibiotic resistance therefore prescription of antibiotics can be rationalized based on the detection and identification of bacterial pathogens through the point of care poc thus can help in regulating and reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics which can further enhance and prolong the effectiveness of such antibiotics as the field of poc detection tests is growing and advancing reliance on empirical antimicrobial treatment is losing its efficacy therefore quick poc tests should be employed for bacterial infections diagnosis before antimicrobials are prescribed to patients improving the results and limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance reali et al 2019 the occurrence of arbs and args are reported in urban watersheds without point source adulteration signifying that naturally produced antimicrobials might act as selective agents for the resistance of antibiotics in the watersheds low et al 2016 therefore any water that has been linked with agricultural production units wwtps aquafarming swine production facilities or hospital waste where antibiotics are highly used should be extensively examined before reusing it moreover in developing regions due to the lack of proper waste handling systems comprehensive point and nonpoint source based monitoring of the groundwater and watersheds should be introduced to reap the benefits of good health 11 conclusions and take home message the current review provides comprehensive information about the occurrence pattern of most frequently detected antibiotics args and arbs in groundwater globally the reviewed studies suggested sulfonamides macrolides quinolones and tetracycline classes of antibiotics to be more prevalent in groundwater bodies owing to their significance in human and veterinary medicines and persistence in groundwater although these antibiotics classes are widely detected in groundwater the data on the occurrence of sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines is more prevalent in various regions of the world the literature on the occurrence of tetracyclines and sulfonamides resistance genes is more abundant reflecting their continuous input in the groundwater it was found that groundwater lying in nearby proximity of point sources such as landfill leachates wastewater discharge aquaculture runoff discharge from hospitals or drug manufacturing industries and discharge from swine production facilities are more contaminated with antibiotics residues resistance genes and resistant bacteria however it was observed that intensive swine farming is a significant source contributing to args and arbs in groundwater this review further collates the knowledge on the correlation between antibiotics args environmental factors and the microbial community the relationship between args and environmental factors reflects the potential impacts of environmental factors on disseminating args in groundwater the nexus between args profile and microbial community revealed that microbial taxa might be the potential host of args the relationship between antibiotics and args suggests that antibiotics dispersion in groundwater leads to the enhanced dissemination of args in groundwater to evaluate the worst case scenario the highest reported antibiotics values were selected from published literature to estimate ecological and human health risks the risk assessment showed the negligible risk to human health and medium to moderate ecological risks to antibiotics were estimated to aquatic species therefore human health and environmental risk from exposure to antibiotics may be of concern especially because groundwater is an essential source of drinking water in many regions of the world considering the inescapable use of antibiotics this review highlights the point and non point source based monitoring to reduce the groundwater adulteration with antibiotics args and arbs and support future regulatory measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare
