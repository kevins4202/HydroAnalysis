20675,spar type platforms have been widely applied in ocean engineering and first get commercial applications in the offshore wind industry the spar type platform is typically deployed in deep waters whereas shallow and moderate water depths are regarded as more ideal regions for deploying floating wind turbines fwt however the deep draft of spar type platform limits its use in these regions encountering great challenges this paper aims to seek a solution for deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths of about 100 m to this end a novel stepped short spar for shallow water is developed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu with a draft of 50 m abbreviated as sjtu s4 then a model system is designed and manufactured at a scaling ratio of 1 50 an integrated experimental apparatus is constructed and comprehensive model tests are carried out the hydrodynamic characteristics of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt are objectively evaluated referring to those of the typical oc3 hywind fwt the model test results indicate that the sjtu s4 fwt has reasonable hydrodynamic performance in water depth of 100 m this study suggests that the application of sjtu s4 fwt concept is feasible and can be an alternative in offshore wind exploitation in moderate water depths keywords feasibility floating wind turbine moderate water depth model test 1 introduction in the last decades the increasing global energy consumption brought environmental concerns and wind energy especially offshore wind energy to the forefront meng et al 2017 recently offshore wind energy development has shown a trend towards deeper waters for steadier and better quality wind resources and less influence on the ecological system skaare et al 2015 the majority of the offshore wind turbines deployed at present are in water depths within 30 m supported by the conventional fixed foundations however the fixed foundation wind turbines seem to be economically infeasible when the water depth exceeds 60 m musial et al 2006 instead the floating wind turbine fwt can be an alternative for deep waters as indicated by the european wind energy association the fwt concept shows great practical potential and has gained rapid developments since it was proposed in the 1970s different from the conventional fixed foundation wind turbines the fwts are mounted on floating platforms with mooring systems similar to the classical oil and gas industry floaters the stiffness of mooring systems is relatively low when compared with fixed foundations the floating platform tends to experience non negligible oscillations in the complex wind wave current excitations under such effects the wind turbine located at a high elevation will experience very different aerodynamic characteristics according to our previous work in practical operating conditions the inflow misalignments and platform oscillations will significantly impact the aerodynamics and affect the operations of fwt wen et al 2017 2018a 2019a to acquire proper system stability in the complex environmental loads several novel floating platforms have been proposed at present the floating platform in offshore industries includes 3 major types semi submersible platform tension leg platform tlp and spar type platform floating wind turbine prototypes are developed such as the spar type in project hywind in norway skaare 2017 semi submersible type in project windfloat demo in portugal roddier et al 2009 especially the spar type floating wind turbine is advantaged in hydrodynamic performance and economy furthermore spar type fwt was commercially deployed in the project hywind scotland by statoil the world s first fwt farm in 2017 equinor 2017 by virtue of the good hydrodynamic performance the spar type fwt first gets commercial applications besides the spar type platform is advantaged in simple design and fabrication it should be noted that most of the existing fwts are developed for deep waters unlike the fjords in european seas especially in norway oppikofer et al 2014 most of offshore wind energy development target waters are shallow and moderate in depth take the east china sea and the south china sea as examples they are extensions of the mainland gradually formed after years of continental layers scour the depth of the water changes little even in the distance of 20 km to coast water depth is around 100 m qu it is too far and costly to deploy deepwater fwts in these areas therefore it is of great importance to conduct relevant research on deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths which will contribute to the worldwide renewable energy development stewart and muskulus 2016 according to jonkman j et al designing and deploying fwts still face several engineering challenges butterfield et al 2005 including the accuracy of the simulation tools cost complexity of supporting platforms cost complexity of mooring system and modeling the various environmental loads compared with deep water shallow and moderate water depth regions have milder sea conditions the less hydrodynamic loads can reduce the impact on rotor aerodynamic performance induced by the platform motion and oscillation wen et al 2017 2018a the comparatively lower cost of installation maintenance and electricity transmission of the fwts is another advantage although the spar type platform shows good hydrodynamic performance in deep waters and is economical in construction and operation nielsen et al 2006 the draft limits its application in shallow and moderate water depths the reduced draft causes a rise in the center of gravity in shallow and moderate water depths the higher center of gravity makes it challenging to obtain proper hydrodynamic performance the spar type buoy requires larger displacement to load the increased ballast water in addition the allowable motion region for platforms is much more limited in moderate water which also brings challenges in mooring system design and layout karimirad m and moan t have studied the feasibility of spar type fwt in different water depths karimirad and moan 2012a 2012b as recommended in their work it is possible to achieve a more cost effective solution with smaller mass by adequate design of short spar at a depth of 150 m utsunomiya t et al utsunomiya et al 2009a studied the wave response of a single pontoon spar type fwt and a stepped spar type fwt with a draft of 60 m in the water depth of 64 m and indicated that the stepped spar is more suitable for carrying offshore wind turbines sethuraman l et al sethuraman and venugopal 2013 performed studies on a stepped spar fwt with a draft of 70 m in the water depth of 120 m wen t et al wen et al 2018b used simo riflex dms code to analyze and compared the dynamic response of short spar and deep spar carrying vertical axis wind turbine under turbulent winds and irregular waves the results indicate that spar type supporting structure is feasible in moderate waters by proper design as an effective method of investigating the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performance of offshore structures scaled model test is of great importance not only the reliable source to validate the numerical tools but also dynamic phenomena can be captured in model tests li et al 2018 a review of previous spar type fwt model tests is briefly conducted with the rapid development of fwt numerical design tools the computational study on spar type fwt has been widely carried out however up till now only several model tests on spar type fwts have been performed seebai et al from the indian institute of technology madras seebai et al 2009 found out that the counterweight disc structure at the bottom of hull would especially result in increased added mass damping and wave force in heave motion utsunomiya t et al utsunomiya et al 2009a 2009b 2010 from kyoto university conducted a series of model tests on a prototype spar fwt with a 2 mw wind turbine from a 1 100 scaled model basin test to a 1 10 scaled model at sea test through the series of tests the researchers indicate that the simply structured spar type fwt could be a cost effective alternative for the offshore wind industry their deficiency is that part of the tests did not fully integrate the wind and wave loads goupee a j et al goupee et al 2014 performed comparison experiments of spar semi submersible and tlp fwts detailed discussions on the relative performances of the 3 types of fwts are given tomasicchio g r et al tomasicchio et al 2018 conducted a comprehensive model test on the dynamic behaviors of the oc3 hywind fwt ruzzo c et al ruzzo et al 2016 2018 from mediterranea university conducted a 1 30 scaled oc3 hywind fwt at sea model test the test provided abundant experimental data with shortcomings such as limitations in identification techniques and limited frequency range of the natural sea states sethuraman l et al sethuraman and venugopal 2013 from the university of edinburgh conducted a model test on a stepped spar fwt design with a 70 m draft in a curved wave tank the main conclusions include the good agreement between experimental results and numerical simulation advantages of the 4 point mooring system and the presence of active pitch damping mechanics at lower frequencies duan f et al duan et al 2016 from sjtu performed basin model tests based on 2 different rotor concepts thrust matched and thrust unmatched these works have studied the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the spar type fwts nevertheless few studies dedicated to water depths within 100 m and shorter draft have been conducted furthermore most of the studies on spar type fwts in shallow and moderate water depths are numerical while the research on fully coupled model tests is not sufficient up to now the minimum draft of proposed moderate spar type fwts is 60 m and both numerical simulation and scaled model tests have been performed to study the feasibility of these concepts however the 60 m draft still seems to be too large when the water depth is limited within 100 m for the existence of shallow water effect xiao et al 2007 the work conducted in this paper is devoted to investigating the feasibility of the spar type fwt with the draft reduced to 50 m in water depth of 100 m first a novel stepped spar type fwt is developed and introduced then the dedicated experimental apparatus is set up and extensive wave basin model tests are carried out the performance of the sjtu s4 is objectively evaluated based on the experimental results see table 1 2 sjtu s4 floating platform a novel stepped short spar for shallow water abbreviated as sjtu s4 is developed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu to serve at a water depth of 100 m to deal with the challenges brought by the reduction of water depth the main target of the design is to obtain adequate hydrodynamic performance in 100 m water depth carrying the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 2 1 sjtu s4 concept evolution this part mainly introduces the sjtu s4 floating platform originally the concept of sjtu s4 floating platform is inspired by oc3 hywind spar platform and has been modified into the stepped design as shown in fig 1 the oc3 hywind spar type platform is catenary moored with a draft of 200 m in deep waters the mooring system of the oc3 hywind platform consists of 3 catenary lines the more detailed parameters of the reference oc3 hywind platform can be accessed in relevant reference skaare 2017 jonkman 2010 the hard tank of sjtu s4 platform includes 3 different steps and the diameters of the 3 steps increase from top to bottom the clearance between s4 s bottom and sea bed is sufficient and the step design helps lower the center of gravity the total mass of the sjtu s4 is greatly increased to obtain a proper center of gravity the main properties of sjtu s4 platform are shown in table 2 and fig 2 to amend the deficiencies in platform performance brought by the reduced draft the ballast water of sjtu s4 is increased which causes that the total mass is significantly larger than the mass of oc3 hywind platform 2 2 mooring system the allowable motion region for platforms is significantly limited in moderate depths of waters to obtain appropriate system stiffness and meet the wind turbine s operation requirements mooring system design is crucial in the fwt industry generally the mooring systems for moderate water depths should be stiffer than those for deep water depths the mooring system for sjtu s4 is preliminarily designed to consist of 3 same catenary mooring lines and the fairleads are located 6 m below the still water line on the circumference of hard tank hull each of the mooring lines contains a long bottom section to offer an adequate restoring force for the whole fwt system the pretension at the top of each mooring line is 313 21 kn the mooring line properties are shown in table 3 3 experimental apparatus to study the motion characteristics of the sjtu s4 platform in various environmental conditions and validate the feasibility of deploying fwts in moderate water depth a fully coupled experimental apparatus is developed and introduced in this paper the test system is developed and tested at the state key laboratory of ocean engineering skloe and the state key laboratory of mechanical system and vibration sklmsv at sjtu the whole system consists of a wind generation system wgs a model wind turbine mwt with motion track system the wave basin in skloe and an integrated measurement system in the work of this paper the coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic load is taken into account and the experimental apparatus mainly captures the dynamic response of the platform the mwt is fiber made and the model assembly is considered as rigid body elasticity is not modeled 3 1 wind generation system wgs a wind generation system consists of 16 axial fans arranged in 4 4 square is developed at sjtu to generate inflow wind for the tests meng et al 2019 each of the 16 fans can be individually controlled to generate different winds with varying averaged wind speeds so that diverse horizontal vertical wind shears and various turbulence intensities can be modeled the effective dimensions of the wgs are 3 m both horizontally and vertically generated wind uniformity increasing structures including circle to square shape transfer structures and 2 layers of honeycomb screens are mounted during the tests the model hub center height is located at the same elevation as the center of wgs the specification of the wgs and the generated wind field s quality are analyzed in our previous work nielsen et al 2006 and the spatial uniformity and turbulence intensity ti of the generated wind at the rotor plane are qualified also the proper position to locate the mwt is determined the mwt is located at x r 3 3 r is the mwt rotor radius wen et al 2019b the average wind speed and ti in the downwind direction at 5 4 m 6 6 m and 7 8 m to the wgs are depicted in fig 4 the red circle represents the mwt rotor swept area with the gradual mixture of flows extending downwind with the increase of x u m is gradually increasing and ti is decreasing generally the wind field maintains good uniformity in the rotor plane area as the ti keeps much lower here than that outside the rotor plane inside the rotor swept area the ti is about 10 strong interaction between the generated flow and the external still air outside the wgs edges causes the relatively lower average wind speed and higher ti where it is close to the edge of wgs in the present tests the 16 axial fans are collectively controlled to operate at the same rotation speed the analysis above indicates that the wind field generated by the wgs is reliable for the mwt basin tests 3 2 model wind turbine mwt to carry out wave basin tests a model wind turbine is geometrically scaled from the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine which is a traditional 3 bladed horizontal axis wind turbine the scaling ratio of the mwt is 1 50 the blades are made of carbon fiber in order to meet the scaled mass according to froude law it should note that an axis tilt angle of 5 and a blade pre cone of 2 5 are designed according to the prototype to avoid the blade tower strike the properties of the mwt and the full scaled prototype are shown in table 4 besides the scaled tower is geometrically designed and manufactured by carbon fiber which can imitate the tower shadow effect it is cone shaped with 7 74 cm top diameter and 12 cm at the bottom it should be noted that the mwt here is a scaled model based on froude law performing as an independent wind turbine in the study of this paper to compare the dynamic performance between sjtu s4 and oc3 hywind platform the test matrix is carefully selected to mitigate the adverse effects due to the mismatched reynolds number wen et al 2020 details about test matrix selection will be introduced later the nacelle design is crucial in mwt development the nacelle carries the rotating blades as well as a control system and a set of transducers while meeting the requirement of the limited total mass the nacelle designed in this paper is manufactured by high quality aluminum alloy to reduce the mass and guarantee the strength a coreless brushless direct current servo motor is used to maintain the rotor speed and between the rotor and motor a torque sensor is located to measure the aerodynamic torque the tower structure is geometrically scaled and manufactured by carbon fiber the mwt assembly is shown in fig 5 3 3 wave basin the model tests are carried out at a deep water offshore basin in skloe sjtu the basin is composed of a basin body and a deep well and can simulate various types of ocean environments such as wind waves and currents it is equipped with wave generation wave absorption current generation wind generation water depth adjustment and vehicle towing systems as well as various instruments and facilities for ocean engineering experiments and research the basin is capable of producing various types of waves as well as typical deep current with vertical fluid velocity profile the photos of the test system layout in the basin and a side view sketch are shown in fig 6 the motion track system markers are attached to the mwt the mwt sjtu s4 platform assembly is located 4 m away from the wgs in the wave basin the wgs is mounted on a customed base with sufficient space for wave passing through 3 4 test matrix in the present study the target water region is 100 m depth a group of regular wave test cases and a group of irregular wave test cases are selected the regular waves are defined with wave height h m and wave period t s the jonswap wave spectrum is used to define the irregular waves in this study with 3 main parameters significant wave height h s wave peak period t p and shape factor γ different shape factors are separately applied to each irregular wave it should be noted that the mwt in this paper is manufactured according to the froude scaling law which means it will face the mismatch of reynolds number causing a decreased rotor aerodynamic load martin et al 2014 to analyze the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 and compare it with the oc3 hywind platform the test matrix selection needs further explanation here in the basin test 2 different wind speeds are selected 13 3 m s and 31 1 m s full scale in the wave tests the rotor speed is maintained at 50 rpm the wind speeds for oc3 hywind platform s numerical simulation in this study are carefully selected to keep the aerodynamic loads similarity between the 2 fwts in the basin tests 5 regular wave cases and 3 irregular wave cases are selected in the basin test the speed of generated wind is 31 1 m s it should be noted that in the extreme sea state case the environmental loads include a current load of 2 m s full scale in the extreme sea state the mwt is shut down and blades are kept still additionally wave only cases are conducted to be baseline cases the parameters of waves are shown in table 5 and table 6 all the parameters are given in full scale it should be noted that all the wind and wave loads are co directional and co linear with mooring line 1 as shown in fig 3 4 results and discussions in this paper wind wave joint basin tests for different environmental cases are carried out basin tests include decay tests regular wave tests and irregular wave tests decay tests contain all the 6 degree of freedoms dofs each irregular wave test ran over 3 h full scale time before the tests the waves are calibrated in the wave basin without mwt fig 7 shows the measured wave time series in regular wave case no 3 and the measured wave spectrum in irregular wave case no 6 both the measured wave time series in regular wave cases and the wave spectra in irregular wave cases show acceptable correspondence with the targets to evaluate the performance of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt corresponding numerical simulations of oc3 hywind platform are conducted under the same environmental conditions to serve as a reference the comparison of the measured test results of sjtu s4 and numerical simulation results of oc3 hywind platform is presented in this part the 6 dofs of the fwt are measured by a motion track system at the model s center of mass 4 1 free decay test the natural period of spar type platform is an important index evaluating its hydrodynamic performance to this end still water decay tests with mooring system are carried out first to identify the natural periods of sjtu s4 the main results are shown in table 7 the time series of decay tests are shown in fig 8 due to the symmetry of spar type platform the surge and sway natural periods are almost the same and so as the pitch and roll natural periods in the decay tests single forces are separately applied to each degree of motion direction to induce the decay motion the heave natural period of sjtu s4 is 30 8 s which is close to that of oc3 hywind platform the surge natural period is 154 1 s significantly larger than 100s the difference between sjtu s4 and oc3 hywind lies in pitch and yaw natural periods the platform pitch natural period is mainly affected by the metacentric height rotational inertia and the restoring force applied by the mooring system stiffness while the yaw natural period is mainly affected by the mooring system stiffness and rotational inertia the pitch natural period of sjtu s4 is more than 10 s larger than that of oc3 hywind which is 24 2 s and the yaw natural period of the sjtu s4 is significantly larger than the 23 4 s yaw natural period of oc3 hywind the difference in mooring stiffness of the 2 platforms is the main cause of the significant larger yaw natural period of sjtu s4 and the sjtu s4 is expected to have mild yaw responses with larger yaw natural period which better avoids the wind and rotor rotation excitation frequency band therefore the sjtu s4 is expected to experience small fluctuation in aerodynamic load induced by platform dynamic yaw motion wen et al 2019a typically spar type fwts have over 100s surge and sway natural periods dnv 2019 the moored decay test shows that the design basically meets the characteristics in spar platform natural periods for offshore fwts characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations include the wave load and wind load as well as the characteristic rotation frequency of the rotor note that the peak spectral frequency of typical ocean wave is from 0 05 hz to 0 2 hz faltinsen 1990 corresponding to a period range from 5s to 20s while the driving wind frequency is in a much lower band the rotor 1 p once per revolution period range of nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine is from 4 959s to 8 696s and a 3 p period range from 1 65s to 2 90s jonkman et al 2009 it can be inferred that the motion natural frequencies of the sjtu s4 properly avoid the characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations and is expected to obtain good hydrodynamic performance 4 2 performance in regular waves regular wave tests of 5 different wave heights with generated wind inflows are carried out after still water decay tests to find out the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 when considering the dynamic responses of floating platforms the co linear regular wave and wind loads mainly induce the platform surge pitch and heave responses the pitch and surge motions are the main concerns for the great influence on rotor aerodynamic loads and the heave response also affects the operating stability of the equipment installed in the wind turbine the surge pitch and heave responses are discussed in this part the motion time series of surge and pitch in case no 5 are selected to compare and the results are shown in fig 9 the average surge displacements are individually subtracted in the time series comparison here only the dynamic surge motions around the equilibrium positions are taken into account it is clear that sjtu s4 has a better surge motion performance at the equilibrium position than oc3 hywind platform the averaged pitch motion is mainly induced by the wind loads applied on the rotor plane and the fluctuation is majorly induced by the wave loads the reduction in hydrostatic stiffness brought by the reduced draft and the smaller mooring stiffness in pitch direction result in a greater pitch magnitude of the sjtu s4 the pitch time series indicates that the pitch angular velocities of the 2 fwts remain nearly the same consequently it could be inferred that the 2 fwts will experience similar dynamic loads besides though the sjtu s4 has a greater pitch motion than oc3 hywind platform it remains below the acceptable criterion about 10 huijs et al 2013 the statistical comparison of platform motions is also shown in fig 10 the bars in the figure are the motion response amplitude operators rao defined as motion amplitude wave amplitude in surge pitch and heave under different regular cases with the 31 m s wind speed the straight lines on each bar represent the standard deviation of motion the results indicate that sjtu s4 platform has smaller surge motion response for which the potential reason is that the surge mooring stiffness of the sjtu s4 is greater than that of the oc3 hywind the waves in basin test for sjtu s4 and numerical simulations for oc3 hywind are the same fig 10 shows that the surge and pitch raos of both platforms decrease with the increasing wave period while the standard deviations of both platforms increase despite the relative large difference in raos the standard deviations of the surge and pitch responses for both platforms are close the heave rao of the sjtu s4 reduces slightly with the increasing wave period the dynamic response is also larger than that of the oc3 hywind this is due to the greatly reduced draft and different waterplane area the difference in mooring systems also contributes to this result the heave rao of oc3 hywind increases slightly with the increasing wave period 4 3 performance in irregular waves to further study and validate the performance of sjtu s4 in operating conditions irregular wave tests with 3 different significant wave heights and 2 different driving wind speeds are carried out the motions studied in this part stay consistent with that in the previous section including platform surge pitch and heave the more complex irregular wave loads brought larger differences in the standard deviation of motions in the direction perpendicular to environmental loads meanwhile the effects of system natural periods and error in model manufacture markedly increased the results of the surge comparison in fig 11 show that the mooring system of sjtu s4 has good surge constraint ability which is of great significance in shallow and moderate water regions the pitch motion of sjtu s4 in irregular wave cases stays close to that in regular wave cases remaining within 10 deg the standard deviations of surge and pitch show similar features with regular wave cases increasing with the significant wave height the average heave motion of the sjtu s4 in irregular waves weakens significantly while it first increases and then reduces with the increasing significant wave height besides the analysis of statistics comparison the spectra of the 3 motions under the wind speed of 31 m s are respectively presented in fig 12 fig 13 and fig 14 only wave frequency responses and responses at system natural frequencies are reflected in the spectrum under steady wind and wave cases cao et al 2019 nevertheless in real practical operating conditions the turbulence of wind inflow does exist arany et al 2015 and the turbulence excitation can greatly induce dynamic response at the low frequency range as reflected in the spectra here fig 12 is the power spectral density of surge motion under different significant wave heights rather than the response at wave frequency the dynamic response at platform natural frequencies dominates the spectrum fig 13 shows that there is obvious resonance oscillation at surge natural frequency in pitch response indicating that a significant coupling effect exists between pitch and surge motions in the meantime fig 14 indicates that only small resonance oscillation response at surge natural frequency emerges in heave motion response representing that the surge and heave motions are relatively independent without obvious coupling effect with other modes of motion the power spectral densities of surge pitch and heave under different driving wind speeds of 0 m s 13 3 m s and 31 1 m s are respectively presented in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 the significant wave height considered here is 7 m by comparing the spectra it can be found that the aerodynamic load has marginal influence on the response at wave frequency this is because the characteristic frequency bands of the 2 loads are far apart no significant coupling effect exists therefore the linear superposition method can be used to calculate aerodynamic and wave loads in some cases in wave only cases the second order wave forces including drift force cao et al 2020 induce resonance responses at platform natural frequencies and the coupled responses between different dofs are not obvious the influence of aerodynamic load on platform motions enhances with the increasing wind speeds fig 15 shows that in surge response the high speed wind increases the dynamic responses around the platform s surge natural frequency while the low speed wind slightly weakens the surge motion relatively fig 16 and 17 show that in pitch and heave responses the aerodynamic load substantially weakens the response at pitch and heave natural frequencies but enhances the resonance response at surge natural frequency meanwhile the response at wave frequency is slightly reduced this phenomenon can be explained by aerodynamic damping li et al 2018 this damping effect is more significant in the pitch motion which is sensitive to aerodynamic load the sensitivity to the wind speed of this phenomenon needs further validation compare the wave only case with the coupled wind and wave cases it also can be inferred that the coupled response at surge natural frequency in the spectrum of pitch motion is enhanced by the wind load such resonance response even can dominate the spectrum under large aerodynamic load nevertheless the yaw induced coupling and the gyroscopic effect of rotor rotation in the thrust matched model test mentioned in duan et al 2016 bahramiasl et al 2018 are not reflected in the present study from the spectra discussed in this section it can be determined that among the 3 important motions the surge is the most significant affecting the other 2 motions it even dominates the pitch response spectrum the pitch is the second and the heave is the least in the subsequent optimization work the surge and pitch performances should be modified first increasing the mooring system stiffness and adjusting the fairleads position could be effective methods also mounting damping structures helps reduce the dynamic responses of the platform 4 4 performance in extreme sea state it is of great importance to validate the survival capability of the system in fwt model tests the extreme sea state case of sjtu s4 is conducted after the regular wave cases and the irregular wave tests in this case the wind speed is 35 m s and the significant wave height is 13 m also an additional current with a speed of 2 m s is generated to simulate the survival condition in this case the rotor is parked and kept still in y style the equipment in wind turbine is considered to be shut down thus the heave response is not discussed in this part since the current load is taken into account the roll and sway motions are studied for the possible existence of vortex induced motion see table 8 the statistics of platform motions in extreme sea state case is shown in table 5 as common knowledge the aerodynamic load is the major impact on the fwt s pitch motion the great reduction in aerodynamic load on the rotor plane in this case leads to a smaller pitch motion the surge motion of sjtu s4 in extreme sea state case increases apparently this is due to the larger waves and an initial displacement in surge direction is induced by the current it should be noted that the average sway motion is over 5 m and the standard deviation is significantly larger than that of the other 3 motions which indicating the possible existence of current or vortex induced vibration fig 18 shows the power spectral density of surge and pitch in extreme sea state case in the spectra of extreme sea state case the energy distribution is similar to the wave only case due to the larger wave the proportion of energy at wave frequency increases the dynamic responses at natural frequencies and the resonance oscillation response at surge natural frequency in pitch motion are weakened which could be due to the smaller aerodynamic loads on the rotor plane the surge response in extreme sea state is induced by both the current and wave load including current induced in line oscillation sumer and fredsoe 2006 the sway and roll spectra contain little wave frequency response further representing that the dynamic responses of these 2 motions are induced by turbulent wind load and current load the zoom in image in fig 18 represents significant sway responses under the current load including cross flow oscillation sumer and fredsoe 2006 both the sway response spectrum in fig 18 and sway time series presented in fig 19 indicate the existence of the current or vortex induced vibration since this is not in the scope of the present study it will not be further discussed the resonance oscillation response in roll motion is also observed in the spectrum besides it is interesting to observe that the surge and pitch spectral response peaks vary slightly towards the lower frequency position this is due to the nonlinear nature of the catenary mooring system souza and bachynski 2019 under changed coupled environmental load conditions resulting in a different system stiffness 5 conclusions and prospects deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths shows good application potential with the motivation of deploying fwts with a smaller draft a novel stepped short spar for shallow water is proposed by shanghai jiao tong university named as sjtu s4 an integrated experimental apparatus is set up and comprehensive tests are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt extensive operating and survival conditions with different regular irregular waves and varying wind speeds are tested based on the experimental analysis and discussion the main conclusions are drawn as below 1 the sjtu s4 fwt is developed dedicatedly for the water depth of 100 m in china seas it has a novel stepped structure design with a draft of 50 m referring to the commercially successful oc3 hywind fwt 2 an experimental apparatus is set up to test the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 the natural frequencies of sjtu s4 avoid the characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations and the overall performance is acceptable in the direction collinear to environmental loads the surge behavior seems to be better than oc3 hywind platform and the pitch response is in a reasonable range in the direction perpendicular to environmental loads the average sway and roll performance of sjtu s4 is inferior to oc3 hywind but it is still kept in an acceptable range survival tests indicate that the sjtu s4 could maintain acceptable surge and pitch motions when the rotor is parked in extreme sea state showing reasonable viability 3 the statistics obtained in the tests of this paper can provide relevant model test experience and data reserve for future research observing and validating several aerodynamic phenomena wind induced resonance response between different modes of motion is observed in wind and wave combination tests aerodynamic load tends to damp the surge and pitch motions of the platform weakening the response at pitch natural frequency large wind load also enhances the resonance response at surge natural frequency in pitch motion changed environmental conditions also induce an offset of the dynamic spectral response peak up till now the work presented in this paper has preliminarily validated the feasibility of deploying spar type fwts with 50 m draft in moderate water depths further work still needs to be conducted the mass distribution of the whole fwt system needs further optimization for its great impact on the platform s motion performance the influence of large pitch magnitude on the power production rotor load and gyroscopic moment needs further investigation in addition the sensitivity of sjtu s4 motion performance to the wind speeds needs further validation credit authorship contribution statement zhihao jiang conceptualization

20675,spar type platforms have been widely applied in ocean engineering and first get commercial applications in the offshore wind industry the spar type platform is typically deployed in deep waters whereas shallow and moderate water depths are regarded as more ideal regions for deploying floating wind turbines fwt however the deep draft of spar type platform limits its use in these regions encountering great challenges this paper aims to seek a solution for deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths of about 100 m to this end a novel stepped short spar for shallow water is developed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu with a draft of 50 m abbreviated as sjtu s4 then a model system is designed and manufactured at a scaling ratio of 1 50 an integrated experimental apparatus is constructed and comprehensive model tests are carried out the hydrodynamic characteristics of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt are objectively evaluated referring to those of the typical oc3 hywind fwt the model test results indicate that the sjtu s4 fwt has reasonable hydrodynamic performance in water depth of 100 m this study suggests that the application of sjtu s4 fwt concept is feasible and can be an alternative in offshore wind exploitation in moderate water depths keywords feasibility floating wind turbine moderate water depth model test 1 introduction in the last decades the increasing global energy consumption brought environmental concerns and wind energy especially offshore wind energy to the forefront meng et al 2017 recently offshore wind energy development has shown a trend towards deeper waters for steadier and better quality wind resources and less influence on the ecological system skaare et al 2015 the majority of the offshore wind turbines deployed at present are in water depths within 30 m supported by the conventional fixed foundations however the fixed foundation wind turbines seem to be economically infeasible when the water depth exceeds 60 m musial et al 2006 instead the floating wind turbine fwt can be an alternative for deep waters as indicated by the european wind energy association the fwt concept shows great practical potential and has gained rapid developments since it was proposed in the 1970s different from the conventional fixed foundation wind turbines the fwts are mounted on floating platforms with mooring systems similar to the classical oil and gas industry floaters the stiffness of mooring systems is relatively low when compared with fixed foundations the floating platform tends to experience non negligible oscillations in the complex wind wave current excitations under such effects the wind turbine located at a high elevation will experience very different aerodynamic characteristics according to our previous work in practical operating conditions the inflow misalignments and platform oscillations will significantly impact the aerodynamics and affect the operations of fwt wen et al 2017 2018a 2019a to acquire proper system stability in the complex environmental loads several novel floating platforms have been proposed at present the floating platform in offshore industries includes 3 major types semi submersible platform tension leg platform tlp and spar type platform floating wind turbine prototypes are developed such as the spar type in project hywind in norway skaare 2017 semi submersible type in project windfloat demo in portugal roddier et al 2009 especially the spar type floating wind turbine is advantaged in hydrodynamic performance and economy furthermore spar type fwt was commercially deployed in the project hywind scotland by statoil the world s first fwt farm in 2017 equinor 2017 by virtue of the good hydrodynamic performance the spar type fwt first gets commercial applications besides the spar type platform is advantaged in simple design and fabrication it should be noted that most of the existing fwts are developed for deep waters unlike the fjords in european seas especially in norway oppikofer et al 2014 most of offshore wind energy development target waters are shallow and moderate in depth take the east china sea and the south china sea as examples they are extensions of the mainland gradually formed after years of continental layers scour the depth of the water changes little even in the distance of 20 km to coast water depth is around 100 m qu it is too far and costly to deploy deepwater fwts in these areas therefore it is of great importance to conduct relevant research on deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths which will contribute to the worldwide renewable energy development stewart and muskulus 2016 according to jonkman j et al designing and deploying fwts still face several engineering challenges butterfield et al 2005 including the accuracy of the simulation tools cost complexity of supporting platforms cost complexity of mooring system and modeling the various environmental loads compared with deep water shallow and moderate water depth regions have milder sea conditions the less hydrodynamic loads can reduce the impact on rotor aerodynamic performance induced by the platform motion and oscillation wen et al 2017 2018a the comparatively lower cost of installation maintenance and electricity transmission of the fwts is another advantage although the spar type platform shows good hydrodynamic performance in deep waters and is economical in construction and operation nielsen et al 2006 the draft limits its application in shallow and moderate water depths the reduced draft causes a rise in the center of gravity in shallow and moderate water depths the higher center of gravity makes it challenging to obtain proper hydrodynamic performance the spar type buoy requires larger displacement to load the increased ballast water in addition the allowable motion region for platforms is much more limited in moderate water which also brings challenges in mooring system design and layout karimirad m and moan t have studied the feasibility of spar type fwt in different water depths karimirad and moan 2012a 2012b as recommended in their work it is possible to achieve a more cost effective solution with smaller mass by adequate design of short spar at a depth of 150 m utsunomiya t et al utsunomiya et al 2009a studied the wave response of a single pontoon spar type fwt and a stepped spar type fwt with a draft of 60 m in the water depth of 64 m and indicated that the stepped spar is more suitable for carrying offshore wind turbines sethuraman l et al sethuraman and venugopal 2013 performed studies on a stepped spar fwt with a draft of 70 m in the water depth of 120 m wen t et al wen et al 2018b used simo riflex dms code to analyze and compared the dynamic response of short spar and deep spar carrying vertical axis wind turbine under turbulent winds and irregular waves the results indicate that spar type supporting structure is feasible in moderate waters by proper design as an effective method of investigating the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performance of offshore structures scaled model test is of great importance not only the reliable source to validate the numerical tools but also dynamic phenomena can be captured in model tests li et al 2018 a review of previous spar type fwt model tests is briefly conducted with the rapid development of fwt numerical design tools the computational study on spar type fwt has been widely carried out however up till now only several model tests on spar type fwts have been performed seebai et al from the indian institute of technology madras seebai et al 2009 found out that the counterweight disc structure at the bottom of hull would especially result in increased added mass damping and wave force in heave motion utsunomiya t et al utsunomiya et al 2009a 2009b 2010 from kyoto university conducted a series of model tests on a prototype spar fwt with a 2 mw wind turbine from a 1 100 scaled model basin test to a 1 10 scaled model at sea test through the series of tests the researchers indicate that the simply structured spar type fwt could be a cost effective alternative for the offshore wind industry their deficiency is that part of the tests did not fully integrate the wind and wave loads goupee a j et al goupee et al 2014 performed comparison experiments of spar semi submersible and tlp fwts detailed discussions on the relative performances of the 3 types of fwts are given tomasicchio g r et al tomasicchio et al 2018 conducted a comprehensive model test on the dynamic behaviors of the oc3 hywind fwt ruzzo c et al ruzzo et al 2016 2018 from mediterranea university conducted a 1 30 scaled oc3 hywind fwt at sea model test the test provided abundant experimental data with shortcomings such as limitations in identification techniques and limited frequency range of the natural sea states sethuraman l et al sethuraman and venugopal 2013 from the university of edinburgh conducted a model test on a stepped spar fwt design with a 70 m draft in a curved wave tank the main conclusions include the good agreement between experimental results and numerical simulation advantages of the 4 point mooring system and the presence of active pitch damping mechanics at lower frequencies duan f et al duan et al 2016 from sjtu performed basin model tests based on 2 different rotor concepts thrust matched and thrust unmatched these works have studied the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the spar type fwts nevertheless few studies dedicated to water depths within 100 m and shorter draft have been conducted furthermore most of the studies on spar type fwts in shallow and moderate water depths are numerical while the research on fully coupled model tests is not sufficient up to now the minimum draft of proposed moderate spar type fwts is 60 m and both numerical simulation and scaled model tests have been performed to study the feasibility of these concepts however the 60 m draft still seems to be too large when the water depth is limited within 100 m for the existence of shallow water effect xiao et al 2007 the work conducted in this paper is devoted to investigating the feasibility of the spar type fwt with the draft reduced to 50 m in water depth of 100 m first a novel stepped spar type fwt is developed and introduced then the dedicated experimental apparatus is set up and extensive wave basin model tests are carried out the performance of the sjtu s4 is objectively evaluated based on the experimental results see table 1 2 sjtu s4 floating platform a novel stepped short spar for shallow water abbreviated as sjtu s4 is developed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu to serve at a water depth of 100 m to deal with the challenges brought by the reduction of water depth the main target of the design is to obtain adequate hydrodynamic performance in 100 m water depth carrying the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 2 1 sjtu s4 concept evolution this part mainly introduces the sjtu s4 floating platform originally the concept of sjtu s4 floating platform is inspired by oc3 hywind spar platform and has been modified into the stepped design as shown in fig 1 the oc3 hywind spar type platform is catenary moored with a draft of 200 m in deep waters the mooring system of the oc3 hywind platform consists of 3 catenary lines the more detailed parameters of the reference oc3 hywind platform can be accessed in relevant reference skaare 2017 jonkman 2010 the hard tank of sjtu s4 platform includes 3 different steps and the diameters of the 3 steps increase from top to bottom the clearance between s4 s bottom and sea bed is sufficient and the step design helps lower the center of gravity the total mass of the sjtu s4 is greatly increased to obtain a proper center of gravity the main properties of sjtu s4 platform are shown in table 2 and fig 2 to amend the deficiencies in platform performance brought by the reduced draft the ballast water of sjtu s4 is increased which causes that the total mass is significantly larger than the mass of oc3 hywind platform 2 2 mooring system the allowable motion region for platforms is significantly limited in moderate depths of waters to obtain appropriate system stiffness and meet the wind turbine s operation requirements mooring system design is crucial in the fwt industry generally the mooring systems for moderate water depths should be stiffer than those for deep water depths the mooring system for sjtu s4 is preliminarily designed to consist of 3 same catenary mooring lines and the fairleads are located 6 m below the still water line on the circumference of hard tank hull each of the mooring lines contains a long bottom section to offer an adequate restoring force for the whole fwt system the pretension at the top of each mooring line is 313 21 kn the mooring line properties are shown in table 3 3 experimental apparatus to study the motion characteristics of the sjtu s4 platform in various environmental conditions and validate the feasibility of deploying fwts in moderate water depth a fully coupled experimental apparatus is developed and introduced in this paper the test system is developed and tested at the state key laboratory of ocean engineering skloe and the state key laboratory of mechanical system and vibration sklmsv at sjtu the whole system consists of a wind generation system wgs a model wind turbine mwt with motion track system the wave basin in skloe and an integrated measurement system in the work of this paper the coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic load is taken into account and the experimental apparatus mainly captures the dynamic response of the platform the mwt is fiber made and the model assembly is considered as rigid body elasticity is not modeled 3 1 wind generation system wgs a wind generation system consists of 16 axial fans arranged in 4 4 square is developed at sjtu to generate inflow wind for the tests meng et al 2019 each of the 16 fans can be individually controlled to generate different winds with varying averaged wind speeds so that diverse horizontal vertical wind shears and various turbulence intensities can be modeled the effective dimensions of the wgs are 3 m both horizontally and vertically generated wind uniformity increasing structures including circle to square shape transfer structures and 2 layers of honeycomb screens are mounted during the tests the model hub center height is located at the same elevation as the center of wgs the specification of the wgs and the generated wind field s quality are analyzed in our previous work nielsen et al 2006 and the spatial uniformity and turbulence intensity ti of the generated wind at the rotor plane are qualified also the proper position to locate the mwt is determined the mwt is located at x r 3 3 r is the mwt rotor radius wen et al 2019b the average wind speed and ti in the downwind direction at 5 4 m 6 6 m and 7 8 m to the wgs are depicted in fig 4 the red circle represents the mwt rotor swept area with the gradual mixture of flows extending downwind with the increase of x u m is gradually increasing and ti is decreasing generally the wind field maintains good uniformity in the rotor plane area as the ti keeps much lower here than that outside the rotor plane inside the rotor swept area the ti is about 10 strong interaction between the generated flow and the external still air outside the wgs edges causes the relatively lower average wind speed and higher ti where it is close to the edge of wgs in the present tests the 16 axial fans are collectively controlled to operate at the same rotation speed the analysis above indicates that the wind field generated by the wgs is reliable for the mwt basin tests 3 2 model wind turbine mwt to carry out wave basin tests a model wind turbine is geometrically scaled from the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine which is a traditional 3 bladed horizontal axis wind turbine the scaling ratio of the mwt is 1 50 the blades are made of carbon fiber in order to meet the scaled mass according to froude law it should note that an axis tilt angle of 5 and a blade pre cone of 2 5 are designed according to the prototype to avoid the blade tower strike the properties of the mwt and the full scaled prototype are shown in table 4 besides the scaled tower is geometrically designed and manufactured by carbon fiber which can imitate the tower shadow effect it is cone shaped with 7 74 cm top diameter and 12 cm at the bottom it should be noted that the mwt here is a scaled model based on froude law performing as an independent wind turbine in the study of this paper to compare the dynamic performance between sjtu s4 and oc3 hywind platform the test matrix is carefully selected to mitigate the adverse effects due to the mismatched reynolds number wen et al 2020 details about test matrix selection will be introduced later the nacelle design is crucial in mwt development the nacelle carries the rotating blades as well as a control system and a set of transducers while meeting the requirement of the limited total mass the nacelle designed in this paper is manufactured by high quality aluminum alloy to reduce the mass and guarantee the strength a coreless brushless direct current servo motor is used to maintain the rotor speed and between the rotor and motor a torque sensor is located to measure the aerodynamic torque the tower structure is geometrically scaled and manufactured by carbon fiber the mwt assembly is shown in fig 5 3 3 wave basin the model tests are carried out at a deep water offshore basin in skloe sjtu the basin is composed of a basin body and a deep well and can simulate various types of ocean environments such as wind waves and currents it is equipped with wave generation wave absorption current generation wind generation water depth adjustment and vehicle towing systems as well as various instruments and facilities for ocean engineering experiments and research the basin is capable of producing various types of waves as well as typical deep current with vertical fluid velocity profile the photos of the test system layout in the basin and a side view sketch are shown in fig 6 the motion track system markers are attached to the mwt the mwt sjtu s4 platform assembly is located 4 m away from the wgs in the wave basin the wgs is mounted on a customed base with sufficient space for wave passing through 3 4 test matrix in the present study the target water region is 100 m depth a group of regular wave test cases and a group of irregular wave test cases are selected the regular waves are defined with wave height h m and wave period t s the jonswap wave spectrum is used to define the irregular waves in this study with 3 main parameters significant wave height h s wave peak period t p and shape factor γ different shape factors are separately applied to each irregular wave it should be noted that the mwt in this paper is manufactured according to the froude scaling law which means it will face the mismatch of reynolds number causing a decreased rotor aerodynamic load martin et al 2014 to analyze the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 and compare it with the oc3 hywind platform the test matrix selection needs further explanation here in the basin test 2 different wind speeds are selected 13 3 m s and 31 1 m s full scale in the wave tests the rotor speed is maintained at 50 rpm the wind speeds for oc3 hywind platform s numerical simulation in this study are carefully selected to keep the aerodynamic loads similarity between the 2 fwts in the basin tests 5 regular wave cases and 3 irregular wave cases are selected in the basin test the speed of generated wind is 31 1 m s it should be noted that in the extreme sea state case the environmental loads include a current load of 2 m s full scale in the extreme sea state the mwt is shut down and blades are kept still additionally wave only cases are conducted to be baseline cases the parameters of waves are shown in table 5 and table 6 all the parameters are given in full scale it should be noted that all the wind and wave loads are co directional and co linear with mooring line 1 as shown in fig 3 4 results and discussions in this paper wind wave joint basin tests for different environmental cases are carried out basin tests include decay tests regular wave tests and irregular wave tests decay tests contain all the 6 degree of freedoms dofs each irregular wave test ran over 3 h full scale time before the tests the waves are calibrated in the wave basin without mwt fig 7 shows the measured wave time series in regular wave case no 3 and the measured wave spectrum in irregular wave case no 6 both the measured wave time series in regular wave cases and the wave spectra in irregular wave cases show acceptable correspondence with the targets to evaluate the performance of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt corresponding numerical simulations of oc3 hywind platform are conducted under the same environmental conditions to serve as a reference the comparison of the measured test results of sjtu s4 and numerical simulation results of oc3 hywind platform is presented in this part the 6 dofs of the fwt are measured by a motion track system at the model s center of mass 4 1 free decay test the natural period of spar type platform is an important index evaluating its hydrodynamic performance to this end still water decay tests with mooring system are carried out first to identify the natural periods of sjtu s4 the main results are shown in table 7 the time series of decay tests are shown in fig 8 due to the symmetry of spar type platform the surge and sway natural periods are almost the same and so as the pitch and roll natural periods in the decay tests single forces are separately applied to each degree of motion direction to induce the decay motion the heave natural period of sjtu s4 is 30 8 s which is close to that of oc3 hywind platform the surge natural period is 154 1 s significantly larger than 100s the difference between sjtu s4 and oc3 hywind lies in pitch and yaw natural periods the platform pitch natural period is mainly affected by the metacentric height rotational inertia and the restoring force applied by the mooring system stiffness while the yaw natural period is mainly affected by the mooring system stiffness and rotational inertia the pitch natural period of sjtu s4 is more than 10 s larger than that of oc3 hywind which is 24 2 s and the yaw natural period of the sjtu s4 is significantly larger than the 23 4 s yaw natural period of oc3 hywind the difference in mooring stiffness of the 2 platforms is the main cause of the significant larger yaw natural period of sjtu s4 and the sjtu s4 is expected to have mild yaw responses with larger yaw natural period which better avoids the wind and rotor rotation excitation frequency band therefore the sjtu s4 is expected to experience small fluctuation in aerodynamic load induced by platform dynamic yaw motion wen et al 2019a typically spar type fwts have over 100s surge and sway natural periods dnv 2019 the moored decay test shows that the design basically meets the characteristics in spar platform natural periods for offshore fwts characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations include the wave load and wind load as well as the characteristic rotation frequency of the rotor note that the peak spectral frequency of typical ocean wave is from 0 05 hz to 0 2 hz faltinsen 1990 corresponding to a period range from 5s to 20s while the driving wind frequency is in a much lower band the rotor 1 p once per revolution period range of nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine is from 4 959s to 8 696s and a 3 p period range from 1 65s to 2 90s jonkman et al 2009 it can be inferred that the motion natural frequencies of the sjtu s4 properly avoid the characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations and is expected to obtain good hydrodynamic performance 4 2 performance in regular waves regular wave tests of 5 different wave heights with generated wind inflows are carried out after still water decay tests to find out the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 when considering the dynamic responses of floating platforms the co linear regular wave and wind loads mainly induce the platform surge pitch and heave responses the pitch and surge motions are the main concerns for the great influence on rotor aerodynamic loads and the heave response also affects the operating stability of the equipment installed in the wind turbine the surge pitch and heave responses are discussed in this part the motion time series of surge and pitch in case no 5 are selected to compare and the results are shown in fig 9 the average surge displacements are individually subtracted in the time series comparison here only the dynamic surge motions around the equilibrium positions are taken into account it is clear that sjtu s4 has a better surge motion performance at the equilibrium position than oc3 hywind platform the averaged pitch motion is mainly induced by the wind loads applied on the rotor plane and the fluctuation is majorly induced by the wave loads the reduction in hydrostatic stiffness brought by the reduced draft and the smaller mooring stiffness in pitch direction result in a greater pitch magnitude of the sjtu s4 the pitch time series indicates that the pitch angular velocities of the 2 fwts remain nearly the same consequently it could be inferred that the 2 fwts will experience similar dynamic loads besides though the sjtu s4 has a greater pitch motion than oc3 hywind platform it remains below the acceptable criterion about 10 huijs et al 2013 the statistical comparison of platform motions is also shown in fig 10 the bars in the figure are the motion response amplitude operators rao defined as motion amplitude wave amplitude in surge pitch and heave under different regular cases with the 31 m s wind speed the straight lines on each bar represent the standard deviation of motion the results indicate that sjtu s4 platform has smaller surge motion response for which the potential reason is that the surge mooring stiffness of the sjtu s4 is greater than that of the oc3 hywind the waves in basin test for sjtu s4 and numerical simulations for oc3 hywind are the same fig 10 shows that the surge and pitch raos of both platforms decrease with the increasing wave period while the standard deviations of both platforms increase despite the relative large difference in raos the standard deviations of the surge and pitch responses for both platforms are close the heave rao of the sjtu s4 reduces slightly with the increasing wave period the dynamic response is also larger than that of the oc3 hywind this is due to the greatly reduced draft and different waterplane area the difference in mooring systems also contributes to this result the heave rao of oc3 hywind increases slightly with the increasing wave period 4 3 performance in irregular waves to further study and validate the performance of sjtu s4 in operating conditions irregular wave tests with 3 different significant wave heights and 2 different driving wind speeds are carried out the motions studied in this part stay consistent with that in the previous section including platform surge pitch and heave the more complex irregular wave loads brought larger differences in the standard deviation of motions in the direction perpendicular to environmental loads meanwhile the effects of system natural periods and error in model manufacture markedly increased the results of the surge comparison in fig 11 show that the mooring system of sjtu s4 has good surge constraint ability which is of great significance in shallow and moderate water regions the pitch motion of sjtu s4 in irregular wave cases stays close to that in regular wave cases remaining within 10 deg the standard deviations of surge and pitch show similar features with regular wave cases increasing with the significant wave height the average heave motion of the sjtu s4 in irregular waves weakens significantly while it first increases and then reduces with the increasing significant wave height besides the analysis of statistics comparison the spectra of the 3 motions under the wind speed of 31 m s are respectively presented in fig 12 fig 13 and fig 14 only wave frequency responses and responses at system natural frequencies are reflected in the spectrum under steady wind and wave cases cao et al 2019 nevertheless in real practical operating conditions the turbulence of wind inflow does exist arany et al 2015 and the turbulence excitation can greatly induce dynamic response at the low frequency range as reflected in the spectra here fig 12 is the power spectral density of surge motion under different significant wave heights rather than the response at wave frequency the dynamic response at platform natural frequencies dominates the spectrum fig 13 shows that there is obvious resonance oscillation at surge natural frequency in pitch response indicating that a significant coupling effect exists between pitch and surge motions in the meantime fig 14 indicates that only small resonance oscillation response at surge natural frequency emerges in heave motion response representing that the surge and heave motions are relatively independent without obvious coupling effect with other modes of motion the power spectral densities of surge pitch and heave under different driving wind speeds of 0 m s 13 3 m s and 31 1 m s are respectively presented in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 the significant wave height considered here is 7 m by comparing the spectra it can be found that the aerodynamic load has marginal influence on the response at wave frequency this is because the characteristic frequency bands of the 2 loads are far apart no significant coupling effect exists therefore the linear superposition method can be used to calculate aerodynamic and wave loads in some cases in wave only cases the second order wave forces including drift force cao et al 2020 induce resonance responses at platform natural frequencies and the coupled responses between different dofs are not obvious the influence of aerodynamic load on platform motions enhances with the increasing wind speeds fig 15 shows that in surge response the high speed wind increases the dynamic responses around the platform s surge natural frequency while the low speed wind slightly weakens the surge motion relatively fig 16 and 17 show that in pitch and heave responses the aerodynamic load substantially weakens the response at pitch and heave natural frequencies but enhances the resonance response at surge natural frequency meanwhile the response at wave frequency is slightly reduced this phenomenon can be explained by aerodynamic damping li et al 2018 this damping effect is more significant in the pitch motion which is sensitive to aerodynamic load the sensitivity to the wind speed of this phenomenon needs further validation compare the wave only case with the coupled wind and wave cases it also can be inferred that the coupled response at surge natural frequency in the spectrum of pitch motion is enhanced by the wind load such resonance response even can dominate the spectrum under large aerodynamic load nevertheless the yaw induced coupling and the gyroscopic effect of rotor rotation in the thrust matched model test mentioned in duan et al 2016 bahramiasl et al 2018 are not reflected in the present study from the spectra discussed in this section it can be determined that among the 3 important motions the surge is the most significant affecting the other 2 motions it even dominates the pitch response spectrum the pitch is the second and the heave is the least in the subsequent optimization work the surge and pitch performances should be modified first increasing the mooring system stiffness and adjusting the fairleads position could be effective methods also mounting damping structures helps reduce the dynamic responses of the platform 4 4 performance in extreme sea state it is of great importance to validate the survival capability of the system in fwt model tests the extreme sea state case of sjtu s4 is conducted after the regular wave cases and the irregular wave tests in this case the wind speed is 35 m s and the significant wave height is 13 m also an additional current with a speed of 2 m s is generated to simulate the survival condition in this case the rotor is parked and kept still in y style the equipment in wind turbine is considered to be shut down thus the heave response is not discussed in this part since the current load is taken into account the roll and sway motions are studied for the possible existence of vortex induced motion see table 8 the statistics of platform motions in extreme sea state case is shown in table 5 as common knowledge the aerodynamic load is the major impact on the fwt s pitch motion the great reduction in aerodynamic load on the rotor plane in this case leads to a smaller pitch motion the surge motion of sjtu s4 in extreme sea state case increases apparently this is due to the larger waves and an initial displacement in surge direction is induced by the current it should be noted that the average sway motion is over 5 m and the standard deviation is significantly larger than that of the other 3 motions which indicating the possible existence of current or vortex induced vibration fig 18 shows the power spectral density of surge and pitch in extreme sea state case in the spectra of extreme sea state case the energy distribution is similar to the wave only case due to the larger wave the proportion of energy at wave frequency increases the dynamic responses at natural frequencies and the resonance oscillation response at surge natural frequency in pitch motion are weakened which could be due to the smaller aerodynamic loads on the rotor plane the surge response in extreme sea state is induced by both the current and wave load including current induced in line oscillation sumer and fredsoe 2006 the sway and roll spectra contain little wave frequency response further representing that the dynamic responses of these 2 motions are induced by turbulent wind load and current load the zoom in image in fig 18 represents significant sway responses under the current load including cross flow oscillation sumer and fredsoe 2006 both the sway response spectrum in fig 18 and sway time series presented in fig 19 indicate the existence of the current or vortex induced vibration since this is not in the scope of the present study it will not be further discussed the resonance oscillation response in roll motion is also observed in the spectrum besides it is interesting to observe that the surge and pitch spectral response peaks vary slightly towards the lower frequency position this is due to the nonlinear nature of the catenary mooring system souza and bachynski 2019 under changed coupled environmental load conditions resulting in a different system stiffness 5 conclusions and prospects deploying spar type fwts in moderate water depths shows good application potential with the motivation of deploying fwts with a smaller draft a novel stepped short spar for shallow water is proposed by shanghai jiao tong university named as sjtu s4 an integrated experimental apparatus is set up and comprehensive tests are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed sjtu s4 fwt extensive operating and survival conditions with different regular irregular waves and varying wind speeds are tested based on the experimental analysis and discussion the main conclusions are drawn as below 1 the sjtu s4 fwt is developed dedicatedly for the water depth of 100 m in china seas it has a novel stepped structure design with a draft of 50 m referring to the commercially successful oc3 hywind fwt 2 an experimental apparatus is set up to test the dynamic performance of sjtu s4 the natural frequencies of sjtu s4 avoid the characteristic frequency bands of the main environmental excitations and the overall performance is acceptable in the direction collinear to environmental loads the surge behavior seems to be better than oc3 hywind platform and the pitch response is in a reasonable range in the direction perpendicular to environmental loads the average sway and roll performance of sjtu s4 is inferior to oc3 hywind but it is still kept in an acceptable range survival tests indicate that the sjtu s4 could maintain acceptable surge and pitch motions when the rotor is parked in extreme sea state showing reasonable viability 3 the statistics obtained in the tests of this paper can provide relevant model test experience and data reserve for future research observing and validating several aerodynamic phenomena wind induced resonance response between different modes of motion is observed in wind and wave combination tests aerodynamic load tends to damp the surge and pitch motions of the platform weakening the response at pitch natural frequency large wind load also enhances the resonance response at surge natural frequency in pitch motion changed environmental conditions also induce an offset of the dynamic spectral response peak up till now the work presented in this paper has preliminarily validated the feasibility of deploying spar type fwts with 50 m draft in moderate water depths further work still needs to be conducted the mass distribution of the whole fwt system needs further optimization for its great impact on the platform s motion performance the influence of large pitch magnitude on the power production rotor load and gyroscopic moment needs further investigation in addition the sensitivity of sjtu s4 motion performance to the wind speeds needs further validation credit authorship contribution statement zhihao jiang conceptualization

20676,nowadays aluminium alloys are very popular for use in the marine industry one of the most important applications of aluminium in the marine industry is the construction of high speed vessels with the expansion of the role of high speed vessels applying ultimate strength based design methods for structural design and optimization of aluminium vessels is getting more attention formulations developed for steel structures ultimate strength prediction cannot be used directly for aluminium alloys structures this is mainly due to the different nature of various aluminium alloys material behaviour in terms of stress strain relationship compared to steel besides initial imperfections generated during fabrication including initial deflections residual stresses and softening of material in the heat affected zone make a significant difference between aluminium alloys and steel structures many research studies employed various methods for the investigation of aluminium structures

workboats the use of aluminium for the main hull of high speed vessels began in the 1990s the size of such aluminium high speed vessels has been dramatically increased over the years sielski 2007 aluminium high speed vessels are employed in commercial and non commercial maritime transport because of the many benefits aluminium vessels provide by increasing the duty of aluminium vessels applying ultimate strength based design methods for structural design and optimization of aluminium vessels is getting more attention as a replacement for allowable stress techniques collette 2007 fig 1 shows the progressive development of high speed aluminium vessels from the 1990s as reported by incat incat 2020 the use of aluminium alloys in the shipbuilding industry has many advantages but also include many disadvantages and challenges the advantages of using aluminium alloys compared to steel include lower weight excellent resistance to corrosion and less maintenance challenges of using aluminium include reduced stiffness buckling and plastic collapse as well as different welding methods used for aluminium alloys paik et al 2008 increasing the size of high speed aluminium vessels has led to many design challenges compared to vessels with shorter lengths apart from the lower stiffness of aluminium alloys compared to steel structures there is almost no defined ultimate strength based design method either locally or globally for aluminium structures paik et al 2008 formulations developed for ultimate strength prediction of steel structures cannot be used directly for aluminium alloys structures even if the material properties are correctly considered this is in some extent related to the natural difference between the material behaviour of various types of aluminium alloys in terms of the stress strain curve and structural steel for aluminium structures in the elastic plastic range after the proportional limit the effect of strain hardening is significant on the ultimate strength of the structure while the elastic perfectly plastic material behaviour for steel structures is well accepted also the ultimate strength of aluminium structures is significantly affected by the softening in the heat affected zone haz while in the case of steel structures this effect is less important also the lack of information related to the initial imperfections caused by fabrication and welding leads to more design and construction related uncertainty for marine aluminium structures compared to steel structures paik et al 2008 many research studies have investigated aluminium plated marine structures in terms of ultimate strength considering different effective parameters these studies can be reviewed from various aspects including the extent of structural geometry unstiffened plate stiffened plate and ship hull girder material characteristics fabrication induced initial imperfections type of loading and investigation method experimental numerical and analytical in this paper important research activities in the field of ultimate strength of aluminium vessels elements and systems are reviewed in detail firstly aluminium alloys used for marine applications are described and then research studies on the ultimate strength of aluminium structures are briefly reviewed analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium structures in association with material properties investigation methods structural geometry initial imperfections boundary and loading conditions is discussed research studies on the strength of aluminium structures under fatigue and cracking damage are also reviewed this review study conclusions can be used as a guideline for future research 2 aluminium alloys for marine applications the use of aluminium structures for a variety of marine applications such as hull and deck of high speed vessels especially catamarans and also the superstructure of ships is of great interest other applications include box girder bridges walls and floors of offshore modules and containers the need to reduce structural weight increase payload capacity increase speed and reduce fuel consumption is some of the factors that have led to the use of aluminium in the marine industry contrary to steel structures the ultimate strength and collapse behaviour of aluminium structures in addition to the initial imperfections i e initial deflections and residual stresses are significantly affected by the nonlinearity of material and mechanical strength reduction in the heat affected zone induced due to welding mechanical strength reduction in haz depends on the alloy type its temper welding process and welding parameters this reduction is generally between 30 and 50 of the strength of the base material for common alloys considered for shipbuilding and joined by fusion welding yoshikawa et al 2015 it is recognized that the strength of aluminium alloys in the softened zone may be recovered by natural aging over a period of time paik 2018 however the reduction in mechanical strength in haz leads to a significant reduction in the structural strength as far as the material strength in haz is not recovered utilization of ultimate strength analysis for aluminium ships requires adapted ultimate strength calculating methods that consider the influences of the alloy type and temper material behaviour softening in the haz initial imperfections and loading type however the available studies are relatively scarce compared to steel structures yoshikawa et al 2015 in the field of aluminium structures in the early 1980s a set of 76 unstiffened aluminium plates was tested by mofflin 1983 and mofflin and dwight mofflin et al 1984 at the university of cambridge uk these tests are among the most prominent and largest and earliest collapse tests ever performed on aluminium plates in these tests the two most common aluminium alloys used in the marine industry including 5083 and 6082 alloys have been tested after tungsten inert gas tig welding in the longitudinal direction and metal inert gas mig welding in the transverse direction initial deflections and residual stresses are measured and then their effect on the collapse behaviour of plates is investigated in the late 1980s clarke and swan 1985 and clarke clarke and narayanan 1987 conducted collapse tests on five stiffened aluminium plates at the admiralty research establishment are uk these tests are one of the earliest collapse tests in which welded full scale aluminium stiffened plates are studied the materials used in the tests were equivalent to 5083 aluminium alloys after are tests many research works have been performed on the ultimate strength of aluminium plated structures considering different aspects of aluminium alloys reference can be made to studies carried out by matsuoka et al 1997 hopperstad et al 1997 1999 kristensen and moan 1999 aalberg et al 2001 zha and moan 2001 2003 rigo et al 2003 paik and duran 2004 paik et al 2005a 2005b paik 2007a collette 2007 paik et al 2008 paik 2009 khedmati and ghavami 2009 khedmati et al 2009 2010a 2010b chen and moan 2010 rønning et al 2010 benson et al 2011 zareei et al 2012 paik et al 2012 benson et al 2013a 2013b 2013c paulo et al 2013 khedmati et al 2014 pedram and khedmati 2014 magoga and flockhart 2014 khedmati et al 2015 2016 farajkhah and liu 2016 li et al 2018 and mohammadi et al 2019 fig 2 shows a summary of research carried out on the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures according to structural geometry and method of investigation 3 aspects of analysing ultimate strength of aluminium structures 3 1 material properties aluminium alloys used for structural applications cover a wide range however for marine applications 5000 and 6000 series alloys are generally used these alloys have good corrosion resistance are weldable and also are economically available 5000 series alloys are commonly used as rolled plates and are scarcely extruded these alloys are strain hardened 6000 series alloys can be easily extruded and form sections with complex shapes such as bulb t and l sections and also closed section stiffeners like trapezoidal stiffeners the strength of 6000 series alloys is gained by heat treatment the difference between marine aluminium alloys of 5000 and 6000 series and steel alloys in terms of ultimate strength regardless of corrosion and fatigue is summarized below collette et al 2008 the elastic modulus of aluminium alloys is approximately one third the elastic modulus of steel the shape of the stress strain curve for aluminium alloys is generally more rounded than for steel typically no specific point can be identified as the yield for aluminium alloys in the stress strain curve and therefore a 0 2 offset proof stress is considered as an alternative to yield strength the differences in material stress strain curves between typical ship steel plating and typical marine grade aluminium alloys are shown in fig 3 due to fusion welding both 5000 and 6000 series alloys are weakened in a local region close to the weld this local region is known as the heat affected zone the minimum requirements of mechanical properties for rolled and extruded 5000 and 6000 series aluminium alloys according to the international association of classification societies iacs iacs 2014 is illustrated in table 1 and table 2 in the theoretical and numerical analysis of aluminium structures two types of material models are generally utilized to analyse of ultimate strength actual stress strain relationship obtained from mechanical tests and approximate models like ramberg osgood model moreover the elastic perfectly plastic material model is also used by some authors if the stress strain curve of the material is not available but its main mechanical properties such as young s modulus of elasticity and yield strength are known then engineering stress strain curve can be obtained with a very good approximation by the ramberg osgood equation which was originally proposed by ramberg and osgood 1941 to derive the stress strain relationship of aluminium alloys hughes and paik 2010 this equation is widely used in many research works and is mentioned in various references such an annex of eurocode 9 eurocode 9 and 2009 design 2009 and also mazzolani 1995 and hughes and paik 2010 the actual material behaviour model as well as the ramberg osgood model represents the relationship between engineering stresses and engineering strains however nonlinear finite element analyses actually use the relationship of the material characteristics between the true stresses and strains which can be approximately estimated from the corresponding relationship between the engineering stresses and strains hughes and paik 2010 material models utilized for analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium structures are presented in table 3 it is notable that besides ramberg osgood model that is of the ϵ ϵ σ form and is shown to be very useful for ultimate strength analysis of marine aluminium structures there are other approximate models of the σ σ ϵ form such as the model proposed by mazzolani 1995 the latter types of the models are not applied for analysis of marine aluminium structures based on studied references some references directly focused on obtaining mechanical properties from tensile tests the corresponding results in such references might or might not use for ultimate strength analyses following research studies can be used as a reference for actual stress strain relationship of various aluminium alloys hopperstad et al 1999 for aluminium alloys 6082 t4 and 6082 t6 aalberg et al 2001 rønning et al 2010 for aluminium alloy 6082 t6 paik and duran 2004 for aluminium alloy 5383 h116 paik et al 2005a for aluminium alloys 5083 h116 and 5383 h116 paik et al 2008 for aluminium alloys 5083 h116 5383 h112 5383 h116 and 6082 t6 paik 2009 for aluminium alloys 5083 h112 5383 h116 5083 h116 6082 t6 and 5383 h112 paik et al 2012 for aluminium alloys5383 h116 and 5083 h112 mechanical properties and stress strain relationship of aluminium alloys are also investigated in association with environmental and operational conditions paik et al 2017 developed a new test database that considers the effects of cold temperatures and strain rates for marine grade structural materials such as mild steel high tensile steel aluminium alloy 5083 o and stainless steel 304l the details of the materials stress strain curves are presented in this study mechanical properties documented for strain rates ranging from 0 001 s 0 09 s 1 8 s and 34 s and temperatures including 160 c 120 c and 20 c for aluminium alloys paik et al 2017 also developed mechanical property database management system mpdas software which can predict material properties based on the test database various types of materials especially aluminium alloys are considered in this software the developed software considers the effects of strain rates up to 100 s and temperatures in the range of 200 c 20 c engineering stress engineering strain curves for aluminium alloy 5083 at room temperature 120 c and 160 c and various strain rates based on test databases presented in paik et al 2017 is shown in fig 4 summers et al 2015 reviewed the mechanical behaviour of 5083 h116 and 6061 t651 aluminium alloys during and after fires the high temperature quasi static mechanical and creep behaviour is discussed a review is also provided on modelling techniques for residual mechanical behaviour at high temperatures moreover stress strain relationship of 5083 h116 and 6061 t651 aluminium alloys is presented at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 500 c 3 2 investigation methods investigation into the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures is categorized in three methods including experimental works analytical investigations and numerical modelling in some research studies a combination of different methods is used for validation 3 2 1 experimental works matsuoka et al 1997 investigated the buckling strength of lightened aluminium hull structures under axial compression hull structures models constructed by pi shaped sections pre ribbed panels and extruded hollow sections were tested fig 5 shows the experimental test set up four transverse sections of the structure were elastically restrained and the arrangement was designed to ensure compression in the longitudinal direction through the bar at both ends hopperstad et al 1999 conducted an experimental study of the ultimate strength of outstands fabricated from aluminium alloys post buckling behaviour of thin walled cruciform aluminium extrusions was tested under axial compressive loading aalberg et al 2001 experimentally studied the collapse behaviour of stiffened aluminium panels of 6082 t6 alloys under axial compression the test panels were constructed from extruded aluminium profiles which were joined by longitudinal welds panels consisting of open section l shaped stiffeners and closed section stiffeners were considered fig 6 shows their test structures more details are provided in the paper in zha and moan 2001 2003 the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium plates with predominantly torsional buckling or tripping failure modes has been investigated in the studies aluminium plates with flat bar stiffeners considered paik et al 2008 paik 2009 and paik et al 2012 experimentally investigated the buckling collapse and ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium plated structures under axial compressive loading aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed using gas metal arc welding and also friction stir welding examined the test structures were equivalent to sub structures of an 80 m long aluminium high speed vessel rønning et al 2010 conducted experimental studies to investigate the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels of alloy 6082 t6 under in plane transverse compressive loads twenty one stiffened panels with different aspect ratios consisting of both open and closed stiffener sections were investigated 3 2 2 analytical studies paik et al 2005b compared some practical analytical ultimate strength analysis methods adopted for the design of aerospace marine and land based aluminium structures against experimental and numerical methods isum and fem analysed methods include the euler johnson e j method dnv puls steen et al 2001 paik duran empirical formulae paik and duran 2004 eurocode 9 method and aluminium association method it was concluded that dnv puls isum alps ulsap and the paik duran empirical formulae developed for the ultimate strength prediction of marine grade aluminium panels provide much better results than euler johnson e j eurocode 9 and aluminium association methods when compared to performed finite element analyses and existing experimental results paik and duran 2004 paik 2007a paik et al 2008 paik 2009 khedmati et al 2010b zareei et al 2012 khedmati et al 2015 and khedmati et al 2016 presented empirical formulations for estimating ultimate strength of aluminium plates and stiffened plates subjected to different loading proposed empirical formulations are based on fe analyses and or experimental investigations table 4 shows some formulations as presented by different researchers 3 2 3 numerical modelling the size and intricacy of the structure of aluminium vessels along with extensive parameters affecting the aluminium structures ultimate strength has made experimental studies to be almost difficult it is relatively easy to construct unstiffened and stiffened aluminium plates however it is costly and also time consuming to perform different tests that take into account various aspects of an aluminium structure like alloy types and tempers welding method and welding induced initial imperfections therefore the use of numerical methods to simulate the behaviour of aluminium structures and also to evaluate the ultimate strength is suggested the finite element method fem and methods developed as a substitute for the conventional finite element method are the most common numerical methods used for evaluating the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures alternative methods to the finite element method include the smith method idealized structural unit method isum and intelligent supersize finite element method isfem the isum resolves the issue of computation time comparing to fem while keeping the computational accuracy at a reasonable level in this method a large sized structural member is modelled as a structural unit or a supersize finite element in the isfem historically the idea of this method was initiated by ueda and rashed 1974 who named this method the idealized structural unit method the first effort of ueda and rashed was to formulate the ultimate strength behaviour of the deep girder unit for analysing the ultimate transverse strength of a ship in an almost parallel development smith 1977 considered the same idea which is sometimes called the smith method in this method the nonlinear behaviour of plate stiffener combinations is formulated for analysing the ultimate longitudinal strength of ships more information about the three mentioned methods can be found in hughes and paik 2010 and corresponding references ueda and rashed 1974 smith 1977 smith 1977 1977 paik 2006 the differences between smith isum and isfem generally appear in structural modelling techniques formulating the nonlinear behaviour of the structural units and considering the interacting effects of local and overall failures hughes and paik 2010 various commercial and non commercial packages have been used by researchers for numerical modelling and aluminium structures ultimate strength analysis and their validity has been confirmed table 5 presents these packages along with the references that have used them throughout the paper more details about numerical modelling including the structural geometry initial imperfections boundary and loading conditions and etc are discussed 3 3 structural geometry aluminium used for the construction of marine vessels is generally available in three forms including sheet flat plate and extruded shapes extrusions can be ordered in various standard structural shapes such as tees angles flat bars bulb flats and bulb tees sielski 2007 the possibility of constructing aluminium in extruded shapes allows the designer to replace the conventional plate and welded stiffener panels with integrated extruded units such as single extruded units sandwich extrusions or hat type panel structures these extruded units are generally used for the construction of large and flat decks such as the deck of cargo and passenger vessels cross deck of multi hull vessels and the side shell above the waterline of aluminium vessels collette et al 2008 a conventional panel against various types of extruded panels is shown in fig 7 in fig 8 breakdown of a typical aluminium catamaran ship hull girder into smaller subdivisions is shown in terms of structural geometry three levels are considered for analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures these three levels include unstiffened plates stiffened plates and ship hull girders 3 3 1 unstiffened plates for unstiffened plates studies with respect to stiffened plates are scarce hopperstad et al 1997 investigated the reliability of the finite element method for calculating the ultimate strength of aluminium plates subjected to in plane compression aluminium plates of alloys 5083 m and 6082 tf were analysed for different b t ratios and non welded and welded conditions the accuracy of the estimated results was evaluated by comparison with existing experimental results also kristensen and moan 1999 studied the collapse strength of rectangular aluminium plates under uniaxial and biaxial compressive stresses both non welded and welded plates with residual stresses and softened zones were considered for numerical simulations the finite element method was utilized using abaqus paik and duran 2004 investigated the ultimate strength of aluminium plates with various geometric properties under axial compressive loads they conducted elastic plastic large deflection finite element analyses using ansys welding induced initial imperfections assumed for the analyses closed form ultimate compressive strength formulations for aluminium plates were derived by regression analysis of the computed results benson et al 2011 2013a examined the strength of a series of unstiffened aluminium plates with material and geometric parameters typical of aluminium vessels using a non linear finite element approach under uniaxial and biaxial compressive loads and also lateral pressure loading the effects of alloy type geometric imperfection shape heat affected zone and residual stresses considered through investigations 3 3 2 stiffened plates ultimate and collapse strength investigation of marine grade aluminium stiffened plates are studies in more detail by researchers studies include different loading and various geometry of aluminium profiles both extruded and non extruded studies performed experimentally numerically and or analytically table 6 contains a list of conducted studies on this level 3 3 3 girder structures for aluminium girder structures the studies are very limited matsuoka et al 1997 studied the buckling strength of lightened aluminium hull structures under axial compression studies carried out by experimental tests as well as numerical and simplified analytical investigations aluminium girder structures constructed from pi shaped sections pre ribbed panels and extruded hollow sections examined for more details of structural models and test results matsuoka et al 1997 is referred to after matsuoka et al limited number of studies performed focusing on ultimate strength and progressive collapse analysis of aluminium hull girders fig 9 shows a schematic of girder structures used in subsequent analyses paik et al 2005a investigated the ultimate strength of the hull girder of a 120m long aluminium catamaran fast ship alps hull program based on isum idealized structural unit method approach used for progressive collapse analysis of the ship hull girder a sliced hull section between two transverse frames is taken as the extent of the analysis for alps hull simulations the ship hull is modelled as an assembly of plate elements and support members initial imperfections at an average level are considered for all structural elements progressive collapse analysis for the ship hull girder of aluminium catamaran performed under sagging and hogging moments the effect of horizontal bending moment on ultimate strength of the hull girder is also studied collette 2007 investigated the response of an aluminium box girder under hogging bending moment box girder response was calculated using an incremental curvature smith type approach benson et al 2013b 2013c used various methods to evaluate the collapse behaviour of a number of box girders with similar dimensions to large aluminium ships and also an aluminium catamaran hull girder the comparative study involves applying an extended progressive collapse methodology which was developed by the authors specifically to predict the strength behaviour of aluminium hull structures under primary bending moment and accounts for compartment level the approach is based on the principles of the smith progressive collapse methodology for comparison the extended progressive collapse methodology is examined against the conventional smith method at the interframe level and nonlinear finite element analyses magoga and flockhart 2014 studied the ultimate hull girder strength of the mid ship section between transverse frames of an aluminium high speed patrol craft constructed by mig welding under vertical and horizontal bending moments using isfem intelligent supersize finite element method approach and alps hull computer program the effects of welding induced imperfections including plate and stiffener deflections residual stresses and material softening in haz on ultimate strength are investigated in the analyses farajkhah and liu 2016 investigated the ultimate strength of an aluminium box girder using the smith method before ultimate strength analyses a three dimensional finite element model was developed to simulate the welding process on aluminium stiffened plates with extruded and non extruded tee bar stiffeners friction stir welding fsw metal inert gas mig butt welding and mig fillet welding simulated during analyses residual stresses initial deflections and also heat affected zones have been obtained for these welding methods the load shortening curves for analysed stiffened plates used for ultimate strength calculation of the prescribed hull girder 3 4 initial imperfections the most common imperfections in aluminium plated structures constructed by welding are initial deflections residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone initial deflections are known as geometrical imperfections welding residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone are known as mechanical imperfections initial deflections include deflections that appear in plating and support members during the welding process as a result of welding residual stresses are generated due to applied thermal loads tensile residual stresses remain in the haz and compressive residual stresses develop in other areas so that equilibrium of internal forces to be preserved due to softening of materials in the heat affected zone by welding the strength of haz is generally reduced since such fabrication related initial imperfections affect the structural properties and load carrying capacity of the structure they must be considered as effective parameters in structural design and analysis in contrast to steel structures the initial imperfection measurement for aluminium structures is scarce among them the studies by aalberg et al 2001 zha and moan 2001 2003 paik 2007b paik et al 2008 paik 2009 rønning et al 2010 paik et al 2012 and hosseinabadi et al 2021 directly focused on measuring the initial imperfections also farajkhah and liu 2016 carried out thermo mechanical finite element simulations to obtain the welding induced deflections residual stresses and haz for fsw and mig welding methods aalberg et al 2001 measured the initial deflection of test structures in their experimental investigation of aluminium stiffened panels subjected to axial compressive loads zha and moan 2001 2003 measured initial deflections induced in plates and stiffeners of test structures in their ultimate strength assessment of aluminium stiffened panels with predominantly torsional failure modes paik 2007b measured welding induced initial deflections of aluminium plating used in marine structures seventy eight stiffened plates equivalent to sub structures of an 80 m long full aluminium high speed vessel constructed using mig welding after construction the initial deflection of plating between stiffeners was measured according to the statistical analysis of the measured data simplified levels based on the breadth of the plates proposed to estimate the maximum value of the initial deflection of the aluminium plating paik et al 2008 measured initial imperfections induced in plates and stiffeners in their ultimate strength investigation of seventy eight aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed by mig welding initial deflections including initial deflection of plating between stiffeners column type initial distortion of stiffeners and sideways initial distortion of stiffeners as well as residual stresses in plating and stiffener web and breadth of the heat affected zone were measured according to measured values and statistical analyses three levels presented for estimating each component of initial imperfection also paik 2009 measured initial deflection of plating between stiffeners column type initial deflection of stiffeners sideways initial deflection of stiffeners residual stresses in plating and stiffener web and breadth of the heat affected zone for stiffened aluminium plates constructed by friction stir welding measured values compared between fsw and mig welding methods rønning et al 2010 carried out an extensive measurement study to determine the distribution of the geometrical initial imperfections due to mig and fsw welding they also used vickers hardness tests to determine the strength reduction and extent of the heat affected zone paik et al 2012 measured welding induced initial imperfections during collapse behaviour assessment of aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed by fusion welding under axial compression recently hosseinabadi et al 2021 measured initial deflections of aluminium plating between stiffeners for different panels of four aluminium vessels constructed by the semi automatic mig welding method two average levels predicted for the maximum value of initial deflections of aluminium plating based on the plate thickness plate slenderness ratio and plate breadth using statistical analyses of measured data 3 4 1 geometrical imperfections three types of welding induced initial deflections are generally considered for welded stiffened plate structures including initial deflection of plating between the support members column type initial deflection of support members and sideways initial deflection of the support members paik 2018 different modelling features can be used for the fe simulation of initial deflections in the case of aluminium structures three approaches are commonly used in related literature as follows direct measurement of initial deflection components and applying for fe simulations zha and moan 2001 zha and moan 2003 paik et al 2008 paik 2009 paik et al 2012 using lateral pressure for generating initial deflections as shown in fig 10 rigo et al 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 khedmati et al 2009 khedmati et al 2010a khedmati et al 2010b zareei et al 2012 khedmati et al 2014 pedram and khedmati 2014 khedmati et al 2015 khedmati et al 2016 li et al 2018 using fourier series for generating initial deflections as presented in table 7 applying initial deflection by analysing eigenvalue buckling modes is also used in some research works like paulo et al 2013 and li et al 2018 also paulo et al 2013 used another different approach they conducted compression analyses without any imperfection the deformed shape of the structure at the collapse point is considered as the initial imperfection 3 4 2 mechanical imperfections welding is the most usual method used for building aluminium marine structures when aluminium alloys are heated locally the heated regions will expand but it will be subjected to compressive stresses due to the adjacent cold regions when the heated region cools down it undergoes local shrinkage and is therefore exposed to tensile stress as a result of welding tensile residual stresses remain in the haz and compressive residual stresses develop in other areas so that the equilibrium of internal forces to be preserved due to welding the softening phenomenon occurs in the heat affected zone and subsequently the material is softened and the yield strength of the haz is reduced paik et al 2008 for finite element analysis tensile and compressive residual stresses are often considered as initial stresses in terms of structural analysis of aluminium structures in association with softening in the heat affected zone the breadth of the softening zones yield strength reduction and also the location of haz plays a primary role mechanical initial imperfections including welding residual stresses and heat affected zone as used by different researchers in numerical studies are summarized in table 8 3 5 boundary conditions improper modelling of boundary and loading conditions in finite element analyses may lead to incorrect results for ultimate strength paik et al 2008 structural member s location in the ship hull girder directly affects the boundary conditions selected for experimental and numerical investigations in a continuous stiffened plated structure the edges of the plate elements are supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames a simply supported boundary condition is usually assumed to give a lower bound load shortening curve while the upper bound is usually the clamped plate benson et al 2013a simply supported boundary conditions have been of interest to many researchers for ultimate strength analysis of unstiffened aluminium plates hopperstad et al 1997 paik and duran 2004 and benson et al 2013a selected simply supported boundary conditions for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium plates under longitudinal axial compression while the same boundary condition is considered by kristensen and moan 1999 and benson et al 2011 under uniaxial and biaxial compression a stiffened plate is an assembly of plate elements and support members for ultimate strength analysis of stiffened aluminium plates either experimental or numerical various boundary conditions for different structural extent are implemented by researchers to conclude accurate results under applied loading conditions table 9 illustrates a summary of considered boundary conditions by researchers in the category of hull structures benson et al 2013b for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium box girders under longitudinal bending moment conducted a series of compartment level analyses using a complete fem model the box girders had seven bays within the compartment and additional single bays at each end to minimize boundary effects the bulkheads modelled with very large thicknesses to keep the compartment ends straight the box was fixed at one end and free to rotate and translate at the other the bending moment applied by rotation control about a reference point tied by rigid body constraints to all nodes at the free end the same boundary condition applied by benson et al 2013c for an aluminium catamaran hull girder to the extent of ½ 1 ½ bay and 1 bay 1 compartment 1 bay fem models a schematic of the applied boundary condition is shown in fig 11 4 strength of aluminium structures under fatigue and cracking damage research related to the design of aluminium structures to resist fatigue damage is very limited due to the lack of information on fatigue strength of typical structural details used in aluminium marine vessels sielski 2008 several organizations have published design codes relating to the fatigue strength of aluminium structural details the most relevant of these codes is eurocode 9 eurocode 9 and 2011 design 2011 as a review of methods and corresponding codes and standards for the assessment of fatigue strength of welded aluminium alloy structures reference can be made to maddox 2003 in maddox 2003 maddox reviewed methods for evaluating fatigue strength of welded aluminium structures from the point of view of design and estimation of the residual life of welded aluminium structures studies related to fatigue and fracture of aluminium marine structures are very scarce collette 2005 presented newly developed reliability based design techniques for the ultimate strength and fatigue strength assessment of aluminium stiffened panels a reliability based hot spot s n fatigue prediction method is developed for welded connections including an analysis of the material and prediction of uncertainty values and a comparison with existing design codes ye 2007 evaluated the fatigue strength of aluminium welded box stiffener joints used in ships three similar web frame box stiffener connections are considered in this study welded aluminium box stiffener connections are investigated by carrying out fatigue tests as well as numerical evaluations important weld parameters that may considerably affect the fatigue strength are examined vafai and estekanchi 1999 studied the overall behaviour of aluminium plates and shells in the elastic range damaged due to the presence of a through crack using the finite element method various parameters such as the order of mesh refining at the crack tip the effect of boundary conditions poisson s ratio and crack length and shell curvature are studied the basic fe model in this study is a square aluminium alloy plate with dimensions 2 0 m by 2 0 m and 1 0 cm in thickness loaded under tension estekanchi and vafai 1999 studied the buckling of cylindrical aluminium shells with through cracks using the finite element method the buckling behaviour of cracked cylinders in tension and compression has been studied with cracks of varying length and orientation vaziri and estekanchi 2006 evaluated the buckling behaviour of cracked cylindrical thin shells using the finite element method under combined internal pressure and axial compression in order to study the effect of crack type size and orientation brighenti investigated buckling of cracked rectangular aluminium thin plates using finite element various crack parameters under tension compression and shear loading are considered in his studies brighenti 2005a 2005b 2009 brighenti and carpinteri 2011 more information about the ultimate strength of cracked ship structural elements and systems including aluminium ship structures is referred to babazadeh and khedmati 2018 5 discussions and future prospects in this paper a review of published studies on the ultimate strength of aluminium plated structures is performed different aspects affecting on the ultimate strength of an aluminium structure including material properties investigation methods structural geometry fabrication related and welding induced initial imperfections and also boundary conditions reviewed based on of literature for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium marine structures actual material behaviour is more interested in achieving reliable results ramberg osgood approximation model is also used in some research as a replacement of the actual material behaviour model this is in contrast to steel structures which are usually simulated using the elastic perfectly plastic material model ultimate strength analysis on aluminium marine stiffened panels is investigated broadly however for aluminium marine structures in the extent of unstiffened plates and ship hull girders using experimental and analytical investigations is scarce this is discernible from fig 2 for numerical analyses approaches such as the nonlinear finite element analysis method and fem alternative methods like smith isum and also isfem especially for girder analyses have received much attention ultimate strength investigation using experimental studies for unstiffened plates and ship shaped box girders under global hull girder loads and developing analytical closed form formulations for unstiffened plates and ship hull girders seems to be the most important issues that must be considered in future studies by researchers unlike steel structures with abundant data on initial imperfections the database on welding induced initial imperfections including initial deflections welding residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone for welded aluminium plated structures are scarce therefore the design and construction of aluminium vessels are faced by more uncertainty than the similar steel vessels in contrast to marine steel structures which there are accepted relations for ultimate strength estimation of plated and hull structures for aluminium structures simplified closed form relationships are very limited as described previously there are some simplified formulations for ultimate strength estimation of unstiffened stiffened aluminium plates but for hull girders there is no relationship there is a growing interest in using aluminium extruded panels which directly affects welding induced initial imperfection by reducing welding however there are few published experimental and numerical works on these structures therefore the difference of them with traditional aluminium panels must be investigated in terms of ultimate strength the effect of using this type of structure on the ultimate strength of hull girder structures especially multi hull vessels has to be studied smith or isum progressive collapse methods which both follow the same idea as well as the isfem method have been shown to be capable measures for ultimate strength analysis of steel ships hughes and paik 2010 therefore it is used for strength assessment in some research regarding aluminium vessels these methods need to be further evaluated for aluminium vessels especially large sized multi hull ships by considering the pre mentioned aspects of aluminium alloy structures using smith isum and isfem methods overcome the issue of computational time in fem analyses of hull girders while keeping the accuracy at a reasonable level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20676,nowadays aluminium alloys are very popular for use in the marine industry one of the most important applications of aluminium in the marine industry is the construction of high speed vessels with the expansion of the role of high speed vessels applying ultimate strength based design methods for structural design and optimization of aluminium vessels is getting more attention formulations developed for steel structures ultimate strength prediction cannot be used directly for aluminium alloys structures this is mainly due to the different nature of various aluminium alloys material behaviour in terms of stress strain relationship compared to steel besides initial imperfections generated during fabrication including initial deflections residual stresses and softening of material in the heat affected zone make a significant difference between aluminium alloys and steel structures many research studies employed various methods for the investigation of aluminium structures ultimate strength these studies mainly focused on understanding the effects of different parameters this paper reviews parameters such as stress strain relationship initial imperfections boundary conditions and extent of analysis which affects the ultimate strength of aluminium ship hull girder elements the concluding remarks of this paper are reviewed in a comparative manner such that it can

workboats the use of aluminium for the main hull of high speed vessels began in the 1990s the size of such aluminium high speed vessels has been dramatically increased over the years sielski 2007 aluminium high speed vessels are employed in commercial and non commercial maritime transport because of the many benefits aluminium vessels provide by increasing the duty of aluminium vessels applying ultimate strength based design methods for structural design and optimization of aluminium vessels is getting more attention as a replacement for allowable stress techniques collette 2007 fig 1 shows the progressive development of high speed aluminium vessels from the 1990s as reported by incat incat 2020 the use of aluminium alloys in the shipbuilding industry has many advantages but also include many disadvantages and challenges the advantages of using aluminium alloys compared to steel include lower weight excellent resistance to corrosion and less maintenance challenges of using aluminium include reduced stiffness buckling and plastic collapse as well as different welding methods used for aluminium alloys paik et al 2008 increasing the size of high speed aluminium vessels has led to many design challenges compared to vessels with shorter lengths apart from the lower stiffness of aluminium alloys compared to steel structures there is almost no defined ultimate strength based design method either locally or globally for aluminium structures paik et al 2008 formulations developed for ultimate strength prediction of steel structures cannot be used directly for aluminium alloys structures even if the material properties are correctly considered this is in some extent related to the natural difference between the material behaviour of various types of aluminium alloys in terms of the stress strain curve and structural steel for aluminium structures in the elastic plastic range after the proportional limit the effect of strain hardening is significant on the ultimate strength of the structure while the elastic perfectly plastic material behaviour for steel structures is well accepted also the ultimate strength of aluminium structures is significantly affected by the softening in the heat affected zone haz while in the case of steel structures this effect is less important also the lack of information related to the initial imperfections caused by fabrication and welding leads to more design and construction related uncertainty for marine aluminium structures compared to steel structures paik et al 2008 many research studies have investigated aluminium plated marine structures in terms of ultimate strength considering different effective parameters these studies can be reviewed from various aspects including the extent of structural geometry unstiffened plate stiffened plate and ship hull girder material characteristics fabrication induced initial imperfections type of loading and investigation method experimental numerical and analytical in this paper important research activities in the field of ultimate strength of aluminium vessels elements and systems are reviewed in detail firstly aluminium alloys used for marine applications are described and then research studies on the ultimate strength of aluminium structures are briefly reviewed analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium structures in association with material properties investigation methods structural geometry initial imperfections boundary and loading conditions is discussed research studies on the strength of aluminium structures under fatigue and cracking damage are also reviewed this review study conclusions can be used as a guideline for future research 2 aluminium alloys for marine applications the use of aluminium structures for a variety of marine applications such as hull and deck of high speed vessels especially catamarans and also the superstructure of ships is of great interest other applications include box girder bridges walls and floors of offshore modules and containers the need to reduce structural weight increase payload capacity increase speed and reduce fuel consumption is some of the factors that have led to the use of aluminium in the marine industry contrary to steel structures the ultimate strength and collapse behaviour of aluminium structures in addition to the initial imperfections i e initial deflections and residual stresses are significantly affected by the nonlinearity of material and mechanical strength reduction in the heat affected zone induced due to welding mechanical strength reduction in haz depends on the alloy type its temper welding process and welding parameters this reduction is generally between 30 and 50 of the strength of the base material for common alloys considered for shipbuilding and joined by fusion welding yoshikawa et al 2015 it is recognized that the strength of aluminium alloys in the softened zone may be recovered by natural aging over a period of time paik 2018 however the reduction in mechanical strength in haz leads to a significant reduction in the structural strength as far as the material strength in haz is not recovered utilization of ultimate strength analysis for aluminium ships requires adapted ultimate strength calculating methods that consider the influences of the alloy type and temper material behaviour softening in the haz initial imperfections and loading type however the available studies are relatively scarce compared to steel structures yoshikawa et al 2015 in the field of aluminium structures in the early 1980s a set of 76 unstiffened aluminium plates was tested by mofflin 1983 and mofflin and dwight mofflin et al 1984 at the university of cambridge uk these tests are among the most prominent and largest and earliest collapse tests ever performed on aluminium plates in these tests the two most common aluminium alloys used in the marine industry including 5083 and 6082 alloys have been tested after tungsten inert gas tig welding in the longitudinal direction and metal inert gas mig welding in the transverse direction initial deflections and residual stresses are measured and then their effect on the collapse behaviour of plates is investigated in the late 1980s clarke and swan 1985 and clarke clarke and narayanan 1987 conducted collapse tests on five stiffened aluminium plates at the admiralty research establishment are uk these tests are one of the earliest collapse tests in which welded full scale aluminium stiffened plates are studied the materials used in the tests were equivalent to 5083 aluminium alloys after are tests many research works have been performed on the ultimate strength of aluminium plated structures considering different aspects of aluminium alloys reference can be made to studies carried out by matsuoka et al 1997 hopperstad et al 1997 1999 kristensen and moan 1999 aalberg et al 2001 zha and moan 2001 2003 rigo et al 2003 paik and duran 2004 paik et al 2005a 2005b paik 2007a collette 2007 paik et al 2008 paik 2009 khedmati and ghavami 2009 khedmati et al 2009 2010a 2010b chen and moan 2010 rønning et al 2010 benson et al 2011 zareei et al 2012 paik et al 2012 benson et al 2013a 2013b 2013c paulo et al 2013 khedmati et al 2014 pedram and khedmati 2014 magoga and flockhart 2014 khedmati et al 2015 2016 farajkhah and liu 2016 li et al 2018 and mohammadi et al 2019 fig 2 shows a summary of research carried out on the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures according to structural geometry and method of investigation 3 aspects of analysing ultimate strength of aluminium structures 3 1 material properties aluminium alloys used for structural applications cover a wide range however for marine applications 5000 and 6000 series alloys are generally used these alloys have good corrosion resistance are weldable and also are economically available 5000 series alloys are commonly used as rolled plates and are scarcely extruded these alloys are strain hardened 6000 series alloys can be easily extruded and form sections with complex shapes such as bulb t and l sections and also closed section stiffeners like trapezoidal stiffeners the strength of 6000 series alloys is gained by heat treatment the difference between marine aluminium alloys of 5000 and 6000 series and steel alloys in terms of ultimate strength regardless of corrosion and fatigue is summarized below collette et al 2008 the elastic modulus of aluminium alloys is approximately one third the elastic modulus of steel the shape of the stress strain curve for aluminium alloys is generally more rounded than for steel typically no specific point can be identified as the yield for aluminium alloys in the stress strain curve and therefore a 0 2 offset proof stress is considered as an alternative to yield strength the differences in material stress strain curves between typical ship steel plating and typical marine grade aluminium alloys are shown in fig 3 due to fusion welding both 5000 and 6000 series alloys are weakened in a local region close to the weld this local region is known as the heat affected zone the minimum requirements of mechanical properties for rolled and extruded 5000 and 6000 series aluminium alloys according to the international association of classification societies iacs iacs 2014 is illustrated in table 1 and table 2 in the theoretical and numerical analysis of aluminium structures two types of material models are generally utilized to analyse of ultimate strength actual stress strain relationship obtained from mechanical tests and approximate models like ramberg osgood model moreover the elastic perfectly plastic material model is also used by some authors if the stress strain curve of the material is not available but its main mechanical properties such as young s modulus of elasticity and yield strength are known then engineering stress strain curve can be obtained with a very good approximation by the ramberg osgood equation which was originally proposed by ramberg and osgood 1941 to derive the stress strain relationship of aluminium alloys hughes and paik 2010 this equation is widely used in many research works and is mentioned in various references such an annex of eurocode 9 eurocode 9 and 2009 design 2009 and also mazzolani 1995 and hughes and paik 2010 the actual material behaviour model as well as the ramberg osgood model represents the relationship between engineering stresses and engineering strains however nonlinear finite element analyses actually use the relationship of the material characteristics between the true stresses and strains which can be approximately estimated from the corresponding relationship between the engineering stresses and strains hughes and paik 2010 material models utilized for analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium structures are presented in table 3 it is notable that besides ramberg osgood model that is of the ϵ ϵ σ form and is shown to be very useful for ultimate strength analysis of marine aluminium structures there are other approximate models of the σ σ ϵ form such as the model proposed by mazzolani 1995 the latter types of the models are not applied for analysis of marine aluminium structures based on studied references some references directly focused on obtaining mechanical properties from tensile tests the corresponding results in such references might or might not use for ultimate strength analyses following research studies can be used as a reference for actual stress strain relationship of various aluminium alloys hopperstad et al 1999 for aluminium alloys 6082 t4 and 6082 t6 aalberg et al 2001 rønning et al 2010 for aluminium alloy 6082 t6 paik and duran 2004 for aluminium alloy 5383 h116 paik et al 2005a for aluminium alloys 5083 h116 and 5383 h116 paik et al 2008 for aluminium alloys 5083 h116 5383 h112 5383 h116 and 6082 t6 paik 2009 for aluminium alloys 5083 h112 5383 h116 5083 h116 6082 t6 and 5383 h112 paik et al 2012 for aluminium alloys5383 h116 and 5083 h112 mechanical properties and stress strain relationship of aluminium alloys are also investigated in association with environmental and operational conditions paik et al 2017 developed a new test database that considers the effects of cold temperatures and strain rates for marine grade structural materials such as mild steel high tensile steel aluminium alloy 5083 o and stainless steel 304l the details of the materials stress strain curves are presented in this study mechanical properties documented for strain rates ranging from 0 001 s 0 09 s 1 8 s and 34 s and temperatures including 160 c 120 c and 20 c for aluminium alloys paik et al 2017 also developed mechanical property database management system mpdas software which can predict material properties based on the test database various types of materials especially aluminium alloys are considered in this software the developed software considers the effects of strain rates up to 100 s and temperatures in the range of 200 c 20 c engineering stress engineering strain curves for aluminium alloy 5083 at room temperature 120 c and 160 c and various strain rates based on test databases presented in paik et al 2017 is shown in fig 4 summers et al 2015 reviewed the mechanical behaviour of 5083 h116 and 6061 t651 aluminium alloys during and after fires the high temperature quasi static mechanical and creep behaviour is discussed a review is also provided on modelling techniques for residual mechanical behaviour at high temperatures moreover stress strain relationship of 5083 h116 and 6061 t651 aluminium alloys is presented at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 500 c 3 2 investigation methods investigation into the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures is categorized in three methods including experimental works analytical investigations and numerical modelling in some research studies a combination of different methods is used for validation 3 2 1 experimental works matsuoka et al 1997 investigated the buckling strength of lightened aluminium hull structures under axial compression hull structures models constructed by pi shaped sections pre ribbed panels and extruded hollow sections were tested fig 5 shows the experimental test set up four transverse sections of the structure were elastically restrained and the arrangement was designed to ensure compression in the longitudinal direction through the bar at both ends hopperstad et al 1999 conducted an experimental study of the ultimate strength of outstands fabricated from aluminium alloys post buckling behaviour of thin walled cruciform aluminium extrusions was tested under axial compressive loading aalberg et al 2001 experimentally studied the collapse behaviour of stiffened aluminium panels of 6082 t6 alloys under axial compression the test panels were constructed from extruded aluminium profiles which were joined by longitudinal welds panels consisting of open section l shaped stiffeners and closed section stiffeners were considered fig 6 shows their test structures more details are provided in the paper in zha and moan 2001 2003 the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium plates with predominantly torsional buckling or tripping failure modes has been investigated in the studies aluminium plates with flat bar stiffeners considered paik et al 2008 paik 2009 and paik et al 2012 experimentally investigated the buckling collapse and ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium plated structures under axial compressive loading aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed using gas metal arc welding and also friction stir welding examined the test structures were equivalent to sub structures of an 80 m long aluminium high speed vessel rønning et al 2010 conducted experimental studies to investigate the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels of alloy 6082 t6 under in plane transverse compressive loads twenty one stiffened panels with different aspect ratios consisting of both open and closed stiffener sections were investigated 3 2 2 analytical studies paik et al 2005b compared some practical analytical ultimate strength analysis methods adopted for the design of aerospace marine and land based aluminium structures against experimental and numerical methods isum and fem analysed methods include the euler johnson e j method dnv puls steen et al 2001 paik duran empirical formulae paik and duran 2004 eurocode 9 method and aluminium association method it was concluded that dnv puls isum alps ulsap and the paik duran empirical formulae developed for the ultimate strength prediction of marine grade aluminium panels provide much better results than euler johnson e j eurocode 9 and aluminium association methods when compared to performed finite element analyses and existing experimental results paik and duran 2004 paik 2007a paik et al 2008 paik 2009 khedmati et al 2010b zareei et al 2012 khedmati et al 2015 and khedmati et al 2016 presented empirical formulations for estimating ultimate strength of aluminium plates and stiffened plates subjected to different loading proposed empirical formulations are based on fe analyses and or experimental investigations table 4 shows some formulations as presented by different researchers 3 2 3 numerical modelling the size and intricacy of the structure of aluminium vessels along with extensive parameters affecting the aluminium structures ultimate strength has made experimental studies to be almost difficult it is relatively easy to construct unstiffened and stiffened aluminium plates however it is costly and also time consuming to perform different tests that take into account various aspects of an aluminium structure like alloy types and tempers welding method and welding induced initial imperfections therefore the use of numerical methods to simulate the behaviour of aluminium structures and also to evaluate the ultimate strength is suggested the finite element method fem and methods developed as a substitute for the conventional finite element method are the most common numerical methods used for evaluating the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures alternative methods to the finite element method include the smith method idealized structural unit method isum and intelligent supersize finite element method isfem the isum resolves the issue of computation time comparing to fem while keeping the computational accuracy at a reasonable level in this method a large sized structural member is modelled as a structural unit or a supersize finite element in the isfem historically the idea of this method was initiated by ueda and rashed 1974 who named this method the idealized structural unit method the first effort of ueda and rashed was to formulate the ultimate strength behaviour of the deep girder unit for analysing the ultimate transverse strength of a ship in an almost parallel development smith 1977 considered the same idea which is sometimes called the smith method in this method the nonlinear behaviour of plate stiffener combinations is formulated for analysing the ultimate longitudinal strength of ships more information about the three mentioned methods can be found in hughes and paik 2010 and corresponding references ueda and rashed 1974 smith 1977 smith 1977 1977 paik 2006 the differences between smith isum and isfem generally appear in structural modelling techniques formulating the nonlinear behaviour of the structural units and considering the interacting effects of local and overall failures hughes and paik 2010 various commercial and non commercial packages have been used by researchers for numerical modelling and aluminium structures ultimate strength analysis and their validity has been confirmed table 5 presents these packages along with the references that have used them throughout the paper more details about numerical modelling including the structural geometry initial imperfections boundary and loading conditions and etc are discussed 3 3 structural geometry aluminium used for the construction of marine vessels is generally available in three forms including sheet flat plate and extruded shapes extrusions can be ordered in various standard structural shapes such as tees angles flat bars bulb flats and bulb tees sielski 2007 the possibility of constructing aluminium in extruded shapes allows the designer to replace the conventional plate and welded stiffener panels with integrated extruded units such as single extruded units sandwich extrusions or hat type panel structures these extruded units are generally used for the construction of large and flat decks such as the deck of cargo and passenger vessels cross deck of multi hull vessels and the side shell above the waterline of aluminium vessels collette et al 2008 a conventional panel against various types of extruded panels is shown in fig 7 in fig 8 breakdown of a typical aluminium catamaran ship hull girder into smaller subdivisions is shown in terms of structural geometry three levels are considered for analysing the ultimate strength of aluminium marine structures these three levels include unstiffened plates stiffened plates and ship hull girders 3 3 1 unstiffened plates for unstiffened plates studies with respect to stiffened plates are scarce hopperstad et al 1997 investigated the reliability of the finite element method for calculating the ultimate strength of aluminium plates subjected to in plane compression aluminium plates of alloys 5083 m and 6082 tf were analysed for different b t ratios and non welded and welded conditions the accuracy of the estimated results was evaluated by comparison with existing experimental results also kristensen and moan 1999 studied the collapse strength of rectangular aluminium plates under uniaxial and biaxial compressive stresses both non welded and welded plates with residual stresses and softened zones were considered for numerical simulations the finite element method was utilized using abaqus paik and duran 2004 investigated the ultimate strength of aluminium plates with various geometric properties under axial compressive loads they conducted elastic plastic large deflection finite element analyses using ansys welding induced initial imperfections assumed for the analyses closed form ultimate compressive strength formulations for aluminium plates were derived by regression analysis of the computed results benson et al 2011 2013a examined the strength of a series of unstiffened aluminium plates with material and geometric parameters typical of aluminium vessels using a non linear finite element approach under uniaxial and biaxial compressive loads and also lateral pressure loading the effects of alloy type geometric imperfection shape heat affected zone and residual stresses considered through investigations 3 3 2 stiffened plates ultimate and collapse strength investigation of marine grade aluminium stiffened plates are studies in more detail by researchers studies include different loading and various geometry of aluminium profiles both extruded and non extruded studies performed experimentally numerically and or analytically table 6 contains a list of conducted studies on this level 3 3 3 girder structures for aluminium girder structures the studies are very limited matsuoka et al 1997 studied the buckling strength of lightened aluminium hull structures under axial compression studies carried out by experimental tests as well as numerical and simplified analytical investigations aluminium girder structures constructed from pi shaped sections pre ribbed panels and extruded hollow sections examined for more details of structural models and test results matsuoka et al 1997 is referred to after matsuoka et al limited number of studies performed focusing on ultimate strength and progressive collapse analysis of aluminium hull girders fig 9 shows a schematic of girder structures used in subsequent analyses paik et al 2005a investigated the ultimate strength of the hull girder of a 120m long aluminium catamaran fast ship alps hull program based on isum idealized structural unit method approach used for progressive collapse analysis of the ship hull girder a sliced hull section between two transverse frames is taken as the extent of the analysis for alps hull simulations the ship hull is modelled as an assembly of plate elements and support members initial imperfections at an average level are considered for all structural elements progressive collapse analysis for the ship hull girder of aluminium catamaran performed under sagging and hogging moments the effect of horizontal bending moment on ultimate strength of the hull girder is also studied collette 2007 investigated the response of an aluminium box girder under hogging bending moment box girder response was calculated using an incremental curvature smith type approach benson et al 2013b 2013c used various methods to evaluate the collapse behaviour of a number of box girders with similar dimensions to large aluminium ships and also an aluminium catamaran hull girder the comparative study involves applying an extended progressive collapse methodology which was developed by the authors specifically to predict the strength behaviour of aluminium hull structures under primary bending moment and accounts for compartment level the approach is based on the principles of the smith progressive collapse methodology for comparison the extended progressive collapse methodology is examined against the conventional smith method at the interframe level and nonlinear finite element analyses magoga and flockhart 2014 studied the ultimate hull girder strength of the mid ship section between transverse frames of an aluminium high speed patrol craft constructed by mig welding under vertical and horizontal bending moments using isfem intelligent supersize finite element method approach and alps hull computer program the effects of welding induced imperfections including plate and stiffener deflections residual stresses and material softening in haz on ultimate strength are investigated in the analyses farajkhah and liu 2016 investigated the ultimate strength of an aluminium box girder using the smith method before ultimate strength analyses a three dimensional finite element model was developed to simulate the welding process on aluminium stiffened plates with extruded and non extruded tee bar stiffeners friction stir welding fsw metal inert gas mig butt welding and mig fillet welding simulated during analyses residual stresses initial deflections and also heat affected zones have been obtained for these welding methods the load shortening curves for analysed stiffened plates used for ultimate strength calculation of the prescribed hull girder 3 4 initial imperfections the most common imperfections in aluminium plated structures constructed by welding are initial deflections residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone initial deflections are known as geometrical imperfections welding residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone are known as mechanical imperfections initial deflections include deflections that appear in plating and support members during the welding process as a result of welding residual stresses are generated due to applied thermal loads tensile residual stresses remain in the haz and compressive residual stresses develop in other areas so that equilibrium of internal forces to be preserved due to softening of materials in the heat affected zone by welding the strength of haz is generally reduced since such fabrication related initial imperfections affect the structural properties and load carrying capacity of the structure they must be considered as effective parameters in structural design and analysis in contrast to steel structures the initial imperfection measurement for aluminium structures is scarce among them the studies by aalberg et al 2001 zha and moan 2001 2003 paik 2007b paik et al 2008 paik 2009 rønning et al 2010 paik et al 2012 and hosseinabadi et al 2021 directly focused on measuring the initial imperfections also farajkhah and liu 2016 carried out thermo mechanical finite element simulations to obtain the welding induced deflections residual stresses and haz for fsw and mig welding methods aalberg et al 2001 measured the initial deflection of test structures in their experimental investigation of aluminium stiffened panels subjected to axial compressive loads zha and moan 2001 2003 measured initial deflections induced in plates and stiffeners of test structures in their ultimate strength assessment of aluminium stiffened panels with predominantly torsional failure modes paik 2007b measured welding induced initial deflections of aluminium plating used in marine structures seventy eight stiffened plates equivalent to sub structures of an 80 m long full aluminium high speed vessel constructed using mig welding after construction the initial deflection of plating between stiffeners was measured according to the statistical analysis of the measured data simplified levels based on the breadth of the plates proposed to estimate the maximum value of the initial deflection of the aluminium plating paik et al 2008 measured initial imperfections induced in plates and stiffeners in their ultimate strength investigation of seventy eight aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed by mig welding initial deflections including initial deflection of plating between stiffeners column type initial distortion of stiffeners and sideways initial distortion of stiffeners as well as residual stresses in plating and stiffener web and breadth of the heat affected zone were measured according to measured values and statistical analyses three levels presented for estimating each component of initial imperfection also paik 2009 measured initial deflection of plating between stiffeners column type initial deflection of stiffeners sideways initial deflection of stiffeners residual stresses in plating and stiffener web and breadth of the heat affected zone for stiffened aluminium plates constructed by friction stir welding measured values compared between fsw and mig welding methods rønning et al 2010 carried out an extensive measurement study to determine the distribution of the geometrical initial imperfections due to mig and fsw welding they also used vickers hardness tests to determine the strength reduction and extent of the heat affected zone paik et al 2012 measured welding induced initial imperfections during collapse behaviour assessment of aluminium stiffened plate structures constructed by fusion welding under axial compression recently hosseinabadi et al 2021 measured initial deflections of aluminium plating between stiffeners for different panels of four aluminium vessels constructed by the semi automatic mig welding method two average levels predicted for the maximum value of initial deflections of aluminium plating based on the plate thickness plate slenderness ratio and plate breadth using statistical analyses of measured data 3 4 1 geometrical imperfections three types of welding induced initial deflections are generally considered for welded stiffened plate structures including initial deflection of plating between the support members column type initial deflection of support members and sideways initial deflection of the support members paik 2018 different modelling features can be used for the fe simulation of initial deflections in the case of aluminium structures three approaches are commonly used in related literature as follows direct measurement of initial deflection components and applying for fe simulations zha and moan 2001 zha and moan 2003 paik et al 2008 paik 2009 paik et al 2012 using lateral pressure for generating initial deflections as shown in fig 10 rigo et al 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 khedmati et al 2009 khedmati et al 2010a khedmati et al 2010b zareei et al 2012 khedmati et al 2014 pedram and khedmati 2014 khedmati et al 2015 khedmati et al 2016 li et al 2018 using fourier series for generating initial deflections as presented in table 7 applying initial deflection by analysing eigenvalue buckling modes is also used in some research works like paulo et al 2013 and li et al 2018 also paulo et al 2013 used another different approach they conducted compression analyses without any imperfection the deformed shape of the structure at the collapse point is considered as the initial imperfection 3 4 2 mechanical imperfections welding is the most usual method used for building aluminium marine structures when aluminium alloys are heated locally the heated regions will expand but it will be subjected to compressive stresses due to the adjacent cold regions when the heated region cools down it undergoes local shrinkage and is therefore exposed to tensile stress as a result of welding tensile residual stresses remain in the haz and compressive residual stresses develop in other areas so that the equilibrium of internal forces to be preserved due to welding the softening phenomenon occurs in the heat affected zone and subsequently the material is softened and the yield strength of the haz is reduced paik et al 2008 for finite element analysis tensile and compressive residual stresses are often considered as initial stresses in terms of structural analysis of aluminium structures in association with softening in the heat affected zone the breadth of the softening zones yield strength reduction and also the location of haz plays a primary role mechanical initial imperfections including welding residual stresses and heat affected zone as used by different researchers in numerical studies are summarized in table 8 3 5 boundary conditions improper modelling of boundary and loading conditions in finite element analyses may lead to incorrect results for ultimate strength paik et al 2008 structural member s location in the ship hull girder directly affects the boundary conditions selected for experimental and numerical investigations in a continuous stiffened plated structure the edges of the plate elements are supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames a simply supported boundary condition is usually assumed to give a lower bound load shortening curve while the upper bound is usually the clamped plate benson et al 2013a simply supported boundary conditions have been of interest to many researchers for ultimate strength analysis of unstiffened aluminium plates hopperstad et al 1997 paik and duran 2004 and benson et al 2013a selected simply supported boundary conditions for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium plates under longitudinal axial compression while the same boundary condition is considered by kristensen and moan 1999 and benson et al 2011 under uniaxial and biaxial compression a stiffened plate is an assembly of plate elements and support members for ultimate strength analysis of stiffened aluminium plates either experimental or numerical various boundary conditions for different structural extent are implemented by researchers to conclude accurate results under applied loading conditions table 9 illustrates a summary of considered boundary conditions by researchers in the category of hull structures benson et al 2013b for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium box girders under longitudinal bending moment conducted a series of compartment level analyses using a complete fem model the box girders had seven bays within the compartment and additional single bays at each end to minimize boundary effects the bulkheads modelled with very large thicknesses to keep the compartment ends straight the box was fixed at one end and free to rotate and translate at the other the bending moment applied by rotation control about a reference point tied by rigid body constraints to all nodes at the free end the same boundary condition applied by benson et al 2013c for an aluminium catamaran hull girder to the extent of ½ 1 ½ bay and 1 bay 1 compartment 1 bay fem models a schematic of the applied boundary condition is shown in fig 11 4 strength of aluminium structures under fatigue and cracking damage research related to the design of aluminium structures to resist fatigue damage is very limited due to the lack of information on fatigue strength of typical structural details used in aluminium marine vessels sielski 2008 several organizations have published design codes relating to the fatigue strength of aluminium structural details the most relevant of these codes is eurocode 9 eurocode 9 and 2011 design 2011 as a review of methods and corresponding codes and standards for the assessment of fatigue strength of welded aluminium alloy structures reference can be made to maddox 2003 in maddox 2003 maddox reviewed methods for evaluating fatigue strength of welded aluminium structures from the point of view of design and estimation of the residual life of welded aluminium structures studies related to fatigue and fracture of aluminium marine structures are very scarce collette 2005 presented newly developed reliability based design techniques for the ultimate strength and fatigue strength assessment of aluminium stiffened panels a reliability based hot spot s n fatigue prediction method is developed for welded connections including an analysis of the material and prediction of uncertainty values and a comparison with existing design codes ye 2007 evaluated the fatigue strength of aluminium welded box stiffener joints used in ships three similar web frame box stiffener connections are considered in this study welded aluminium box stiffener connections are investigated by carrying out fatigue tests as well as numerical evaluations important weld parameters that may considerably affect the fatigue strength are examined vafai and estekanchi 1999 studied the overall behaviour of aluminium plates and shells in the elastic range damaged due to the presence of a through crack using the finite element method various parameters such as the order of mesh refining at the crack tip the effect of boundary conditions poisson s ratio and crack length and shell curvature are studied the basic fe model in this study is a square aluminium alloy plate with dimensions 2 0 m by 2 0 m and 1 0 cm in thickness loaded under tension estekanchi and vafai 1999 studied the buckling of cylindrical aluminium shells with through cracks using the finite element method the buckling behaviour of cracked cylinders in tension and compression has been studied with cracks of varying length and orientation vaziri and estekanchi 2006 evaluated the buckling behaviour of cracked cylindrical thin shells using the finite element method under combined internal pressure and axial compression in order to study the effect of crack type size and orientation brighenti investigated buckling of cracked rectangular aluminium thin plates using finite element various crack parameters under tension compression and shear loading are considered in his studies brighenti 2005a 2005b 2009 brighenti and carpinteri 2011 more information about the ultimate strength of cracked ship structural elements and systems including aluminium ship structures is referred to babazadeh and khedmati 2018 5 discussions and future prospects in this paper a review of published studies on the ultimate strength of aluminium plated structures is performed different aspects affecting on the ultimate strength of an aluminium structure including material properties investigation methods structural geometry fabrication related and welding induced initial imperfections and also boundary conditions reviewed based on of literature for ultimate strength analysis of aluminium marine structures actual material behaviour is more interested in achieving reliable results ramberg osgood approximation model is also used in some research as a replacement of the actual material behaviour model this is in contrast to steel structures which are usually simulated using the elastic perfectly plastic material model ultimate strength analysis on aluminium marine stiffened panels is investigated broadly however for aluminium marine structures in the extent of unstiffened plates and ship hull girders using experimental and analytical investigations is scarce this is discernible from fig 2 for numerical analyses approaches such as the nonlinear finite element analysis method and fem alternative methods like smith isum and also isfem especially for girder analyses have received much attention ultimate strength investigation using experimental studies for unstiffened plates and ship shaped box girders under global hull girder loads and developing analytical closed form formulations for unstiffened plates and ship hull girders seems to be the most important issues that must be considered in future studies by researchers unlike steel structures with abundant data on initial imperfections the database on welding induced initial imperfections including initial deflections welding residual stresses and softening in the heat affected zone for welded aluminium plated structures are scarce therefore the design and construction of aluminium vessels are faced by more uncertainty than the similar steel vessels in contrast to marine steel structures which there are accepted relations for ultimate strength estimation of plated and hull structures for aluminium structures simplified closed form relationships are very limited as described previously there are some simplified formulations for ultimate strength estimation of unstiffened stiffened aluminium plates but for hull girders there is no relationship there is a growing interest in using aluminium extruded panels which directly affects welding induced initial imperfection by reducing welding however there are few published experimental and numerical works on these structures therefore the difference of them with traditional aluminium panels must be investigated in terms of ultimate strength the effect of using this type of structure on the ultimate strength of hull girder structures especially multi hull vessels has to be studied smith or isum progressive collapse methods which both follow the same idea as well as the isfem method have been shown to be capable measures for ultimate strength analysis of steel ships hughes and paik 2010 therefore it is used for strength assessment in some research regarding aluminium vessels these methods need to be further evaluated for aluminium vessels especially large sized multi hull ships by considering the pre mentioned aspects of aluminium alloy structures using smith isum and isfem methods overcome the issue of computational time in fem analyses of hull girders while keeping the accuracy at a reasonable level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20677,global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years and the offshore wind turbines owts have been applied to much more applications because the support structure of an owt is prone to damage it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing fault diagnosis remaining useful life prediction and condition based maintenance through real time monitoring on the operating status of the owt support structures the operation measurements can be obtained to detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to assess potential risks and perform just in time maintenance as a result the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged this paper introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the owt support structures first of all the types of the support structures are reviewed then the reliability research progress on the support structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed in light of the digital twin dt technology a solution to existing challenging issues is proposed by introducing the dt into the owt support structures this new dt framework will enable real time monitoring fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the owt support structures which may provide a useful application prospect in the reliability analysis of the owt support structures in the future keywords offshore wind turbines support structures reliability analysis digital twin 1 introduction as the global energy demand continues increasing wind energy as one of most promising clean energy sources has been widely used over the world the global wind energy development report 2019 released by the global wind energy council gwec global wind energy council 2020a shows that the global installation capacity of the wind power in 2019 was 60 4 gw with an increase of 19 over 2018 the newly installation capacity of the onshore wind power market reached 54 2 gw and the offshore wind power market broke the milestone of 6 0 gw accounting for 10 of the global newly installation capacity in 2019 the top five countries in terms of new installation capacity were china 43 3 the united states 15 1 the united kingdom 4 india 3 9 and spain 3 8 accounting for 72 of the global new installation capacity fig 1 shows a statistical chart of the cumulative installation capacity of global wind turbines from 2001 to 2019 it can be seen from the figure that the number of the installed wind turbines has increased rapidly in the past ten years burke and stephens 2018 as per of the end of 2019 the global wind energy market has reached a new milestone with a cumulative installation capacity of 651 gw the development and utilization of the wind energy has been identified as the focus of energy transition global wind energy council 2020a as can be seen in fig 1 in recent years the offshore wind power kumar et al 2016 has gained fast development compared with the onshore wind energy the offshore wind power receives the ocean wind with faster flowing speed higher uniformity and longer available time per year kang et al 2019b more importantly installing wind turbines in the ocean can protect the environment jeon et al 2013 and save land resources qi and yi qing 2007 hallowell et al 2018a the ocean area is super vast providing good conditions for developing large scale wind farms and large scale turbines chen and frede 2009 the power generation by the same turbines in the offshore area is 50 100 higher than that in the onshore area karloseva et al 2016 and hence there is an urgent shift to transit the wind energy from onshore to offshore in 2019 the total installation capacity of the offshore wind power reached 6 1 gw and the proportion of the global wind power installation capacity increased from 5 to 10 in just five years global wind energy council 2020a gwec predicts that in the next few years the offshore wind power will develop at a faster rate global wind energy council 2020b although the wind power has good development the reliability maintenance issues are still unresolved especially on the wind turbine support structures as reported the infrastructure cost of one owt accounts for 34 of the total investment carter 2007 in the 20 year service life the operation and maintenance cost of a 750 kw wind turbine may account for 25 30 of the total energy generation cost milborrow 2006 nielsen and sorensen 2011 carroll et al 2017 or 75 90 of the investment cost w portland portland oregon 2002 where the cost due to infrastructure damages is a major category cockerill et al 2001 in order to keep and improve the current developing rate of the offshore wind farms with less downtime and maintenance costs it is crucial to solve the reliability maintenance problems in the owt support structures zhang et al 2016b generally a wind farm consists of one upper tower part and one lower support part the upper tower part of the owt is similar to the onshore wind turbine the basic difference between the onshore and offshore turbines lies in the design of the lower support structures kumar et al 2016 due to complicated marine environments different types of loads are performed on the owt support structures including the wind ocean currents waves sea ice and earthquakes etc villalobos et al 2010 under repeated excitation of various alternating cyclic loads the owt support structures are prone to fatigue damages moghaddam et al 2019 ivanhoe et al 2020 however to our best knowledge very limited work has been done to address the reliability analysis of the owt support structures by investigating the damages mechanisms using fluid structure interaction analysis and detecting predicting the damages using digital twin dt technology because the dt technology is regarded as a promising tool to help understanding the undergoing mechanisms of the owt support structural failures this paper reviews the potentials of dt applications in the reliability analysis of the owt support structures a specific dt based reliability solution to the owt support structures is accordingly provided the remainder of this review is organized as follows section 2 gives a detailed introduction on the owts including the types of support structures fatigue analysis and their reliability research progress section 3 reviews the dt based reliability research results and section 4 suggests a possible dt solution to assess the owt support structures section 5 draws the main concludes 2 reliability analysis of owt support structures 2 1 an overview of owt support structures the upper tower part of the owt mainly consists of several blades liu et al 2010 one pitch system one gear transmission line osman and velex 2012 one generator li et al 2019 and one control system as shown in fig 2 the wind drives the blades to rotate converting the wind energy into the mechanical torque which enables the operation of the generator through the gear transmission line the safety analysis of the owt often includes the failure analysis reliability analysis and risk assessment jin et al 2016 due to complex working environment and owt structure it is difficult to comprehensively analyze the overall wind turbine therefore most researchers focus on the owt subsystems such as the gearboxes hameed et al 2011 nejad et al 2016 reder et al 2016 generators samarakoon and ratnayake 2018 mooring system melchers and prediction 1999 grime and langley 2008 and floating structure ozguc 2020 etc the pitch system is the key component that is most likely to cause the failure of the wind turbine followed by the generator and the gearbox carroll et al 2016 in order to monitor the wind turbines the failure analysis of each key component is carried out to determine the main failure cause of each subsystem pinar pérez 2013 kang et al 2016 for example gear crack is the most common cause for the gear failures belsak and flasker 2007 leakage is the main cause of generator failures li et al 2020b by calculating the failure rate of each part the optimal maintenance decision can be determined for the wind turbines shafiee et al shafiee and management 2013 santos et al 2018 arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 used the failure modes and effects analysis fmea to determine the key failure modes of the generator and predict the generator failures li et al 2019 used the degradation hidden markov model to evaluate the reliability of the wind turbine gearbox and concluded that the reliability of the wind turbine bearing dropped sharply after 108 months of service bhardwaj et al 2019 used the fmea method to analyze the roots of the gearbox failures and found that the gearbox failure rate was as high as 15 7 tazi et al 2017 developed a mixed cost fmea by integrating the cost factors and conducted quantitative research on the wind turbine parameters existing literature demonstrates that the condition monitoring and maintenance of the owts are mainly focused on the upper tower part while there are few researches on the lower support part because the reliability analysis techniques used for the upper tower part present certain versatility they can be applied to the support structures table 1 lists existing popular techniques that can be used for the owt support structures at present the owt support structures can be divided into two categories fixed basic structure and seabed connection and floating basic structure and seabed not connected ones jiang et al 2017a according to different installation methods of the basic structure there are eight support types including the monopile type santos et al 2016 esteban et al 2015 gravity type malhotra 2007 tripod type tchakoua et al 2014 floating type jeon et al 2013 esteban et al 2015 jacket type esteban et al 2015 and so forth as shown in fig 3 different support types are applicable to different installation depth wei ping et al 2009 roddier et al 2010 the selection of the basic structure needs to consider many factors such as the water depth soil and seabed conditions environmental loads and construction etc wang and bai 2010 in the design stage the water depth is the primary factor the characteristics of each type of the support structures have been introduced in details in some excellent reviews wu et al 2019 at present marine wind farms are mainly arranged within 50 m in the offshore areas the monopile type accounts for 75 of the owt support structures and the tripod and jacket types accounts for about 5 macaskill et al 2013 because the wind energy is much richer away off the coast the development and usage of the jacket and tripod support structures is a future trend in this review we introduced the structural response and reliability analysis of the owt support structures and paid more attention to the jacket type 2 2 loads of owt support structures the load borne by the owt support structure is complex and changeable any structural analysis of the support system must fully consider the load the load can be roughly divided into the following six categories 1 aerodynamic loads transferred from the rotor 2 wind loads on the tower 3 inertia gravitational loads 4 current loads 5 wave loads and 6 hydrostatic loads gentils et al 2017 the distribution of each force is shown in fig 4 where the jacket support structure is taken as an example the jacket support is composed of a tower a transition structure a basic structure a pile foundation structure and an auxiliary structure macaskill and mitchell 2013 the main function of the owt support structure is to transmit the loads generated by the wind turbine to the seabed at the same time the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads of the support structure are also transmitted to the seabed the external influence of the support structure system mainly comes from the aerodynamic load hydrodynamic load and soil properties carswell et al 2015 gravitational loads depend on the mass of the owt while inertia loads are generated by the operation of the wind turbine the size of the inertia loads is related to the supporting structure and the rna rotor nacelle assembly the inertia loads have great influence on the frequency characteristics and stability of the wind turbine gentils et al 2017 aerodynamic loads are dynamic and static loads generated by the interaction of the airflow and fans whose magnitude is related to the factors such as the air density at sea level and average wind speed the aerodynamic loads can be computed using aeroelastic models the load generated by the rotor is transmitted to the top of the tower which is decomposed into the axial load lateral thrust and torsional moment current loads wave loads and wind loads are all caused by environmental changes the force produced by the interaction between the wave and the supporting structure is the wave load the wave period wave height and water depth are usually used as the wave load parameters the stokes wave theory is usually used to calculate the motion parameters corresponding to the wave load and the morison equation is used to calculate the resistance and inertial force generated by the wave action in structural design in order to facilitate the estimation of the limit response of marine structures a regular wave with appropriate period and height is usually adopted to represent extreme waves and the energy density spectrum is used to define random waves shittu et al 2020 wind load is the resistance generated by the interaction between the structure above sea level and the wind it is the resistance from the movement of the air particles the magnitude of the resistance depends on the sea level carswell et al 2016 the thrust generated by the wave load and wind load produces the greatest pressure and tension on the legs of the jacket hydrostatic pressure is a constant load caused by the support structure under water the load is related to the water depth and water flow density similar to the jacket support these six types of loads can be found in the other support types performing owt structural reliability analysis usually considers the fatigue analysis under the normal sea conditions and the ultimate sea state limit load for example earthquake dong et al 2012b glacier shi w et al 2016 and hurricane hurricane causes the rotor of the wind turbine to deviate to produce a large bending moment on the tower which generates the turbulent wind and irregular waves to increase the uncertainty of the reliability analysis model hallowell et al 2018b therefore the establishment of an accurate environmental parameter model is very important for the reliability analysis in the existing publications the conditional joint distribution xuan et al 2018 nataf transformation silva gonzalez et al 2012 and various copula based models masina et al 2015 are popular to describe the relationship between the environmental parameters taking the jacket type support as an example kim et al kim and lee 2014 defined the limit state function lsf of a jacket structure and used the form first order reliability method to analyze the reliability of the supporting structure under the limit load wei et al 2016 established a damage assessment framework for the jacket support system under extreme wave height loads and calculated the damage probability using the response surface method taking the floating support as an another example li et al li and zhang 2020 used the copula model to describe the dependence of the environmental parameters such as wind and waves where the kriging model and the artificial neural network model ann were combined to predict the short term fatigue damage of the key parts in the wind turbine and an evaluation framework for the long term fatigue damage was also introduced soa and ss 2021 used the linear elastic finite element analysis and kriging model to build the reliability analysis framework of a floating support structure and the results emphasized the importance of kriging uncertainty in the limit state it should note that the support structure is an essential part of the wind turbine system so the failure detection and reliability analysis for the support structure are of great importance to ensure the turbine safety cheng et al 2013 kumar et al 2016 because the marine environment is complex the owt support adopts a very large structure and the failure rate and maintenance costs are very high thus in recent years the failure detection and reliability analysis for the owt support structures become a hot topic nilsson and bertling 2007b carroll et al 2017 the current research on owt support reliability includes the structural response fatigue analysis and reliability analysis 2 3 structure response and reliability of owt support structures the support structure is the main load bearing part in a wind turbine subjected to random current and wind loads in the ocean the structural ultimate bearing capacity gradually decades toward to defects and damages such as cracks dents corrosion sea creatures and foundation erosion corrosion will reduce the cross section of the support components thereby reducing the ultimate bearing capacity of the support structures marine organisms will increase the diameter and roughness of the rod thereby amplifying the effect of the environmental loads on the support components erosion of the foundation will reduce the effective pile length buried in the seabed and change the position of the pile head in addition the owt basic structures are welded by the steel components which inevitably suffer from cracks all these factors should be considered in the reliability analysis for the owt support structures reliability is the possibility of achieving normal operation within a specific time according to existing and predetermined conditions eghbali et al 2018 the reliability analysis models of the owt supporting structure mainly include the one dimensional beam model and three dimensional 3d finite element analysis fea model in a one dimensional model the supporting structure is simplified into beam elements to investigate the structural behavior of the overall model however the local structural responses such as the stress concentration effects petrini et al 2010 cannot be calculated in a 3d fea model the jacket is usually set as brick or shell elements which can calculate the stress distribution inside the structure due to the high fidelity of the finite element analysis fea the 3d fea model has been widely used in the structural analysis jung et al 2015 in the finite element analysis the basic structure of the jacket is modeled according to the actual number of the piles and the superstructure adopts a truss type with a small force bearing area therefore the key to the structural analysis is to check the reliability of the connections between the nodes and the members according to standard requirements of the load bearing under the action of load because the lower part of the jacket is embedded in the soil through piles the soil structure interaction analysis is required the p y method where p is the lateral resistance and y is the lateral deflection is usually employed to model the soil carswell et al 2016 as a rigid spring to address the soil structure interaction due to the complex nature of the owt multi body system the analysis methods for each part are different marquez et al 2012 marquez et al 2012 santos et al 2016 when analyzing the overall reliability of the wind turbine the reliability frame diagrams monte carlo simulation mcs bayesian interference fault trees analysis fta markov and semi markov models mm are often employed when analyzing the reliability of a specific component the response surface method rsm first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm are commonly used cai et al 2019 the choice of the reliability method depends on the limit state and the degree of non linearity form can be used when the limit state is a linear function in the case of highly nonlinear systems sorm is usually better than form the mcs method can reduce the uncertainty in the solution process and produce high calculation accuracy for complex systems the popular fault tree is widely used to establish a hierarchical relationship between various faults in a wind turbine however the correlation between different faults is often ignored li and soares 2019 subsequently latest researches mapped the fault tree to a bayesian network by integrating the uncertain factors through the dynamic bayesian network to address this issue and the performance of the fault diagnosis and prediction for the owt components has been greatly improved borunda et al 2016 jun and kim 2017 rebello et al 2018 chang et al 2019 a summary of the owt reliability analysis methods is shown in table 2 the mainstream research is focusing on the condition monitoring and reliability analysis for the upper part of the wind turbines zhang et al 2016a kang et al 2019a for example the fault tree and bayesian methods were used to diagnose the faults of each unit in a wind turbine to determine the overall failure rate bobbioa 2001 kang et al 2019a divided the entire floating owt into several sub units such as the generators gearboxes support structures and mooring systems etc and each sub unit was further subdivided into different components which were connected through logical relationships to form a fault tree this method can diagnose the failure rate of the owt and determine the failure rate of owt as 7 3 times per year zhang et al 2016a divided the wind turbine into four parts i e blade tower floating foundation and mooring system and used the dynamic fault tree method to calculate the failure probability of each part so as to predict the reliability of the wind turbine system it is found that the maintenance interval of the owt should be less than 576 h tchakoua et al 2014 combined the fault tree with the binary decision diagram method to effectively identify the failure probabilities of the key components in the wind turbines under different operation conditions bobbioa et al bobbioa 2001 mapped the fault tree to the bayesian network to analyze the owt reliability the accuracy of the reliability analysis was improved li et al 2020a directly used the bayesian network method to establish a owt reliability analysis model and identified the failure probabilities of the key sub units and key components with the accelerated exploration of deep sea resources more and more floating supports are applied to owt applications and the reliability analysis for the mooring systems attracts considerable attentions fracture damage begg et al 2018 and fatigue damage jameel and ahmad 2011 are the most common failure modes in the mooring systems which will destroy the stability of the mooring systems jeon et al 2013 bagbanci 2015 used a long term analysis method to study the stability of a floating owt and found that effective control of the motion amplitude can ensure the stability in sea waves and sea breeze zhang et al 2013 analyzed the coupling effect between the floating foundation mooring system and ocean environment through a combination of experiment and numerical simulation jeon et al 2013 structured the wind turbine blade hub and nacelle into a concentrated force considered three catenary mooring cables and conducted a structural dynamic response study on a spar type owt du et al 2019 considered three failure modes of float migration mooring line fracture and fatigue as part of the reliability assessment of the mooring system the study found that the failure probability of concurrence of the three failure modes is much greater than that of any single failure mode hallowell et al 2018a used the monte carlo simulation to study the multi line mooring system of a floating owt and found that progressive failures are an important factor leading to the end time of the reliability of the mooring system for the owt reliability analysis most of the load analysis is simplified the reliability evaluation of the structure is used to estimate the safety level of the structure most of the reliability evaluation methods are steady however the resistance of the structure will continue to degrade with corrosion cracks fatigue etc therefore the reliability model should update over time choi et al 2007 roi et al roi et al analyzed five limit states of the jacket support system including the buckling deflection fatigue frequency and ultimate limit states using a parameterized finite element model and the form was adopted to calculate the reliability index under each limit state schafhirt et al 2016 used a distributed spring model to model the soil pile interaction and analyzed the influence of the soil parameters on the reliability analysis chew et al 2016 proposed an analytical gradient based method to solve the problem of the high constraints and nonlinearity under extreme load conditions for the jacket foundation model lin et al 2016 used the computational fluid dynamics to simulate the hydrodynamics of the wave climb height and wave load on the ocean wind turbines ruiter et al ruiter and van 2016 proposed an efficient sequential approach that required approximately 80 of additional computing time jiang et al 2017b presented a detailed introduction to the reliability analysis of wind turbines yeter et al 2015b simplified the wind load into a transfer function established a limit state function and used form to analyze the reliability of the jacket support structure the fracture mechanics method was also employed to carry out the fatigue analysis dong et al 2012b analyzed the fatigue reliability of the welded joints of a 5 wm jacket based wind turbine by using the probabilistic models and studied the influence of corrosion on the reliability indicators ziegler et al 2015 adopted the monte carlo method to analyze the influence of the water depth soil stiffness wave height and wave period on the owt fatigue analysis the results suggested that the water depth and wave period are two primary factors due to the combined effect of various factors the support structure may fail and the wind turbine may collapse the collapse process of the support structure is in the form of gradual failure first the struts yield causing local structural damage then the steel piles yield reducing the structural bearing capacity and lastly the joints gradually fail causing the structure collapse yougang et al 2016 with the increase in service life the possibility of fatigue cracks in the structural nodes and components is increasing especially for aged wind turbines that have been in service beyond the expiry date crack defects are already one of the most common defects if the crack defects are not treated in time the cracks will continue to expand under external loads which may cause structural fractures therefore the structural reliability must be performed in time to optimize the structure performance and minimize the operation and maintenance costs while ensuring safety rebello et al 2018 in order to better measure the reliability of the owt support structures it is necessary to carry out condition monitoring nilsson and bertling 2007a by installing various equipment such as sensors and strain gauges in the support structures the collected data can be processed to find the failure and damage of the components in the owt support structures alhmoud and wang 2018 then one can enhance the service life of the support structures and reduce the downtime by making just in time maintenance 2 4 structure response and fatigue analysis of owt support structures the environmental load aerodynamic load and variable loads borne by the owt support structures are the main reasons for the structural damage and life reduction due to the complexity of various loads it is difficult to quantify all of them in a reliability analysis model mendes et al 2021 therefore many researchers conducted targeted analysis for a specific load or specific working conditions toft et al 2016 for example dong et al 2011 conducted a long term fatigue analysis on the owt welded joints and analyzed the dynamic response under three conditions of the wind load only wave load only and the combined wind and wave loads shabakhty and khansari 2019 studied the dynamic response of a jacket support structure under linear load and weak nonlinear wave load and calculated the fatigue life of the jacket under two different wave models mendes et al 2021 processed the wave distribution data through morrison s equation to obtain the appropriate positive wave load for an owt support structure using static and dynamic fatigue analysis they found that the fatigue life of the dynamic analysis was 11 45 lower than that of the static analysis jimenez martinez 2020 introduced the statistical fatigue damage assessment method for the owt support structures under random loads velarde et al 2019 studied the sensitivity of the owt support structure fatigue load and simulated three design loads by the monte carlo method yeter et al 2015a studied the fatigue damage of the fixed owt support structure caused by the combined wave and wind loads and used the rain flow counting method to calculate the total number of cycles related to the stress range khedmati et al 2013 and vorpahl et al 2013 investigated the influence of the dynamic load on the fatigue life of the support structure kim and manuel 2019 simulated the wind field and wave field of the typhoon on the owt support to evaluate the load situation ivanhoe et al 2020 used the finite element analysis to analyze the reliability of a jacket support structure by establishing an owt parametric finite element model which considered the interaction between the load and the soil structure fatigue damage is the main failure mode of the support structures a fatigue usually experiences crack generation crack propagation and brittle fracture zhao 2000 in the crack generation stage the internal defects of a welded component quickly produce cracks and these cracks gradually merge to form an initial crack on the surface of the component then in the crack propagation stage the crack extends along the depth and length directions until penetrating the plate thickness at the point of penetration the crack opens quickly forming a rectangular like shape the rectangular penetrating crack continues to propagate and the brittle fracture occurs when the component reaches the critical value of the crack instability the fatigue life mainly depends on the crack propagation stage when the grinding technology is used to eliminate the defects in the welded structure the generation of cracks at this time mainly depends on the microscopic plastic slip in the local area in this case the crack formation time is longer and can be regarded as part of the fatigue life of the structure fatigue analysis is an important part in the reliability analysis for owt support structures because more than 80 of structural failures are caused by fatigue mendes et al 2021 deterministic analysis time domain analysis and frequency spectrum analysis methods can be used to process wave loads in the fatigue analysis rokni and tabeshpour 2019 used the spectrum analysis method to analyze the fatigue problem of a jacket support with wave load the arrangement of dampers was optimized gaidai and naess 2008 used the spectrum analysis to perform fatigue analysis on a jacket structure and improved structural design fan et al 2020 determined the stress concentration factor through finite element analysis and used the time domain fatigue analysis to predict the owt support life the result demonstrated that the time domain analysis can produce higher accuracy but lower efficiency than that of the spectrum analysis mohammadi et al 2016 therefore the fatigue assessment methods continue improving du et al 2015 and mohammadi et al 2016 proposed a new fatigue damage assessment method using the hybrid time frequency analysis which does not require the assumption of stress distribution and is more accurate than the spectrum analysis and faster than the time domain analysis zhu et al 2019 introduced the damage functions related to the fatigue life and established a new nonlinear fatigue damage cumulative model bocher et al 2018 established a new shape function to improve the accuracy of fatigue life prediction maia et al 2019 developed a new method to update the oceanographic data and strain measurement data to predict the fatigue life of the owt support structures jia 2016 found that the gravity has large influence on the dynamic response and fatigue damage assessment of the support structures if the gravity is ignored the assessment error of the fatigue damage can be up to 24 monsalve giraldo et al 2016 used the univariate dimensionality reduction to perform probabilistic fatigue analysis of the support structures these excellent research results facilitate the reliability analysis of the owt support structures the latest research progress includes the owt supporting structure transformation alessi 2019 reliability optimization meng et al 2020 failure scenarios gholizad et al 2012 geometric effects at welds biswal and mehmanparast 2019 reliability model simplification wang et al 2020a and many other effects on the fatigue analysis at the same time the material degradation effect caused by corrosion has a great impact on the reliability analysis of the support structure dong et al 2012a therefore corrosion is a factor that cannot be ignored in the fatigue analysis mohammadi et al 2016 2 5 remaining problems in summary the reliability analysis of the owt support structures mainly focuses on the fatigue analysis and dynamic response research the finite element analysis is the primary tool however some problems still remain li et al 2020a 1 the finite element model is performed offline and the real time online monitoring is not realized hence actions cannot be conducted immediately when the wind turbine fails resulting in missing the best maintenance opportunity meanwhile the operating status of the support structure cannot be fed back to the finite element model in time so the model parameters cannot be updated 2 the finite element model cannot fully reflect and describe the physical state of the real structure it simply simulates the geometric characteristics of the support structure and does not well simulate other physical characteristics of the actual support structure such as time varying stiffness strength and other material properties as a result the finite element model cannot accurately describe the fatigue process such as crack growth corrosion and structural dynamics in addition the dynamical wind and wave loads received by the real model cannot be added in the finite element model 3 existing reliability analysis models can only calculate the support structure with a specific aspect for example when calculating the dynamic response of a wind turbine the overall wind turbine model is usually used for the calculation however this overall model cannot be used to calculate the fatigue crack 4 there are many uncertainties and ambiguities in the existing calculation models such as the uncertainty of the load uncertainty of the material properties and uncertainty of the model parameters in order to address these aforementioned challenges this review suggests combining the currently popular digital twins dt technology and finite element model to assess the reliability of the owt support structures an academic viewpoint of applying dt to the owt support structure is illustrated in the following sections 3 overview and applications of dt 3 1 concept the concept of dt is first proposed by professor grieves in 2003 grieves m grieves 2014 since 2012 dt has been developed rapidly in different documents the definition of dt is different kritzinger et al 2018 tao et al 2018a autiosalo et al 2020 an agreeable definition is that dt makes full use of data such as physical models sensor updates and operating history and integrates multi disciplinary multi physical multi scale and multi probability simulation processes to real time reproduce the dynamics of a physical system in the virtual space glaessgen and stargel 2012 the composition of dt is also different according to different understandings qi and tao qi and tao 2018 believed that dt mainly included three parts physical entity virtual model and connection system while tao et al 2018b thought that dt included five parts physical entity virtual model database service system and connection system weyer et al 2016 suggested that dt is composed of a series of virtual models however an agreeable understanding is that dt aims to monitor the state of a physical model in real time by fusing the data of each module tao et al 2018a and realize the control and optimization of the physical model soderberg et al 2017 the construction of a dt model includes four stages modeling data fusion data interaction and collaboration and service dt modeling is the foundation part but until now a systematic and standard modeling method is still unavailable it is usually involved with a virtual model the so called mirror model which is built according to the size of the physical model of interest with the help of various simulation software schroeder et al 2016 the virtual model needs to collect uhlemann et al 2017a and fuse data from different sources uhlemann et al 2017b such as sensor data strain gauge data and historical data etc data fusion includes three steps data preprocessing data mining and data optimization tao et al 2019b data interaction and collaboration are the most important feature for the dt model wang et al 2020b which involves timely information exchange between various modules to achieve information sharing the service system is the ultimate goal of dt which involves with realizing the intelligent control and task optimization of the physical model through technologies such as the internet of things sensor technology and big data driving tao et al 2018a the data and status of the virtual model are updated in real time and feedback to the physical model to achieve the service goal he et al 2021 at present the finite element simulation analysis is often adopted in the optimization and dynamic response analysis for the owt support structures raman and hassanaly 2019 however a dt model is completely different from a finite element model the dt model is a digital copy of a physical entity and is able to update its parameters simultaneously with the state of the physical entity lu et al 2020 more importantly the dt model cannot only describe the current state of the physical entity but also predict the future state as a result different from the finite element model the dt model can be used to monitor diagnose and predict the physical model schleich et al 2017 3 2 dt applications the dt model has a wide range of applications such as engineering design and production schleich et al 2017 food verboven et al 2020 vehicles glaessgen and stargel 2012 workshop equipment energy consumption management zhang 2018 medical treatment bruynseels 2018 multimedia el saddik 2018 intelligent manufacturing lu et al 2020 intelligent workshop tao and zhang 2017 lathe zhou et al 2020 etc currently dt is mostly used in manufacturing and can run through the entire life cycle of the product from the design zhang et al 2017 to the production health monitoring luo et al 2019 and later operation and maintenance fotland et al 2020 a good review on the application range of dt can refer to tao et al 2019b recently dt is found application in operation and maintenance where intelligent decision making can be well solved by dt for optimal operation and maintenance errandonea et al 2020 khan 2020 dt can realize the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis reduce unnecessary maintenance activities and formulate the optimal maintenance interval werner et al 2019 used dt to achieve predictive maintenance of equipment according to the prediction results the data driven predictive model was improved by dt to enhance the maintenance efficiency and save costs booyse 2020 proposed the concept of deep digital twins ddt for health management mi 2020 used dt to predict the bearing maintenance and improved the fault diagnosis and prediction accuracy coraddu et al 2019 adopted the dt model for ships to estimate the speed loss caused by ocean fouling akintseva 2021 used dt in the cutting process of machine tools where the kinematics process parameters and metal characteristics in the grinding process were considered into the dt model cattaneo and macchi 2019 employed dt to establish a rig degradation model to achieve higher prediction accuracy of the remaining life of the rig tao et al 2019a applied dt to product development and proposed a digital dual drive product design framework yu 2020 used dt to monitor the dynamic degradation process of a photoelectric system ruppert and abonyi 2020 connected a real time positioning system with a simulation model to form an adaptive dt which can predict the production status and evaluate the product performance erkoyuncu et al 2020 proposed a dt framework based on the ontology design to realize the adaptability of data update between various modules and to enhance the synchronization capability between physical entities and virtual models xu 2020 proposed a digital dual drive optimization method based on multiple dt modules which can increase the gas exchange efficiency of the generator by 4 millwater et al 2019 established a dt model for the fuselage and accurately calculated the failure probability and remaining life of key components tao et al 2018b used a five dimensional dt model to perform health management on the upper system of a wind turbine it can be seen that the dt technology can be well applied to the structure operation and maintenance and the existing applications of the dt models provide valuable guidance for the reliability analysis of the owt support structures 3 3 artificial intelligence enhanced dt with the rapid development of industry 4 0 big data and machine learning algorithms artificial intelligence ai has been applied to the development of more powerful dt models abramovici et al 2016 erkoyuncu et al 2017 molinaro et al 2021 developed a database through machine learning which efficiently coupled the cfd solver transat and the data platform edap to provide a new data interaction strategy for dt chakraborty and adhikari 2021 used the machine learning algorithms to establish a multi time scale dt framework to realize the parameter evolution of a dynamic system the model consisted of a physical model and a data driven model where the gaussian process gp was used as a mixed expert model for data driven to evolve the model parameters chakraborty et al 2021 used the gp simulators as the surrogate models in dt to solve the uncertainty problem due to limited and sparse data mi 2020 established an integrated mathematical programming model by considering parameter uncertainties and the nsga ii hybrid algorithm was used to solve the model qiu et al 2019 combined the augmented reality augmented reality and dt to improve the assembly quality and efficiency of complex products zohdi et al zohdi 2021 combined machine learning with dt to find the optimal path planning for airborne fuel to improve the firefighting effect yu 2020 combined the non parametric bayesian networks with dt and improved the gaussian particle filter to update the states and parameters of the system in real time to enhance the adaptability of the dt model in these excellent publications one can note that ai is able to improve the applications of dt in modeling very complex dynamic systems by adaptively updating the model parameters in light of this promising potential the ai based dt has been applied to monitor the structural fatigue cracks and predict the crack length and crack propagation in recent literature mohanty et al 2010 used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to predict the fatigue crack growth under a constant load wang et al 2016 used the extended kalman filter ekf and unscented kalman filter ukf to estimate the structural crack length with uncertain parameters keprate et al 2017 used an adaptive gaussian process regression model agprm instead of the finite element analysis to analyze the fatigue degradation of offshore pipelines the calculation time was significantly reduced sankararaman et al 2011 used the bayesian network to connect the finite element model crack growth model and alternative model to quantify the uncertainty of fatigue crack growth and predict the cracks on the cylindrical surface li et al 2017 used the bayesian network to establish a general dt model for diagnosis and prognosis of fatigue crack in the aircraft wings karve et al 2020 established an intelligent dt model for damage diagnosis prediction and model optimization of aircraft cracks ye et al 2020 proposed a dt to track the spacecraft structure life by predicting the crack growth lim et al 2018 used a data driven dt model using ultrasonic modulation to quantify and predict structural fatigue cracks cerrone et al 2014 used a dt model to monitor the crack path in real time and studied the influence of manufacturing errors on the crack path it can be seen that the dt has been much popularized in the fatigue crack analysis which provides a solid basis for the reliability analysis for the owt support structures however due to uncertainties and randomness in the owt reliability analysis the existing ai based dt models cannot be directly applied to the owt support structures to address this issue millwater et al 2019 pointed out that the best available knowledge of dt for uncertainty quantification should be provided in the form of probability distributions the probability theory for example bayesian theory is a promising tool to evaluate and quantify the uncertainties for the owt reliability analysis hurtado and hoffman 2006 used bayesian method to estimate the probability density function of the crack size and integrated the first verified crack size and the observed response crack size to update the estimation model torregosa and hu 2013 adopted the bayesian method to update the initial crack size in an aircraft model thereby improving the accuracy of the probabilistic risk assessment li et al 2017 integrated the dynamic bayesian networks with physical models and various accidental and cognitive sources of uncertainties to predict crack propagation sankararaman and mahadevan 2013 developed a bayesian model to continuously quantify and update the uncertainties in the structural health monitoring yang et al 2016 proposed a new crack size quantification method based on in situ lamb wave testing and bayesian method all these publications demonstrate that the bayesian method especially the dynamic bayesian method is very convenient for quantifying and updating the uncertainties in damage detection as a result it is reasonable to combine the bayesian method and dt model to provide effective reliability analysis for the owt support structures in summary dt has a close relationship with the design production and health management of a physical entity tao et al 2019b with the rapid development of machine learning and big data technologies the development of dt technology will be flourishing by combining the dynamic bayesian method with the dt technology various uncertain factors can be integrated to perform reliable crack growth analysis according to the research results reported in existing literatures it is believed that the bayesian dt can be applied to the owt support health monitoring and eventually solve the reliability problem in these support structures 4 a specific suggestion on dt monitoring owt support structures an owt support is a high reliability and long life marine structure with a service life of more than 20 years in the ocean due to environmental complexity model uncertainties and unrealistic assumptions it is difficult and sometime even impossible to make an accurate assessment on the health condition of the owt support structures mendes et al 2021 the dt technology has great application potential in the reliability analysis for the owt support structures taking the advantages of dt technology this review provides a specific suggestion to perform reliability analysis on the owt support structures fig 5 shows an overview of the suggested dt based reliability analysis system for the owt support structures this new dt framework consists of a physical model a virtual model a twin database and a service system when establishing this dt framework to support the owt reliability analysis one sensory data acquisition system is used to obtain the load parameters from the physical model and the damage parameters generated in the support structures and then map them to the virtual model then the multi scale modeling technology is used to provide full scale simulation tools for the reliability analysis of the support structures and the high precision simulation technology is used to establish a high fidelity model of the support structure to realize the prediction of crack growth hence model reduction can be conducted based on the high fidelity model to perform efficient prediction of the structural damage to meet the dt timeliness requirements lastly by considering the uncertainties of the support structure and integrating multi source heterogeneous data the dynamic bayesian method is used to evaluate the reliability probabilities of the owt support structures the physical model is mainly composed of the entities of the owt support structures and the sensory data acquisition system by installing various sensors and strain gauges in the support structures real time collection of the owt operating data continuous recording of the load received by the support structures and continuous monitoring of the structural damage data can be achieved in an online manner tao et al 2018b for the purpose of estimating the real time damage degree and location of the support structures at the same time the non destructive testing technologies are used to detect the structural damage because the non destructive testing data is in discrete type it is necessary to combine the online monitoring and non destructive testing data to fully describe the load and damage of the support structures which will support the parameter updating of the virtual model and provide sufficient knowledge for the service system the virtual model is a digital mirror of the physical model as shown in fig 6 a first the sub model technology is used to model the owt support structures at multiple scales according to the classification method of the first level overall the second level partial and the third level unit ye et al 2020 the wind turbine loads structural responses and maintenance record data acquired by the data acquisition system are used as the inputs of the dt model to dynamically update the virtual model xu 2020 step by step the virtual model will analyze the support structures to locate the stress concentration and deformation and produce details of the local stress and strain which will be used as the inputs of the damage simulation module then the damage simulation module is used to predict the structural cracks lastly but most importantly a degradation surrogate module will be established by reducing the high fidelity model to perform fast and accurate damage estimation which will enable real time data exchange between the physical model and the virtual model by mutually parameter updating and online reliability analysis of the owt support structures by cooperating the physical virtual and service models the service system mainly consists of an intelligent prediction module an information evaluation module and an intelligent decision making module as shown in fig 6 b thanks to the twin data the service system can use the dynamic bayesian networks to predict the fatigue cracks of the support structures and customize the task plan of the wind turbine according to the size of the damage so as to reduce the damage evolution rate and formulate an appropriate maintenance program more importantly the service system is able to assess the risk of the supports in extreme weather conditions the twin database is composed of data fused from the physical virtual and service models the fused data will be analyzed and processed by using advanced machine learning and signal processing algorithms the processed fused data will feedback to the physical virtual and service models and to drive these models to interact in real time 5 conclusions wind energy as a rich and clean new energy source has been widely exploited and utilized in most countries ocean wind energy has the advantages of high wind speed and long available time which makes owt as a promising development prospect with the continuous development and maturity of the wind harvest technology the cost of wind power is gradually reduced therefore the installed capacity of the owts has increased exponentially due to high operating and maintenance costs performing health monitoring reliability analysis and condition based maintenance for the owts is still a challenge this paper introduces the current research progress on the reliability analysis of the owt support structures as well as the applications of the dt technology for structure monitoring based on the latest literature for the owt reliability analysis a new dt framework applied to the owt support structures is proposed this new framework makes up for the shortcomings of the existing reliability analysis methods by using the combination of the virtual real modeling and real time data updating and monitoring at the same time the development of the dt technology continues to mature and related technologies such as the machine learning algorithms internet of things big data and finite element calculations are also developing rapidly which will provide nourishing technical support for the application of the dt based reliability analysis for the owt support structures particularly the proposed new dt framework in this review has a good potential to solve the challenging tasks in the owt reliability analysis our

20677,global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years and the offshore wind turbines owts have been applied to much more applications because the support structure of an owt is prone to damage it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing fault diagnosis remaining useful life prediction and condition based maintenance through real time monitoring on the operating status of the owt support structures the operation measurements can be obtained to detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to assess potential risks and perform just in time maintenance as a result the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged this paper introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the owt support structures first of all the types of the support structures are reviewed then the reliability research progress on the support structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed in light of the digital twin dt technology a solution to existing challenging issues is proposed by introducing the dt into the owt support structures this new dt framework will enable real time monitoring fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the owt support structures which may provide a useful application prospect in the reliability analysis of the owt support structures in the future keywords offshore wind turbines support structures reliability analysis digital twin 1 introduction as the global energy demand continues increasing wind energy as one of most promising clean energy sources has been widely used over the world the global wind energy development report 2019 released by the global wind energy council gwec global wind energy council 2020a shows that the global installation capacity of the wind power in 2019 was 60 4 gw with an increase of 19 over 2018 the newly installation capacity of the onshore wind power market reached 54 2 gw and the offshore wind power market broke the milestone of 6 0 gw accounting for 10 of the global newly installation capacity in 2019 the top five countries in terms of new installation capacity were china 43 3 the united states 15 1 the united kingdom 4 india 3 9 and spain 3 8 accounting for 72 of the global new installation capacity fig 1 shows a statistical chart of the cumulative installation capacity of global wind turbines from 2001 to 2019 it can be seen from the figure that the number of the installed wind turbines has increased rapidly in the past ten years burke and stephens 2018 as per of the end of 2019 the global wind energy market has reached a new milestone with a cumulative installation capacity of 651 gw the development and utilization of the wind energy has been identified as the focus of energy transition global wind energy council 2020a as can be seen in fig 1 in recent years the offshore wind power kumar et al 2016 has gained fast development compared with the onshore wind energy the offshore wind power receives the ocean wind with faster flowing speed higher uniformity and longer available time per year kang et al 2019b more importantly installing wind turbines in the ocean can protect the environment jeon et al 2013 and save land resources qi and yi qing 2007 hallowell et al 2018a the ocean area is super vast providing good conditions for developing large scale wind farms and large scale turbines chen and frede 2009 the power generation by the same turbines in the offshore area is 50 100 higher than that in the onshore area karloseva et al 2016 and hence there is an urgent shift to transit the wind energy from onshore to offshore in 2019 the total installation capacity of the offshore wind power reached 6 1 gw and the proportion of the global wind power installation capacity increased from 5 to 10 in just five years global wind energy council 2020a gwec predicts that in the next few years the offshore wind power will develop at a faster rate global wind energy council 2020b although the wind power has good development the reliability maintenance issues are still unresolved especially on the wind turbine support structures as reported the infrastructure cost of one owt accounts for 34 of the total investment carter 2007 in the 20 year service life the operation and maintenance cost of a 750 kw wind turbine may account for 25 30 of the total energy generation cost milborrow 2006 nielsen and sorensen 2011 carroll et al 2017 or 75 90 of the investment cost w portland portland oregon 2002 where the cost due to infrastructure damages is a major category cockerill et al 2001 in order to keep and improve the current developing rate of the offshore wind farms with less downtime and maintenance costs it is crucial to solve the reliability maintenance problems in the owt support structures zhang et al 2016b generally a wind farm consists of one upper tower part and one lower support part the upper tower part of the owt is similar to the onshore wind turbine the basic difference between the onshore and offshore turbines lies in the design of the lower support structures kumar et al 2016 due to complicated marine environments different types of loads are performed on the owt support structures including the wind ocean currents waves sea ice and earthquakes etc villalobos et al 2010 under repeated excitation of various alternating cyclic loads the owt support structures are prone to fatigue damages moghaddam et al 2019 ivanhoe et al 2020 however to our best knowledge very limited work has been done to address the reliability analysis of the owt support structures by investigating the damages mechanisms using fluid structure interaction analysis and detecting predicting the damages using digital twin dt technology because the dt technology is regarded as a promising tool to help understanding the undergoing mechanisms of the owt support structural failures this paper reviews the potentials of dt applications in the reliability analysis of the owt support structures a specific dt based reliability solution to the owt support structures is accordingly provided the remainder of this review is organized as follows section 2 gives a detailed introduction on the owts including the types of support structures fatigue analysis and their reliability research progress section 3 reviews the dt based reliability research results and section 4 suggests a possible dt solution to assess the owt support structures section 5 draws the main concludes 2 reliability analysis of owt support structures 2 1 an overview of owt support structures the upper tower part of the owt mainly consists of several blades liu et al 2010 one pitch system one gear transmission line osman and velex 2012 one generator li et al 2019 and one control system as shown in fig 2 the wind drives the blades to rotate converting the wind energy into the mechanical torque which enables the operation of the generator through the gear transmission line the safety analysis of the owt often includes the failure analysis reliability analysis and risk assessment jin et al 2016 due to complex working environment and owt structure it is difficult to comprehensively analyze the overall wind turbine therefore most researchers focus on the owt subsystems such as the gearboxes hameed et al 2011 nejad et al 2016 reder et al 2016 generators samarakoon and ratnayake 2018 mooring system melchers and prediction 1999 grime and langley 2008 and floating structure ozguc 2020 etc the pitch system is the key component that is most likely to cause the failure of the wind turbine followed by the generator and the gearbox carroll et al 2016 in order to monitor the wind turbines the failure analysis of each key component is carried out to determine the main failure cause of each subsystem pinar pérez 2013 kang et al 2016 for example gear crack is the most common cause for the gear failures belsak and flasker 2007 leakage is the main cause of generator failures li et al 2020b by calculating the failure rate of each part the optimal maintenance decision can be determined for the wind turbines shafiee et al shafiee and management 2013 santos et al 2018 arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 used the failure modes and effects analysis fmea to determine the key failure modes of the generator and predict the generator failures li et al 2019 used the degradation hidden markov model to evaluate the reliability of the wind turbine gearbox and concluded that the reliability of the wind turbine bearing dropped sharply after 108 months of service bhardwaj et al 2019 used the fmea method to analyze the roots of the gearbox failures and found that the gearbox failure rate was as high as 15 7 tazi et al 2017 developed a mixed cost fmea by integrating the cost factors and conducted quantitative research on the wind turbine parameters existing literature demonstrates that the condition monitoring and maintenance of the owts are mainly focused on the upper tower part while there are few researches on the lower support part because the reliability analysis techniques used for the upper tower part present certain versatility they can be applied to the support structures table 1 lists existing popular techniques that can be used for the owt support structures at present the owt support structures can be divided into two categories fixed basic structure and seabed connection and floating basic structure and seabed not connected ones jiang et al 2017a according to different installation methods of the basic structure there are eight support types including the monopile type santos et al 2016 esteban et al 2015 gravity type malhotra 2007 tripod type tchakoua et al 2014 floating type jeon et al 2013 esteban et al 2015 jacket type esteban et al 2015 and so forth as shown in fig 3 different support types are applicable to different installation depth wei ping et al 2009 roddier et al 2010 the selection of the basic structure needs to consider many factors such as the water depth soil and seabed conditions environmental loads and construction etc wang and bai 2010 in the design stage the water depth is the primary factor the characteristics of each type of the support structures have been introduced in details in some excellent reviews wu et al 2019 at present marine wind farms are mainly arranged within 50 m in the offshore areas the monopile type accounts for 75 of the owt support structures and the tripod and jacket types accounts for about 5 macaskill et al 2013 because the wind energy is much richer away off the coast the development and usage of the jacket and tripod support structures is a future trend in this review we introduced the structural response and reliability analysis of the owt support structures and paid more attention to the jacket type 2 2 loads of owt support structures the load borne by the owt support structure is complex and changeable any structural analysis of the support system must fully consider the load the load can be roughly divided into the following six categories 1 aerodynamic loads transferred from the rotor 2 wind loads on the tower 3 inertia gravitational loads 4 current loads 5 wave loads and 6 hydrostatic loads gentils et al 2017 the distribution of each force is shown in fig 4 where the jacket support structure is taken as an example the jacket support is composed of a tower a transition structure a basic structure a pile foundation structure and an auxiliary structure macaskill and mitchell 2013 the main function of the owt support structure is to transmit the loads generated by the wind turbine to the seabed at the same time the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads of the support structure are also transmitted to the seabed the external influence of the support structure system mainly comes from the aerodynamic load hydrodynamic load and soil properties carswell et al 2015 gravitational loads depend on the mass of the owt while inertia loads are generated by the operation of the wind turbine the size of the inertia loads is related to the supporting structure and the rna rotor nacelle assembly the inertia loads have great influence on the frequency characteristics and stability of the wind turbine gentils et al 2017 aerodynamic loads are dynamic and static loads generated by the interaction of the airflow and fans whose magnitude is related to the factors such as the air density at sea level and average wind speed the aerodynamic loads can be computed using aeroelastic models the load generated by the rotor is transmitted to the top of the tower which is decomposed into the axial load lateral thrust and torsional moment current loads wave loads and wind loads are all caused by environmental changes the force produced by the interaction between the wave and the supporting structure is the wave load the wave period wave height and water depth are usually used as the wave load parameters the stokes wave theory is usually used to calculate the motion parameters corresponding to the wave load and the morison equation is used to calculate the resistance and inertial force generated by the wave action in structural design in order to facilitate the estimation of the limit response of marine structures a regular wave with appropriate period and height is usually adopted to represent extreme waves and the energy density spectrum is used to define random waves shittu et al 2020 wind load is the resistance generated by the interaction between the structure above sea level and the wind it is the resistance from the movement of the air particles the magnitude of the resistance depends on the sea level carswell et al 2016 the thrust generated by the wave load and wind load produces the greatest pressure and tension on the legs of the jacket hydrostatic pressure is a constant load caused by the support structure under water the load is related to the water depth and water flow density similar to the jacket support these six types of loads can be found in the other support types performing owt structural reliability analysis usually considers the fatigue analysis under the normal sea conditions and the ultimate sea state limit load for example earthquake dong et al 2012b glacier shi w et al 2016 and hurricane hurricane causes the rotor of the wind turbine to deviate to produce a large bending moment on the tower which generates the turbulent wind and irregular waves to increase the uncertainty of the reliability analysis model hallowell et al 2018b therefore the establishment of an accurate environmental parameter model is very important for the reliability analysis in the existing publications the conditional joint distribution xuan et al 2018 nataf transformation silva gonzalez et al 2012 and various copula based models masina et al 2015 are popular to describe the relationship between the environmental parameters taking the jacket type support as an example kim et al kim and lee 2014 defined the limit state function lsf of a jacket structure and used the form first order reliability method to analyze the reliability of the supporting structure under the limit load wei et al 2016 established a damage assessment framework for the jacket support system under extreme wave height loads and calculated the damage probability using the response surface method taking the floating support as an another example li et al li and zhang 2020 used the copula model to describe the dependence of the environmental parameters such as wind and waves where the kriging model and the artificial neural network model ann were combined to predict the short term fatigue damage of the key parts in the wind turbine and an evaluation framework for the long term fatigue damage was also introduced soa and ss 2021 used the linear elastic finite element analysis and kriging model to build the reliability analysis framework of a floating support structure and the results emphasized the importance of kriging uncertainty in the limit state it should note that the support structure is an essential part of the wind turbine system so the failure detection and reliability analysis for the support structure are of great importance to ensure the turbine safety cheng et al 2013 kumar et al 2016 because the marine environment is complex the owt support adopts a very large structure and the failure rate and maintenance costs are very high thus in recent years the failure detection and reliability analysis for the owt support structures become a hot topic nilsson and bertling 2007b carroll et al 2017 the current research on owt support reliability includes the structural response fatigue analysis and reliability analysis 2 3 structure response and reliability of owt support structures the support structure is the main load bearing part in a wind turbine subjected to random current and wind loads in the ocean the structural ultimate bearing capacity gradually decades toward to defects and damages such as cracks dents corrosion sea creatures and foundation erosion corrosion will reduce the cross section of the support components thereby reducing the ultimate bearing capacity of the support structures marine organisms will increase the diameter and roughness of the rod thereby amplifying the effect of the environmental loads on the support components erosion of the foundation will reduce the effective pile length buried in the seabed and change the position of the pile head in addition the owt basic structures are welded by the steel components which inevitably suffer from cracks all these factors should be considered in the reliability analysis for the owt support structures reliability is the possibility of achieving normal operation within a specific time according to existing and predetermined conditions eghbali et al 2018 the reliability analysis models of the owt supporting structure mainly include the one dimensional beam model and three dimensional 3d finite element analysis fea model in a one dimensional model the supporting structure is simplified into beam elements to investigate the structural behavior of the overall model however the local structural responses such as the stress concentration effects petrini et al 2010 cannot be calculated in a 3d fea model the jacket is usually set as brick or shell elements which can calculate the stress distribution inside the structure due to the high fidelity of the finite element analysis fea the 3d fea model has been widely used in the structural analysis jung et al 2015 in the finite element analysis the basic structure of the jacket is modeled according to the actual number of the piles and the superstructure adopts a truss type with a small force bearing area therefore the key to the structural analysis is to check the reliability of the connections between the nodes and the members according to standard requirements of the load bearing under the action of load because the lower part of the jacket is embedded in the soil through piles the soil structure interaction analysis is required the p y method where p is the lateral resistance and y is the lateral deflection is usually employed to model the soil carswell et al 2016 as a rigid spring to address the soil structure interaction due to the complex nature of the owt multi body system the analysis methods for each part are different marquez et al 2012 marquez et al 2012 santos et al 2016 when analyzing the overall reliability of the wind turbine the reliability frame diagrams monte carlo simulation mcs bayesian interference fault trees analysis fta markov and semi markov models mm are often employed when analyzing the reliability of a specific component the response surface method rsm first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm are commonly used cai et al 2019 the choice of the reliability method depends on the limit state and the degree of non linearity form can be used when the limit state is a linear function in the case of highly nonlinear systems sorm is usually better than form the mcs method can reduce the uncertainty in the solution process and produce high calculation accuracy for complex systems the popular fault tree is widely used to establish a hierarchical relationship between various faults in a wind turbine however the correlation between different faults is often ignored li and soares 2019 subsequently latest researches mapped the fault tree to a bayesian network by integrating the uncertain factors through the dynamic bayesian network to address this issue and the performance of the fault diagnosis and prediction for the owt components has been greatly improved borunda et al 2016 jun and kim 2017 rebello et al 2018 chang et al 2019 a summary of the owt reliability analysis methods is shown in table 2 the mainstream research is focusing on the condition monitoring and reliability analysis for the upper part of the wind turbines zhang et al 2016a kang et al 2019a for example the fault tree and bayesian methods were used to diagnose the faults of each unit in a wind turbine to determine the overall failure rate bobbioa 2001 kang et al 2019a divided the entire floating owt into several sub units such as the generators gearboxes support structures and mooring systems etc and each sub unit was further subdivided into different components which were connected through logical relationships to form a fault tree this method can diagnose the failure rate of the owt and determine the failure rate of owt as 7 3 times per year zhang et al 2016a divided the wind turbine into four parts i e blade tower floating foundation and mooring system and used the dynamic fault tree method to calculate the failure probability of each part so as to predict the reliability of the wind turbine system it is found that the maintenance interval of the owt should be less than 576 h tchakoua et al 2014 combined the fault tree with the binary decision diagram method to effectively identify the failure probabilities of the key components in the wind turbines under different operation conditions bobbioa et al bobbioa 2001 mapped the fault tree to the bayesian network to analyze the owt reliability the accuracy of the reliability analysis was improved li et al 2020a directly used the bayesian network method to establish a owt reliability analysis model and identified the failure probabilities of the key sub units and key components with the accelerated exploration of deep sea resources more and more floating supports are applied to owt applications and the reliability analysis for the mooring systems attracts considerable attentions fracture damage begg et al 2018 and fatigue damage jameel and ahmad 2011 are the most common failure modes in the mooring systems which will destroy the stability of the mooring systems jeon et al 2013 bagbanci 2015 used a long term analysis method to study the stability of a floating owt and found that effective control of the motion amplitude can ensure the stability in sea waves and sea breeze zhang et al 2013 analyzed the coupling effect between the floating foundation mooring system and ocean environment through a combination of experiment and numerical simulation jeon et al 2013 structured the wind turbine blade hub and nacelle into a concentrated force considered three catenary mooring cables and conducted a structural dynamic response study on a spar type owt du et al 2019 considered three failure modes of float migration mooring line fracture and fatigue as part of the reliability assessment of the mooring system the study found that the failure probability of concurrence of the three failure modes is much greater than that of any single failure mode hallowell et al 2018a used the monte carlo simulation to study the multi line mooring system of a floating owt and found that progressive failures are an important factor leading to the end time of the reliability of the mooring system for the owt reliability analysis most of the load analysis is simplified the reliability evaluation of the structure is used to estimate the safety level of the structure most of the reliability evaluation methods are steady however the resistance of the structure will continue to degrade with corrosion cracks fatigue etc therefore the reliability model should update over time choi et al 2007 roi et al roi et al analyzed five limit states of the jacket support system including the buckling deflection fatigue frequency and ultimate limit states using a parameterized finite element model and the form was adopted to calculate the reliability index under each limit state schafhirt et al 2016 used a distributed spring model to model the soil pile interaction and analyzed the influence of the soil parameters on the reliability analysis chew et al 2016 proposed an analytical gradient based method to solve the problem of the high constraints and nonlinearity under extreme load conditions for the jacket foundation model lin et al 2016 used the computational fluid dynamics to simulate the hydrodynamics of the wave climb height and wave load on the ocean wind turbines ruiter et al ruiter and van 2016 proposed an efficient sequential approach that required approximately 80 of additional computing time jiang et al 2017b presented a detailed introduction to the reliability analysis of wind turbines yeter et al 2015b simplified the wind load into a transfer function established a limit state function and used form to analyze the reliability of the jacket support structure the fracture mechanics method was also employed to carry out the fatigue analysis dong et al 2012b analyzed the fatigue reliability of the welded joints of a 5 wm jacket based wind turbine by using the probabilistic models and studied the influence of corrosion on the reliability indicators ziegler et al 2015 adopted the monte carlo method to analyze the influence of the water depth soil stiffness wave height and wave period on the owt fatigue analysis the results suggested that the water depth and wave period are two primary factors due to the combined effect of various factors the support structure may fail and the wind turbine may collapse the collapse process of the support structure is in the form of gradual failure first the struts yield causing local structural damage then the steel piles yield reducing the structural bearing capacity and lastly the joints gradually fail causing the structure collapse yougang et al 2016 with the increase in service life the possibility of fatigue cracks in the structural nodes and components is increasing especially for aged wind turbines that have been in service beyond the expiry date crack defects are already one of the most common defects if the crack defects are not treated in time the cracks will continue to expand under external loads which may cause structural fractures therefore the structural reliability must be performed in time to optimize the structure performance and minimize the operation and maintenance costs while ensuring safety rebello et al 2018 in order to better measure the reliability of the owt support structures it is necessary to carry out condition monitoring nilsson and bertling 2007a by installing various equipment such as sensors and strain gauges in the support structures the collected data can be processed to find the failure and damage of the components in the owt support structures alhmoud and wang 2018 then one can enhance the service life of the support structures and reduce the downtime by making just in time maintenance 2 4 structure response and fatigue analysis of owt support structures the environmental load aerodynamic load and variable loads borne by the owt support structures are the main reasons for the structural damage and life reduction due to the complexity of various loads it is difficult to quantify all of them in a reliability analysis model mendes et al 2021 therefore many researchers conducted targeted analysis for a specific load or specific working conditions toft et al 2016 for example dong et al 2011 conducted a long term fatigue analysis on the owt welded joints and analyzed the dynamic response under three conditions of the wind load only wave load only and the combined wind and wave loads shabakhty and khansari 2019 studied the dynamic response of a jacket support structure under linear load and weak nonlinear wave load and calculated the fatigue life of the jacket under two different wave models mendes et al 2021 processed the wave distribution data through morrison s equation to obtain the appropriate positive wave load for an owt support structure using static and dynamic fatigue analysis they found that the fatigue life of the dynamic analysis was 11 45 lower than that of the static analysis jimenez martinez 2020 introduced the statistical fatigue damage assessment method for the owt support structures under random loads velarde et al 2019 studied the sensitivity of the owt support structure fatigue load and simulated three design loads by the monte carlo method yeter et al 2015a studied the fatigue damage of the fixed owt support structure caused by the combined wave and wind loads and used the rain flow counting method to calculate the total number of cycles related to the stress range khedmati et al 2013 and vorpahl et al 2013 investigated the influence of the dynamic load on the fatigue life of the support structure kim and manuel 2019 simulated the wind field and wave field of the typhoon on the owt support to evaluate the load situation ivanhoe et al 2020 used the finite element analysis to analyze the reliability of a jacket support structure by establishing an owt parametric finite element model which considered the interaction between the load and the soil structure fatigue damage is the main failure mode of the support structures a fatigue usually experiences crack generation crack propagation and brittle fracture zhao 2000 in the crack generation stage the internal defects of a welded component quickly produce cracks and these cracks gradually merge to form an initial crack on the surface of the component then in the crack propagation stage the crack extends along the depth and length directions until penetrating the plate thickness at the point of penetration the crack opens quickly forming a rectangular like shape the rectangular penetrating crack continues to propagate and the brittle fracture occurs when the component reaches the critical value of the crack instability the fatigue life mainly depends on the crack propagation stage when the grinding technology is used to eliminate the defects in the welded structure the generation of cracks at this time mainly depends on the microscopic plastic slip in the local area in this case the crack formation time is longer and can be regarded as part of the fatigue life of the structure fatigue analysis is an important part in the reliability analysis for owt support structures because more than 80 of structural failures are caused by fatigue mendes et al 2021 deterministic analysis time domain analysis and frequency spectrum analysis methods can be used to process wave loads in the fatigue analysis rokni and tabeshpour 2019 used the spectrum analysis method to analyze the fatigue problem of a jacket support with wave load the arrangement of dampers was optimized gaidai and naess 2008 used the spectrum analysis to perform fatigue analysis on a jacket structure and improved structural design fan et al 2020 determined the stress concentration factor through finite element analysis and used the time domain fatigue analysis to predict the owt support life the result demonstrated that the time domain analysis can produce higher accuracy but lower efficiency than that of the spectrum analysis mohammadi et al 2016 therefore the fatigue assessment methods continue improving du et al 2015 and mohammadi et al 2016 proposed a new fatigue damage assessment method using the hybrid time frequency analysis which does not require the assumption of stress distribution and is more accurate than the spectrum analysis and faster than the time domain analysis zhu et al 2019 introduced the damage functions related to the fatigue life and established a new nonlinear fatigue damage cumulative model bocher et al 2018 established a new shape function to improve the accuracy of fatigue life prediction maia et al 2019 developed a new method to update the oceanographic data and strain measurement data to predict the fatigue life of the owt support structures jia 2016 found that the gravity has large influence on the dynamic response and fatigue damage assessment of the support structures if the gravity is ignored the assessment error of the fatigue damage can be up to 24 monsalve giraldo et al 2016 used the univariate dimensionality reduction to perform probabilistic fatigue analysis of the support structures these excellent research results facilitate the reliability analysis of the owt support structures the latest research progress includes the owt supporting structure transformation alessi 2019 reliability optimization meng et al 2020 failure scenarios gholizad et al 2012 geometric effects at welds biswal and mehmanparast 2019 reliability model simplification wang et al 2020a and many other effects on the fatigue analysis at the same time the material degradation effect caused by corrosion has a great impact on the reliability analysis of the support structure dong et al 2012a therefore corrosion is a factor that cannot be ignored in the fatigue analysis mohammadi et al 2016 2 5 remaining problems in summary the reliability analysis of the owt support structures mainly focuses on the fatigue analysis and dynamic response research the finite element analysis is the primary tool however some problems still remain li et al 2020a 1 the finite element model is performed offline and the real time online monitoring is not realized hence actions cannot be conducted immediately when the wind turbine fails resulting in missing the best maintenance opportunity meanwhile the operating status of the support structure cannot be fed back to the finite element model in time so the model parameters cannot be updated 2 the finite element model cannot fully reflect and describe the physical state of the real structure it simply simulates the geometric characteristics of the support structure and does not well simulate other physical characteristics of the actual support structure such as time varying stiffness strength and other material properties as a result the finite element model cannot accurately describe the fatigue process such as crack growth corrosion and structural dynamics in addition the dynamical wind and wave loads received by the real model cannot be added in the finite element model 3 existing reliability analysis models can only calculate the support structure with a specific aspect for example when calculating the dynamic response of a wind turbine the overall wind turbine model is usually used for the calculation however this overall model cannot be used to calculate the fatigue crack 4 there are many uncertainties and ambiguities in the existing calculation models such as the uncertainty of the load uncertainty of the material properties and uncertainty of the model parameters in order to address these aforementioned challenges this review suggests combining the currently popular digital twins dt technology and finite element model to assess the reliability of the owt support structures an academic viewpoint of applying dt to the owt support structure is illustrated in the following sections 3 overview and applications of dt 3 1 concept the concept of dt is first proposed by professor grieves in 2003 grieves m grieves 2014 since 2012 dt has been developed rapidly in different documents the definition of dt is different kritzinger et al 2018 tao et al 2018a autiosalo et al 2020 an agreeable definition is that dt makes full use of data such as physical models sensor updates and operating history and integrates multi disciplinary multi physical multi scale and multi probability simulation processes to real time reproduce the dynamics of a physical system in the virtual space glaessgen and stargel 2012 the composition of dt is also different according to different understandings qi and tao qi and tao 2018 believed that dt mainly included three parts physical entity virtual model and connection system while tao et al 2018b thought that dt included five parts physical entity virtual model database service system and connection system weyer et al 2016 suggested that dt is composed of a series of virtual models however an agreeable understanding is that dt aims to monitor the state of a physical model in real time by fusing the data of each module tao et al 2018a and realize the control and optimization of the physical model soderberg et al 2017 the construction of a dt model includes four stages modeling data fusion data interaction and collaboration and service dt modeling is the foundation part but until now a systematic and standard modeling method is still unavailable it is usually involved with a virtual model the so called mirror model which is built according to the size of the physical model of interest with the help of various simulation software schroeder et al 2016 the virtual model needs to collect uhlemann et al 2017a and fuse data from different sources uhlemann et al 2017b such as sensor data strain gauge data and historical data etc data fusion includes three steps data preprocessing data mining and data optimization tao et al 2019b data interaction and collaboration are the most important feature for the dt model wang et al 2020b which involves timely information exchange between various modules to achieve information sharing the service system is the ultimate goal of dt which involves with realizing the intelligent control and task optimization of the physical model through technologies such as the internet of things sensor technology and big data driving tao et al 2018a the data and status of the virtual model are updated in real time and feedback to the physical model to achieve the service goal he et al 2021 at present the finite element simulation analysis is often adopted in the optimization and dynamic response analysis for the owt support structures raman and hassanaly 2019 however a dt model is completely different from a finite element model the dt model is a digital copy of a physical entity and is able to update its parameters simultaneously with the state of the physical entity lu et al 2020 more importantly the dt model cannot only describe the current state of the physical entity but also predict the future state as a result different from the finite element model the dt model can be used to monitor diagnose and predict the physical model schleich et al 2017 3 2 dt applications the dt model has a wide range of applications such as engineering design and production schleich et al 2017 food verboven et al 2020 vehicles glaessgen and stargel 2012 workshop equipment energy consumption management zhang 2018 medical treatment bruynseels 2018 multimedia el saddik 2018 intelligent manufacturing lu et al 2020 intelligent workshop tao and zhang 2017 lathe zhou et al 2020 etc currently dt is mostly used in manufacturing and can run through the entire life cycle of the product from the design zhang et al 2017 to the production health monitoring luo et al 2019 and later operation and maintenance fotland et al 2020 a good review on the application range of dt can refer to tao et al 2019b recently dt is found application in operation and maintenance where intelligent decision making can be well solved by dt for optimal operation and maintenance errandonea et al 2020 khan 2020 dt can realize the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis reduce unnecessary maintenance activities and formulate the optimal maintenance interval werner et al 2019 used dt to achieve predictive maintenance of equipment according to the prediction results the data driven predictive model was improved by dt to enhance the maintenance efficiency and save costs booyse 2020 proposed the concept of deep digital twins ddt for health management mi 2020 used dt to predict the bearing maintenance and improved the fault diagnosis and prediction accuracy coraddu et al 2019 adopted the dt model for ships to estimate the speed loss caused by ocean fouling akintseva 2021 used dt in the cutting process of machine tools where the kinematics process parameters and metal characteristics in the grinding process were considered into the dt model cattaneo and macchi 2019 employed dt to establish a rig degradation model to achieve higher prediction accuracy of the remaining life of the rig tao et al 2019a applied dt to product development and proposed a digital dual drive product design framework yu 2020 used dt to monitor the dynamic degradation process of a photoelectric system ruppert and abonyi 2020 connected a real time positioning system with a simulation model to form an adaptive dt which can predict the production status and evaluate the product performance erkoyuncu et al 2020 proposed a dt framework based on the ontology design to realize the adaptability of data update between various modules and to enhance the synchronization capability between physical entities and virtual models xu 2020 proposed a digital dual drive optimization method based on multiple dt modules which can increase the gas exchange efficiency of the generator by 4 millwater et al 2019 established a dt model for the fuselage and accurately calculated the failure probability and remaining life of key components tao et al 2018b used a five dimensional dt model to perform health management on the upper system of a wind turbine it can be seen that the dt technology can be well applied to the structure operation and maintenance and the existing applications of the dt models provide valuable guidance for the reliability analysis of the owt support structures 3 3 artificial intelligence enhanced dt with the rapid development of industry 4 0 big data and machine learning algorithms artificial intelligence ai has been applied to the development of more powerful dt models abramovici et al 2016 erkoyuncu et al 2017 molinaro et al 2021 developed a database through machine learning which efficiently coupled the cfd solver transat and the data platform edap to provide a new data interaction strategy for dt chakraborty and adhikari 2021 used the machine learning algorithms to establish a multi time scale dt framework to realize the parameter evolution of a dynamic system the model consisted of a physical model and a data driven model where the gaussian process gp was used as a mixed expert model for data driven to evolve the model parameters chakraborty et al 2021 used the gp simulators as the surrogate models in dt to solve the uncertainty problem due to limited and sparse data mi 2020 established an integrated mathematical programming model by considering parameter uncertainties and the nsga ii hybrid algorithm was used to solve the model qiu et al 2019 combined the augmented reality augmented reality and dt to improve the assembly quality and efficiency of complex products zohdi et al zohdi 2021 combined machine learning with dt to find the optimal path planning for airborne fuel to improve the firefighting effect yu 2020 combined the non parametric bayesian networks with dt and improved the gaussian particle filter to update the states and parameters of the system in real time to enhance the adaptability of the dt model in these excellent publications one can note that ai is able to improve the applications of dt in modeling very complex dynamic systems by adaptively updating the model parameters in light of this promising potential the ai based dt has been applied to monitor the structural fatigue cracks and predict the crack length and crack propagation in recent literature mohanty et al 2010 used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to predict the fatigue crack growth under a constant load wang et al 2016 used the extended kalman filter ekf and unscented kalman filter ukf to estimate the structural crack length with uncertain parameters keprate et al 2017 used an adaptive gaussian process regression model agprm instead of the finite element analysis to analyze the fatigue degradation of offshore pipelines the calculation time was significantly reduced sankararaman et al 2011 used the bayesian network to connect the finite element model crack growth model and alternative model to quantify the uncertainty of fatigue crack growth and predict the cracks on the cylindrical surface li et al 2017 used the bayesian network to establish a general dt model for diagnosis and prognosis of fatigue crack in the aircraft wings karve et al 2020 established an intelligent dt model for damage diagnosis prediction and model optimization of aircraft cracks ye et al 2020 proposed a dt to track the spacecraft structure life by predicting the crack growth lim et al 2018 used a data driven dt model using ultrasonic modulation to quantify and predict structural fatigue cracks cerrone et al 2014 used a dt model to monitor the crack path in real time and studied the influence of manufacturing errors on the crack path it can be seen that the dt has been much popularized in the fatigue crack analysis which provides a solid basis for the reliability analysis for the owt support structures however due to uncertainties and randomness in the owt reliability analysis the existing ai based dt models cannot be directly applied to the owt support structures to address this issue millwater et al 2019 pointed out that the best available knowledge of dt for uncertainty quantification should be provided in the form of probability distributions the probability theory for example bayesian theory is a promising tool to evaluate and quantify the uncertainties for the owt reliability analysis hurtado and hoffman 2006 used bayesian method to estimate the probability density function of the crack size and integrated the first verified crack size and the observed response crack size to update the estimation model torregosa and hu 2013 adopted the bayesian method to update the initial crack size in an aircraft model thereby improving the accuracy of the probabilistic risk assessment li et al 2017 integrated the dynamic bayesian networks with physical models and various accidental and cognitive sources of uncertainties to predict crack propagation sankararaman and mahadevan 2013 developed a bayesian model to continuously quantify and update the uncertainties in the structural health monitoring yang et al 2016 proposed a new crack size quantification method based on in situ lamb wave testing and bayesian method all these publications demonstrate that the bayesian method especially the dynamic bayesian method is very convenient for quantifying and updating the uncertainties in damage detection as a result it is reasonable to combine the bayesian method and dt model to provide effective reliability analysis for the owt support structures in summary dt has a close relationship with the design production and health management of a physical entity tao et al 2019b with the rapid development of machine learning and big data technologies the development of dt technology will be flourishing by combining the dynamic bayesian method with the dt technology various uncertain factors can be integrated to perform reliable crack growth analysis according to the research results reported in existing literatures it is believed that the bayesian dt can be applied to the owt support health monitoring and eventually solve the reliability problem in these support structures 4 a specific suggestion on dt monitoring owt support structures an owt support is a high reliability and long life marine structure with a service life of more than 20 years in the ocean due to environmental complexity model uncertainties and unrealistic assumptions it is difficult and sometime even impossible to make an accurate assessment on the health condition of the owt support structures mendes et al 2021 the dt technology has great application potential in the reliability analysis for the owt support structures taking the advantages of dt technology this review provides a specific suggestion to perform reliability analysis on the owt support structures fig 5 shows an overview of the suggested dt based reliability analysis system for the owt support structures this new dt framework consists of a physical model a virtual model a twin database and a service system when establishing this dt framework to support the owt reliability analysis one sensory data acquisition system is used to obtain the load parameters from the physical model and the damage parameters generated in the support structures and then map them to the virtual model then the multi scale modeling technology is used to provide full scale simulation tools for the reliability analysis of the support structures and the high precision simulation technology is used to establish a high fidelity model of the support structure to realize the prediction of crack growth hence model reduction can be conducted based on the high fidelity model to perform efficient prediction of the structural damage to meet the dt timeliness requirements lastly by considering the uncertainties of the support structure and integrating multi source heterogeneous data the dynamic bayesian method is used to evaluate the reliability probabilities of the owt support structures the physical model is mainly composed of the entities of the owt support structures and the sensory data acquisition system by installing various sensors and strain gauges in the support structures real time collection of the owt operating data continuous recording of the load received by the support structures and continuous monitoring of the structural damage data can be achieved in an online manner tao et al 2018b for the purpose of estimating the real time damage degree and location of the support structures at the same time the non destructive testing technologies are used to detect the structural damage because the non destructive testing data is in discrete type it is necessary to combine the online monitoring and non destructive testing data to fully describe the load and damage of the support structures which will support the parameter updating of the virtual model and provide sufficient knowledge for the service system the virtual model is a digital mirror of the physical model as shown in fig 6 a first the sub model technology is used to model the owt support structures at multiple scales according to the classification method of the first level overall the second level partial and the third level unit ye et al 2020 the wind turbine loads structural responses and maintenance record data acquired by the data acquisition system are used as the inputs of the dt model to dynamically update the virtual model xu 2020 step by step the virtual model will analyze the support structures to locate the stress concentration and deformation and produce details of the local stress and strain which will be used as the inputs of the damage simulation module then the damage simulation module is used to predict the structural cracks lastly but most importantly a degradation surrogate module will be established by reducing the high fidelity model to perform fast and accurate damage estimation which will enable real time data exchange between the physical model and the virtual model by mutually parameter updating and online reliability analysis of the owt support structures by cooperating the physical virtual and service models the service system mainly consists of an intelligent prediction module an information evaluation module and an intelligent decision making module as shown in fig 6 b thanks to the twin data the service system can use the dynamic bayesian networks to predict the fatigue cracks of the support structures and customize the task plan of the wind turbine according to the size of the damage so as to reduce the damage evolution rate and formulate an appropriate maintenance program more importantly the service system is able to assess the risk of the supports in extreme weather conditions the twin database is composed of data fused from the physical virtual and service models the fused data will be analyzed and processed by using advanced machine learning and signal processing algorithms the processed fused data will feedback to the physical virtual and service models and to drive these models to interact in real time 5 conclusions wind energy as a rich and clean new energy source has been widely exploited and utilized in most countries ocean wind energy has the advantages of high wind speed and long available time which makes owt as a promising development prospect with the continuous development and maturity of the wind harvest technology the cost of wind power is gradually reduced therefore the installed capacity of the owts has increased exponentially due to high operating and maintenance costs performing health monitoring reliability analysis and condition based maintenance for the owts is still a challenge this paper introduces the current research progress on the reliability analysis of the owt support structures as well as the applications of the dt technology for structure monitoring based on the latest literature for the owt reliability analysis a new dt framework applied to the owt support structures is proposed this new framework makes up for the shortcomings of the existing reliability analysis methods by using the combination of the virtual real modeling and real time data updating and monitoring at the same time the development of the dt technology continues to mature and related technologies such as the machine learning algorithms internet of things big data and finite element calculations are also developing rapidly which will provide nourishing technical support for the application of the dt based

20678,in recent years very large floating structures vlfs technology has attracted much attention for its sustainable and eco friendly approach in creating land from the sea owing to the massive size vlfs are usually fabricated as a number of floating modules in shipyards towed to site and connected on sea to ensure the functionality of such connected vlfs effective connector systems are essential the connector system must address issues related to the relative motion between adjacent modules and be able to sustain forces as a result of wave motion this paper presents a critical review on the research and development in connector systems for modularized vlfs various design concepts for connector systems are first categorized and their working principles outlined research studies on hydroelastic analysis of vlfs and the effectiveness of connector systems in reducing the hydroelastic responses and internal stress resultants in connectors are also reviewed in addition potential technical challenges on the determination of connector stiffness in practical designs are discussed finally some recommendations and suggestions for future practice are provided keywords connector systems hydroelastic responses internal stress resultants very large floating structures 1 introduction very large floating structures vlfs have been touted to be a better alternative approach in creating land space on the sea than the traditional land reclamation technique their advantages include the freedom in site selection low construction cost smaller environmental impact fast construction easily scalable and immunity to flooding wang et al 2015 xie et al 2020 owing to their massive size vlfs are usually constructed by connecting multiple standardized modules with connector systems thereby enabling easy construction and transportation moreover a review of past research studies indicates that a monolithic floating structure has to resist enormous bending moments and shear forces that significantly increases the difficulty and complexity of structural design a connector system is a critical component in the modularized floating structure and should be handled with caution many connector designs have been developed and comprehensive research studies were performed on a wide range of connector systems in this paper various design concepts for connector systems are first described and categorized according to their working principles recent research studies on hydro elastic responses and structural integrity are then introduced in addition the determination of connector stiffness in practical designs is discussed and suggestions for future engineering practice are provided 2 types of connector systems 2 1 general the relative motion between adjacent vlfs modules consists of six components grouped into translational motions surge sway and heave and rotational motions pitch roll and yaw as shown in fig 1 each degree of freedom dof can be rigidly restrained compliant or fully released a single connector is usually designed to be compliant to restrain the translational dof to some extent and connector systems deployed in vlfs are commonly composed of multiple compliant connectors to restrain more dofs as illustrated in table 1 it can be further inferred that a three dimensional combination of multiple connectors generally results in a connector system with no unrestrained dof denoted as all restrained connector system herein for instance vlfs modules connected with horizontal and vertical elements at both short and long sides ideally allow no relative motions in practice the margin in each individual connector determines the possible relative motions and the stiffness of the connector system depends on connector numbers configurations and materials used table 2 compares the key positive and negative aspects of rigid and flexible connector systems in general a flexible connector system results in lower connection forces and easier decoupling procedures by varying the stiffness of individual connectors the all restrained connector system transits from a fully rigid connection to a fully flexible connection connector systems for modules connected with no gap may be categorized into three main types rigid semi rigid and hinge connector systems a rigid connector system commonly consists of a combination of multiple connectors whereas a hinge connector system is realized with discrete connectors such as a hinge a ball joint and others the main difference between rigid and hinge connections lies in the transmitted bending moment the largest action effects in a hinged connector will be the axial and shear forces while the transmitted moments are negligible no distinct boundary exists between the rigid and semi rigid connector systems but the latter option has a relatively smaller stiffness some other connector systems are designed for floating modules with spaces in between and they include rigid vertical free hinge and flexible connectors 2 2 connector systems for floating modules connected with no gap the motions of vlfs are permitted to be within an allowable range according to various construction principles alternative design concepts are adopted in developing an all restrained connector system table 3 presents typical examples of connector systems developed based on 1 cable tensioning whereby multiple modules are prestressed with cables or bars 2 hinge clicking whereby adjacent elements are clicked together with multiple hinges in different dofs and 3 tooth anchoring whereby toothed structures are connected with a steel pin cable tensioning connector system is used to connect floating modules by passing and tensioning cables or tendons through internal ducts by which a larger stiffness can be achieved this tensioning principle generates well distributed connection forces but the shear resistance to heave motions could be weak hence shear keys may be installed to take care of the transverse shear forces in practice cables are not grouted to the sleeves to facilitate future removal when necessary the cost of cable tensioning connector system is low but the prestressing tendons may have to be destroyed to disassemble the floating structure and a large part of the connector system will have to be renewed for future repurposing of the floating structure rognaas et al 2001 designed a special connector with steel cables to handle axial tensile forces and hydraulic jacks and elastomeric bearings to provide elastic supports see table 3a the cable compliant technology was also used by halim to combine adjacent floating modules with different prestressing cable configurations table 3b when the modules are connected only at the upper deck level this connector system does not effectively transfer internal moments however when prestressing cables are arranged at both upper and lower deck levels flexural resistance can be provided to some extent and the bottom opening scenarios are eliminated jiang et al 2018 the cable tensioning connector system has been successfully applied in the incheon floating pier table 3c in 2018 and it has shown good in service performance so far jung et al 2019 each fabricated prestressed concrete segment has many connection holes for prestressing bars around the cross section and double rubber layers were also attached to prevent water penetration during the module connection work these connection holes were made in advance in the segment fabrication work and closed by temporary rubber water stoppers during the launching of the segment the stoppers were removed one by one before inserting prestressing bars into the connection holes all segments were connected to each other by prestressing bars on the sea to form the 200 m long sub module hinge clicking connector system is developed with multiple rows of steel piano hinges either in horizontal or vertical alignments key protruding steel connections are externally distributed over the sides of the floating module to reduce point load intensity and increase the rigidity armin s connector design table 3d uses steel piano hinges distributed at both top and bottom sides to guarantee sufficient stiffness and effectively transfer bending moments thereby forming a rigid connector system lei 2007 in contrast han s connection table 3e and mcdermotts mobile offshore base mob connection table 3f has only one row of hinge connectors and thus they may be considered as a hinge connector system with angular rotations allowed in service lei 2007 mcallister 1997 in armin s design the lower edges of the joined pontoons tend to open up in sagging condition because the pins are placed only on the deck level thus tolerance control for the locking pin s holes position is very crucial when compared to the cable tensioning system steel hinge connections are relatively expensive and are easily damaged in severe sea conditions due to fatigue and durability issues besides it is difficult for inspection or maintenance once steel piano hinges are clicked thus the costs for replacement of the steel connectors would be high the tooth anchoring connector system is commonly made of protruding teeth attached on sides of adjacent floating modules which are shoved or slid in place and locked by steel bars or bolts the large protruding teeth are not easily damaged during coupling but may hinder the coupling procedure bolting technology requires regular monitoring of the bolt torque as it may loosen over time the tooth anchoring connector system is able to bear high internal force in service and it is rather easy for disassembling the floating modules by pulling out the steel bar bargeco s connector design table 3g consists of male and female coupling members that can connected with a wedge engagement yoon and boldbaatar 2013 similarly gardner s design table 3h aligns adjacent pontoons with two coupling members and an elongated connecting member fitting into a recess both connector designs have limited tensile strength and require high tolerance control for assembly bargeco s connector demands the mating modules to be even and heel perfectly which is not practical and may only suitable for calm water condition gardner s design can lock both top and bottom of the connector theoretically but it is hard to achieve in practice because of tolerances of components and assembly tooth anchoring technique has been practically used in the connecting system of floating performance stage at the marina bay in singapore a special square shaped connector unit made of high tensile steel is designed to connect to the corners of four surrounding floating platforms wang et al 2015 the hollow edges of the connector unit slip into the tapered wedges and coupling members are kept in place by twelve distributed detachable steel locking pins the connector system that eventuated required the pontoon modules to be joined at the corners using a floating corner connector and along the mating edges with side connectors 5 along the longer edge and 2 along the shorter edge table 3i in general the tooth anchoring connector system can be very stiff when subjected to transverse compression but gaps are needed to insert the steel bar during the coupling process fig 2 shows some other connector systems that use bolts or bars to lock adjacent modules without protruding teeth au yeong proposed connector assemblies that comprise two housings mounted on adjacent floating modules and one movable connector element as shown in fig 2a the connection is established by shifting the connector element from one housing to the other and securing it by horizontal latches at the top and vertical pins at the bottom in practice the tolerance between the latch pin and hole has to be large enough for successfully latching all the connector elements with housings which may result in loose connection and creates gap movements between adjacent modules a special type of rigid connector system known as frictional locking connector was developed by han ocean yoon and boldbaatar 2013 in which locking bars were dropped in directed recesses of the two coupling parts to secure the connection between floating units both designs avoid shoving or sliding of protruding teeth but a high tolerance control is required for the assembly wilkins 2002 patented a connector system to rapdily lock floating modules in heavy seas via interconnecting male and female fingers fig 2c depicts the interface alignment and internal component arrangement for male and female connector fingers the male finger assembly includes a casing configured with a rotatable camshaft cams and connector bodies the spherical connector bodies are seated in receivers on the male connector finger and can be forced to move outwards and into the female finger s receptors a similar casing configuration with no moving parts is used for the female finger assembly the receptors are shaped like indentations of the connector bodies and designed to restrain connector bodies and support loads in three dimensions the circular hole in the female casing can be adapted to be used as a receptacle for the connector bodies from the male casing female fingers are attached along one side of a flat end module and adequately separated so that a male finger attached to a side of another flat end module may fit flush within the two female fingers creating a female pocket when floating modules are aligned and in close proximity to each other the male fingers are made flush with female pockets and the connector bodies are forced out into a locked position by rotating the camshaft within the male finger the cams are scalloped to prevent the connector bodies in the male connector fingers from turning the camshafts when the connector bodies are under loads in a locked position as described above tooth anchoring connector systems can be very strong in resisting transverse compression but they have limited tensile resistance and require high tolerances during the coupling process in order to overcome this a new design of rigid connector system hereby termed prestressed concrete shear key connection pcskc has been developed by the authors the proposed connection combines the use of tooth anchoring and cable tensioning approaches fig 3 illustrates the proposed pcskc for the connection of two modular concrete floating structures the adjacent floating modules are designed with thicker side walls and connected with prestressed bars at both the top and bottom of the modules which resist axial tensile forces and provide flexural moment resistance shear keys fig 3b are arranged along the interface between two modules to withstand vertical shear forces the assembly of floating modules using pcskc requires little tolerance to be provided for installation purpose in addition the connection stiffness can be adjusted by varying the shear key arrangements amount of prestressed bars as well as prestressing forces 2 3 connector systems for floating modules with space in between in engineering practices large floating structures are occasionally made of several modules with space in between so as to improve mobility in such cases the rigidity of connector systems is designed in accordance with different practical situations including rigid connector system vertical free connector system hinge connector system and fully flexible connector system for instance the us navy s mobile offshore base mob platform requires rigid connected modules to accommodate aircraft take off and landing whilst fully flexible connector systems that allow sway or surge motions are used for transport reasons e g ducts cables or pedestrian bridges connecting to shore brown and root designed a rigid connector system that combines multiple semi submersible modules in mob based on in operation tension leg platform tlp connections ramsamooj and shugar 2002 fig 4 a shows the conceptual design of rigidly connected semi submersible mob modules and fig 4b and c shows the proposed abb vetco grey latching system which is similar to those used on tlp connectors each connector comprises male and female halves made of 6 1 m diameter 152 mm thick thin walled steel tubing each half pivots on a 3 66 m diameter tube and is able to move or slide on the pivot tube via hydraulic cylinders which assists with the connection alignment and latching in addition buckled strut elastomeric members are arranged in an outer circle around the connector well to provide limited flexibility in the connector system and also attenuate the initial shock upon impact of the modules during mating once a rigid connector is latched a type of shear mechanism will be required to eliminate movement at the module interface the entire connection system deploys eight connectors four of them are connected at module joining another two are required to be connected before encountering sea state 6 and the last two are connected before encountering sea state 8 vertical free connector systems as shown in fig 5 are used when surge and sway motions are to be prevented they can be categorized as rotation allowing and rotation restricting connections the vertical free rotation free connection fig 5a is made of tubes and rods with horizontal transverse bolts pens and fixed holes the sway motion is prevented by clamping the connection elements in the horizontal plane while the heave motion is allowed since only one set of tubes and rods is used in the horizontal plane the vertical free rotation resistant connection fig 5b uses tubes and rods with horizontal transverse bolts pens with ends sliding in vertical slots diagonal connection elements are used in both horizontal and vertical planes which can effectively restrict the rotational motions in a similar manner hinge connector systems can be realized by using horizontal transverse bolt pen connections as shown in fig 6 flexible connector system is used where floating structures are moored and other relative movements are allowed xu et al 2014 proposed a conceptual design of flexible connector with trapezoidal rubbers and cables as illustrated in fig 7 the rubber was mainly used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when compression forces occur the cable is used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when tension forces occur very limited moment and shear force resistances can be provided by such a flexible connector system 3 research studies on connector systems 3 1 hydroelasticity theories and analysis approaches vlfs behaves elastically under wave actions because of its large horizontal dimensions when compared to the wavelength the response of vlfs cannot be solely described by rigid body motions as the interaction between elastic deformations and the surrounding flow field must be taken into account moreover for vlfs interconnected with multiple modules the hydroelastic response affects the internal forces acting on the connectors and the structural integrity thus a hydroelascitiy study is essential to verify the serviceability and strength of vlfs fig 8 presents an overall view of fundamental theories and analysis approaches for the hydroelastic analysis of the monolithic and mutli modular vlfs the hydroelastic behavior has been thoroughly studied with employing potential flow solvers based on i two dimensional 2d linear theories betts et al 1977 bishop and price 1977 jørgen and mansour 2002 ii 2d nonlinear theories juncher and terndrup 1979 iii three dimensional 3d linear theories bishop et al 1986 and iv 3d nonlinear theories wu et al 1997 chen et al 2003 2006 lee et al 2016 as for the structural part vlfs is frequently simplified as a floating beam or a floating plate model and hydroelastic formulations have been developed through the application of the strip theory and green s function method fu et al 2007 in order to reduce computational effort and time hydroelastic analysis is commonly carried out in the frequency domain by assuming a linear response two main numerical methods have been developed to implement the frequency domain analysis direct method and mode superposition method in the direct method one solves the equation of motion directly with all nodes of the discretized structural system namba and ohkusu 1999 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 taylor 2007 ohkusu and namba 2004 kim et al 2007 the mode superposition method introduces the generalized flexible modes apart from six rigid body modes to describe the structural deformations and decomposes the hydroelastic problem into diffraction and radiation problems for each mode wu et al 1995 senjanovic et al 2008 the generalized flexible modes require the determination of corresponding mode shapes of vlfs which can be achieved through either analytical modal functions or fem eigenvalue analysis the mode superposition method can be further divided into wet mode loukogeorgaki et al 2012 and dry mode fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 approaches depending on whether the surrounding fluid effect added mass and hydrostatic gravitational stiffness is taken into account in the calculation of vlfs mode shapes it is noted that the utilization of analytical modal functions is considered as a dry mode approach while the fem eigenvalue analysis can be applied in either the dry mode approach riggs et al 2000 fu et al 2005 senjanovic et al 2008a 2008b or the wet mode approach michailides et al 2013 when nonlinear characteristics of the fluid and structure are taken into consideration or when transient responses are of concern the frequency domain analysis is not applicable under such circumstances the time domain approach is necessary for solution but it requires intensive computational costs feng and bai 2017 nematbakhsh et al 2017 commonly used approaches for the time domain analysis of vlfs includes the direct integration method watanabe et al 1998 liu and sakai 2002 and the fourier transform method kashiwagi 2000 2004 endo 2000 ohmatsu 2005 wu and cui 2009 elucidated various 3d hydroelasticity theories ranging from linear frequency domain analyses to nonlinear time domain analyses comparisons between frequency domain and time domain solutions indicated that discrepancies exist for the case of anti symmetric responses where time domain analyses agree better with experimental measurements kim et al 2009 in practice vlfs are usually constructed by connecting multiple standardized modules with connector systems from the viewpoints of easy construction transportation and deployment watanabe et al 2004 the effect of both flexibility of the structure and the existence of the connectors should be considered to properly evaluate the hydroelastic performance of interconnected multi modular vlfs both floating modules and connector systems can be modeled as either rigid or flexible including hinges in the hydroelastic analysis resulting in four main types of model rigid module and rigid connector rmrc rigid module and flexible connector rmfc flexible module and rigid connector fmrc and flexible module and flexible connector fmfc fu et al 2007 in particular rmfc model was used by many researchers to predict the hydroelastic responses of vlfs wang et al 1991 riggs and ertekin 1993 riggs et al 1999 wei et al 2017 2018 in the rmfc model it is assumed that only rigid displacements translation and rotation exist in the floating modules while the connectors would have flexible deformations and generate internal forces due to relative motion of the adjacent modules riggs et al 2000 compared the use of rmfc and fmfc models in hydroelastic analysis and found that the effect of module elasticity in the fmfc model can be reproduced in a rmfc model by changing the connection stiffness to match the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the two models to study hinge connected floating structures with the modal superposition method newman 1997 defined hinge rigid body modes to represent relative motions between floating modules when the direct method is employed translational and rotational stiffness are specified for connector systems at the continuity point of interconnected floating modules and structural mass and stiffness matrices are updated accordingly for simple hinge connections rotational stiffness is set to be zero in the past two decades the rmfc model has been adopted by many chinese researchers to predict hydrodynamic responses and connector loads of vlfs wang et al 2002 developed a time sequence analysis method based on the assumption of rigid modules and flexible connectors to study the linear wave induced response of mob yu et al 2003 2004 used rmfc model to study the dynamic responses of mob connectors and further investigate the effects of connector stiffness multiple modules interaction wave angles and sea states on the mob module motions and connector loads yu et al 2006a 2006b applied rmfc model to determine the hydrodynamic responses of the floating trestle in seawaters with finite depth which were further verified by comparing with spectrometric analysis result and the experimental test result liu et al 2014 further adopted the rmfc model to analyze the dynamic responses of connectors in vlfs with a shallow draft and concluded that the shallow water effect may increase relative motions between floating modules leading to a higher vertical connector load intensity experimental investigations related to interconnected floating modules based on scaled physical models are necessary to practically assess the overall performance and forces in the connector system and also to verify numerical analysis approaches diamantoulaki et al 2008 martinelli et al 2008 carried out 3d experimental tests on i shaped and j shaped floating modules connected with tie rods to study effects of module layout and wave obliqueness on the effectiveness of floating breakwaters peña et al 2011 and ferreras et al 2014 implemented experimental investigations on π type floating modules that are connected with flexible connectors steel cables through cylindrical neoprene to explore the connectors forces of vlfs including horizontal and vertical shear forces and associated moments loukogeorgaki et al 2014 performed 3d experimental tests on an array of multiple floating box type modules connected with flexible connectors coated wire rope to assess connectors internal forces under the action of both regular and irregular perpendicular and oblique incident waves ding et al 2019 performed model tests on a 3 module vlfs and an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs in two simulated shallow sea regions to investigate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs deployed near islands and reefs in shallow sea the aforementioned physical model studies effectively evaluate the influences of module geometries environmental conditions and connection types on structural responses and connecting forces and also helps to verify analytical and numerical solutions 3 2 hydroelastic responses vlfs is required to satisfy the functional and operational requirements in practice such as tolerance on the structure motions and structural internal forces all these criteria are directly related to the hydroelastic response and it is desirable to reduce the response magnitude as much as possible to ensure the safety and serviceability of vlfs many research studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of the connector characteristics on the hydroelastic response of vlfs considering either hinge type connectors lee and newman 2000 xia et al 2000 or flexible connectors fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the main responses discussed herein are i vertical deflections and ii internal forces lee and newman 2000 and teng et al 2014 investigated rigid floating modules inter connected with hinge connectors while yoon et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 evaluated the performance of flexible floating modules connected with hinged joints fig 9 shows dimensionless vertical deflection and bending moments of floating plate structures with multiple hinge connections obtained by yoon et al 2014 who used the hybrid bem fem method as the number of hinge connections increases vertical deflections in the floating plate increase and peak values occur at hinge connections while bending moments reduce in general and maximum values locate around the centre between adjacent hinges note that maximum moment of single hinge plate is larger than that of the monolithic plate indicating that the use of hinge connections is not always beneficial in reducing the maximum bending moment riggs et al 2000 implemented hydroelastic analysis of vlfs consisting of rigid modules interconnected with flexible connectors while fu et al 2007 used 3d linear hydroelastic theory to predict the response of flexible floating modules interconnected with flexible connectors fig 10 presents vertical deflection profiles and bending moments of a flexible floating plate interconnected with flexible connectors for different rotational stiffness k rot riggs et al 2000 in the figure w represents the calculated deflection value while symbol a in the y axis indicates wave amplitude where a h 2 and h is the wave height it is seen that the vertical displacement amplitude decreases as the rotational stiffness increases and the deflection profile of the floating plate interconnected with stiffer connectors approaches the experimental results of continuous structures also the rotational stiffness of the connector system has a greater effect on the regions near the connector in terms of bending moments the value at the connector system gradually decreases to zero as the rotational stiffness reduces on the other hand the bending moment within the upstream and downstream modules will increase slightly xia et al 2000 evaluated the hydroelastic behaviour of articulated plates interconnected with vertical and rotational springs with a variation of stiffness value from zero to infinity that represent welded joints during the assembling process the displacement at the connectors is found to be larger than that on the plate and an increase in the spring stiffness is favorable in reducing the connector motions the bending moments and shear forces at the connectors are independent of the stiffness of the vertical and rotational springs respectively in the aforementioned studies the number and stiffness values of connections are artificially specified by researchers wang et al 2009 and riyansyah et al 2010 proposed the use of a compliance parameter χ defined in equation 1 in determining the optimal rotational stiffness parameter ξ and number of semi rigid connectors n to minimize the hydroelastic responses of longish vlfs a minimum value of compliance parameter is desirable and it is equivalent to a stiff beam acting against wave action 1 χ 1 a ρ l l 2 l 2 p w d x where a is the wave amplitude ρ the mass density of water l the floating beam length p the hydrodynamic pressure and w the deflection of the floating beam fig 11 compares hydroelastic responses of floating beams with multiple optimally designed semi rigid connections and with rigid connections semi rigid connections with appropriate stiffness and inserted at suitable locations are found to be more effective in reducing the vertical displacement as compared with rigid or hinge connections the compliance parameter was observed to reduce by using a moderate number of connector systems i e n 3 7 further increase in number of connections does not result in a significant reduction in the value of the compliance parameter 3 3 internal forces in connectors the structural integrity of vlfs under wave action strongly depends on the induced internal forces in the connectors up to now limited research studies had been carried out on the numerical evaluation of the internal forces and effects of various design parameters such as stiffness of connectors module layout shallow water effect and incident wave period kim et al 2007 liu et al 2014 michailides et al 2013 newman 1997 qi et al 2017a b yu et al 2003 2004 past research studies indicate that rigid connectors generally lead to high load intensity whilst the use of hinge connectors can effectively reduce the magnitude of connecting forces gao et al 2011 2013 dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 2019 2021 therefore connector systems with a certain degree of flexibility are usually adopted in designs of vlfs specifically newman 1997 computed the shear forces acting on the hinge connectors of floating structures and analyzed the influence of the number of floating modules on the forces in hinge connectors on the other hand kim et al 2007 evaluated the bending moments and the shear forces at flexible connections of vlfs assembled of modules and concluded that the internal forces in connectors of side by side arranged vlfs modules generally increase as the connection stiffness and heading angle increase qi et al 2017a b studied the relationship between the connector load and rigidity by computing the dynamic responses of flexible connectors in a vlfs with different combinations of transverse longitudinal and vertical rigidities analysis results show that whether the transverse rigidity is high or low there exists a combination of longitudinal and vertical rigidity that results in the peak connector load zhao et al 2019 further provided optimal stiffness values in three directions of flexible connectors for multi modular floating systems in different sea conditions apart from the connector stiffness incident wave characteristics also cause significant effects on connector forces of vlfs yu et al 2003 2004 conducted numerical analyses of mob connector loads on the basis of a rmfc model the results indicate that the longitudinal connector loads are much larger than the lateral and vertical loads besides the wave headings significantly affected the forces between modules and the longitudinal load of the connector reached its maximum with a 75 wave direction it is suggested to keep the angle between the mob and wave direction less than 45 and to avoid unrealistically large connector loads ding et al 2019 performed a model test on an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs with specified connector stiffness of 4 60 106 n m 6 55 106 n m and 9 78 106 n m in three directions fig 12 presents the variations of connecting forces along the length of the vlfs model from connectors c1 c3 to c13 three frequencies representing short medium and long regular waves that is 0 897 rad s t 7 s 0 483 rad s t 13 s and 0 209 rad s t 30 s were considered the distribution of internal forces is significantly dependent on the frequency of incoming waves axial forces f x for connectors in the middle of the longish vlfs are generally greater than those at the two end parts but no consistent pattern is observed for shear forces f y loukogeorgaki et al 2014 implemented 3d experiments to assess the internal forces in connectors of multiple floating box type modules with flexible connectors under wave actions of different characteristics wave obliquity wave period and wave height fig 13 shows the variation of internal forces with the change of incident wave frequency and wave steepness test results showed that the wave obliquity and wave height affect forces mainly in the low frequency range 6 rad s ω 9 rad s contrary to ding s findings it is seen from fig 13 that the increase in incident wave frequency generally leads to the decrease in axial and shear forces which may attribute to a relatively higher wave frequency and a shorter structural length besides the increase in incident wave steepness h l results in the increase of these forces especially in the low frequency range for the same wave height and period the increase of wave obliquity from 60 to 90 leads to a decrease in internal forces resulting in a more efficient floating structure in terms of both functionality and structural integrity most research studies were conducted on vlfs with modules connected in the transverse direction only michailides et al 2013 considered vlfs consisting of a grid of floating modules flexibly connected in two directions and identified the optimal module layout and connectors rotational stiffness fig 14 presents the variation of connector internal forces as a function of incident wave frequencies for a 3 3 grid type floating structure with wave angle β 0 the increase in connector rotational stiffness from k r1 and k r2 to k r3 results in a decrease of the peak axial forces and shear forces additionally a larger rotational stiffness k r3 leads to larger moments in x direction m y xc fig 15 compares the axial forces in x direction f x xc as a function of incident wave frequency for different module layout and various rotational stiffness values the change of the module number and layout directly affects connectors internal loads specifically a 1 2 grid structure has the largest maximum axial force f x xc compared to structures with other grid layouts for all cases the axial forces f x xc was the same and small regardless of connector stiffness when the incident wave frequency ω 2 72 rad s to further investigate the application of a combination of hinge and rigid connectors in floating structures and their effects on the connector forces a comprehensive experimental model test program was conducted by the authors at the national university of singapore nus hydraulics laboratory fig 16 a shows three floating module layouts tested in the wave basin including one line system 2 4 grid system and 3 3 grid system in the one line system two proposed connector types rigid or hinge were applied for the outermost connector similarly rigid and hinge connector systems were explored in 2 4 and 3 3 grid module layouts as described in fig 16a note that the first two modules in the one line system served as a floating bridge to connect the longish floating structure with the onshore quay boundary fig 16 b d presents the maximum bending moments of three module layouts under 100 year irregular wave with a heading angle of 0 in general the moments can be effectively reduced with the use of hinge connectors especially for 2 4 and 3 3 grid systems however the motions of the hinge connected systems were relatively larger thus a trade off needs to be considered between connecting loads and structural motions in the design of connector system in addition a longish vlfs one line system may sustain larger connecting forces compared to the floating structure with smaller length to width ratios that is 2 4 and 3 3 grid systems liu et al 2014 studied the shallow water effect on the dynamic characteristics of connectors it shows that the vertical connector load tends to be amplified for a vlfs with a shallow draft which should be considered in the engineering design practice gu et al 2015 used the time domain method to determine the connector loads for a vlfs under the combined action of wave loads and ship impact loads under impact loads high frequency oscillations in the time history curve of the connector load are observed under different wave headings the maximum magnitude of the connector load is found to occur in the x direction an oscillatory connector load is observed in the y direction with a wave heading of 75 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 determination of connector stiffness assessment of hydroelastic responses combined with determination of connector forces represents a key element towards an integrated design of vlfs based on extensive review work presented above it is concluded that various factors significantly affect the performance of vlfs in terms of operational design requirements and structural integrity these include the variation in connector stiffness geometrical dimensions and grid type of floating structures and wave field characteristics that is wave obliquity wave period wave height etc of which the connection stiffness is particularly important in general the use of rigid connector systems induces relatively smaller structural motions but extremely higher internal loads when compared to hinge connectors to achieve a balance between load and motion responses flexible connectors that utilize compliant materials such as rubber spring and cable have been used in practice however this results in complex connector system and design and raises difficulties in quantifying the stiffness accurately apart from referring it as a semi rigid connector system meanwhile in the evaluation of hydroelastic responses and connecting forces in vlfs with flexible connectors researchers usually artificially specify the translational and rotational stiffness from zero to infinity regardless of their feasibility of the connector system under such circumstances there is a gap between the results of hydroelasticity research and the development of practical connector systems as part of critical design variables of vlfs connector characteristics should be defined and selected to satisfy the design objective and operational requirements experimental test is an effective way to determine the actual stiffness of a practical vlfs connector system via the load deformation relationship china ship scientific research center has conducted extensive experimental research studies on the strength and behavior of various practical connector systems qi et al 2015 designed a flexible connector system for vlfs with a shallow draft which is composed of 5 ball and spring devices 2 devices in the x direction 2 devices in the z direction and 1 device in the y direction as shown in fig 17 comprehensive static and dynamic load tests were performed to study the rigidity and evaluate the structural safety of the connector design test results indicated that the relationship between load and deformation of the flexible connector system remains in the linear range during the test from which the stiffness value can be obtained besides different load combinations may result in uneven deformations in the two ball and spring devices in the x direction which requires special attention in the design song 2018 introduced several conceptual designs of connector systems for modular vlfs and provided preliminary design drawings for one type of flexible connector zhang et al 2019 explored the use of nylon and rubber materials in the design of a flexible connector mechanical properties of the connector system were determined from experimental tests from which a nonlinear relationship between the load and displacement was observed the stiffness characteristics and stress magnitudes are found to be significantly influenced by nylon and rubber material properties which needs to be optimized in the engineering design practice zhang et al 2019 analyzed the mechanical property of an integrated case typed connector with double module platform as shown in fig 18 the contact relationship between the connector steel shaft and shaft block were established based on the model test and finite element analysis also the connector s stress distribution and ultimate strength were analyzed and the stiffness was determined in the case that the test data of vlfs connector is unavailable engineers are required to use reasonable stiffness values in the design fig 19 shows the flow chart proposed by the authors to determine the connector stiffness for practical designs the process includes two main parts hydroelastic analysis and structural analysis first the connector stiffness values are assumed according to its characteristics for instance the rotational stiffness can be set as a large value for near rigid connectors whereas it should be set small for near hinge connectors for the translational stiffness zhao et al 2019 has studied the optimal stiffness layout of modularized floating structures using genetic algorithm based approach and concluded that the stiffness along the surge motion should be designed relatively soft while the stiffness along the sway and heave motions should be designed relatively hard against shear load the suggested optimized stiffness in three directions are k x 106 n m k y 1011 n m and k z 1011 n m where x y and z represent surge sway and heave respectively which can be used as initial values if no other information is available with the assumed connector stiffness and in conjunction with wave field characteristics and structural geometry information the hydroelastic analysis can be performed on the vlfs to obtain the connector internal forces next a detailed finite element model of the connector systems needs to be established to perform the deformation analysis with the inputs of connector geometries material properties and connecting forces the relations between the loading and deformation response are obtained from which the connector stiffness can be inferred if this differs from the initial assumed value the hydroelastic analysis will be carried out for a second round with the obtained stiffness and the iteration ends when the stiffnesses converge shi et al 2018 claimed that the connector stiffness is related to connecting forces and material nonlinearity thus several rounds may be needed in the iterative procedure to finalize the actual stiffness values as the by product the strength analysis can also be carried out using the detailed finite element model to check the safety of the connector design under maximum internal loads 3 4 2 fatigue strength connector systems of vlfs are subjected to repeated loading conditions throughout the service life due to the cyclic nature of environmental loads which may result in serious fatigue problems although extensive research studies on fatigue analysis and design of marine structures have been conducted very limited literature were found on fatigue behavior of connector systems specifically lotsberg i 2016 ramsamooj et al 2001 2002 developed an analytical model to predict the fracture based fatigue life of vlfs connectors under random wave actions in the marine environment besides a performance function is further defined in terms of the material properties nominal stress range and inherent defect or starter crack to perform the reliability based design analysis of the fatigue life of the connectors in mob the reliability calculations indicated that relatively lower stress values should be used in the design to meet the fatigue life target reliability level wang et al 2009 predicted the fatigue behavior of the connectors in a floating bridge with employing the local stress strain approach it is revealed that the ultimate tensile strength and the sequence of the dynamic loads may significantly influence the fatigue damage of the connectors more research studies are expected to ensure the safety and economical design of connector systems for vlfs in the absence of sufficient research activities performed overseas the fatigue strength of connector systems in vlfs was significantly studied by the china ship scientific research center in recent years liu 2014 utilized the s n curve method and theory of fracture mechanics to predict the fatigue life of a connector system seven s n curves were considered and the effects of wave angles and sea states on the fatigue damage were analyzed single stage paris law and two stage paris law were adopted to calculate the fatigue life of connectors with an initial crack of thirty different sets of sizes and shapes it is concluded that smaller initial cracks generally lead to slower crack growth speed and longer fatigue life of the connectors qi et al 2017a b conducted a model test of a hinge connector consisting of a nylon sandwich and a pipe shaft strengthened by circular frames to evaluate the fatigue strength and structural stresses of the connector as shown in fig 20 the fatigue life was evaluated based on theory of the s n curve and crack propagation separately the fatigue life and fatigue strength are found to be significantly affected by the load magnitude and wave angle zhao et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the ultimate strength of the vlfs connector foundation support reinforcing area structure under complex loads as shown in fig 21 plastic hinges were observed in the model when subjected to large combined vertical and longitudinal loads therefore the material nonlinearity may be important and should be considered in the analysis and design of connector systems for vlfs 3 4 3 active control connector system since the structural responses and connector forces of modularized vlfs are significantly affected by connector stiffness xia et al 2016 proposed a special active control connector system with air springs the connector stiffness could be adjusted along with the evolution of wave conditions by changing the air pressure inside the air spring to reduce the oscillation of floating structures fig 22 a presents adjacent floating modules connected with two parallel air springs where symbols δ1 and δ2 represent respectively the initial horizontal and vertical distances between two modules the air spring configuration is shown in fig 22b an in outlet is reserved for inflating or deflating the air spring and rubber bumper is used to cushion the hard impact due to extreme motion although the stiffness of connector can be altered by changing the air pressure it is still difficult to accurately quantify the stiffness for practical design moreover this special active control connector system is also limited in terms of timeliness and complexity of the sensor signal transmission 3 4 4 materials design of connector system connector systems for vlfs can be designed with different materials such as steel concrete and composites the selection of appropriate materials relates to their own strength and advantages functional requirements and application scenarios of floating structures considering its good mechanical properties and light weight steel is suitable for connector systems in medium scale floating structures that need to be transported from place to place such as military pontoons barges and causeways on the other hand concrete is resistant to seawater and keeps maintenance costs low making it more attractive for connections in large permanent floating structures like breakwaters piers and jetties in a seawater environment a sophisticated connector system can be made of various materials to meet different requirements in practice conventional materials steel and concrete are commonly used for critical stiff components to ensure the structural integrity of vlfs once adjacent floating modules are joined rubber and foam are preferable for flexible components of the connector system to withstand impact loading and absorb kinetic energy of the moving modules which can effectively dampen and gently decelerate the motion in a sense the use of the aforementioned two types of materials with distinctive mechanical properties fulfill two contradicting requirements on the elasticity and rigidity of the connector system additionally steel cables or springs are occasionally used in the connection design to withstand axial tensile forces fibre reinforced polymer frp has been increasingly used in a variety of structures in the severe environments frp materials exhibit a linear elastic behavior under tensile loading up to failure without showing any plastic behavior owning higher tensile strength but lower young s modulus than conventional steel in general carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp shows more favorable behaviors in terms of mechanical characteristics chloride resistance and anti moisture compared to frps manufactured of other materials such as glass aramid and basalt sen et al 1998a b although no existing literature reported the use of cfrp in the connector system for vlfs cfrp is a preferable substitute for the stiff component steel block and flexible component steel cable for anti corrosion purposes specifically elsafty et al 2014 evaluated the characteristics of prestressing carbon fiber composite cables cfcc in severe environment and concluded that cfcc showed excellent performance maintaining very high guaranteed tensile strength retention and elastic modulus retention after conditioning for over 7000 h in an alkaline solution pantelides et al 2003 reported that cfrp composites with their superior strength and resistance to electrochemical corrosion are a practical alternative for connecting precast concrete members in building structures it is worth mentioning that mechanical properties strength and stiffness of frp decrease significantly with the increase of temperature fried 1995 therefore the use of frp may not be suitable where high temperature is of concern durable connector systems that require less intrusive maintenance are highly desirable because it would exhibit longer life spans and thus maximize the use of the vlfs in the seawater environment ultrahigh performance concrete uhpc has roused great interests in the past decades due to its advantageous material properties such as high strength low permeability to water and chemical substance good chloride penetration resistance which is believed to have a broader application prospect in marine environments li et al 2020 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 similar as an frp material uhpc has not been applied in the connector system for vlfs at the current stage however this new advanced cementitious composite material has been widely used in the design and construction of connections for concrete bridge superstructures graybeal 2010 investigated the structural behavior of field cast uhpc connections for modular bridge deck components via static and cyclic loading tests and better performances were demonstrated than those of a conventional cast in place bridge deck in canada 42 adjacent box girder bridges were constructed with uhpc shear keys since 2008 rahman and mcquaker 2016 yuan and graybeal 2016 conducted full scale tests on the uhpc joints when subjected to over 1 million load structural cycles and 10 thermal load cycles and research results shown an enhanced strength of the connection filled with uhpc based on the experience in bridge engineering uhpc can be a competitive material for the design of the stiff component concrete block in connector systems for vlfs 4 concluding remarks in the next decade and beyond we shall witness the construction of very large and sustainable floating platforms near congested coastal cities to create space on the adjacent water bodies for urban expansion with the adoption of modular prefabricated construction approach for vlfs the design and manufacturing of effective connector systems and careful construction control to safely connect segments on the sea is needed a literature review on research and development in connector systems for modularized vlfs is presented key findings potential design issues and suggestions for practice are summarized as follows 1 connector systems are categorized into cable tensioning connector hinge clicking connector and tooth anchoring connector by combining the tooth anchoring and cable tensioning technologies a new design of connector system pcskc is developed and presented herein for easy installation and stiffness adjustment 2 the effect of both flexibility of the structure and the existence of the connectors should be considered to properly evaluate hydroelastic performance of modularized vlfs both floating modules and connector systems may be modeled as either rigid or flexible resulting in four types of model rmrc rmfc fmrc and fmfc in particular rmfc model was widely used to predict the hydroelastic responses of vlfs considering the flexibility of the connector system 3 rigid connectors generally lead to high internal forces whilst hinge connectors can effectively reduce the connector forces semi rigid connectors with appropriate stiffness and installed at suitable locations are found to be more effective in reducing structural responses when compared to fully rigid or hinge connections besides connector stiffness geometrical dimensions grid type and wave field characteristics also affect the magnitude of connector forces significantly hydroelastic analyses are required to assess the internal forces accounting for these parameters 4 the stiffness of the flexible connector is of upmost importance because it seriously affects the connector loads and dynamics of the floating platform to address the inconsistency in the determination of connector stiffness between hydroelasticity research and development of practical connector systems an iterative procedure is proposed herein to determine the actual stiffness of connector systems using both hydroelastic analysis and finite element structural analysis 5 current methods of analysis involve complicated mathematical models and techniques which are difficult to use simplified methods of analysis and models are in dire need for design practice besides more research studies need to be carried out on the fatigue behaviour of connector systems for vlfs to ensure the safety and economical design in the engineering practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

20678,in recent years very large floating structures vlfs technology has attracted much attention for its sustainable and eco friendly approach in creating land from the sea owing to the massive size vlfs are usually fabricated as a number of floating modules in shipyards towed to site and connected on sea to ensure the functionality of such connected vlfs effective connector systems are essential the connector system must address issues related to the relative motion between adjacent modules and be able to sustain forces as a result of wave motion this paper presents a critical review on the research and development in connector systems for modularized vlfs various design concepts for connector systems are first categorized and their working principles outlined research studies on hydroelastic analysis of vlfs and the effectiveness of connector systems in reducing the hydroelastic responses and internal stress resultants in connectors are also reviewed in addition potential technical challenges on the determination of connector stiffness in practical designs are discussed finally some recommendations and suggestions for future practice are provided keywords connector systems hydroelastic responses internal stress resultants very large floating structures 1 introduction very large floating structures vlfs have been touted to be a better alternative approach in creating land space on the sea than the traditional land reclamation technique their advantages include the freedom in site selection low construction cost smaller environmental impact fast construction easily scalable and immunity to flooding wang et al 2015 xie et al 2020 owing to their massive size vlfs are usually constructed by connecting multiple standardized modules with connector systems thereby enabling easy construction and transportation moreover a review of past research studies indicates that a monolithic floating structure has to resist enormous bending moments and shear forces that significantly increases the difficulty and complexity of structural design a connector system is a critical component in the modularized floating structure and should be handled with caution many connector designs have been developed and comprehensive research studies were performed on a wide range of connector systems in this paper various design concepts for connector systems are first described and categorized according to their working principles recent research studies on hydro elastic responses and structural integrity are then introduced in addition the determination of connector stiffness in practical designs is discussed and suggestions for future engineering practice are provided 2 types of connector systems 2 1 general the relative motion between adjacent vlfs modules consists of six components grouped into translational motions surge sway and heave and rotational motions pitch roll and yaw as shown in fig 1 each degree of freedom dof can be rigidly restrained compliant or fully released a single connector is usually designed to be compliant to restrain the translational dof to some extent and connector systems deployed in vlfs are commonly composed of multiple compliant connectors to restrain more dofs as illustrated in table 1 it can be further inferred that a three dimensional combination of multiple connectors generally results in a connector system with no unrestrained dof denoted as all restrained connector system herein for instance vlfs modules connected with horizontal and vertical elements at both short and long sides ideally allow no relative motions in practice the margin in each individual connector determines the possible relative motions and the stiffness of the connector system depends on connector numbers configurations and materials used table 2 compares the key positive and negative aspects of rigid and flexible connector systems in general a flexible connector system results in lower connection forces and easier decoupling procedures by varying the stiffness of individual connectors the all restrained connector system transits from a fully rigid connection to a fully flexible connection connector systems for modules connected with no gap may be categorized into three main types rigid semi rigid and hinge connector systems a rigid connector system commonly consists of a combination of multiple connectors whereas a hinge connector system is realized with discrete connectors such as a hinge a ball joint and others the main difference between rigid and hinge connections lies in the transmitted bending moment the largest action effects in a hinged connector will be the axial and shear forces while the transmitted moments are negligible no distinct boundary exists between the rigid and semi rigid connector systems but the latter option has a relatively smaller stiffness some other connector systems are designed for floating modules with spaces in between and they include rigid vertical free hinge and flexible connectors 2 2 connector systems for floating modules connected with no gap the motions of vlfs are permitted to be within an allowable range according to various construction principles alternative design concepts are adopted in developing an all restrained connector system table 3 presents typical examples of connector systems developed based on 1 cable tensioning whereby multiple modules are prestressed with cables or bars 2 hinge clicking whereby adjacent elements are clicked together with multiple hinges in different dofs and 3 tooth anchoring whereby toothed structures are connected with a steel pin cable tensioning connector system is used to connect floating modules by passing and tensioning cables or tendons through internal ducts by which a larger stiffness can be achieved this tensioning principle generates well distributed connection forces but the shear resistance to heave motions could be weak hence shear keys may be installed to take care of the transverse shear forces in practice cables are not grouted to the sleeves to facilitate future removal when necessary the cost of cable tensioning connector system is low but the prestressing tendons may have to be destroyed to disassemble the floating structure and a large part of the connector system will have to be renewed for future repurposing of the floating structure rognaas et al 2001 designed a special connector with steel cables to handle axial tensile forces and hydraulic jacks and elastomeric bearings to provide elastic supports see table 3a the cable compliant technology was also used by halim to combine adjacent floating modules with different prestressing cable configurations table 3b when the modules are connected only at the upper deck level this connector system does not effectively transfer internal moments however when prestressing cables are arranged at both upper and lower deck levels flexural resistance can be provided to some extent and the bottom opening scenarios are eliminated jiang et al 2018 the cable tensioning connector system has been successfully applied in the incheon floating pier table 3c in 2018 and it has shown good in service performance so far jung et al 2019 each fabricated prestressed concrete segment has many connection holes for prestressing bars around the cross section and double rubber layers were also attached to prevent water penetration during the module connection work these connection holes were made in advance in the segment fabrication work and closed by temporary rubber water stoppers during the launching of the segment the stoppers were removed one by one before inserting prestressing bars into the connection holes all segments were connected to each other by prestressing bars on the sea to form the 200 m long sub module hinge clicking connector system is developed with multiple rows of steel piano hinges either in horizontal or vertical alignments key protruding steel connections are externally distributed over the sides of the floating module to reduce point load intensity and increase the rigidity armin s connector design table 3d uses steel piano hinges distributed at both top and bottom sides to guarantee sufficient stiffness and effectively transfer bending moments thereby forming a rigid connector system lei 2007 in contrast han s connection table 3e and mcdermotts mobile offshore base mob connection table 3f has only one row of hinge connectors and thus they may be considered as a hinge connector system with angular rotations allowed in service lei 2007 mcallister 1997 in armin s design the lower edges of the joined pontoons tend to open up in sagging condition because the pins are placed only on the deck level thus tolerance control for the locking pin s holes position is very crucial when compared to the cable tensioning system steel hinge connections are relatively expensive and are easily damaged in severe sea conditions due to fatigue and durability issues besides it is difficult for inspection or maintenance once steel piano hinges are clicked thus the costs for replacement of the steel connectors would be high the tooth anchoring connector system is commonly made of protruding teeth attached on sides of adjacent floating modules which are shoved or slid in place and locked by steel bars or bolts the large protruding teeth are not easily damaged during coupling but may hinder the coupling procedure bolting technology requires regular monitoring of the bolt torque as it may loosen over time the tooth anchoring connector system is able to bear high internal force in service and it is rather easy for disassembling the floating modules by pulling out the steel bar bargeco s connector design table 3g consists of male and female coupling members that can connected with a wedge engagement yoon and boldbaatar 2013 similarly gardner s design table 3h aligns adjacent pontoons with two coupling members and an elongated connecting member fitting into a recess both connector designs have limited tensile strength and require high tolerance control for assembly bargeco s connector demands the mating modules to be even and heel perfectly which is not practical and may only suitable for calm water condition gardner s design can lock both top and bottom of the connector theoretically but it is hard to achieve in practice because of tolerances of components and assembly tooth anchoring technique has been practically used in the connecting system of floating performance stage at the marina bay in singapore a special square shaped connector unit made of high tensile steel is designed to connect to the corners of four surrounding floating platforms wang et al 2015 the hollow edges of the connector unit slip into the tapered wedges and coupling members are kept in place by twelve distributed detachable steel locking pins the connector system that eventuated required the pontoon modules to be joined at the corners using a floating corner connector and along the mating edges with side connectors 5 along the longer edge and 2 along the shorter edge table 3i in general the tooth anchoring connector system can be very stiff when subjected to transverse compression but gaps are needed to insert the steel bar during the coupling process fig 2 shows some other connector systems that use bolts or bars to lock adjacent modules without protruding teeth au yeong proposed connector assemblies that comprise two housings mounted on adjacent floating modules and one movable connector element as shown in fig 2a the connection is established by shifting the connector element from one housing to the other and securing it by horizontal latches at the top and vertical pins at the bottom in practice the tolerance between the latch pin and hole has to be large enough for successfully latching all the connector elements with housings which may result in loose connection and creates gap movements between adjacent modules a special type of rigid connector system known as frictional locking connector was developed by han ocean yoon and boldbaatar 2013 in which locking bars were dropped in directed recesses of the two coupling parts to secure the connection between floating units both designs avoid shoving or sliding of protruding teeth but a high tolerance control is required for the assembly wilkins 2002 patented a connector system to rapdily lock floating modules in heavy seas via interconnecting male and female fingers fig 2c depicts the interface alignment and internal component arrangement for male and female connector fingers the male finger assembly includes a casing configured with a rotatable camshaft cams and connector bodies the spherical connector bodies are seated in receivers on the male connector finger and can be forced to move outwards and into the female finger s receptors a similar casing configuration with no moving parts is used for the female finger assembly the receptors are shaped like indentations of the connector bodies and designed to restrain connector bodies and support loads in three dimensions the circular hole in the female casing can be adapted to be used as a receptacle for the connector bodies from the male casing female fingers are attached along one side of a flat end module and adequately separated so that a male finger attached to a side of another flat end module may fit flush within the two female fingers creating a female pocket when floating modules are aligned and in close proximity to each other the male fingers are made flush with female pockets and the connector bodies are forced out into a locked position by rotating the camshaft within the male finger the cams are scalloped to prevent the connector bodies in the male connector fingers from turning the camshafts when the connector bodies are under loads in a locked position as described above tooth anchoring connector systems can be very strong in resisting transverse compression but they have limited tensile resistance and require high tolerances during the coupling process in order to overcome this a new design of rigid connector system hereby termed prestressed concrete shear key connection pcskc has been developed by the authors the proposed connection combines the use of tooth anchoring and cable tensioning approaches fig 3 illustrates the proposed pcskc for the connection of two modular concrete floating structures the adjacent floating modules are designed with thicker side walls and connected with prestressed bars at both the top and bottom of the modules which resist axial tensile forces and provide flexural moment resistance shear keys fig 3b are arranged along the interface between two modules to withstand vertical shear forces the assembly of floating modules using pcskc requires little tolerance to be provided for installation purpose in addition the connection stiffness can be adjusted by varying the shear key arrangements amount of prestressed bars as well as prestressing forces 2 3 connector systems for floating modules with space in between in engineering practices large floating structures are occasionally made of several modules with space in between so as to improve mobility in such cases the rigidity of connector systems is designed in accordance with different practical situations including rigid connector system vertical free connector system hinge connector system and fully flexible connector system for instance the us navy s mobile offshore base mob platform requires rigid connected modules to accommodate aircraft take off and landing whilst fully flexible connector systems that allow sway or surge motions are used for transport reasons e g ducts cables or pedestrian bridges connecting to shore brown and root designed a rigid connector system that combines multiple semi submersible modules in mob based on in operation tension leg platform tlp connections ramsamooj and shugar 2002 fig 4 a shows the conceptual design of rigidly connected semi submersible mob modules and fig 4b and c shows the proposed abb vetco grey latching system which is similar to those used on tlp connectors each connector comprises male and female halves made of 6 1 m diameter 152 mm thick thin walled steel tubing each half pivots on a 3 66 m diameter tube and is able to move or slide on the pivot tube via hydraulic cylinders which assists with the connection alignment and latching in addition buckled strut elastomeric members are arranged in an outer circle around the connector well to provide limited flexibility in the connector system and also attenuate the initial shock upon impact of the modules during mating once a rigid connector is latched a type of shear mechanism will be required to eliminate movement at the module interface the entire connection system deploys eight connectors four of them are connected at module joining another two are required to be connected before encountering sea state 6 and the last two are connected before encountering sea state 8 vertical free connector systems as shown in fig 5 are used when surge and sway motions are to be prevented they can be categorized as rotation allowing and rotation restricting connections the vertical free rotation free connection fig 5a is made of tubes and rods with horizontal transverse bolts pens and fixed holes the sway motion is prevented by clamping the connection elements in the horizontal plane while the heave motion is allowed since only one set of tubes and rods is used in the horizontal plane the vertical free rotation resistant connection fig 5b uses tubes and rods with horizontal transverse bolts pens with ends sliding in vertical slots diagonal connection elements are used in both horizontal and vertical planes which can effectively restrict the rotational motions in a similar manner hinge connector systems can be realized by using horizontal transverse bolt pen connections as shown in fig 6 flexible connector system is used where floating structures are moored and other relative movements are allowed xu et al 2014 proposed a conceptual design of flexible connector with trapezoidal rubbers and cables as illustrated in fig 7 the rubber was mainly used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when compression forces occur the cable is used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when tension forces occur very limited moment and shear force resistances can be provided by such a flexible connector system 3 research studies on connector systems 3 1 hydroelasticity theories and analysis approaches vlfs behaves elastically under wave actions because of its large horizontal dimensions when compared to the wavelength the response of vlfs cannot be solely described by rigid body motions as the interaction between elastic deformations and the surrounding flow field must be taken into account moreover for vlfs interconnected with multiple modules the hydroelastic response affects the internal forces acting on the connectors and the structural integrity thus a hydroelascitiy study is essential to verify the serviceability and strength of vlfs fig 8 presents an overall view of fundamental theories and analysis approaches for the hydroelastic analysis of the monolithic and mutli modular vlfs the hydroelastic behavior has been thoroughly studied with employing potential flow solvers based on i two dimensional 2d linear theories betts et al 1977 bishop and price 1977 jørgen and mansour 2002 ii 2d nonlinear theories juncher and terndrup 1979 iii three dimensional 3d linear theories bishop et al 1986 and iv 3d nonlinear theories wu et al 1997 chen et al 2003 2006 lee et al 2016 as for the structural part vlfs is frequently simplified as a floating beam or a floating plate model and hydroelastic formulations have been developed through the application of the strip theory and green s function method fu et al 2007 in order to reduce computational effort and time hydroelastic analysis is commonly carried out in the frequency domain by assuming a linear response two main numerical methods have been developed to implement the frequency domain analysis direct method and mode superposition method in the direct method one solves the equation of motion directly with all nodes of the discretized structural system namba and ohkusu 1999 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 taylor 2007 ohkusu and namba 2004 kim et al 2007 the mode superposition method introduces the generalized flexible modes apart from six rigid body modes to describe the structural deformations and decomposes the hydroelastic problem into diffraction and radiation problems for each mode wu et al 1995 senjanovic et al 2008 the generalized flexible modes require the determination of corresponding mode shapes of vlfs which can be achieved through either analytical modal functions or fem eigenvalue analysis the mode superposition method can be further divided into wet mode loukogeorgaki et al 2012 and dry mode fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 approaches depending on whether the surrounding fluid effect added mass and hydrostatic gravitational stiffness is taken into account in the calculation of vlfs mode shapes it is noted that the utilization of analytical modal functions is considered as a dry mode approach while the fem eigenvalue analysis can be applied in either the dry mode approach riggs et al 2000 fu et al 2005 senjanovic et al 2008a 2008b or the wet mode approach michailides et al 2013 when nonlinear characteristics of the fluid and structure are taken into consideration or when transient responses are of concern the frequency domain analysis is not applicable under such circumstances the time domain approach is necessary for solution but it requires intensive computational costs feng and bai 2017 nematbakhsh et al 2017 commonly used approaches for the time domain analysis of vlfs includes the direct integration method watanabe et al 1998 liu and sakai 2002 and the fourier transform method kashiwagi 2000 2004 endo 2000 ohmatsu 2005 wu and cui 2009 elucidated various 3d hydroelasticity theories ranging from linear frequency domain analyses to nonlinear time domain analyses comparisons between frequency domain and time domain solutions indicated that discrepancies exist for the case of anti symmetric responses where time domain analyses agree better with experimental measurements kim et al 2009 in practice vlfs are usually constructed by connecting multiple standardized modules with connector systems from the viewpoints of easy construction transportation and deployment watanabe et al 2004 the effect of both flexibility of the structure and the existence of the connectors should be considered to properly evaluate the hydroelastic performance of interconnected multi modular vlfs both floating modules and connector systems can be modeled as either rigid or flexible including hinges in the hydroelastic analysis resulting in four main types of model rigid module and rigid connector rmrc rigid module and flexible connector rmfc flexible module and rigid connector fmrc and flexible module and flexible connector fmfc fu et al 2007 in particular rmfc model was used by many researchers to predict the hydroelastic responses of vlfs wang et al 1991 riggs and ertekin 1993 riggs et al 1999 wei et al 2017 2018 in the rmfc model it is assumed that only rigid displacements translation and rotation exist in the floating modules while the connectors would have flexible deformations and generate internal forces due to relative motion of the adjacent modules riggs et al 2000 compared the use of rmfc and fmfc models in hydroelastic analysis and found that the effect of module elasticity in the fmfc model can be reproduced in a rmfc model by changing the connection stiffness to match the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the two models to study hinge connected floating structures with the modal superposition method newman 1997 defined hinge rigid body modes to represent relative motions between floating modules when the direct method is employed translational and rotational stiffness are specified for connector systems at the continuity point of interconnected floating modules and structural mass and stiffness matrices are updated accordingly for simple hinge connections rotational stiffness is set to be zero in the past two decades the rmfc model has been adopted by many chinese researchers to predict hydrodynamic responses and connector loads of vlfs wang et al 2002 developed a time sequence analysis method based on the assumption of rigid modules and flexible connectors to study the linear wave induced response of mob yu et al 2003 2004 used rmfc model to study the dynamic responses of mob connectors and further investigate the effects of connector stiffness multiple modules interaction wave angles and sea states on the mob module motions and connector loads yu et al 2006a 2006b applied rmfc model to determine the hydrodynamic responses of the floating trestle in seawaters with finite depth which were further verified by comparing with spectrometric analysis result and the experimental test result liu et al 2014 further adopted the rmfc model to analyze the dynamic responses of connectors in vlfs with a shallow draft and concluded that the shallow water effect may increase relative motions between floating modules leading to a higher vertical connector load intensity experimental investigations related to interconnected floating modules based on scaled physical models are necessary to practically assess the overall performance and forces in the connector system and also to verify numerical analysis approaches diamantoulaki et al 2008 martinelli et al 2008 carried out 3d experimental tests on i shaped and j shaped floating modules connected with tie rods to study effects of module layout and wave obliqueness on the effectiveness of floating breakwaters peña et al 2011 and ferreras et al 2014 implemented experimental investigations on π type floating modules that are connected with flexible connectors steel cables through cylindrical neoprene to explore the connectors forces of vlfs including horizontal and vertical shear forces and associated moments loukogeorgaki et al 2014 performed 3d experimental tests on an array of multiple floating box type modules connected with flexible connectors coated wire rope to assess connectors internal forces under the action of both regular and irregular perpendicular and oblique incident waves ding et al 2019 performed model tests on a 3 module vlfs and an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs in two simulated shallow sea regions to investigate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs deployed near islands and reefs in shallow sea the aforementioned physical model studies effectively evaluate the influences of module geometries environmental conditions and connection types on structural responses and connecting forces and also helps to verify analytical and numerical solutions 3 2 hydroelastic responses vlfs is required to satisfy the functional and operational requirements in practice such as tolerance on the structure motions and structural internal forces all these criteria are directly related to the hydroelastic response and it is desirable to reduce the response magnitude as much as possible to ensure the safety and serviceability of vlfs many research studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of the connector characteristics on the hydroelastic response of vlfs considering either hinge type connectors lee and newman 2000 xia et al 2000 or flexible connectors fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 the main responses discussed herein are i vertical deflections and ii internal forces lee and newman 2000 and teng et al 2014 investigated rigid floating modules inter connected with hinge connectors while yoon et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 evaluated the performance of flexible floating modules connected with hinged joints fig 9 shows dimensionless vertical deflection and bending moments of floating plate structures with multiple hinge connections obtained by yoon et al 2014 who used the hybrid bem fem method as the number of hinge connections increases vertical deflections in the floating plate increase and peak values occur at hinge connections while bending moments reduce in general and maximum values locate around the centre between adjacent hinges note that maximum moment of single hinge plate is larger than that of the monolithic plate indicating that the use of hinge connections is not always beneficial in reducing the maximum bending moment riggs et al 2000 implemented hydroelastic analysis of vlfs consisting of rigid modules interconnected with flexible connectors while fu et al 2007 used 3d linear hydroelastic theory to predict the response of flexible floating modules interconnected with flexible connectors fig 10 presents vertical deflection profiles and bending moments of a flexible floating plate interconnected with flexible connectors for different rotational stiffness k rot riggs et al 2000 in the figure w represents the calculated deflection value while symbol a in the y axis indicates wave amplitude where a h 2 and h is the wave height it is seen that the vertical displacement amplitude decreases as the rotational stiffness increases and the deflection profile of the floating plate interconnected with stiffer connectors approaches the experimental results of continuous structures also the rotational stiffness of the connector system has a greater effect on the regions near the connector in terms of bending moments the value at the connector system gradually decreases to zero as the rotational stiffness reduces on the other hand the bending moment within the upstream and downstream modules will increase slightly xia et al 2000 evaluated the hydroelastic behaviour of articulated plates interconnected with vertical and rotational springs with a variation of stiffness value from zero to infinity that represent welded joints during the assembling process the displacement at the connectors is found to be larger than that on the plate and an increase in the spring stiffness is favorable in reducing the connector motions the bending moments and shear forces at the connectors are independent of the stiffness of the vertical and rotational springs respectively in the aforementioned studies the number and stiffness values of connections are artificially specified by researchers wang et al 2009 and riyansyah et al 2010 proposed the use of a compliance parameter χ defined in equation 1 in determining the optimal rotational stiffness parameter ξ and number of semi rigid connectors n to minimize the hydroelastic responses of longish vlfs a minimum value of compliance parameter is desirable and it is equivalent to a stiff beam acting against wave action 1 χ 1 a ρ l l 2 l 2 p w d x where a is the wave amplitude ρ the mass density of water l the floating beam length p the hydrodynamic pressure and w the deflection of the floating beam fig 11 compares hydroelastic responses of floating beams with multiple optimally designed semi rigid connections and with rigid connections semi rigid connections with appropriate stiffness and inserted at suitable locations are found to be more effective in reducing the vertical displacement as compared with rigid or hinge connections the compliance parameter was observed to reduce by using a moderate number of connector systems i e n 3 7 further increase in number of connections does not result in a significant reduction in the value of the compliance parameter 3 3 internal forces in connectors the structural integrity of vlfs under wave action strongly depends on the induced internal forces in the connectors up to now limited research studies had been carried out on the numerical evaluation of the internal forces and effects of various design parameters such as stiffness of connectors module layout shallow water effect and incident wave period kim et al 2007 liu et al 2014 michailides et al 2013 newman 1997 qi et al 2017a b yu et al 2003 2004 past research studies indicate that rigid connectors generally lead to high load intensity whilst the use of hinge connectors can effectively reduce the magnitude of connecting forces gao et al 2011 2013 dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 2019 2021 therefore connector systems with a certain degree of flexibility are usually adopted in designs of vlfs specifically newman 1997 computed the shear forces acting on the hinge connectors of floating structures and analyzed the influence of the number of floating modules on the forces in hinge connectors on the other hand kim et al 2007 evaluated the bending moments and the shear forces at flexible connections of vlfs assembled of modules and concluded that the internal forces in connectors of side by side arranged vlfs modules generally increase as the connection stiffness and heading angle increase qi et al 2017a b studied the relationship between the connector load and rigidity by computing the dynamic responses of flexible connectors in a vlfs with different combinations of transverse longitudinal and vertical rigidities analysis results show that whether the transverse rigidity is high or low there exists a combination of longitudinal and vertical rigidity that results in the peak connector load zhao et al 2019 further provided optimal stiffness values in three directions of flexible connectors for multi modular floating systems in different sea conditions apart from the connector stiffness incident wave characteristics also cause significant effects on connector forces of vlfs yu et al 2003 2004 conducted numerical analyses of mob connector loads on the basis of a rmfc model the results indicate that the longitudinal connector loads are much larger than the lateral and vertical loads besides the wave headings significantly affected the forces between modules and the longitudinal load of the connector reached its maximum with a 75 wave direction it is suggested to keep the angle between the mob and wave direction less than 45 and to avoid unrealistically large connector loads ding et al 2019 performed a model test on an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs with specified connector stiffness of 4 60 106 n m 6 55 106 n m and 9 78 106 n m in three directions fig 12 presents the variations of connecting forces along the length of the vlfs model from connectors c1 c3 to c13 three frequencies representing short medium and long regular waves that is 0 897 rad s t 7 s 0 483 rad s t 13 s and 0 209 rad s t 30 s were considered the distribution of internal forces is significantly dependent on the frequency of incoming waves axial forces f x for connectors in the middle of the longish vlfs are generally greater than those at the two end parts but no consistent pattern is observed for shear forces f y loukogeorgaki et al 2014 implemented 3d experiments to assess the internal forces in connectors of multiple floating box type modules with flexible connectors under wave actions of different characteristics wave obliquity wave period and wave height fig 13 shows the variation of internal forces with the change of incident wave frequency and wave steepness test results showed that the wave obliquity and wave height affect forces mainly in the low frequency range 6 rad s ω 9 rad s contrary to ding s findings it is seen from fig 13 that the increase in incident wave frequency generally leads to the decrease in axial and shear forces which may attribute to a relatively higher wave frequency and a shorter structural length besides the increase in incident wave steepness h l results in the increase of these forces especially in the low frequency range for the same wave height and period the increase of wave obliquity from 60 to 90 leads to a decrease in internal forces resulting in a more efficient floating structure in terms of both functionality and structural integrity most research studies were conducted on vlfs with modules connected in the transverse direction only michailides et al 2013 considered vlfs consisting of a grid of floating modules flexibly connected in two directions and identified the optimal module layout and connectors rotational stiffness fig 14 presents the variation of connector internal forces as a function of incident wave frequencies for a 3 3 grid type floating structure with wave angle β 0 the increase in connector rotational stiffness from k r1 and k r2 to k r3 results in a decrease of the peak axial forces and shear forces additionally a larger rotational stiffness k r3 leads to larger moments in x direction m y xc fig 15 compares the axial forces in x direction f x xc as a function of incident wave frequency for different module layout and various rotational stiffness values the change of the module number and layout directly affects connectors internal loads specifically a 1 2 grid structure has the largest maximum axial force f x xc compared to structures with other grid layouts for all cases the axial forces f x xc was the same and small regardless of connector stiffness when the incident wave frequency ω 2 72 rad s to further investigate the application of a combination of hinge and rigid connectors in floating structures and their effects on the connector forces a comprehensive experimental model test program was conducted by the authors at the national university of singapore nus hydraulics laboratory fig 16 a shows three floating module layouts tested in the wave basin including one line system 2 4 grid system and 3 3 grid system in the one line system two proposed connector types rigid or hinge were applied for the outermost connector similarly rigid and hinge connector systems were explored in 2 4 and 3 3 grid module layouts as described in fig 16a note that the first two modules in the one line system served as a floating bridge to connect the longish floating structure with the onshore quay boundary fig 16 b d presents the maximum bending moments of three module layouts under 100 year irregular wave with a heading angle of 0 in general the moments can be effectively reduced with the use of hinge connectors especially for 2 4 and 3 3 grid systems however the motions of the hinge connected systems were relatively larger thus a trade off needs to be considered between connecting loads and structural motions in the design of connector system in addition a longish vlfs one line system may sustain larger connecting forces compared to the floating structure with smaller length to width ratios that is 2 4 and 3 3 grid systems liu et al 2014 studied the shallow water effect on the dynamic characteristics of connectors it shows that the vertical connector load tends to be amplified for a vlfs with a shallow draft which should be considered in the engineering design practice gu et al 2015 used the time domain method to determine the connector loads for a vlfs under the combined action of wave loads and ship impact loads under impact loads high frequency oscillations in the time history curve of the connector load are observed under different wave headings the maximum magnitude of the connector load is found to occur in the x direction an oscillatory connector load is observed in the y direction with a wave heading of 75 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 determination of connector stiffness assessment of hydroelastic responses combined with determination of connector forces represents a key element towards an integrated design of vlfs based on extensive review work presented above it is concluded that various factors significantly affect the performance of vlfs in terms of operational design requirements and structural integrity these include the variation in connector stiffness geometrical dimensions and grid type of floating structures and wave field characteristics that is wave obliquity wave period wave height etc of which the connection stiffness is particularly important in general the use of rigid connector systems induces relatively smaller structural motions but extremely higher internal loads when compared to hinge connectors to achieve a balance between load and motion responses flexible connectors that utilize compliant materials such as rubber spring and cable have been used in practice however this results in complex connector system and design and raises difficulties in quantifying the stiffness accurately apart from referring it as a semi rigid connector system meanwhile in the evaluation of hydroelastic responses and connecting forces in vlfs with flexible connectors researchers usually artificially specify the translational and rotational stiffness from zero to infinity regardless of their feasibility of the connector system under such circumstances there is a gap between the results of hydroelasticity research and the development of practical connector systems as part of critical design variables of vlfs connector characteristics should be defined and selected to satisfy the design objective and operational requirements experimental test is an effective way to determine the actual stiffness of a practical vlfs connector system via the load deformation relationship china ship scientific research center has conducted extensive experimental research studies on the strength and behavior of various practical connector systems qi et al 2015 designed a flexible connector system for vlfs with a shallow draft which is composed of 5 ball and spring devices 2 devices in the x direction 2 devices in the z direction and 1 device in the y direction as shown in fig 17 comprehensive static and dynamic load tests were performed to study the rigidity and evaluate the structural safety of the connector design test results indicated that the relationship between load and deformation of the flexible connector system remains in the linear range during the test from which the stiffness value can be obtained besides different load combinations may result in uneven deformations in the two ball and spring devices in the x direction which requires special attention in the design song 2018 introduced several conceptual designs of connector systems for modular vlfs and provided preliminary design drawings for one type of flexible connector zhang et al 2019 explored the use of nylon and rubber materials in the design of a flexible connector mechanical properties of the connector system were determined from experimental tests from which a nonlinear relationship between the load and displacement was observed the stiffness characteristics and stress magnitudes are found to be significantly influenced by nylon and rubber material properties which needs to be optimized in the engineering design practice zhang et al 2019 analyzed the mechanical property of an integrated case typed connector with double module platform as shown in fig 18 the contact relationship between the connector steel shaft and shaft block were established based on the model test and finite element analysis also the connector s stress distribution and ultimate strength were analyzed and the stiffness was determined in the case that the test data of vlfs connector is unavailable engineers are required to use reasonable stiffness values in the design fig 19 shows the flow chart proposed by the authors to determine the connector stiffness for practical designs the process includes two main parts hydroelastic analysis and structural analysis first the connector stiffness values are assumed according to its characteristics for instance the rotational stiffness can be set as a large value for near rigid connectors whereas it should be set small for near hinge connectors for the translational stiffness zhao et al 2019 has studied the optimal stiffness layout of modularized floating structures using genetic algorithm based approach and concluded that the stiffness along the surge motion should be designed relatively soft while the stiffness along the sway and heave motions should be designed relatively hard against shear load the suggested optimized stiffness in three directions are k x 106 n m k y 1011 n m and k z 1011 n m where x y and z represent surge sway and heave respectively which can be used as initial values if no other information is available with the assumed connector stiffness and in conjunction with wave field characteristics and structural geometry information the hydroelastic analysis can be performed on the vlfs to obtain the connector internal forces next a detailed finite element model of the connector systems needs to be established to perform the deformation analysis with the inputs of connector geometries material properties and connecting forces the relations between the loading and deformation response are obtained from which the connector stiffness can be inferred if this differs from the initial assumed value the hydroelastic analysis will be carried out for a second round with the obtained stiffness and the iteration ends when the stiffnesses converge shi et al 2018 claimed that the connector stiffness is related to connecting forces and material nonlinearity thus several rounds may be needed in the iterative procedure to finalize the actual stiffness values as the by product the strength analysis can also be carried out using the detailed finite element model to check the safety of the connector design under maximum internal loads 3 4 2 fatigue strength connector systems of vlfs are subjected to repeated loading conditions throughout the service life due to the cyclic nature of environmental loads which may result in serious fatigue problems although extensive research studies on fatigue analysis and design of marine structures have been conducted very limited literature were found on fatigue behavior of connector systems specifically lotsberg i 2016 ramsamooj et al 2001 2002 developed an analytical model to predict the fracture based fatigue life of vlfs connectors under random wave actions in the marine environment besides a performance function is further defined in terms of the material properties nominal stress range and inherent defect or starter crack to perform the reliability based design analysis of the fatigue life of the connectors in mob the reliability calculations indicated that relatively lower stress values should be used in the design to meet the fatigue life target reliability level wang et al 2009 predicted the fatigue behavior of the connectors in a floating bridge with employing the local stress strain approach it is revealed that the ultimate tensile strength and the sequence of the dynamic loads may significantly influence the fatigue damage of the connectors more research studies are expected to ensure the safety and economical design of connector systems for vlfs in the absence of sufficient research activities performed overseas the fatigue strength of connector systems in vlfs was significantly studied by the china ship scientific research center in recent years liu 2014 utilized the s n curve method and theory of fracture mechanics to predict the fatigue life of a connector system seven s n curves were considered and the effects of wave angles and sea states on the fatigue damage were analyzed single stage paris law and two stage paris law were adopted to calculate the fatigue life of connectors with an initial crack of thirty different sets of sizes and shapes it is concluded that smaller initial cracks generally lead to slower crack growth speed and longer fatigue life of the connectors qi et al 2017a b conducted a model test of a hinge connector consisting of a nylon sandwich and a pipe shaft strengthened by circular frames to evaluate the fatigue strength and structural stresses of the connector as shown in fig 20 the fatigue life was evaluated based on theory of the s n curve and crack propagation separately the fatigue life and fatigue strength are found to be significantly affected by the load magnitude and wave angle zhao et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the ultimate strength of the vlfs connector foundation support reinforcing area structure under complex loads as shown in fig 21 plastic hinges were observed in the model when subjected to large combined vertical and longitudinal loads therefore the material nonlinearity may be important and should be considered in the analysis and design of connector systems for vlfs 3 4 3 active control connector system since the structural responses and connector forces of modularized vlfs are significantly affected by connector stiffness xia et al 2016 proposed a special active control connector system with air springs the connector stiffness could be adjusted along with the evolution of wave conditions by changing the air pressure inside the air spring to reduce the oscillation of floating structures fig 22 a presents adjacent floating modules connected with two parallel air springs where symbols δ1 and δ2 represent respectively the initial horizontal and vertical distances between two modules the air spring configuration is shown in fig 22b an in outlet is reserved for inflating or deflating the air spring and rubber bumper is used to cushion the hard impact due to extreme motion although the stiffness of connector can be altered by changing the air pressure it is still difficult to accurately quantify the stiffness for practical design moreover this special active control connector system is also limited in terms of timeliness and complexity of the sensor signal transmission 3 4 4 materials design of connector system connector systems for vlfs can be designed with different materials such as steel concrete and composites the selection of appropriate materials relates to their own strength and advantages functional requirements and application scenarios of floating structures considering its good mechanical properties and light weight steel is suitable for connector systems in medium scale floating structures that need to be transported from place to place such as military pontoons barges and causeways on the other hand concrete is resistant to seawater and keeps maintenance costs low making it more attractive for connections in large permanent floating structures like breakwaters piers and jetties in a seawater environment a sophisticated connector system can be made of various materials to meet different requirements in practice conventional materials steel and concrete are commonly used for critical stiff components to ensure the structural integrity of vlfs once adjacent floating modules are joined rubber and foam are preferable for flexible components of the connector system to withstand impact loading and absorb kinetic energy of the moving modules which can effectively dampen and gently decelerate the motion in a sense the use of the aforementioned two types of materials with distinctive mechanical properties fulfill two contradicting requirements on the elasticity and rigidity of the connector system additionally steel cables or springs are occasionally used in the connection design to withstand axial tensile forces fibre reinforced polymer frp has been increasingly used in a variety of structures in the severe environments frp materials exhibit a linear elastic behavior under tensile loading up to failure without showing any plastic behavior owning higher tensile strength but lower young s modulus than conventional steel in general carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp shows more favorable behaviors in terms of mechanical characteristics chloride resistance and anti moisture compared to frps manufactured of other materials such as glass aramid and basalt sen et al 1998a b although no existing literature reported the use of cfrp in the connector system for vlfs cfrp is a preferable substitute for the stiff component steel block and flexible component steel cable for anti corrosion purposes specifically elsafty et al 2014 evaluated the characteristics of prestressing carbon fiber composite cables cfcc in severe environment and concluded that cfcc showed excellent performance maintaining very high guaranteed tensile strength retention and elastic modulus retention after conditioning for over 7000 h in an alkaline solution pantelides et al 2003 reported that cfrp composites with their superior strength and resistance to electrochemical corrosion are a practical alternative for connecting precast concrete members in building structures it is worth mentioning that mechanical properties strength and stiffness of frp decrease significantly with the increase of temperature fried 1995 therefore the use of frp may not be suitable where high temperature is of concern durable connector systems that require less intrusive maintenance are highly desirable because it would exhibit longer life spans and thus maximize the use of the vlfs in the seawater environment ultrahigh performance concrete uhpc has roused great interests in the past decades due to its advantageous material properties such as high strength low permeability to water and chemical substance good chloride penetration resistance which is believed to have a broader application prospect in marine environments li et al 2020 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 similar as an frp material uhpc has not been applied in the connector system for vlfs at the current stage however this new advanced cementitious composite material has been widely used in the design and construction of connections for concrete bridge superstructures graybeal 2010 investigated the structural behavior of field cast uhpc connections for modular bridge deck components via static and cyclic loading tests and better performances were demonstrated than those of a conventional cast in place bridge deck in canada 42 adjacent box girder bridges were constructed with uhpc shear keys since 2008 rahman and mcquaker 2016 yuan and graybeal 2016 conducted full scale tests on the uhpc joints when subjected to over 1 million load structural cycles and 10 thermal load cycles and research results shown an enhanced strength of the connection filled with uhpc based on the experience in bridge engineering uhpc can be a competitive material for the design of the stiff component concrete block in connector systems for vlfs 4 concluding remarks in the next decade and beyond we shall witness the construction of very large and sustainable floating platforms near congested coastal cities to create space on the adjacent water bodies for urban expansion with the adoption of modular prefabricated construction approach for vlfs the design and manufacturing of effective connector systems and careful construction control to safely connect segments on the sea is needed a literature review on research and development in connector systems for modularized vlfs is presented key findings potential design issues and suggestions for practice are summarized as follows 1 connector systems are categorized into cable tensioning connector hinge clicking connector and tooth anchoring connector by combining the tooth anchoring and cable tensioning technologies a new design of connector system pcskc is developed and presented herein for easy installation and stiffness adjustment 2 the effect of both flexibility of the structure and the existence of the connectors should be considered to properly evaluate hydroelastic performance of modularized vlfs both floating modules and connector systems may be modeled as either rigid or flexible resulting in four types of model rmrc rmfc fmrc and fmfc in particular rmfc model was widely used to predict the hydroelastic responses of vlfs considering the flexibility of the connector system 3 rigid connectors generally lead to high internal forces whilst hinge connectors can effectively reduce the connector forces semi rigid connectors with appropriate stiffness and installed at suitable locations are found to be more effective in reducing structural responses when compared to fully rigid or hinge connections besides connector stiffness geometrical dimensions grid type and wave field characteristics also affect the magnitude of connector forces significantly hydroelastic analyses are required to assess the internal forces accounting for these parameters 4 the stiffness of the flexible connector is of upmost importance because it seriously affects the connector loads and dynamics of the floating platform to address the inconsistency in the determination of connector stiffness between hydroelasticity research and development of practical connector systems an iterative procedure is proposed herein to determine the actual stiffness of connector systems using both hydroelastic analysis and finite element structural analysis 5 current methods of analysis involve complicated mathematical models and techniques which are difficult to use simplified methods of analysis and models are in dire need for design practice besides more research studies need to be carried out on the fatigue behaviour of connector systems for vlfs to ensure the safety and economical design in the engineering practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

20679,this study analyzes the energy efficiency of ships based on iso 19030 which is a standard for the measurement of changes in hull and propeller performance the goal is to provide energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided the ship navigation information platform snip is developed to determine the dynamic information of each ship including the fuel consumption ship speed horsepower of the engine rotation speed of the engine wind direction and wind speed in addition model test data and computational fluid dynamics cfd calculation data are applied to calculate the energy efficiency performance indicators finally the relationship of the speed through water and the speed over ground enables us to modify the effects of the ocean currents the results verify that these indicators can be used as a reference for performance monitoring and maintenance prediction of international maritime affairs keywords energy efficiency management iso 19030 hull and propeller maintenance 1 introduction with the emergence of the concept of smart ships and the ever growing development of electronic technology for ships analysis of ships big data has become a general trend in global shipping coraddu et al 2019 cristea et al 2017 latifov 2019 zhang et al 2019 domestic shipping companies recently have been attempting to introduce intelligent ship management systems which are developed overseas to analyze the navigational attitude loading conditions engine room and sea meteorological information during navigation of a ship to make suggestions about the navigational attitude speed and sailing route of the ship to reduce fuel consumption and operating costs however a ship in operation involves a wide range of big data including the navigation status hull engine room energy efficiency management and cargo management these data together with marine meteorological and ocean current information form a complete data linkage and correspond to different analytical indicators moreover the aforementioned data come from various sources and contain diverse data dimensions densities and structures so different data correction methods are needed data analysis has driven automation and smart applications and has further promoted industrial evolution it is available for many different roles in the maritime industry such as shipyards shipowners and shipping companies this analysis helps them manage their fleets in a more efficient and safer way 1 1 marine big data analytics for ship performance monitoring analyzing the big data of a ship during navigation can be used to reduce fuel consumption and send an early warning about changes in the ship s conditions in addition to maintaining the high navigation efficiency of ships we also hope to achieve certain goals such as maintenance prediction reducing man made improper operations controlling fuel consumption to reduce costs and most importantly increasing profits big data analytics mishra and datta gupta 2017 are related to data in large volumes of different varieties and at high velocities because the manual daily reports for a ship are replaced with the data directly obtained from the machinery the data diversity is changed from several times per day to several seconds the theory of the performance indicator is to compare the actual navigation data with the expected benchmark index there are two sources of navigation data for the performance baseline a baseline calibration of the model which is built using actual navigation data coraddu et al 2019 and a model to simulate the efficiency of navigation which is built using full scale cfd orihara and tsujimoto 2018 then we can compare the navigating performance between the continuous navigation and the baseline performance in the domain of ship energy performance we must consider reasonable methods to filter or average the pike values because the acceleration and power of a ship quickly increases or decreases thus the data driven modeling will use statistical techniques to mine data to discover the analysis patterns in multivariate datasets research analyzing ship performance in actual seas may be summarized in three types of methods carchen et al 2019 1 data driven methods these methods usually use artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms coraddu et al 2019 parkes et al 2018 petersen et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and do not require domain knowledge of physical ship phenomena all data manipulation and statistical analysis are entirely carried out by computers using self learning algorithms a large number of samples are provided to build the models and limit the applications 2 deterministic methods these methods examine the speed performance of ships by utilizing resistance and propulsion characteristics the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd models choi et al 2010 model testing open water testing sea trials and analysis of the long term data of ships to build the baseline performance 3 hybrid methods these methods use general physical parameters to evaluate efficient shipping operations trodden et al 2015 holtrop regression is a general approach for determining ship resistance based on the speed resistance and some characteristics of ships holtrop 1984 1988 holtrop and mennen 1982 rakke 2016 we can blend the presented data driven methods to refine the models of hybrid methods by historical onboard measurements coraddu et al 2017 more numerical features i e fuel consumption speed trim power draft heeling and headwind support the model testing performance soner et al 2018 then the performance is predicted and validated through a comparison with onboard monitored data orihara and tsujimoto 2018 tsujimoto and orihara 2018 iso 19030 iso 2016a is a practical method for hull and propeller performance monitoring it measures how much power is required to move a ship through water at a given speed draft and wind condition cetena becchi 2019 described a complete application framework based on iso 19030 the standard shows four performance indicators for dry docking performance in service performance maintenance trigger and maintenance effect ship owners and operators can compare hull and propeller performance by analyzing the operational data of ships to calculate the performance indicators and then select the most efficient options for their vessels following the standard the two major implementation priorities of this study are as follows 1 smart shipping the constructed information platform is used to understand and control the dynamic information of each ship for the purpose of assisting domestic shipping companies in analyzing their business decision making 2 energy management for ships a solution is expected to be proposed that not only applies professional knowledge improves fuel consumption and reduces carbon dioxide emissions but also moves toward a low carbon footprint green energy and energy conservation by exploring correlation factors through big data analysis compared with the energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi tran 2017 iso 19030 takes the physical factors of actual ship navigation into consideration and has remarkable accuracy compared with iso 15016 both standards are similar with respect to wind resistance iso 19030 has detailed processes based on anemometer data from ships there are no practical means to measure wave parameters that are not available and theoretical methods require more detailed ship geometry data owing to the need for more time for wave calculation for wave resistance iso 19030 recommends that the data used for evaluation of performance in calm seas should be extracted under wind speed conditions less than 7 9 m s octarvia s project in japan focuses on the increasing rate of resistance due to taking winds and waves as candidate parameters for filtering the increasing rate of resistance is expected to be applied irrespective of ship size since it is a relative parameter representing the extent of weather effects accurate wave data are provided by the japan weather association and the effect of waves is investigated the rate of resistance is estimated in accordance with iso 15016 sogihara et al 2019 similar research topics are also applied in korea to modify the resistance based on weather service data using iso 15016 park s research supports filtering the data when the rudder angle is larger than 5 park 2019 in this study we find that it is necessary to observe the changes in the rudder angles of a ship in contrast to current research this research is intended to provide a more practical method based on previous studies filtering is too loose for a ship with a stable rudder angle for a ship with a large rudder angle using the standard deviation can preclude most of the data from being filtered out at certain angles therefore a research procedure must reasonably consider the amount of data evaluated for determining the navigation characteristics of each ship 1 2 outline this paper studies the changes in the energy efficiency of the hulls of three ships before and after maintenance then it provides a reference for the energy efficiency management of a shipping company by observing the energy efficiency performance of each ship during this period the framework of the ship navigation information platform snip is described in section 2 we apply a new practice area of iso 19030 by relating a performance indicator the speed through water and the speed over ground the analysis procedure is described in section 3 determining how to analyze the indicators of operational ships by applying the methods and demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness based on snip are described in section 4 finally future work is described in the conclusion 2 integrated ship navigation information platform this study develops the integrated snip for ship efficiency assessment seven container ships have currently installed the platform three selected ships are analyzed based on their more adequate data volumes the principal particulars of the ships are shown in table 1 ship a is 8000 teu and ships b and c are the next generation of ship a fig 1 portrays the framework of the snip whose infrastructure includes three modules to send and read the operational data 1 onboard server a data acquisition module which is usually an autonomous industrial embedded computer to connect the sensors and machines of the ship to collect the operational data for the server on the intranet of the ship as shown in the left side figure the major data are collected from the alarm management system ams voyage data recorder vdr mass flow meter mfm and horsepower meter to determine the dynamic information of each ship including fuel consumption ship speed horsepower of the engine rotation speed of the engine wind direction wind speed etc a manual daily report mnl is applied to check the data correction and collect import issues from the chief officer and engineer into the system then the collected data from each ship are transported by the tcp socket protocol michael j and kenneth l 2009 to an onshore databank server via communication tools using the international maritime satellite inmarsat at sea or 4g wireless communication service in port these data are compressed and separated to a small sized file based on the format of the post office protocol 2 onshore server a server with four parts file storage email database and web server first a file storage server must have a good firewall to isolate the issues of network security the server enables the user to save the received raw data of ship navigation through a customized email server receive these data packets and subsequently combine and decompress these data this mechanism can ensure that information is transmitted with extremely high efficiency and extremely small data size when a partial data leak occurs it can be guaranteed that the data cannot be interpreted as a complete picture which will not cause doubts about the security from ship owners in addition meteorological data basic ship information model test data and cfd calculation data are collected based on iso 19030 the overall data can be downloaded using the ftp protocol second a customized service program supports the data process based on iso 19030 and the database is created with a relational data structure queried by structured query language sql third these data can be used through the integrated web server according to the security policy and subsequently shared with users who have access rights through the big data sharing system the main computing resource is used for the cfd calculation including 4 cluster computers 96 cores based on the architecture of the general high performance computing hpc hager and wellein 2010 which are connected by the infiniband network huang et al 2006 the remaining computing requirements can be completed on a workstation 24 cores 3 client interface a data repeater console to load the collected data for display in visual and graphic forms by a web browser the collected data include the sailing conditions in the pilothouse and detailed energy generation aspects in the engine room in this study integrating the information of these two regions for data analysis is the main purpose of the snip the r language is the main development tool fig 2 shows an example of the web styles for the visual data and graphic the details of the calculation are described in section 3 the items include the query condition settings in the left column of the figure and various charts in the right column of the figure such as the wind direction wind speed distribution main engine rotational speed main engine power profile classification of abnormal events in the ams relationship diagram of the ship speed power performance indicators of iso 19030 and sailing path diagram 3 measurement of the hull and propeller performance iso 19030 specifies a practical method to measure changes in the specific hull and propeller performance of a ship fig 3 a shows the main processes data preprocessing to obtain the common time period in different data sources sampling for a stable and single navigation status and screening data for outliers wind speed correction for the horsepower and calculating four performance indicators power increasing indicator p d speed loss indicator v d specific fuel oil consumption indicator s f o c d and torque coefficient indicator k q d v d and p d show the overall energy performance compared to the cfd benchmark because cfd includes three main parameters draft trim and speed the data preprocessing is designed to sample each single navigation status then we can compare the performance with each cfd result s f o c d shows the mass of consumed fuel oil compared to the reference sfoc curve of the main engine k q d shows the propeller performance compared to the open water test because the speed through water stw and speed over ground sog are affected by complex environmental factors the difference between these two variables is currently difficult to quantify we apply a new practice area named the key performance indicator kpi in the scatter diagram of the kpi both horizontal axis stw sog 1 and vertical axis indicator p d v d or s f o c d are value axes that plot numeric data for each indicator and stw sog 1 we build a relationship using the linear regression the kpi also shows the average value for an indicator and complicated navigation condition based on the parameter stw sog stw sog 1 indicates that there is an implied resistance a value close to the origin indicates a reduction of the resistance or a boost of the downstream flow finally these indicators of all navigations and the maintenance events are listed to support the advanced analysis in section 4 3 1 data preprocessing and sampling the main columns of the database are shown in table 2 after the detection is completed for all sample time data the abnormal value data points are deleted and each candidate segment data is saved then we filter the data based on the iso 19030 commands according to chauvenet s criterion iso 2016b a datum is considered an outlier and the acceptable probability of the mean is defined as 1 p 1 1 2n where p is the probability of the mean and n is the number of samples the standard divides the sample time into blocks of 10 min and recommends that an acceptable period navigation should have at least half of the data in this study all original data are averaged at 5 min intervals then the calculated performance indicators are averaged at one hourly intervals for a faster query speed after the data cleaning we can confirm the data correction and the three types of data sources ams vdr mfm should have identical time periods for each voyage then the preprocessing to obtain a common time period of a stable navigation is shown in fig 3 b c 1 check that no data is missing based on the columns in table 2 2 make the data consistent among ams vdr and mnl for the stw and shaft horsepower because the sampling time of each device is different we use vdr data to align the data from different data sources to create this relational data table we have found that the time zones of different devices are not synchronized and result in irrelevant data 3 determine that the datum is a stable navigation it is a loop judgment using the draft parameter until the system can identify a stable segment between the start and end navigation time for the target data as shown in fig 3 c the top figure shows the draft distribution and highlights the identified segment the criteria of the draft variation are within 0 5 m since the draft gauge is a barometric sensor the crews only operates the updated action when the draft of the ship has significantly changed therefore the update rate for the draft is low and can be used as the first screening condition to obtain a stable voyage data as shown in the top part of fig 3 c four parameters are used to filter a single condition sailing the rudder angle main engine me rotational speed stw and sog then substandard data points are deleted after the standard deviation detection is performed for all sample time data the threshold values for the standard deviation sd are me rpm 3 min 1 speed through water stw 0 5 knots speed over ground sog 0 5 knots rudder angle 1 the bottom part of fig 3 c shows the secondary filter results using the threshold of the rpm 3 2 wind resistance the wind resistance especially the impact caused by different wind heights and different ship types is a difficult factor to quantify in iso 19030 the effects of the vessel heading and wind direction are basically considered however the hull shape and superstructures must be very carefully assessed for some ship types generally container ships have similar superstructures but the differences have not been explored in this study iso19030 for the wind resistance is continued for further wind evaluation one can reference the study of carchen et al 2019 the purpose of wind velocity correction is to convert the influence to a windless condition i e the relative wind velocity on the ship is the velocity of the wind with the height about ground and the horsepower is corrected for different wind velocity conditions full ranges of drag coefficients related wind areas and heights of the wind flowmeter are needed the true wind velocity which includes the angle of the wind and ship heading is calculated as follows iso 2016b 2 v w t v g 2 v w r 2 2 v g v w r cos ψ w r i f v w r cos ψ w r ψ v

increased horsepower due to the wind resistance is deducted to calculate the modified shp the actual delivery horsepower dhp which is modified from the measured shaft horsepower shp is the power delivered to and measured at the output shaft of the transmission and defined as follows 11 dhp shp η s where shp shaft horsepower kw η s shaft efficiency coefficient 0 98 considering no wind conditions the increased horsepower due to the wind resistance is deducted to calculate the modified dhp 12 dhp m dhp r a a v g η d where η d propulsive efficiency coefficient at the design speed including the hull efficiency in the ship model test and open water test and the propeller efficiency in the open water test the effective horse power ehp is related to actuate a ship including the hull and propeller efficiency in a model test to compare the performance of different ships the ehp is defined as follows 13 ehp m dhp m η d then the power increasing rate is expressed as follows 14 p d 100 ehp m ehp e ehp e where ehp m is measured based on the specific value of the speed draft and trim if ehp m ehp e p d is positive which indicates that the worse performance is to require more horsepower to achieve the same speed 3 4 speed loss indicator the speed loss indicator is defined as follows 15 v d 100 v w v e v e where v w speed through water stw v e speed reference data based on the draft trim and ehp by cfd if v w v e v d is positive the speed performance is better than the baseline value at the standard power requirement 3 5 sfoc increasing indicator the modification of the mass of consumed fuel oil by the main engine foc is expressed as follows 16 foc m foc lcv r lcv s where foc mass of consumed fuel oil by the main engine ton h lcv r lower calorific value of fuel oil kj kg lcv s sfoc reference curve kj kg the calculation of sfoc corrected by the engine room environment is expressed as follows 17 sfoc m 1000000 foc m shp 1 0 0002 1 t e 0 00002 1000 p e 0 0006 35 t s where sfoc m specific fuel oil consumption g kwh foc m fuel oil consumption ton h t e temperature of the main engine c p e pressure of the main engine mbar t s exhaust gas temperature c the sfoc performance indicator for sfoc loss is defined as follows 18 sfoc d 100 sfoc m sfoc e sfoc e where sfoc e reference sfoc of the main engine based on the parameters of the maximum continuous rating power mcr and shp 3 6 torque loss indicator the torque and torque coefficient kq are 19 q shp 2 π n and 20 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 where shp shaft horsepower kw n revolutions s 1 q torque knm ρ density of seawater kg m3 d p diameter of propeller m k q torque coefficient the torque performance indicator for the torque loss is defined as follows 21 10 k q d 100 10 k q 10 k q e 10 k q e where 10 k qe reference by open water tests 3 7 kpi indicator for the efficiency analysis iso 19030 recommends the use of the average method as the value of the reference key performance indicators kpi for p d and v d however from an average viewpoint it is not easy to see the numerical variation under identical sailing conditions so the linear regression is included to obtain a more stable kpi for v d p d and s f o c d v d in eq 15 is the main indicator v w is the real speed for a time period and v e is the estimated speed based on cfd using the real conditions of draft trim and ehp v d is the extent of ship speed loss because of the difference of two speed sources between stw and sog there are resistance factors that must be considered based on the relationship a smaller value of stw sog corresponds to less speed loss as shown in fig 7 a first we suppose that stw sog is the ideal situation as follows 22 v d v d v w v g 1 where v d is the modified v d according to the condition stw sog next the least square method can estimate the linear equation as 23 f x a 1 x a 0 x v w v g 1 where each x within a time period based on one sailing condition is the independent ratio variable and the corresponding value for a modified speed loss indicator is the dependent variable then a 0 is the kpi value for the evaluated indicator as shown in fig 7 b due to the impact of the cruise controls that only satisfy the minimum speed requirements by accelerating the filter of stw sog 1 is applied for sfoc as shown in fig 7 c v d s f o c d and stw sog 1 have similar distributions the calculations of sfoc d are also similar to that of v d in eqs 22 and 23 as shown in fig 7 d we find the distributions that have a scale factor and a negative correlation of p d and stw sog 1 as shown in fig 7 e a smaller value of stw sog corresponds to a larger power increasing indicator thus we suppose that stw equal to sog is the ideal situation as follows 24 p d p d c v w v g 1 where c is the slope p d v d in fig 6 c then fig 7 f shows the calculations of p d where the methods are similar to that of v d in eq 23 fig 7 b d and f represent the stable sailing conditions for the modified v d s f o c d and p d based on the condition of stw being equal to sog this drawing can provide an analysis that simultaneously considers both speed dimensions the ratio of kpi based on the fixed draft and speed is more suitable for analyzing the indicators in the same sailing state 4 results and discussion ship energy efficiency evaluation software is developed in snip and provides ship energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided in the past we pay attention to the changes in energy efficiency of the hull and propeller before and after maintenance fig 4 for the ships and observe the energy efficiency performance of each ship the results are provided to the shipping company as a reference for their energy efficiency management 4 1 case study 1 container ship a fig 5 show the distribution of the indicators for ship a from jul 2018 to feb 2020 the practice methodology is as follows for ship a 1 distributions of the overall performance all data are saved as row format data every 5 min by the navigation time the average data per hour are subsequently used and the standard deviation by the rudder angle is recorded fig 5 a shows the distributions of v d p d and sfoc d which are filtered by 1 standard deviation of the rudder angle for a long term voyage in principle one should pay attention to the areas of positive p d and negative v d fig 5 b shows that v d and p d have a highly linear correlation which indicates that the ship has excellent performance during this period when the condition of the ship worsens the curve will show an exponential growth and approach into the yellow area in the figure 2 calculations of the segment performance to compare v d and p d it is necessary to find a route segment where the draft depth and speed are similar from a preliminary analysis we find that there are certain values of the time interval between draft depth and rotation speed in fig 3 c the performance indicators of each navigation is summarized in table 3 according to the data of fig 5 we take the first voyage no 3 and voyage no 9 as examples the indicators of no 3 are used as the benchmark and no 9 shows the performance after maintenance we select a period of the relationship between the stable draft depth and the me rotation speed in period no 3 fig 6 a b show the filtered principal parameters to select the stable navigation of no 3 and no 9 fig 6 c shows that the positive correlation the correlation coefficient is 0 998 represents a single navigation attitude between speed and power fig 7 a c and e show the positive correlation between stw sog and these indicators fig 7 b d and f show the quantitative indicators of eq 23 for modified values of v d sfoc d and p d based on the condition of stw being equal to sog these figures show that as summarized in table 4 no 9 is similar to no 3 and no 9 has a better performance in these kpis than no 3 3 evaluation of the maintenance performance after searching for the route segments table 3 with similar operational parameters including the drafts rotational speeds rudder angle changes and navigation paths we determine that segments no 3 and no 9 satisfy the comparison conditions before and after the maintenance time of the ship the changes in rudder angles and navigation area must be as similar as possible so that we can more objectively compare different energy efficiency values table 4 shows the changes in energy efficiency of ship a before and after the hull paint was replaced in october 2018 no 3 and no 9 are extracted in table 4 and the gps speed and foc average are added we can observe that there are fewer negative values of v d which indicates that the speed loss has decreased fig 6 b shows the improved performance of the speed loss approximately 2 6 from 5 176 before maintenance to 2 572 after maintenance because the speed loss has decreased how much can the actual speed increase using the energy efficiency program to find the gps speeds of these two route segments we find that under the conditions of draft depth and speed the increase is approximately 0 09 kn hr from 18 5 kn hr before maintenance to 20 4 kn hr after maintenance the foc values of no 3 and no 9 in table 5 are not directly comparable due to different ship speeds we need to use the ascending relationship between the foc and the cubed speed to calculate the foc values suppose that all other conditions are the same if the speed becomes 20 4 kn hr then the foc theoretical value will become 102 20 4 18 5 3 136 hence we can infer from the statistics of no 9 that the foc theoretical value changed from 136 to 120 which is an approximately 11 decrease after maintenance when the speed was 20 4 kn hr the target segments show similar energy efficiency results using the reference indicators provided by the weather company as shown in fig 8 the data of periods no 3 and no 9 in fig 8 are similar to the data in table 4 the orange performance line fitted with the dots of period no 3 shows that the corresponding fuel consumption is 102 mt at a speed of 18 5 kn hr based on the blue performance line fitted with the dots of period no 9 the corresponding fuel consumption is 120 mt at a speed of 20 4 kn hr which is consistent with the data in table 4 the speed indeed improves after maintenance meanwhile if the speed is fixed at 20 4 kn hr the observed fuel consumption decreases from 136 mt before maintenance to 120 mt after maintenance i e the reduction ratios are notably similar therefore the results prove the reliability of the indicators 4 limitation and follow up studies the changes in rudder angles and navigation area must be as similar as possible so that we can more objectively compare different energy efficiency values limited by the amount of data more factors can be considered in advanced research to cover the continuous changes in rudder angles and special navigation area this energy efficiency assessment of the ship before and after maintenance is taken into account we discovered that the timing of this maintenance was not good although the ship had to be repaired due to regular maintenance the ship s hull performance was not determined to be in a bad condition the ship should have been able to operate for some more time before maintenance was carried out in the future it is recommended that shipping companies use this system to monitor the energy efficiency of the hull they could consider maintenance when the energy efficiency of the hull deteriorates to a certain extent and such conditional maintenance is well supported based on this study 4 2 case study 2 container ship b ship b is deployed on a north american east coast route as shown in fig 9 the figure shows similar route paths for the accumulated data from april 2017 to may 2018 1 distributions of the overall performance fig 10 shows the distributions of the overall performance table 6 shows the important summarized performance the ship always turns on the autopilot on the rudder control the rudder angle generally has a change larger than one standard deviation because of the continuous change in rudder angle the stw sog correction is not used but we can still analyze it from the overall numerical observation or obvious differences in segment routes 2 evaluation of the maintenance performance fig 10 shows the changes in energy efficiency of ship b before and after the propeller polishing in april 2018 we can analyze fig 10 to determine the improvement of the minimum speed loss because of the propeller polishing as shown on the right side of fig 10 v d after maintenance most speed loss indicators are large than 15 as shown in the green baseline the light yellow dots in fig 10 indicate that the change in rudder angle is greater than one standard deviation so the change in overall rudder angle is significantly large however the outliers in the left side of the sfoc are mostly filtered out by one standard deviation of the rudder angle and no significant difference is shown in fig 10 sfoc before and after maintenance thus other fuel consuming operating conditions must be explored from the discussion with the ship operators the factors may include unintended acceleration or dodging piracy 3 lightweight conditions in the segment navigations after the hull paint was replaced in april 2017 ship b has a baseline indicator of approximately 3 1 for v d as shown by no 2 in table 6 then ship b unloads cargo in panama no 3 and no 4 have better values approximately 2 3 for the indicator because of the lightweight conditions the draft was less than 11 m however we find that the cfd calculation in the shallow draft light ship state is overestimated this problem cannot be overcome by the current general cfd analysis therefore these values cannot be directly compared with other draft conditions 4 special current conditions in the similar sailing path fig 11 shows the track chart of no 5 with yellow dots and no 6 with blue dots no 5 has better performance approximately 0 7 because of a route that ended in the western pacific ocean and navigated along the ocean currents from north to south fig 9 right route no 6 which has the opposite direction of no 5 has a value of approximately 8 6 for v d two different models of the distributions of speed and horsepower for no 5 and no 6 are shown in fig 11 no 6 is an unstable navigation in the distribution of the stw so the same horsepower is observed for different speed points this voyage has slight acceleration and deceleration conditions and maintains a speed of approximately 18 1 knots although the loading conditions of the ship are in a stable draft the rudder angles have significant changes iso 19030 does not cover this sailing situation on the continuous rudder change and this standard recommends not to use these data however the numerical difference of no 5 and no 6 between two opposite paths reflects the problem and it is worth continuing to analyze the impact of currents in the route path 4 3 case study 3 container ship c table 7 shows that ship c replaced its propeller and repainted its hull on april 1 2018 after the docking repair there is no information for a time period fig 12 a filters the data by 2 standard deviations of the rudder angle to retain more than half of the data fig 12 b shows that the power increasing indicator and speed loss indicator curve has several slopes in the ship compared to those in ships a and b the figure shows that the navigation performance varies for different routes we find that the performance of the rudder angle is not stable many changes are greater than the standard deviation according to iso 19030 filtering the data under this condition will result in too little data to analyze future research can explore the details of the instability of the rudder angle when we compare the performance in voyages no 1 2 and 3 with the others we observe an improvement in the speed loss indicator after maintenance all values are less than the values of no 3 under light load conditions except for no 8 voyage no 8 has worse performance because the route moves against the ocean currents this route travels from south to north and ends in the western pacific ocean which is similar to no 6 of ship b in fig 9 this is a very fuel efficient voyage and significantly worse than the downstream condition in no 5 of ship b which is based on the speed loss gap between no 5 0 7 and no 6 8 6 therefore if the flow factors are considered we can determine the improvement in the overall efficiency 4 4 comprehensive discussion for ships a b and c 1 fig 13 shows the sorted values of all voyages to compare the speed loss for ships a b and c using the data of tables 3 6 and 7 respectively in the figure the maximum and minimum speed losses for each ship are treated as outliers and removed among these ships ship c has the worst performance the speed loss is worse than approximately 2 under all general loadings ship b has slightly better performance than ship a we suggest that the design factors can be examined in the future the second generation of design ship b will usually have better performance than the first generation ship a 2 the measurement of stw does not have one good method for the calibration instrument in multi ship research it is necessary to provide source data correction or after a data analysis of a longer time period we can develop new methods to correct the data of the main sensors 3 due to the impact of the continuous rudder change which affects the ship acceleration and deceleration for a partial sailing time non uniform water field and other factors we could not obtain the ideal data in ships b and c 4 these three ships are based on the same hull model if we want to apply the comparison to other ship types cfd may cause errors of the baseline in iso 19030 a real flow field in a shallow draft is generally not easy to simulate using cfd because of the broken wave condition which results in poor calculation accuracy and errors in the calculated horsepower based on practical experience we suggest that drafts below 10 5 m should not be used or other methods should be used to calculate these values by the model test or sea trail 4 5 summery and comparison with the iso standard table 8 describes the application conditions for the proposed indicators the comparison with the iso standard is as follows 1 the average performance indicators v d and p d are similar to those of iso 19030 however many factors affect the efficiency such as the ocean currents navigational attitude and mechanical factors 2 for ship owners the sfoc and torque indicators are traditionally important performance indicators in this study these two indicators s f o c d and k q d refer to the iso method but have not been included in the iso standard 3 relative to the average indicator of the iso standard the kpis show instantaneous performance in the ideal sailing conditions stw is equal to sog the assumptions for these indicators are stable currents for the navigation period regression analysis is used to determine whether there is a positive correlation between the water flow and the ship speed then we can modify the indicators v d p d and sfo c d using the proposed method to compare the performance before and after maintenance 4 to control the data quality we find that the continuous ratio indicator v d p d shows the performance distributions for the lifecycle of a ship and can compare the performance of multiple ships the indicator can check whether the data in a navigation period is only included in a single sailing attitude in a short navigation a significant change in ratio is considered an anomaly or implies that the data does not fall into a stable sailing condition 5 we find that the direction of the ocean currents is an important classification factor for the special router in the western pacific ocean 6 finally considering the opportunity of practical application the auto rudder causes the continuous rudder change the samples are filtered between 1 and 2 standard deviations to avoid samples whose sizes are too small to analyze 5 conclusion 1 using the original data without snip it is impossible to analyze the performance indicators based on this platform performance monitoring estimation and maintenance evaluation of ships have been realized and a good foundation has been built for further design feedback based on analysis and research incorporating more navigation data 2 snip provides energy efficiency operational indicators for ships it can offer shipping energy efficiency management services and can provide a reference for monitoring reporting and verification of international maritime affairs 3 this study supports the conclusion that snip can present a reasonable range of data after hull maintenance as a performance indicator to use as baseline data for the next maintenance after docking the performance indicators will improve to better values when the performance indicators in similar navigation routes are below or close to the baseline data before the previous docking docking maintenance should be performed again in practice the maintenance schedule should match the demand of the ship s suspension and the maintenance schedule of the shipyard dock to reduce the impact of the shipowner s capacity loss 4 the kpi trend of the linear regression helps us comprehensively determine the factors of stw sog 5 further research can collect the accumulated navigation mileage of every ship estimate future maintenance from the scheduled voyages and arrange a more reasonable docking maintenance schedule to improve the efficiency and reduce the overall fuel cost credit

20679,this study analyzes the energy efficiency of ships based on iso 19030 which is a standard for the measurement of changes in hull and propeller performance the goal is to provide energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided the ship navigation information platform snip is developed to determine the dynamic information of each ship including the fuel consumption ship speed horsepower of the engine rotation speed of the engine wind direction and wind speed in addition model test data and computational fluid dynamics cfd calculation data are applied to calculate the energy efficiency performance indicators finally the relationship of the speed through water and the speed over ground enables us to modify the effects of the ocean currents the results verify that these indicators can be used as a reference for performance monitoring and maintenance prediction of international maritime affairs keywords energy efficiency management iso 19030 hull and propeller maintenance 1 introduction with the emergence of the concept of smart ships and the ever growing development of electronic technology for ships analysis of ships big data has become a general trend in global shipping coraddu et al 2019 cristea et al 2017 latifov 2019 zhang et al 2019 domestic shipping companies recently have been attempting to introduce intelligent ship management systems which are developed overseas to analyze the navigational attitude loading conditions engine room and sea meteorological information during navigation of a ship to make suggestions about the navigational attitude speed and sailing route of the ship to reduce fuel consumption and operating costs however a ship in operation involves a wide range of big data including the navigation status hull engine room energy efficiency management and cargo management these data together with marine meteorological and ocean current information form a complete data linkage and correspond to different analytical indicators moreover the aforementioned data come from various sources and contain diverse data dimensions densities and structures so different data correction methods are needed data analysis has driven automation and smart applications and has further promoted industrial evolution it is available for many different roles in the maritime industry such as shipyards shipowners and shipping companies this analysis helps them manage their fleets in a more efficient and safer way 1 1 marine big data analytics for ship performance monitoring analyzing the big data of a ship during navigation can be used to reduce fuel consumption and send an early warning about changes in the ship s conditions in addition to maintaining the high navigation efficiency of ships we also hope to achieve certain goals such as maintenance prediction reducing man made improper operations controlling fuel consumption to reduce costs and most importantly increasing profits big data analytics mishra and datta gupta 2017 are related to data in large volumes of different varieties and at high velocities because the manual daily reports for a ship are replaced with the data directly obtained from the machinery the data diversity is changed from several times per day to several seconds the theory of the performance indicator is to compare the actual navigation data with the expected benchmark index there are two sources of navigation data for the performance baseline a baseline calibration of the model which is built using actual navigation data coraddu et al 2019 and a model to simulate the efficiency of navigation which is built using full scale cfd orihara and tsujimoto 2018 then we can compare the navigating performance between the continuous navigation and the baseline performance in the domain of ship energy performance we must consider reasonable methods to filter or average the pike values because the acceleration and power of a ship quickly increases or decreases thus the data driven modeling will use statistical techniques to mine data to discover the analysis patterns in multivariate datasets research analyzing ship performance in actual seas may be summarized in three types of methods carchen et al 2019 1 data driven methods these methods usually use artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms coraddu et al 2019 parkes et al 2018 petersen et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and do not require domain knowledge of physical ship phenomena all data manipulation and statistical analysis are entirely carried out by computers using self learning algorithms a large number of samples are provided to build the models and limit the applications 2 deterministic methods these methods examine the speed performance of ships by utilizing resistance and propulsion characteristics the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd models choi et al 2010 model testing open water testing sea trials and analysis of the long term data of ships to build the baseline performance 3 hybrid methods these methods use general physical parameters to evaluate efficient shipping operations trodden et al 2015 holtrop regression is a general approach for determining ship resistance based on the speed resistance and some characteristics of ships holtrop 1984 1988 holtrop and mennen 1982 rakke 2016 we can blend the presented data driven methods to refine the models of hybrid methods by historical onboard measurements coraddu et al 2017 more numerical features i e fuel consumption speed trim power draft heeling and headwind support the model testing performance soner et al 2018 then the performance is predicted and validated through a comparison with onboard monitored data orihara and tsujimoto 2018 tsujimoto and orihara 2018 iso 19030 iso 2016a is a practical method for hull and propeller performance monitoring it measures how much power is required to move a ship through water at a given speed draft and wind condition cetena becchi 2019 described a complete application framework based on iso 19030 the standard shows four performance indicators for dry docking performance in service performance maintenance trigger and maintenance effect ship owners and operators can compare hull and propeller performance by analyzing the operational data of ships to calculate the performance indicators and then select the most efficient options for their vessels following the standard the two major implementation priorities of this study are as follows 1 smart shipping the constructed information platform is used to understand and control the dynamic information of each ship for the purpose of assisting domestic shipping companies in analyzing their business decision making 2 energy management for ships a solution is expected to be proposed that not only applies professional knowledge improves fuel consumption and reduces carbon dioxide emissions but also moves toward a low carbon footprint green energy and energy conservation by exploring correlation factors through big data analysis compared with the energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi tran 2017 iso 19030 takes the physical factors of actual ship navigation into consideration and has remarkable accuracy compared with iso 15016 both standards are similar with respect to wind resistance iso 19030 has detailed processes based on anemometer data from ships there are no practical means to measure wave parameters that are not available and theoretical methods require more detailed ship geometry data owing to the need for more time for wave calculation for wave resistance iso 19030 recommends that the data used for evaluation of performance in calm seas should be extracted under wind speed conditions less than 7 9 m s octarvia s project in japan focuses on the increasing rate of resistance due to taking winds and waves as candidate parameters for filtering the increasing rate of resistance is expected to be applied irrespective of ship size since it is a relative parameter representing the extent of weather effects accurate wave data are provided by the japan weather association and the effect of waves is investigated the rate of resistance is estimated in accordance with iso 15016 sogihara et al 2019 similar research topics are also applied in korea to modify the resistance based on weather service data using iso 15016 park s research supports filtering the data when the rudder angle is larger than 5 park 2019 in this study we find that it is necessary to observe the changes in the rudder angles of a ship in contrast to current research this research is intended to provide a more practical method based on previous studies filtering is too loose for a ship with a stable rudder angle for a ship with a large rudder angle using the standard deviation can preclude most of the data from being filtered out at certain angles therefore a research procedure must reasonably consider the amount of data evaluated for determining the navigation characteristics of each ship 1 2 outline this paper studies the changes in the energy efficiency of the hulls of three ships before and after maintenance then it provides a reference for the energy efficiency management of a shipping company by observing the energy efficiency performance of each ship during this period the framework of the ship navigation information platform snip is described in section 2 we apply a new practice area of iso 19030 by relating a performance indicator the speed through water and the speed over ground the analysis procedure is described in section 3 determining how to analyze the indicators of operational ships by applying the methods and demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness based on snip are described in section 4 finally future work is described in the conclusion 2 integrated ship navigation information platform this study develops the integrated snip for ship efficiency assessment seven container ships have currently installed the platform three selected ships are analyzed based on their more adequate data volumes the principal particulars of the ships are shown in table 1 ship a is 8000 teu and ships b and c are the next generation of ship a fig 1 portrays the framework of the snip whose infrastructure includes three modules to send and read the operational data 1 onboard server a data acquisition module which is usually an autonomous industrial embedded computer to connect the sensors and machines of the ship to collect the operational data for the server on the intranet of the ship as shown in the left side figure the major data are collected from the alarm management system ams voyage data recorder vdr mass flow meter mfm and horsepower meter to determine the dynamic information of each ship including fuel consumption ship speed horsepower of the engine rotation speed of the engine wind direction wind speed etc a manual daily report mnl is applied to check the data correction and collect import issues from the chief officer and engineer into the system then the collected data from each ship are transported by the tcp socket protocol michael j and kenneth l 2009 to an onshore databank server via communication tools using the international maritime satellite inmarsat at sea or 4g wireless communication service in port these data are compressed and separated to a small sized file based on the format of the post office protocol 2 onshore server a server with four parts file storage email database and web server first a file storage server must have a good firewall to isolate the issues of network security the server enables the user to save the received raw data of ship navigation through a customized email server receive these data packets and subsequently combine and decompress these data this mechanism can ensure that information is transmitted with extremely high efficiency and extremely small data size when a partial data leak occurs it can be guaranteed that the data cannot be interpreted as a complete picture which will not cause doubts about the security from ship owners in addition meteorological data basic ship information model test data and cfd calculation data are collected based on iso 19030 the overall data can be downloaded using the ftp protocol second a customized service program supports the data process based on iso 19030 and the database is created with a relational data structure queried by structured query language sql third these data can be used through the integrated web server according to the security policy and subsequently shared with users who have access rights through the big data sharing system the main computing resource is used for the cfd calculation including 4 cluster computers 96 cores based on the architecture of the general high performance computing hpc hager and wellein 2010 which are connected by the infiniband network huang et al 2006 the remaining computing requirements can be completed on a workstation 24 cores 3 client interface a data repeater console to load the collected data for display in visual and graphic forms by a web browser the collected data include the sailing conditions in the pilothouse and detailed energy generation aspects in the engine room in this study integrating the information of these two regions for data analysis is the main purpose of the snip the r language is the main development tool fig 2 shows an example of the web styles for the visual data and graphic the details of the calculation are described in section 3 the items include the query condition settings in the left column of the figure and various charts in the right column of the figure such as the wind direction wind speed distribution main engine rotational speed main engine power profile classification of abnormal events in the ams relationship diagram of the ship speed power performance indicators of iso 19030 and sailing path diagram 3 measurement of the hull and propeller performance iso 19030 specifies a practical method to measure changes in the specific hull and propeller performance of a ship fig 3 a shows the main processes data preprocessing to obtain the common time period in different data sources sampling for a stable and single navigation status and screening data for outliers wind speed correction for the horsepower and calculating four performance indicators power increasing indicator p d speed loss indicator v d specific fuel oil consumption indicator s f o c d and torque coefficient indicator k q d v d and p d show the overall energy performance compared to the cfd benchmark because cfd includes three main parameters draft trim and speed the data preprocessing is designed to sample each single navigation status then we can compare the performance with each cfd result s f o c d shows the mass of consumed fuel oil compared to the reference sfoc curve of the main engine k q d shows the propeller performance compared to the open water test because the speed through water stw and speed over ground sog are affected by complex environmental factors the difference between these two variables is currently difficult to quantify we apply a new practice area named the key performance indicator kpi in the scatter diagram of the kpi both horizontal axis stw sog 1 and vertical axis indicator p d v d or s f o c d are value axes that plot numeric data for each indicator and stw sog 1 we build a relationship using the linear regression the kpi also shows the average value for an indicator and complicated navigation condition based on the parameter stw sog stw sog 1 indicates that there is an implied resistance a value close to the origin indicates a reduction of the resistance or a boost of the downstream flow finally these indicators of all navigations and the maintenance events are listed to support the advanced analysis in section 4 3 1 data preprocessing and sampling the main columns of the database are shown in table 2 after the detection is completed for all sample time data the abnormal value data points are deleted and each candidate segment data is saved then we filter the data based on the iso 19030 commands according to chauvenet s criterion iso 2016b a datum is considered an outlier and the acceptable probability of the mean is defined as 1 p 1 1 2n where p is the probability of the mean and n is the number of samples the standard divides the sample time into blocks of 10 min and recommends that an acceptable period navigation should have at least half of the data in this study all original data are averaged at 5 min intervals then the calculated performance indicators are averaged at one hourly intervals for a faster query speed after the data cleaning we can confirm the data correction and the three types of data sources ams vdr mfm should have identical time periods for each voyage then the preprocessing to obtain a common time period of a stable navigation is shown in fig 3 b c 1 check that no data is missing based on the columns in table 2 2 make the data consistent among ams vdr and mnl for the stw and shaft horsepower because the sampling time of each device is different we use vdr data to align the data from different data sources to create this relational data table we have found that the time zones of different devices are not synchronized and result in irrelevant data 3 determine that the datum is a stable navigation it is a loop judgment using the draft parameter until the system can identify a stable segment between the start and end navigation time for the target data as shown in fig 3 c the top figure shows the draft distribution and highlights the identified segment the criteria of the draft variation are within 0 5 m since the draft gauge is a barometric sensor the crews only operates the updated action when the draft of the ship has significantly changed therefore the update rate for the draft is low and can be used as the first screening condition to obtain a stable voyage data as shown in the top part of fig 3 c four parameters are used to filter a single condition sailing the rudder angle main engine me rotational speed stw and sog then substandard data points are deleted after the standard deviation detection is performed for all sample time data the threshold values for the standard deviation sd are me rpm 3 min 1 speed through water stw 0 5 knots speed over ground sog 0 5 knots rudder angle 1 the bottom part of fig 3 c shows the secondary filter results using the threshold of the rpm 3 2 wind resistance the wind resistance especially the impact caused by different wind heights and different ship types is a difficult factor to quantify in iso 19030 the effects of the vessel heading and wind direction are basically considered however the hull shape and superstructures must be very carefully assessed for some ship types generally container ships have similar superstructures but the differences have not been explored in this study iso19030 for the wind resistance is continued for further wind evaluation one can reference the study of carchen et al 2019 the purpose of wind velocity correction is to convert the influence to a windless condition i e the relative wind velocity on the ship is the velocity of the wind with the height about ground and the horsepower is corrected for different wind velocity conditions full ranges of drag coefficients related wind areas and heights of the wind flowmeter are needed the true wind velocity which includes the angle of the wind and ship heading is calculated as follows iso 2016b 2 v w t v g 2 v w r 2 2 v g v w r cos ψ w r i f v w r cos ψ w r ψ v

increased horsepower due to the wind resistance is deducted to calculate the modified shp the actual delivery horsepower dhp which is modified from the measured shaft horsepower shp is the power delivered to and measured at the output shaft of the transmission and defined as follows 11 dhp shp η s where shp shaft horsepower kw η s shaft efficiency coefficient 0 98 considering no wind conditions the increased horsepower due to the wind resistance is deducted to calculate the modified dhp 12 dhp m dhp r a a v g η d where η d propulsive efficiency coefficient at the design speed including the hull efficiency in the ship model test and open water test and the propeller efficiency in the open water test the effective horse power ehp is related to actuate a ship including the hull and propeller efficiency in a model test to compare the performance of different ships the ehp is defined as follows 13 ehp m dhp m η d then the power increasing rate is expressed as follows 14 p d 100 ehp m ehp e ehp e where ehp m is measured based on the specific value of the speed draft and trim if ehp m ehp e p d is positive which indicates that the worse performance is to require more horsepower to achieve the same speed 3 4 speed loss indicator the speed loss indicator is defined as follows 15 v d 100 v w v e v e where v w speed through water stw v e speed reference data based on the draft trim and ehp by cfd if v w v e v d is positive the speed performance is better than the baseline value at the standard power requirement 3 5 sfoc increasing indicator the modification of the mass of consumed fuel oil by the main engine foc is expressed as follows 16 foc m foc lcv r lcv s where foc mass of consumed fuel oil by the main engine ton h lcv r lower calorific value of fuel oil kj kg lcv s sfoc reference curve kj kg the calculation of sfoc corrected by the engine room environment is expressed as follows 17 sfoc m 1000000 foc m shp 1 0 0002 1 t e 0 00002 1000 p e 0 0006 35 t s where sfoc m specific fuel oil consumption g kwh foc m fuel oil consumption ton h t e temperature of the main engine c p e pressure of the main engine mbar t s exhaust gas temperature c the sfoc performance indicator for sfoc loss is defined as follows 18 sfoc d 100 sfoc m sfoc e sfoc e where sfoc e reference sfoc of the main engine based on the parameters of the maximum continuous rating power mcr and shp 3 6 torque loss indicator the torque and torque coefficient kq are 19 q shp 2 π n and 20 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 where shp shaft horsepower kw n revolutions s 1 q torque knm ρ density of seawater kg m3 d p diameter of propeller m k q torque coefficient the torque performance indicator for the torque loss is defined as follows 21 10 k q d 100 10 k q 10 k q e 10 k q e where 10 k qe reference by open water tests 3 7 kpi indicator for the efficiency analysis iso 19030 recommends the use of the average method as the value of the reference key performance indicators kpi for p d and v d however from an average viewpoint it is not easy to see the numerical variation under identical sailing conditions so the linear regression is included to obtain a more stable kpi for v d p d and s f o c d v d in eq 15 is the main indicator v w is the real speed for a time period and v e is the estimated speed based on cfd using the real conditions of draft trim and ehp v d is the extent of ship speed loss because of the difference of two speed sources between stw and sog there are resistance factors that must be considered based on the relationship a smaller value of stw sog corresponds to less speed loss as shown in fig 7 a first we suppose that stw sog is the ideal situation as follows 22 v d v d v w v g 1 where v d is the modified v d according to the condition stw sog next the least square method can estimate the linear equation as 23 f x a 1 x a 0 x v w v g 1 where each x within a time period based on one sailing condition is the independent ratio variable and the corresponding value for a modified speed loss indicator is the dependent variable then a 0 is the kpi value for the evaluated indicator as shown in fig 7 b due to the impact of the cruise controls that only satisfy the minimum speed requirements by accelerating the filter of stw sog 1 is applied for sfoc as shown in fig 7 c v d s f o c d and stw sog 1 have similar distributions the calculations of sfoc d are also similar to that of v d in eqs 22 and 23 as shown in fig 7 d we find the distributions that have a scale factor and a negative correlation of p d and stw sog 1 as shown in fig 7 e a smaller value of stw sog corresponds to a larger power increasing indicator thus we suppose that stw equal to sog is the ideal situation as follows 24 p d p d c v w v g 1 where c is the slope p d v d in fig 6 c then fig 7 f shows the calculations of p d where the methods are similar to that of v d in eq 23 fig 7 b d and f represent the stable sailing conditions for the modified v d s f o c d and p d based on the condition of stw being equal to sog this drawing can provide an analysis that simultaneously considers both speed dimensions the ratio of kpi based on the fixed draft and speed is more suitable for analyzing the indicators in the same sailing state 4 results and discussion ship energy efficiency evaluation software is developed in snip and provides ship energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided in the past we pay attention to the changes in energy efficiency of the hull and propeller before and after maintenance fig 4 for the ships and observe the energy efficiency performance of each ship the results are provided to the shipping company as a reference for their energy efficiency management 4 1 case study 1 container ship a fig 5 show the distribution of the indicators for ship a from jul 2018 to feb 2020 the practice methodology is as follows for ship a 1 distributions of the overall performance all data are saved as row format data every 5 min by the navigation time the average data per hour are subsequently used and the standard deviation by the rudder angle is recorded fig 5 a shows the distributions of v d p d and sfoc d which are filtered by 1 standard deviation of the rudder angle for a long term voyage in principle one should pay attention to the areas of positive p d and negative v d fig 5 b shows that v d and p d have a highly linear correlation which indicates that the ship has excellent performance during this period when the condition of the ship worsens the curve will show an exponential growth and approach into the yellow area in the figure 2 calculations of the segment performance to compare v d and p d it is necessary to find a route segment where the draft depth and speed are similar from a preliminary analysis we find that there are certain values of the time interval between draft depth and rotation speed in fig 3 c the performance indicators of each navigation is summarized in table 3 according to the data of fig 5 we take the first voyage no 3 and voyage no 9 as examples the indicators of no 3 are used as the benchmark and no 9 shows the performance after maintenance we select a period of the relationship between the stable draft depth and the me rotation speed in period no 3 fig 6 a b show the filtered principal parameters to select the stable navigation of no 3 and no 9 fig 6 c shows that the positive correlation the correlation coefficient is 0 998 represents a single navigation attitude between speed and power fig 7 a c and e show the positive correlation between stw sog and these indicators fig 7 b d and f show the quantitative indicators of eq 23 for modified values of v d sfoc d and p d based on the condition of stw being equal to sog these figures show that as summarized in table 4 no 9 is similar to no 3 and no 9 has a better performance in these kpis than no 3 3 evaluation of the maintenance performance after searching for the route segments table 3 with similar operational parameters including the drafts rotational speeds rudder angle changes and navigation paths we determine that segments no 3 and no 9 satisfy the comparison conditions before and after the maintenance time of the ship the changes in rudder angles and navigation area must be as similar as possible so that we can more objectively compare different energy efficiency values table 4 shows the changes in energy efficiency of ship a before and after the hull paint was replaced in october 2018 no 3 and no 9 are extracted in table 4 and the gps speed and foc average are added we can observe that there are fewer negative values of v d which indicates that the speed loss has decreased fig 6 b shows the improved performance of the speed loss approximately 2 6 from 5 176 before maintenance to 2 572 after maintenance because the speed loss has decreased how much can the actual speed increase using the energy efficiency program to find the gps speeds of these two route segments we find that under the conditions of draft depth and speed the increase is approximately 0 09 kn hr from 18 5 kn hr before maintenance to 20 4 kn hr after maintenance the foc values of no 3 and no 9 in table 5 are not directly comparable due to different ship speeds we need to use the ascending relationship between the foc and the cubed speed to calculate the foc values suppose that all other conditions are the same if the speed becomes 20 4 kn hr then the foc theoretical value will become 102 20 4 18 5 3 136 hence we can infer from the statistics of no 9 that the foc theoretical value changed from 136 to 120 which is an approximately 11 decrease after maintenance when the speed was 20 4 kn hr the target segments show similar energy efficiency results using the reference indicators provided by the weather company as shown in fig 8 the data of periods no 3 and no 9 in fig 8 are similar to the data in table 4 the orange performance line fitted with the dots of period no 3 shows that the corresponding fuel consumption is 102 mt at a speed of 18 5 kn hr based on the blue performance line fitted with the dots of period no 9 the corresponding fuel consumption is 120 mt at a speed of 20 4 kn hr which is consistent with the data in table 4 the speed indeed improves after maintenance meanwhile if the speed is fixed at 20 4 kn hr the observed fuel consumption decreases from 136 mt before maintenance to 120 mt after maintenance i e the reduction ratios are notably similar therefore the results prove the reliability of the indicators 4 limitation and follow up studies the changes in rudder angles and navigation area must be as similar as possible so that we can more objectively compare different energy efficiency values limited by the amount of data more factors can be considered in advanced research to cover the continuous changes in rudder angles and special navigation area this energy efficiency assessment of the ship before and after maintenance is taken into account we discovered that the timing of this maintenance was not good although the ship had to be repaired due to regular maintenance the ship s hull performance was not determined to be in a bad condition the ship should have been able to operate for some more time before maintenance was carried out in the future it is recommended that shipping companies use this system to monitor the energy efficiency of the hull they could consider maintenance when the energy efficiency of the hull deteriorates to a certain extent and such conditional maintenance is well supported based on this study 4 2 case study 2 container ship b ship b is deployed on a north american east coast route as shown in fig 9 the figure shows similar route paths for the accumulated data from april 2017 to may 2018 1 distributions of the overall performance fig 10 shows the distributions of the overall performance table 6 shows the important summarized performance the ship always turns on the autopilot on the rudder control the rudder angle generally has a change larger than one standard deviation because of the continuous change in rudder angle the stw sog correction is not used but we can still analyze it from the overall numerical observation or obvious differences in segment routes 2 evaluation of the maintenance performance fig 10 shows the changes in energy efficiency of ship b before and after the propeller polishing in april 2018 we can analyze fig 10 to determine the improvement of the minimum speed loss because of the propeller polishing as shown on the right side of fig 10 v d after maintenance most speed loss indicators are large than 15 as shown in the green baseline the light yellow dots in fig 10 indicate that the change in rudder angle is greater than one standard deviation so the change in overall rudder angle is significantly large however the outliers in the left side of the sfoc are mostly filtered out by one standard deviation of the rudder angle and no significant difference is shown in fig 10 sfoc before and after maintenance thus other fuel consuming operating conditions must be explored from the discussion with the ship operators the factors may include unintended acceleration or dodging piracy 3 lightweight conditions in the segment navigations after the hull paint was replaced in april 2017 ship b has a baseline indicator of approximately 3 1 for v d as shown by no 2 in table 6 then ship b unloads cargo in panama no 3 and no 4 have better values approximately 2 3 for the indicator because of the lightweight conditions the draft was less than 11 m however we find that the cfd calculation in the shallow draft light ship state is overestimated this problem cannot be overcome by the current general cfd analysis therefore these values cannot be directly compared with other draft conditions 4 special current conditions in the similar sailing path fig 11 shows the track chart of no 5 with yellow dots and no 6 with blue dots no 5 has better performance approximately 0 7 because of a route that ended in the western pacific ocean and navigated along the ocean currents from north to south fig 9 right route no 6 which has the opposite direction of no 5 has a value of approximately 8 6 for v d two different models of the distributions of speed and horsepower for no 5 and no 6 are shown in fig 11 no 6 is an unstable navigation in the distribution of the stw so the same horsepower is observed for different speed points this voyage has slight acceleration and deceleration conditions and maintains a speed of approximately 18 1 knots although the loading conditions of the ship are in a stable draft the rudder angles have significant changes iso 19030 does not cover this sailing situation on the continuous rudder change and this standard recommends not to use these data however the numerical difference of no 5 and no 6 between two opposite paths reflects the problem and it is worth continuing to analyze the impact of currents in the route path 4 3 case study 3 container ship c table 7 shows that ship c replaced its propeller and repainted its hull on april 1 2018 after the docking repair there is no information for a time period fig 12 a filters the data by 2 standard deviations of the rudder angle to retain more than half of the data fig 12 b shows that the power increasing indicator and speed loss indicator curve has several slopes in the ship compared to those in ships a and b the figure shows that the navigation performance varies for different routes we find that the performance of the rudder angle is not stable many changes are greater than the standard deviation according to iso 19030 filtering the data under this condition will result in too little data to analyze future research can explore the details of the instability of the rudder angle when we compare the performance in voyages no 1 2 and 3 with the others we observe an improvement in the speed loss indicator after maintenance all values are less than the values of no 3 under light load conditions except for no 8 voyage no 8 has worse performance because the route moves against the ocean currents this route travels from south to north and ends in the western pacific ocean which is similar to no 6 of ship b in fig 9 this is a very fuel efficient voyage and significantly worse than the downstream condition in no 5 of ship b which is based on the speed loss gap between no 5 0 7 and no 6 8 6 therefore if the flow factors are considered we can determine the improvement in the overall efficiency 4 4 comprehensive discussion for ships a b and c 1 fig 13 shows the sorted values of all voyages to compare the speed loss for ships a b and c using the data of tables 3 6 and 7 respectively in the figure the maximum and minimum speed losses for each ship are treated as outliers and removed among these ships ship c has the worst performance the speed loss is worse than approximately 2 under all general loadings ship b has slightly better performance than ship a we suggest that the design factors can be examined in the future the second generation of design ship b will usually have better performance than the first generation ship a 2 the measurement of stw does not have one good method for the calibration instrument in multi ship research it is necessary to provide source data correction or after a data analysis of a longer time period we can develop new methods to correct the data of the main sensors 3 due to the impact of the continuous rudder change which affects the ship acceleration and deceleration for a partial sailing time non uniform water field and other factors we could not obtain the ideal data in ships b and c 4 these three ships are based on the same hull model if we want to apply the comparison to other ship types cfd may cause errors of the baseline in iso 19030 a real flow field in a shallow draft is generally not easy to simulate using cfd because of the broken wave condition which results in poor calculation accuracy and errors in the calculated horsepower based on practical experience we suggest that drafts below 10 5 m should not be used or other methods should be used to calculate these values by the model test or sea trail 4 5 summery and comparison with the iso standard table 8 describes the application conditions for the proposed indicators the comparison with the iso standard is as follows 1 the average performance indicators v d and p d are similar to those of iso 19030 however many factors affect the efficiency such as the ocean currents navigational attitude and mechanical factors 2 for ship owners the sfoc and torque indicators are traditionally important performance indicators in this study these two indicators s f o c d and k q d refer to the iso method but have not been included in the iso standard 3 relative to the average indicator of the iso standard the kpis show instantaneous performance in the ideal sailing conditions stw is equal to sog the assumptions for these indicators are stable currents for the navigation period regression analysis is used to determine whether there is a positive correlation between the water flow and the ship speed then we can modify the indicators v d p d and sfo c d using the proposed method to compare the performance before and after maintenance 4 to control the data quality we find that the continuous ratio indicator v d p d shows the performance distributions for the lifecycle of a ship and can compare the performance of multiple ships the indicator can check whether the data in a navigation period is only included in a single sailing attitude in a short navigation a significant change in ratio is considered an anomaly or implies that the data does not fall into a stable sailing condition 5 we find that the direction of the ocean currents is an important classification factor for the special router in the western pacific ocean 6 finally considering the opportunity of practical application the auto rudder causes the continuous rudder change the samples are filtered between 1 and 2 standard deviations to avoid samples whose sizes are too small to analyze 5 conclusion 1 using the original data without snip it is impossible to analyze the performance indicators based on this platform performance monitoring estimation and maintenance evaluation of ships have been realized and a good foundation has been built for further design feedback based on analysis and research incorporating more navigation data 2 snip provides energy efficiency operational indicators for ships it can offer shipping energy efficiency management services and can provide a reference for monitoring reporting and verification of international maritime affairs 3 this study supports the conclusion that snip can present a reasonable range of data after hull maintenance as a performance indicator to use as baseline data for the next maintenance after docking the performance indicators will improve to better values when the performance indicators in similar navigation routes are below or close to the baseline data before the previous docking docking maintenance should be performed again in practice the maintenance schedule should match the demand of the ship s suspension and the maintenance schedule of the shipyard dock to reduce the impact of the shipowner s capacity loss 4 the kpi trend of the linear regression helps us comprehensively determine the factors of stw sog 5 further research can collect the accumulated navigation mileage of
