20390,this research provides a thorough investigation on aspects of the structural integrity of composite blades for a range of operating conditions using fluid structure interaction analysis based on computational fluid dynamics cfd and finite element method fem both shell elements and layered solid elements were used in the finite element model the strength was assessed against tsai wu hashin and hoffman criteria the blade is subjected to combined loads of bend and twist that varying in magnitude direction and acting point therefore the critical failure mode is shown to be highly affected by operating conditions which necessitates evaluating the strength for the whole operating range the safe operating range was analyzed according to a guidance note recently released by bureau veritas bv which defines safety limits for individual and combined stresses across each ply interlaminar normal stress failure is shown to be the most critical mode of failure hence a solid model is recommended over the shell model the blade strength meets the requirement of bv rules when assessed by hoffman criteria however other failure criteria show insufficient strength at the design condition keywords composite propeller failure analysis hydro elasticity fluid structure interaction cfd fea 1 introduction the use of composite materials in marine propellers grabbed the attention of researchers in the marine industry because of their non corrosiveness and ability to be tailored and optimized for different design objectives the lamina of fiber reinforced plastics frp has anisotropic properties that depend on fiber orientation and resin content which makes structural analysis of composite propellers a very challenging process compared to conventional propellers anisotropy of frp necessitates that stress components be determined and evaluated individually because failure margins differ in each direction further composite failure criteria need to be adopted to evaluate resultant combined stresses hashin failure theory hashin 1980 has been applied by lin and lin 2005 in a composite propeller to study the failure modes considering fiber tension fiber compression matrix tension matrix compression and delamination lin and lin utilized 3 d equilibrium equations to obtain transverse shear stresses while the smoothing of stress distribution was achieved by the least squares method they confirmed that leading and trailing edges are prone to failure under delamination matrix tension and compression several studies applied quadratic failure criteria such as tsai hill and tsai wu 1965 tsai wu criterion was applied on composite propellers by kong et al 2012 and das and kapuria 2016 while the tsai hill criterion was applied by h lee et al 2017a hyoungsuk lee et al 2017b and muang et al maung et al 2021 the failure theory of puck puck and schürmann 1998 was adopted on composite marine propellers by hussain et al 2020a to evaluate and optimize the strength of the tapered blade however a comparison of the performance of different criteria on predicting composite blade failure was not sufficiently discussed in the literature finite element analysis of composites is performed using either shell elements or solid elements shell elements are suitable when the out of plane stresses are not significant which is the case in thin walled structures where shell elements perform well in bending deformation and require less computational capacity however for thick laminate out of plane stresses become more significant and solid elements are more appropriate to describe the structural behavior elease 16 0 compo most recently a project funded by the french department of defense dga was performed by naval group and other french research centers in collaboration with bureau veritas bv the project was named fabheli which stands for fabrication d hélices en composite composite propeller manufacturing and was held between 2016 and 2018 guillaume et al 2019 the project developed a propeller prototype with a diameter of 1 1 m fitted on a 30 m passenger ship one of the major outcomes of the research is that in november 2020 bv announced the release of guidance note ni 663 which is the first ever guide to be released by a classification society for composite propellers bureau veritas marineoffshore 2020 the note defines requirements for all stages of designing testing certifying and installing propellers made of composite materials the minimum rule safety factors are defined concerning partial safety factors α cv cf cr ci ccs defined as follow α rule

factor considering the fabrication process and the reproducibility of the fabrication cr rule partial safety factor considering the type and the direction of main stresses applied to the fibers ccs rule partial safety factor for combined stresses in the individual layers ci rule partial safety factor considering the type of loads the variation of magnitude and direction of hydrodynamic twisting moment acting on propeller blade and its implication on the design of composite propellers was described by hussain et al 2020b results showed that twist moment direction relies on the position of the center of pressure which represents the force acting point force acting point depends on the geometry of the propeller and moves toward the trailing edge when the advance coefficient increases as explained by fig 1 this variation generates a positive twist at low advance coefficients and a negative twist moment at high advance coefficients which could consequently influence stress components and critical failure type bv rule suggested approximate force application points in the case of basic design as shown in fig 2 this research aims to study the combined stresses on the composite blade by applying three failure criteria tsai wu hashin and hoffman the failure will be evaluated according to recently released guidelines by bv for both shell elements and solid elements models the analysis covers a range of advance speeds to study the influence of the change of moment magnitude and direction at different operating conditions 2 methodology model propeller vp1304 developed by sva barkmann 2011a was chosen as a base for designing composite propeller after reducing thickness linearly from tip reaching thickness at root being 50 of that of the metallic blade the propeller has five blades with 18 skew nominal p d 1 635 and a smooth hub fig 3 the diameter is 250 mm and the hub to diameter ratio is 30 detailed properties of propeller vp1304 are listed in table 1 fluid structure interaction fsi analysis was implemented to assess the strength of the blade the pressure load was computed using cfd simulations and mapped to the mesh of the composite model which is a monolithic laminate with plydrop to account for thickness variations further failure was analyzed using both individual and combined stress criteria 3 numerical models steady coupling of cfd and fea is considered in the analysis of fluid structure interaction for propeller subjected to pressure load and centripetal force the equilibrium equation is written as 1 f h f r k l k 0 k g k r u where f h is the vector of hydrodynamic force f r is the vector of centrifugal force k l is the linear stiffness matrix k 0 is the matrix of initial displacement k g is the geometric stiffness matrix k r is the rotational stiffness matrix and u is the vector of nodal displacement the methodology for fluid structural coupling used in this research relies on solving fluid and structure problems individually and applying iterative coupling between cfd code and fea code to transfer interacting quantities different meshes are used for the fluid domain and structure domain because each analysis has certain mesh requirements the data transfer process involves matching of source and target mesh to generate mapping weights by the mapping algorithm general grid interface mapping ggi algorithm was applied for mapping pressure from fluid domain to structure domain fig 4 3 1 computational fluid dynamics model the fluid flow around the propeller was solved numerically using cfd in a rotating frame of reference using absolute velocity formulation the equation of mass conservation is written in terms of relative velocity v r can be written as follows 2 ρ t ρ v r 0 the partial derivative ρ t represents the mass change in the control volume while the mass flow through the surface is given by the term ρ v r for reference frame rotating steadily and no external forces acting in it the momentum conservation can be written as 3 t ρ v ρ v r v ρ ω v v t p τ where p is the static pressure ω is the angular velocity and τ is the stress tensor given by 4 τ μ v v t 2 3 v i where μ is the molecular viscosity and i is the unit tensor reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans will be solved after discretizing the domain into a finite set of control volumes modeling the fluid flow problem as a rotating domain with a moving frame of reference allows for solving as a steady state the diameter of the physical domain is 3 times the propeller diameter the inlet is located 1 5 d upstream of the propeller while the outlet is 5 d downstream periodic boundary conditions were utilized to allow for solving the fluid flow problem in a single blade domain which decreases the computational effort to the fifth fig 5 the domain is discretized into 512 000 mesh elements with a second order discretization scheme and k ε realizable turbulence model 3 2 structural analysis model

is idealized as virtual beams connecting shaft center with blade root as suggested and validated by hussain et al 2020a 3 4 composite failure the failure analysis of the composite blade under multiaxial loads requires applying failure criteria to signify a general strength indicator relative to uniaxial stress limits of the composite laminate hashin failure criterion hashin 1980 evaluates five separate modes of failure fiber tension and compression f f matrix tension and compression f m and delamination f d which are calculated as follows 10 f f σ 1 x t 2 τ 12 s 12 2 τ 13 s 13 2 σ 1 0

propeller blade was calculated using cfd and then integrated over the blade surface to get force and moment resultants the velocity of flow to the propeller was taken in the range of 2 25 5 25 m s while the rotational speed was fixed at 15 revolutions per second non dimensional coefficients were calculated for each operating condition by the following equations 15 j v a n d 16 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 17 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 18 η o j 2 π k t k q with j being the advance coefficient k t the thrust coefficient k q the torque coefficient η o the propeller efficiency v a the advance speed d the propeller diameter n the rotational speed t the thrust force and q the torque cfd results agree with the model test data of sva report 3752 barkmann 2011b as depicted in fig 9 while pressure distribution over blade surface is plotted in fig 10 the values of bending moment on the blade moment around y axis and twisting moment moment around the z axis are depicted in fig 11 4 2 main stresses evaluation main stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 τ 12 τ 23 on the blade were evaluated individually on both shell elements and solid elements models failure will occur when any one of the stress components exceeds the corresponding strength in that direction at this part of the analysis main stresses are evaluated independently at each ply without considering the interactions between different failure modes fig 12 shows a comparison of the shell model and solid model in terms of predicted maximum stress components in the fiber direction perpendicular to the fiber direction in plane shear interlaminar shear and interlaminar normal stress the safety factor is calculated for each component relative to the stress limit of the laminate as shown in table 2 19 s a f e t y f a c t o r s f s t r e n g t h l i m i t

mechanical however this was not enough to accurately predict interlaminar stresses because of the intensive ply drops on the laminate out of plane normal stress calculated by the shell model is less than 20 of that predicted by the layered solid model as appears in fig 12 e bv guidelines defined partial safety factors for each of the individual stresses taking into consideration accuracy of

and type of loads ci as shown in table 3 these factors are then used to calculate minimum rule safety factors for individual stresses sf and minimum rule safety factor for combined stresses sfcs according to the following equations 20 s f α c v c f c r c i 21 s f c s α c v c f c c s c i minimum rule safety factors calculated by these equations are shown in table 4 evaluation of sf of main stresses on the blade against rules minimum safety factor is depicted in fig 12 shell element analysis indicates that interlaminar shear s 13 s 23 is the most critical determinant of safe operating zone while solid element results fig 13 indicated that the most critical main stress is the interlaminar normal stress s 3 4 3 combined stress analysis the propeller blade is subjected to multiaxial loads though material strength is defined for uniaxial tension compression and shear three composite failure criteria were adopted to express strength under combined stresses relative to uniaxial stress limits comparison between shell elements and solid elements shows that combined stress predicted by shell elements is much lower than solid elements fig 14 tsai wu and hashin results are almost identical for solid elements however hashin sf is higher than tsai wu for shell elements evaluation against the bv rule revealed that sf obtained by tsai wu and hashin does not fulfill the required while hoffman indicates sufficient strength around j 1 2 fig 15 shows values of minimum safety factor calculated using hoffman criteria plotted over the blade surface the results reveal that the critical stress region is located near blade root especially near the leading egde 5 conclusion this research applied fsi approach to evaluate the strength of composite marine propeller blades at a range of operating conditions against the requirement of bv classification society interlaminar normal stresses are shown to be the most critical mode of failure which necessitate using the solid model in the analysis tsai wu and hashin criteria showed an identical prediction of the safety factor in the solid model while hoffman predicted higher sf shell model underpredicted combined stress failure however tsai wu results are much closer to solid model results therefore when using shell elements it is recommended to apply tsai wu criteria although the minimum safety factor of combined stress at design condition j 1 2 is 4 6 however it does not meet that required by bv sfcs 5 7 yet at j 1 4 the strength requirements are met which insists that a thorough investigation of strength at all potential operating zone is indispensable sf of solid model acquired using hoffman criterion is the highest among other criteria though barely meets the requirement at the design condition credit

blade surface is plotted in fig 10 the values of bending moment on the blade moment around y axis and twisting moment moment around the z axis are depicted in fig 11 4 2 main stresses evaluation main stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 τ 12 τ 23 on the blade were evaluated individually on both shell elements and solid elements models failure will occur when any one of the stress components exceeds the corresponding strength in that direction at this part of the analysis main stresses are evaluated independently at each ply without considering the interactions between different failure modes fig 12 shows a comparison of the shell model and solid model in terms of predicted maximum stress components in the fiber direction perpendicular to the fiber direction in plane shear interlaminar shear and interlaminar normal stress the safety factor is calculated for each component relative to the stress limit of the laminate as shown in table 2 19 s a f e t y f a c t o r s f s t r e n g t h l i m i t

stresses on the blade against rules minimum safety factor is depicted in fig 12 shell element analysis indicates that interlaminar shear s 13 s 23 is the most critical determinant of safe operating zone while solid element results fig 13 indicated that the most critical main stress is the interlaminar normal stress s 3 4 3 combined stress analysis the propeller blade is subjected to multiaxial loads though material strength is defined for uniaxial tension compression and shear three composite failure criteria were adopted to express strength under combined stresses relative to uniaxial stress limits comparison between shell elements and solid elements shows that combined stress predicted by shell elements is much lower than solid elements fig 14 tsai wu and hashin results are almost identical for solid elements however hashin sf is higher than tsai wu for shell elements evaluation against the bv rule revealed that sf obtained by tsai wu and hashin does not fulfill the required while hoffman indicates sufficient strength around j 1 2 fig 15 shows values of minimum safety factor calculated using hoffman criteria plotted over the blade surface the results reveal that the critical stress region is located near blade root especially near the leading egde 5 conclusion this research applied fsi approach to evaluate the strength of composite marine propeller blades at a range of operating conditions against the requirement of bv classification society interlaminar normal stresses are shown to be the most critical mode of failure which necessitate using the solid model in the analysis tsai wu and hashin criteria showed an identical prediction of the safety factor in the solid model while hoffman predicted higher sf shell model underpredicted combined stress failure however tsai wu results are much closer to solid model results therefore when using shell elements it is recommended to apply tsai wu criteria although the minimum safety factor of combined stress at design condition j 1 2 is 4 6 however it does not meet that required by bv sfcs 5 7 yet at j 1 4 the strength requirements are met which insists that a thorough investigation of strength at all potential operating zone is indispensable sf of solid model acquired using hoffman criterion is the highest among other criteria though barely meets the requirement at the design condition credit

20391,in this paper vortex induced vibrations viv of deepwater risers including the viv induced tension fluctuations were simulated using a time domain viv model data from a large scale riser experiment was applied for correlation studies as a first step a new combination of in line and cross flow synchronization models with empirical parameters was proposed for better in line response prediction the performance of the improved load model was investigated based on a linear riser model the results showed that the in line response and its synchronization pattern were improved compared to the previous load model then the improved load model was combined with a non linear structural riser model to explore the effect of tension fluctuations as observed in the tests simulations showed that the tension fluctuations influenced the stability of viv and possibly decreased the resulting vibration amplitudes lastly the viv prediction performance of the load model was evaluated with respect to frequency contents stress levels and fatigue damage from the results it was found that the improved load model in combination with the non linear structural model reflected the response characteristics observed in the tests keywords vortex induced vibration large scale experiment synchronization time sharing process sheared current 1 introduction for a bluff body subjected to fluid flow vortices are formed in the wake and cause alternating lift and drag forces when the vortex shedding frequency becomes close to the eigenfrequencies of the body resulting in strong vibrations and this is referred to as vortex induced vibration viv viv causes fast accumulations of fatigue damages to marine risers due to a high frequency response there have been attempts to explore the physics of viv for several decades and it is revealed that viv is influenced by a large number of parameters relevant studies and findings were summarized by sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 based on short rigid cylinder test data moreover several long flexible pipe tests have been conducted to unveil characteristics of deepwater riser viv considering only tests with an aspect ratio length diameter l d above 1000 the first large scale riser test was performed in hanøytangen norway l d 3000 huse 1997 baarholm et al 2006 lie and kaasen 2006 mit research teams also conducted field tests of long flexible pipes in lake seneca l d 3671 and gulf stream l d 4198 usa vandiver et al 2006 2009 furthermore the norwegian deepwater programme ndp carried out a high mode viv test in marintek s ocean basin l d 1407 trim et al 2005 braaten and lie 2005 based on the test results the features of long flexible pipes viv were summarized voie et al 2016 a key feature of long flexible riser viv is the multi mode response due to the variable current throughout the water column multi mode viv responses in terms of amplitude and frequency may vary along the pipe and with time even under a stationary flow due to its instability larsen et al 2012 as a result of the high aspect ratio the mode order of cross flow cf vibrations may be relative high with traveling waves observed for mode orders exceeding about 10 the dynamic tension variations by the viv responses will be more significant for increasing flow speed and response mode orders even though the test setup is designed to minimize it there is generally a lack of understanding of how such structural non linearity can influence the viv process at high response mode orders semi empirical frequency domain models have been used by the industry vivana larsen et al 2017 shear7 vandiver and li 2005 and viva triantafyllou et al 1999 are representative methods for this approach all methods are based on hydrodynamic coefficients related to the flow velocity cross section parameters and the predicted response viv response is solved in the frequency domain based on a linear structural model which represents a fundamental limitation with respect to describing non stationary viv responses and non linear structural phenomena such as tension variation furthermore in order to describe the frequency and response variation in time and space two idealized concepts are introduced in some of these tools the space sharing concept or concurrent frequency was developed to describe the frequency competition in a sheared flow with multiple response frequencies while the time sharing concept or consecutive frequencies was proposed by swithenbank 2007 to explain the frequency variation in time however these concepts are approximations of the true physical process the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods can provide alternative solutions however cfd methods are requiring extensive computing resources and they are hence not suitable for design purposes as a result of the complexity in response behavior and the difficulties in developing engineering models that can capture the inherent physics a high safety factor is demanded in the design of deepwater risers against viv loads dnv gl 2017 therefore there is a need for developing more accurate viv prediction tools for deepwater riser systems as an alternative different time domain viv models have been proposed including wake oscillator and semi empirical models and the models can account for structural non linearities and time varying flow conditions the wake oscillator models are normally based on the van der pol equation in order to describe the wake and vortex shedding several wake oscillator models have been proposed in order to simulate two degrees of freedom viv however it has been found difficult to determine empirical parameters that can cover both free and forced oscillation tests facchinetti et al 2004 ogink and metrikine 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 for the semi empirical time domain models the vortex shedding forces are formulated by the utilization of empirical parameters a time domain coupled model of cross flow and in line il was proposed xue et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 the vortex shedding forces were formulated by the hydrodynamic coefficients being dependent on the non dimensional amplitude and frequency however the degree of validation of this model was limited another semi empirical time domain model for the cross flow load was introduced by thorsen et al 2014 which later was implemented as an additional load term to the classical morison s equation thorsen et al 2016 2017 basically the viv load term consists of a vortex shedding force coefficient and a synchronization model where the vortex shedding force coefficient determines the magnitude of the vortex shedding force a synchronization model has been introduced to model the phase difference between the instantaneous relative flow velocity and the vortex shedding forces in a local co ordinate system the initial cross flow load model has been systematically validated against a variety of model test data wu et al 2020a subsequently the load model was updated in order to include the in line terms ulveseter et al 2018 2019 the cross flow and in line coupled load model was tested for several flexible pipe experiments in a uniform current ulveseter et al 2019 the empirical parameters were obtained based on rigid cylinder tests with combined il and cf motion furthermore additional optimization of the coefficients was also performed in relation to sheared current condition by drengsrud 2019 as a step of further validation of this time domain viv model for high mode viv responses of deepwater riser systems additional verification was performed with respect to the hanøytangen experiment kim et al 2021 the two most recently updated and optimized parameter sets by ulveseter et al 2018 and drengsrud 2019 were applied to investigate the correlations between simulation and experiment although one of the parameter sets showed a relatively good correlation with the experiments problems were encountered in relation to particularly two aspects first of all predictions for the in line stresses were inaccurate and the frequency variation in time of the in line response was more narrow than the test data furthermore the linear structural model of the hanøytangen riser model was not adequate in order to represent the present experimental set up for the high flow speed cases where the tension variations became significant the tension variations were due to the viv and the boundary conditions of the hanøytangen riser model huse 1998 1999 huse et al 1999 by applying the hanøytangen test data as a basis for validation the main objective of the present study was to improve the time domain load viv model with respect to making it more suitable for deepwater riser viv prediction another main objective was to explore the effect of including the non linear structural features reflected in the actual experimental test set up in section 2 a detailed review of the test and non linearities embedded in the test are given in section 3 the linear and non linear structural modeling procedures applied for the test set up are explained the theoretical background for the previous and new time domain viv model is reviewed in section 4 the empirical parameter sets for the previous and proposed load models are summarized in the same section in section 5 the prediction performances of different in line load models and parameter sets are compared based on a linear structural model the load model that was found to provide the best correlation with the test results was then used to explore the effects of the test set up structural non linearities as included in section 6 the prediction accuracy of the improved load model and the non linear structural model is summarized in section 7 the main observations and conclusions are discussed in section 8 2 large scale model test of deepwater riser 2 1 descriptions of the hanøytangen experiment the main purpose of the test was to investigate the high mode viv responses of a riser in a linearly sheared current condition in the test the riser was towed by a vessel along the floating quay and transducers that were installed on the riser at every 3 m were measuring bi directional bending strains in order to expose the riser to a linearly sheared current the bottom end of the riser was kept tensioned using the buoyancy arrangements the magnitude of pretension in each test was controlled by the number of buoyancy tanks and the amount of water inside the tanks the pretensions were divided into low and high pretension the detailed set up of the tests is illustrated in fig 1a and the main data of the hanøytangen riser model are summarized in table 1 when it comes to the test procedure the towing started 25 m west of the center and ended at the opposite side in each test the location where the riser stood upright over the pulley was designated as the center the towing was not stable until reaching the designated velocity due to the acceleration at the early phase of the towing the test procedure is illustrated in fig 1b 2 2 non linearities caused by the test set up due to the test set up non linear effects were inevitably observed in the measurements the main non linearities associated with the test set up are classified as the low frequency components of the vessel motion and buoyancy arrangements below 1 hz the friction between the pulley and rope system 3 of the pretension axial vibrations of the riser due to the cross flow and in line vibrations 2 ω and 4 ω vibrations among these the viv induced tension fluctuations at the top of the riser were significant as the current speed increased as discussed in section 6 moreover some of the tests were excluded from the analysis due to large waves during the test and significant deviations of measurements when the towing speed was low the viv was dominated by low frequent vessel motion and these tests were excluded in the present study accordingly the number of tests analyzed in this study was 32 out of the 60 two pre tension levels were applied in the test and the number of tests in each pretension group was 14 t l o w and 18 t h i g h respectively 3 numerical modeling of the hanøytangen test the hanøytangen riser model was numerically modeled in riflex sintef ocean 2017a which is based on the 3 d finite element method fem the hydrodynamic bodies related to the towing procedure were modeled in the computer program simo sintef ocean 2017c which is developed for simulation of motions and station keeping behavior of floating bodies riflex simo coupled simulations were implemented by means of the integrated software sima sintef ocean 2017b 3 1 simplified and advanced modeling methods for the hanøytangen riser model the hanøytangen riser model was modeled in two ways i e by means of a linear structural model with simplified boundary conditions and an non linear structural model which includes non linear aspects of the test set up regarding the former the main simplifications is related to neglecting the vessel and buoyancy arrangements and assuming a constant tension at the bottom end of the riser all translations and torsional degrees of freedom were kept fixed while the bending moments were free furthermore the pretension in the test was replaced with constant tension at the top of the riser applying same boundary conditions as in the bottom except for the free vertical motion in addition the current load was modeled as a stationary and linearly sheared current this riser modeling method is hereafter referred to as a simplified riser model and its schematic is shown in fig 2a for the non linear structural model the buoyancy arrangements buoyancy connecting rope and pulley were connected to the bottom end of the riser however the pulleys just played the role of changing the direction of the load vector and it was not possible to model the friction between the pulley and connection rope due to software limitations the buoyancy was modeled as a floating body where the mass and volumetric displacement of buoyancy were adjusted in each test the drag coefficients were roughly estimated by referring to baker et al 1983 and the added mass coefficients were set to be 1 0 in all directions also universal joints were applied at both ends of the riser and a shroud attached at the bottom part furthermore a prescribed motion was applied at the vessel end where the towing speed was gradually increased until its stationary value characteristic for each simulation when the riser passed the center point while keeping a static equilibrium configuration towing was regarded as stable and ended at 25 m east from the center point this riser modeling procedure is hereafter referred to as an advanced riser model the details of the advanced riser model are illustrated in fig 2b and the detailed input parameters for the model are summarized in table 2 3 2 numerical input parameters and post processing of signal the element numbers and time step size for the simulations were set based on the estimation of the highest possible viv response frequency f v s t u m a x d e and the strouhal number s t was set to 0 17 the cross flow mode number was estimated by referring to the tensioned beam theory baarholm et al 2006 structural damping of the riser was assumed proportional to the system stiffness i e c α 2 k where c and k are the global damping and stiffness matrices α 2 was set corresponding to a damping ratio of 0 3 at the frequency f v for each test in order to exclude the low frequencies i e motions induced by the vessel and the buoyancy arrangements the low frequencies below 1 hz were filtered out for the bending moment and tension signals furthermore for the bending moments the upper bound of the frequency was set to be twice the shedding frequency f v in order to exclude higher order viv i e 3 ω and 4 ω and it was applied to both the tests and simulations regarding the tension signal a very broad filtering range was applied in order to involve the high frequency tension fluctuations the numerical simulation input parameters and filtering range are summarized in table 3 for the test data the relatively stable time series were extracted from the stable towing range for each case especially the section of the signal corresponding to when the vessel was close to the center point was preferred this is because as the vessel approaches the end point the inclination angle of the riser was increasing resulting in a decreasing mean tension and a variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients extracted signals included roughly 150 to 200 steady state cross flow periods even though the length of the time window was short it was valid for observing the viv responses larsen et al 2012 examples of tension and bending moment signals corresponding to the time window are illustrated in fig 3 the same time window as applied for each experiment was applied to extract the results from the advanced riser model simulations for the simplified riser model the time window was set to include 200 steady state cross flow periods 4 time domain viv model 4 1 hydrodynamic load model the time domain viv model is based on strip theory the load model is formulated in terms of the incoming flow vectors the cylinder response vectors and the hydrodynamic coefficients the vectors and local coordinate systems of a cylinder in the flow are illustrated in fig 4 the incoming flow vector at any cylinder cross section u can be decomposed into a normal subscript n and a tangential component subscript t to the cylinder strip only considering the normal components of the flow u n the interaction between hydrodynamic loads and structure response x n can be simplified into a two dimensional problem in the cylinder plane i e the j 1 j 2 plane j 3 is the unit vector in the axial direction of the cylinder the vortex shedding forces and drag force follow a local axis system where the horizontal axis is parallel to the relative flow velocity vector v n u n x n the direction of the vortex shedding forces will be changing as the relative flow changes however local cross flow and in line directions will be systematically referred to as cross flow and in line in the present study based on these definitions the hydrodynamic loads acting on a cylinder strip per unit length is expressed in eq 1 by ulveseter et al 2018 1 f n c m ρ π d e 2 4 u n froude kriloff force c m 1 ρ π d e 2 4 x n added mass force 1 2 ρ d e c d v n v n drag force f v x morison s equation 1 2 ρ d e c v x v n v n cos ϕ exc x in line vortex shedding force f v x 1 2 ρ d e c v y v n j 3 v n cos ϕ exc y cross flow vortex shedding force f v y vortex shedding force terms where the first three terms are well known terms from morison s equation and c m c d d e and ρ are the inertia coefficient drag coefficient cylinder diameter and fluid density the remaining two terms are the in line and cross flow vortex shedding force c v x and c v y are in line and cross flow vortex shedding force coefficients ϕ exc x and ϕ exc y are the in line and cross flow instantaneous phases of the vortex shedding forces the load model was intended to be expressed as simply as possible while still including the main viv physics regardless of the frequency or amplitude of viv the hydrodynamic coefficients i e c m c d c v x and c v y were assumed constant within the reynolds number range of the present study therefore the reynolds number must be accounted for when applying specific coefficients to another case this approach excludes consideration of the reynolds number effect which is still an area of research see potts et al 2018 4 2 cross flow and in line synchronization the magnitude of the vortex shedding forces calculated from the eq 1 is determined by the coefficients c v x and c v y at the same time the oscillation of the forces is implemented by the time varying instantaneous phases ϕ exc x and ϕ exc y to simulate the lock in process associated with viv synchronization models are applied to each direction ensuring that the instantaneous frequency of the vortex shedding force can increase or decrease so that its phase can match the phase of the instantaneous phase of the cylinder velocity the synchronization is limited to happen only in the non dimensional frequency range i e the synchronization range in the case of cross flow the instantaneous frequency of the cross flow can be formulated as eqs 2 and 3 thorsen et al 2017 2 d ϕ exc y d t 2 π f exc y 2 π v n d e f ˆ exc y 3 f ˆ exc y f ˆ 0 y f ˆ max y f ˆ 0 y sin θ y θ y 0 f ˆ 0 y f ˆ 0 y f ˆ min y sin θ y θ y 0 where f ˆ min y f ˆ max y and f ˆ 0 y determine the cross flow synchronization range and the non dimensional frequency of maximum energy transfer θ y is the phase difference between the cylinder cross flow velocity ϕ y rel and the cross flow vortex shedding force ϕ exc y i e θ y ϕ y rel ϕ exc y based on eqs 2 and 3 synchronization of the cross flow occurs in the range between f ˆ min y and f ˆ max y and the instantaneous phase of the cross flow vortex shedding force ϕ exc y is to be in phase with the cylinder cross flow velocity at the frequency f ˆ 0 y i e ϕ y rel ϕ exc y when it comes to the in line vibration there are two types of in line responses one is the pure in line response which takes place at low current speed another is the in line response induced by the cross flow response and this is of main interest in this study for the in line response induced by the cross flow response the experimental observations showed that the in line vortex shedding frequency is about twice that of the cross flow vortex shedding dahl et al 2010 the cross flow dependent in line synchronization was suggested by ulveseter et al 2018 4 d ϕ exc x d t 2 π d ϕ exc y d t 1 α sin ϕ x rel ϕ exc x where ϕ x rel is the instantaneous phase of the local in line velocity of the cylinder and α indicates how much the frequency of the in line force depends on that of the cross flow force when α is zero d ϕ exc x d t 2 d ϕ exc y d t 4 3 self limiting process and drag amplification the synchronization concept makes it possible to simulate the self limiting process using the load model in the excitation region defined by f ˆ min y and f ˆ max y the phase of the vortex shedding force is close to the phase of the relative velocity of the cylinder this means that the component of the vortex shedding force in phase with the velocity will provide positive energy to the structural response the out of phase force component becomes the inertia force the center of the synchronization is determined by the f ˆ 0 y value around which most of the force is in phase with the velocity at the same time the damping force is created by the drag load term which increases with motion amplitude the combination of these force terms determines the response as a self limiting process furthermore the inertia force consists of an out of phase component of the vortex shedding force and the additional added mass term in morison s equation refer to eq 1 besides the drag amplification can be described the drag amplification refers to increased drag forces due to the cross flow responses compared to that of a fixed cylinder this is accounted for by the projected force in the global incoming flow direction arising from the vortex shedding force term in eq 1 this means that the drag force term in eq 1 defines the initial static deformation in the in line direction in addition the deformation will be further increased in the dynamic analysis when the vortex shedding force is activated 4 4 improvement of in line vortex shedding term the motivation for the load model update was inaccurate in line predictions while applying the previous time domain viv model for the hanøytangen test kim et al 2021 the previous model was based on an in line synchronization model that was linked to the cross flow synchronization model ulveseter et al 2019 in an effort to improve the in line predictions a new combination of in line and cross flow load models with separate synchronization models is introduced 4 4 1 independent synchronization of in line vortex shedding force the in line synchronization model in the previous section had been tested and validated for the ndp high mode viv tests ulveseter et al 2019 drengsrud 2019 however it was still questionable with respect to the in line synchronization depending on the cross flow synchronization a coupled motion of the cross flow and in line oscillation is a result of the dual resonance dahl et al 2010 and the resonances in each direction are independent of each other according to the respective natural frequencies in the two directions to implement this feature the principle for cross flow synchronization was set to be the same as the previous one i e eqs 2 and 3 whereas a new in line synchronization formulation as expressed by eqs 5 and 6 is proposed for simultaneous cross flow and in line vibrations this model is basically the same model as proposed by ulveseter for pure in line vibration of pipeline free spans ulveseter et al 2017 the idea adopted here is to apply the same approach for the in line force component related to cross flow viv then in principle by applying a sufficiently wide synchronization range both pure in line and combined cross flow and in line vibrations can be captured by the same synchronization model 5 d ϕ exc x d t 2 π f exc x 2 π v n d e f ˆ exc x 6 f ˆ exc x f ˆ 0 x f ˆ max x f ˆ 0 x sin θ x θ x 0 f ˆ 0 x f ˆ 0 x f ˆ min x sin θ x θ x 0 where f ˆ min x f ˆ max x and f ˆ 0 x determines the in line synchronization range and the non dimensional frequency of maximum energy transfer θ x is the phase difference between the cylinder in line velocity ϕ x rel and the in line vortex shedding force ϕ exc x i e θ x ϕ x rel ϕ exc x 4 4 2 in line synchronization parameters to define the proper in line synchronization ranges information about the viv response characteristics of the hanøytangen riser model was required a comparison of viv response characteristics for different deepwater riser tests is provided in fig 5 the x axis gives the cross flow mode number n and the y axis gives the bending stiffness ratio f f n b f n t which is used to quantify the relative contribution of the bending stiffness to the total stiffness the test risers models can be modeled as a tensioned beam and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are given by the following equations 7 t e n s i o n e d b e a m f n t f n s 2 f n b 2 8 t e n s i o n e d s t r i n g f n s n 2 l t m 9 u n t e n s i o n e d b e a m f n b π n 2 2 l 2 e i m as seen in fig 5 for the hanøytangen riser model viv response mode order was relatively high and the stiffness of the structure was highly dominated by the bending stiffness compared to the same viv mode order as for miami ii and lake seneca in addition due to the shear flow condition the space sharing and time sharing processes associated with viv are both likely to be extensive this implies that the viv responses can be more unstable than other high mode riser model tests wu et al 2019 2020b to satisfy the test conditions one of the solutions would be by adjusting the number of viv modes participating in the responses when a large number of modes compete the dominating frequency of cross flow and in line may change in time for the hanøytangen test especially the time variation of the in line frequency was much more pronounced than for the other tests larsen et al 2012 kim et al 2021 therefore the in line synchronization range of the new load model needed to be wider than for the viv analysis of short and rigid pipes and this could be achieved by controlling the in line synchronization parameters to compare the performance of the new load model as a function of the in line synchronization parameters two empirical parameter sets were proposed for the first one all in line synchronization parameters had values that were twice those of the corresponding cross flow parameters as a result the in line frequency was about twice the cross flow frequency which coincides with the combined cross flow and in line vibration tests by dahl et al 2010 and it is referred to as the new1 model or narrow band synchronization nb for the second one the non dimensional frequency of the in line was set to between 0 1 and 0 7 and the maximum energy transfer would occur when the non dimensional frequency of the in line was 0 5 the parameters were estimated based on the results of the pure in line response tests aronsen 2007 ulveseter et al 2017 and it is referred to as the new2 model or the wide band synchronization model wb the previous model in eq 4 was also considered in order to compare with the new load model prediction performance referred to as prev the same c d c m c v y and c v x which were optimized by ulveseter et al 2018 were applied for all cases the empirical parameters of each load model are summarized in table 4 5 comparison of the in line load models based on simplified riser model the performance of the new load model was evaluated with respect to response levels and frequency prediction to focus on the load model performance only the simplified riser model was applied also the cases of high pretension were considered since this causes the interval between adjacent eigenfrequencies to become more narrow when the pretension increases as defined in eqs 7 to 9 this implies that the dominating frequency can be shifted easily into adjacent eigenfrequencies resulting in a wider synchronization range three test set ups were selected among the high tension cases and these comprise the lowest middle and highest current speeds u 0 38 m s 1 14 m s 1 96 m s the prev new1 and new2 load models were applied as basis for the time domain simulations 5 1 prediction of the synchronization range and dominating frequency wavelet analysis was applied in order to compare the frequency predictions the x axis y axis and the colormap of each wavelet represent the time frequency and strain psd wavelets were plotted for the cross flow and in line according to the current speed in fig 6 each figure included the test and simulation wavelets at three different locations these locations corresponded to the non dimensional coordinates z l 0 03 z l 0 33 and z l 0 93 where l is the riser length and z starts from the top of the riser the z l 0 33 was the location where the maximum stress was observed although the colormap scale of each plot was different from each other the main comparisons were the dominating frequency and change of the colormap in time the cross flow and in line results for the tests included the effect of the viv but also external loads which should be kept in mind as basis for the comparison as seen in figs 6a 6c and 6e the dominating frequencies of the cross flow showed a good correlation with respect to the measurements regardless of current speed locations and in line load models however the frequency variation of the cross flow in time i e time sharing process were different from each other which is likely to be related to different in line responses between the prev new1 and new2 models with respect to the in line frequency predictions seen in figs 6b 6d and 6f different frequency predictions were observed between the in line load models the time sharing processes and dominating frequency of prev were well predicted relative to the test results only for the lowest current speed in fig 6b the time sharing was getting irregular as the current speed increased as seen in figs 6d and 6e on the other hand the time sharing processes of the in line of the new1 and new2 models were regular regardless of the locations and current speeds however the in line synchronization ranges of new2 model were wider than that of new1 model and more similar to the test results in terms of the dominating frequency new1 gave better predictions than the new2 model for the low current velocity as seen in fig 6b however when the current speed increased the in line dominating frequency of new2 model was more accurate than for new1 model another difference in in line predictions between new1 model and new2 model was that the results of new1 showed the space sharing process near the bottom of the riser z l 0 93 the in line vibration synchronized not only with the high frequencies but also with the low frequencies due to the low current speed which also was observed in the test the results of new2 model showed weaker space sharing processes than those for new1 model for the previous load model the in line response was somewhat unstable and random because of its dependency on the cross flow synchronization however this lacking stability of the in line response was improved by introducing the independent in line synchronization and it was also able to describe different in line response characteristics in terms of the in line synchronization parameters new2 model fits the test results well with respect to the dominating frequency prediction and time sharing process however the prediction accuracy was lower than for the new1 model in the low velocity range and the space sharing process of new1 model was more realistic 5 2 stress and response characteristics of the new load model for the stress comparisons between new1 and new2 models the standard deviations std s of stress were calculated from the simulation for three different current speed cases the stds of stress induced by the cross flow and in line bending moments were calculated at every cross section and stds of stress were plotted along the riser length in fig 7 there were no significant differences in the cross flow results between new1 and new2 models regardless of the current speed as seen in figs 7a 7c and 7e on the other hand there were significant differences for the in line stress results for all the cases with different current magnitudes and the differences between the stress profiles were observed from the point where the maximum stress occurred z l is about 0 3 to the bottom end of the riser as shown in figs 7b 7d and 7f because of the higher in line mode order for new2 model than that of new1 model the in line stresses of new2 model were normally higher also as discussed in the previous section the space sharing process of new1 model was more dominant than for new2 model near the bottom of the riser this implies that new1 model was partially synchronized with the lower mode near the bottom end of the riser which might result in low stresses to illustrate the response characteristics depending on the parameter sets the trajectories of the viv motion for the lowest current speed are illustrated along the riser length in fig 8 the cross flow and in line responses were non dimensionalized with the diameter of the riser as seen in fig 8 the amplitude differences were not significant between new1 and new2 models except the in line amplitude at the lower part of the riser however the stability features of the response was different the trajectories of new1 model were more stable and varied along the riser while the results of new2 model showed chaotic responses in summary the in line response of the hanøytangen test showed a wide range of time sharing processes and unstable response due to the mode competition considering the results in figs 6 to 8 new2 model was found appropriate to describe the unstable viv response of the hanøytangen test in the following sections the new2 model was applied for all the time domain viv simulations the simulations with the simplified riser model are referred to as td s while td a hereafter refers to the advanced riser model 6 viv induced axial vibrations as discussed in section 2 2 tension fluctuations were observed at the top of the riser for all the tests and the magnitude of the tension variation increased for increasing towing speeds tension fluctuations are illustrated in relation to the riser configurations in fig 9 the riser in the flow is sagging due to the drag force relative to the initial configuration in fig 9a as shown in figs 9b and 9c correspondingly the riser oscillates twice i e runs through two periods in the vertical direction during one period of cross flow ω and in line 2 ω oscillation the frequencies of axial vibrations are 2 ω induced by the cross flow vibrations and twice that for the in line i e 4 ω induced by the in line vibration therefore the capabilities of the advanced riser model td a with respect to capturing such behavior are investigated in the following 6 1 axial non resonant vibrations caused by viv most of the tension fluctuations observed in the test and simulations where axial non resonant vibrations i e vibrations with a frequency outside the first axial vibration mode to quantify the top tension fluctuations statistically the coefficient of variation of the top tension t c o v t s t d t m e a n for td a and for the test are plotted in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the results for the cases with low tension t l o w were higher than those for the cases with high tension t h i g h both for the tests and the td a the low pretension decreased the system stiffness which allowed more tension fluctuation also the results of the test were amplified as the current speed increased regardless of tension magnitudes the axial vibrations induced by the cross flow are normally much higher than those induced by the in line since the magnitude of the axial vibrations is proportional to the square of amplitude in the case of the td a the results showed similar trends however the magnitude of the tension fluctuations were seen to be significantly lower than for the tests these differences might be related to the structural or the hydrodynamic damping viv response is more affected by hydrodynamic damping in the present study as the structural damping was low refer to section 3 2 the hydrodynamic damping force can be controlled by means of the drag coefficient c d or the vortex shedding forces c v x and c v y refer to eq 1 the sensitivities of tension fluctuations to the drag coefficients c d were investigated in order to throw light on this effect the results are plotted for the low and high current speed cases in fig 11 from the results in this figure the tension fluctuations of td a for both current speeds were getting similar to the test as the drag coefficient decreased however the lower drag coefficient than the proposed one allowed for large viv response and axial vibration the cross flow and in line vortex shedding force of the load model are correlated with the drag force term the drag force term in eq 1 leads to a smaller force due to the reduced c d value as a consequence of the decreased damping force both the in line and cross flow response amplitude and vortex shedding force will be amplified then the total force in the in line direction increases due to the higher projected vortex shedding force i e the increase of effective diameter in short the decrease of the drag coefficient does not necessarily mean a reduction of the total hydrodynamic damping the drag coefficient of the load model was set to be 1 2 which was based on fixed cylinder test data thorsen et al 2017 however the sensitivity analysis results suggested that the drag coefficient of flexible pipes could be smaller than 1 2 other uncertainties in the structural model may also contribute to the discrepancy e g there was no frictional force included in the pulley system and the vessel movement in the vertical direction was constrained hence excluding the effect of towing vessel mass and hydro static stiffness therefore rather than optimizing the empirical coefficients in the load model in order to agree as well as possible with the test results it was instead focused upon whether the tension fluctuation was captured by the simulations and how these were correlated to the overall viv response to compare the frequency of tension fluctuations between the test and the td a wavelet analysis was applied for both the tension and strain time series the low and high current speed results are illustrated in fig 12 figs 12a and 12b include the top tension z l 0 00 and the strain wavelets for two different in line and cross flow cases near the top end z l 0 03 and the point where maximum stress observed z l 0 33 the scales of the wavelets are different from each other however the correlation between the strains and the tension variations is clearly observed both for the tests and the td a for the low current speed in fig 12a the frequency of the tension is about twice that of the in line strain and its pattern is similar to the in line strains patterns at z l 0 03 for both the test and the td a for the case of the high current speed in fig 12b the results were similar to those for the low current speed case but the tension was dominated by the cross flow response the frequency variation and the dominating frequency were well predicted by the td a furthermore the frequency variations of the in line and cross flow strains were similar to each other at two points z l 0 03 and z l 0 33 for both the test and the td a this implies that the tension fluctuations affect the viv response not only near the top but also at other locations 6 2 axial resonant vibrations induced by the cross flow motion the axial resonant vibration occurs when the viv frequency coincides with the first mode of vibration in the axial direction of the riser resonance could be induced by both cross flow and in line effects but it was found that the cross flow induced resonance was the most severe for a steel riser the cross flow induced axial resonant vibration occurs when the current speed reaches the critical velocity formulated as below huse 1999 10 v c c d e 8 s t l where the v c is the critical velocity and c is the velocity of sound in steel 5130 m s for the hanøytangen riser the v c is about 1 26 m s when s t is 0 17 the equation was derived by assuming that the viv is high and single mode in uniform flow conditions however the dominating mode may vary in a sheared current due to the competition among the modes the axial resonant vibration could occur intermittently only when certain conditions are satisfied for the td a the cross flow was relatively stationary which caused axial resonance for the two cases to take place at the respective frequency which corresponded most to the critical velocity one of the cases i e the high velocity high tension case and the corresponding results from the test are analyzed in more detail in fig 13 the first row of figs 13a and 13b represents the tension signal at the top and the second row contains the wavelet for the tension psd the last row shows the contour of cross flow bending moment in time as observed from fig 13b the tension in the simulation gradually increased from 37 4 s and increased rapidly at 38 2 s when resonance is observed the cross flow bending moment significantly decreases not only near the top but also at the other locations this was referred to as to the feedback effect huse 1998 and might be due to the combination of an increase of dynamic stiffness and unstable viv response regarding the results from the test it was assumed that axial resonant vibrations were not fully developed as observed from fig 13a in order to compare the decrease of the stress due to the feedback effect the stds of the cross flow induced stresses are plotted along the riser length the results in fig 14a correspond to a lower current speed case with axial non resonant vibration furthermore the results in fig 14b correspond to a high current speed with axial resonant vibration taking place in the td a simulation in fig 14b an additional result of td a using a short time window where axial resonance is observed 38s 39s is included when the current speed increases it is expected that the stress levels will increase which is observed for the test results however the std of the stress for the td a simulation blue line is found to decrease somewhat as shown in fig 14b compared to that in fig 14a this is due to the axial resonance and when this occurs the stress near the top increases but the stress level at other locations decreases as seen from the black dot line in fig 14b it should also be kept in mind that the axial resonant vibration caused by in line effects was excluded from the discussion due to its relatively small magnitude however both for the tests and for the simulations axial vibration induced by in line effects can occur which can also influence the viv response however the td a capability of describing the axial resonance behavior observed in the test has been clearly demonstrated and as such represents a significant step forward with respect to viv modeling practice 7 validation of the new load model in this section the prediction performance of the new load model is evaluated and differences of viv predictions depending on the riser modeling choices discussed 7 1 differences of top tension between riser models to investigate the differences between td s and td a related to boundary conditions the percentwise errors in eq 11 were plotted as a function of current velocity in fig 15 11 t e r r o r t m e a n sim t m e a n exp t m e a n exp 100 it is seen that the errors of td s become larger when the current speed increases which is due to the top tension increase from the drag forces in order to obtain a similar top tension in the td s simulation to that for the tests the initial tension should be set to a level that reflected the drag force effect but no such optimization was performed however by analyzing the results obtained by the td a simulations it was seen that the relative errors were about 1 2 regardless of the current and tension level this implies that td a corresponds to a better riser modeling approach in order to represent the features of the tests 7 2 stress and frequency predictions for the stress comparisons the maximum standard deviation of the viv induced stress at each cross section was averaged along the riser length the results of td s and td a are compared in fig 16 both for the cross flow and in line cases the area below the diagonal line in figs 16a and 16b indicates which cases that give predictions that are lower than for the tests and the area above the diagonal corresponds to overprediction generally tests and both simulations showed good correlations however the td s tends to overestimate more than td a for both the cross flow and the in line cases the higher pretension of td s increased the eigenfrequency of the riser and resulted in higher mode viv in addition the tension fluctuations of td a gave rise to energy transfer in the axial direction of the riser as seen in fig 16a two cases of td a showed much lower stress results due to axial resonant vibrations when it comes to frequency prediction the peak frequency of the strain psd was defined as the dominating frequencies and the dominating frequency at z l 0 33 were compared to each other comparisons were made in the same way as for the mean std stress comparison provided by fig 17 overall the results of td s were more conservative than td a because of the higher pretension and showed a good correlation with the test for both cross flow and in line however it was difficult to conclude on the prediction accuracy due to the uncertainty of the empirical parameters as discussed in section 6 furthermore the in line results of td s and td a in fig 17b were more scattered than those for the cross flow to gain insights on the viv frequency along the riser the wavelets of the strains were compared for all methods at three different locations the most tension dominated cases and bending stiffness dominated cases were selected and results are shown in fig 18 in the case of the viv synchronization at low current speed as shown in figs 18a and 18b the synchronization ranges of td s and td a were similar to the test regardless of the locations however for the bending stiffness dominated case in figs 18c and 18d the frequency variation patterns of both td s and td a became irregular due to the instability of the viv response furthermore in the case of td s there were no significant differences in frequency characteristics according to the locations however as shown in figs 18c and 18d the results for the td a near the top displayed some irregularities due to tension fluctuations and a weak space sharing was also observed near the bottom in short although the results in fig 17 shows that td s gave better frequency predictions than td a the td a reflects the characteristics of the tests better the time and space sharing could be simulated simultaneously by application of the new in line load model combined with the td a which was able to reflect the test characteristics more adequately 7 3 fatigue damage predictions in order to compare the fatigue damage the maximum fatigue damage around the circumference at each cross section was plotted along the riser in fig 19 the fatigue damage was calculated using the bending stresses and the rainflow counting method which is implemented in the wafo matlab toolbox brodtkorb et al 2000 was applied the material constant log a was 11 687 and the slope of the s n curve k was 3 baarholm et al 2006 the results in fig 19 comprise a total of 6 cases that are distinguished by the tension levels and current speeds when it comes to the overall trends the high pretension results from the td a simulation in figs 19b 19c and 19d are relatively more irregular than the results of the low pretension cases in figs 19a 19c and 19e this was related to the number of modes participating in viv response as discussed in section 5 on the other hand in the case of td s all cases showed a stable fatigue damage profile a possible explanation is that the viv responses at each cross section were not coupled with the response of the other cross section furthermore the differences in the mode shape and the location of maximum fatigue damage between td s and td a were observed as seen in fig 19c which showed a more stable profile than other cases comparing the results in terms of the current speed for the low current speed when the in line is relatively dominant the prediction of td a showed better performance than that of td s as seen in figs 19a and 19b especially for the high tension cases although there was inconsistency in the lower part of the riser due to weak space sharing processes the irregularity of the profile was well predicted for the middle current speeds the dominance of the cross flow of the response is getting increased so that both in line and cross flow effects are important the axial non resonant vibration by both responses made the stability of response worse therefore the fatigue damages of the test were more evenly distributed along the riser than in low and high current speed cases as seen in figs 19c and 19d this means that the prediction accuracy of td a for the middle current speed will be lower than for the other current speed cases in the case of high current speed when the cross flow was dominant td s was found to be conservative while td a showed good correlation with the test results as seen in figs 19e and 19f in order to evaluate the fatigue damages for all cases the mean value of the fatigue along the whole riser was compared for the tests versus the simulations and a corresponding bias factor was defined i e λ f a t d m e a n sim d m e a n exp here d m e a n exp is the average of the fatigue damage at each sensor and d m e a n sim is the fatigue damage at the sensor locations which is estimated based on the results from the simulations the bias factor λ f a t is plotted as a function of current velocity according to the pretension level in fig 20 for low current speeds both the td s and the td a underpredict the fatigue damage while for increasing speeds they both overpredict the damage for the low tension cases as seen in fig 20a the results from the td a simulations showed a good correlation with the results from the test with a bias factor of 2 or less although the results for the intermediate current speeds are somewhat irregular for the high tension cases the td a gives even better predictions than for low tension as seen from fig 20b although the results in fig 20 only includes a comparison of the average fatigue damage the corresponding results in terms of the ratio between the values of the maximum fatigue damage is less than 4 regarding results from the td s simulations the bias factor is somewhat higher than for the td a in the case of high pretension for low pretension the bias factor is smaller than for td a for current velocities up to around 1 0 while above this value the ratio becomes higher than for td a 8 conclusions in the present study numerical simulations of the hanøytangen tests were performed in order to develop an improved time domain viv model that is suitable for the estimation of deepwater riser viv the main characteristics of the hanøytangen tests related to viv corresponded to a high mode viv response bending stiffness dominated behavior and sheared current when it comes to the prediction performance of the new load model the following notable results were obtained the improved in line synchronization concept is found to be reasonable in term of dominating frequency and time sharing prediction and it is found to be more robust with respect to modeling the in line response characteristics than the previous load model the improved load model with narrow synchronization bandwidth new1 gave a good prediction of the frequency at low current speeds and showed good performance with respect to representation of the space sharing process on the other hand the load model with wide synchronization bandwidth new2 gave good predictions of the frequency and a good representation of the time sharing process for the higher current speeds the new2 model is found to be favorable with respect to predicting deepwater riser viv responses characterized by a wide in line vibration frequency variation range due to the high mode viv and the sheared current in addition a comparison was made of the viv predictions based on the simplified linear and advanced non linear riser models the advanced riser model increased the viv prediction accuracy by capturing the main non linear effects inherent in the test due to tension fluctuations the insights based on the tension fluctuations can be summarized as the axial non resonant vibrations could be adequately simulated by the new load models although the degree of tension variations was quite different from the test the frequency characteristics of the tension variations were well predicted the tension fluctuation differences between tests and simulations seem to be related to the magnitude of viv responses the hydrodynamic damping is one of the contributing parameters to be further investigated resonant axial vibrations were observed in the simulation and it was observed that the viv response possibly decreases when axial resonant vibration occurs the tension fluctuations affect the stability of the viv process and thereby the prediction uncertainties along the riser therefore non linear time domain analysis needs to be considered for riser systems with large tension fluctuations from the present study it was demonstrated that not only good quality of the viv prediction model itself but also accurate structural modeling is required in order to achieve precise estimates and explain the inherent physics the proposed load model was found capable of capturing the key characteristics of the deepwater riser subjected to high mode viv responses however there are still uncertainties related to prediction accuracy especially with respect to hydrodynamic damping and other load coefficients the uncertainties associated with these empirical parameters need to be reduced by means of additional correlation studies based on suitable test data credit authorship contribution statement sang woo kim conceptualization methodology

20391,in this paper vortex induced vibrations viv of deepwater risers including the viv induced tension fluctuations were simulated using a time domain viv model data from a large scale riser experiment was applied for correlation studies as a first step a new combination of in line and cross flow synchronization models with empirical parameters was proposed for better in line response prediction the performance of the improved load model was investigated based on a linear riser model the results showed that the in line response and its synchronization pattern were improved compared to the previous load model then the improved load model was combined with a non linear structural riser model to explore the effect of tension fluctuations as observed in the tests simulations showed that the tension fluctuations influenced the stability of viv and possibly decreased the resulting vibration amplitudes lastly the viv prediction performance of the load model was evaluated with respect to frequency contents stress levels and fatigue damage from the results it was found that the improved load model in combination with the non linear structural model reflected the response characteristics observed in the tests keywords vortex induced vibration large scale experiment synchronization time sharing process sheared current 1 introduction for a bluff body subjected to fluid flow vortices are formed in the wake and cause alternating lift and drag forces when the vortex shedding frequency becomes close to the eigenfrequencies of the body resulting in strong vibrations and this is referred to as vortex induced vibration viv viv causes fast accumulations of fatigue damages to marine risers due to a high frequency response there have been attempts to explore the physics of viv for several decades and it is revealed that viv is influenced by a large number of parameters relevant studies and findings were summarized by sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 based on short rigid cylinder test data moreover several long flexible pipe tests have been conducted to unveil characteristics of deepwater riser viv considering only tests with an aspect ratio length diameter l d above 1000 the first large scale riser test was performed in hanøytangen norway l d 3000 huse 1997 baarholm et al 2006 lie and kaasen 2006 mit research teams also conducted field tests of long flexible pipes in lake seneca l d 3671 and gulf stream l d 4198 usa vandiver et al 2006 2009 furthermore the norwegian deepwater programme ndp carried out a high mode viv test in marintek s ocean basin l d 1407 trim et al 2005 braaten and lie 2005 based on the test results the features of long flexible pipes viv were summarized voie et al 2016 a key feature of long flexible riser viv is the multi mode response due to the variable current throughout the water column multi mode viv responses in terms of amplitude and frequency may vary along the pipe and with time even under a stationary flow due to its instability larsen et al 2012 as a result of the high aspect ratio the mode order of cross flow cf vibrations may be relative high with traveling waves observed for mode orders exceeding about 10 the dynamic tension variations by the viv responses will be more significant for increasing flow speed and response mode orders even though the test setup is designed to minimize it there is generally a lack of understanding of how such structural non linearity can influence the viv process at high response mode orders semi empirical frequency domain models have been used by the industry vivana larsen et al 2017 shear7 vandiver and li 2005 and viva triantafyllou et al 1999 are representative methods for this approach all methods are based on hydrodynamic coefficients related to the flow velocity cross section parameters and the predicted response viv response is solved in the frequency domain based on a linear structural model which represents a fundamental limitation with respect to describing non stationary viv responses and non linear structural phenomena such as tension variation furthermore in order to describe the frequency and response variation in time and space two idealized concepts are introduced in some of these tools the space sharing concept or concurrent frequency was developed to describe the frequency competition in a sheared flow with multiple response frequencies while the time sharing concept or consecutive frequencies was proposed by swithenbank 2007 to explain the frequency variation in time however these concepts are approximations of the true physical process the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods can provide alternative solutions however cfd methods are requiring extensive computing resources and they are hence not suitable for design purposes as a result of the complexity in response behavior and the difficulties in developing engineering models that can capture the inherent physics a high safety factor is demanded in the design of deepwater risers against viv loads dnv gl 2017 therefore there is a need for developing more accurate viv prediction tools for deepwater riser systems as an alternative different time domain viv models have been proposed including wake oscillator and semi empirical models and the models can account for structural non linearities and time varying flow conditions the wake oscillator models are normally based on the van der pol equation in order to describe the wake and vortex shedding several wake oscillator models have been proposed in order to simulate two degrees of freedom viv however it has been found difficult to determine empirical parameters that can cover both free and forced oscillation tests facchinetti et al 2004 ogink and metrikine 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 for the semi empirical time domain models the vortex shedding forces are formulated by the utilization of empirical parameters a time domain coupled model of cross flow and in line il was proposed xue et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 the vortex shedding forces were formulated by the hydrodynamic coefficients being dependent on the non dimensional amplitude and frequency however the degree of validation of this model was limited another semi empirical time domain model for the cross flow load was introduced by thorsen et al 2014 which later was implemented as an additional load term to the classical morison s equation thorsen et al 2016 2017 basically the viv load term consists of a vortex shedding force coefficient and a synchronization model where the vortex shedding force coefficient determines the magnitude of the vortex shedding force a synchronization model has been introduced to model the phase difference between the instantaneous relative flow velocity and the vortex shedding forces in a local co ordinate system the initial cross flow load model has been systematically validated against a variety of model test data wu et al 2020a subsequently the load model was updated in order to include the in line terms ulveseter et al 2018 2019 the cross flow and in line coupled load model was tested for several flexible pipe experiments in a uniform current ulveseter et al 2019 the empirical parameters were obtained based on rigid cylinder tests with combined il and cf motion furthermore additional optimization of the coefficients was also performed in relation to sheared current condition by drengsrud 2019 as a step of further validation of this time domain viv model for high mode viv responses of deepwater riser systems additional verification was performed with respect to the hanøytangen experiment kim et al 2021 the two most recently updated and optimized parameter sets by ulveseter et al 2018 and drengsrud 2019 were applied to investigate the correlations between simulation and experiment although one of the parameter sets showed a relatively good correlation with the experiments problems were encountered in relation to particularly two aspects first of all predictions for the in line stresses were inaccurate and the frequency variation in time of the in line response was more narrow than the test data furthermore the linear structural model of the hanøytangen riser model was not adequate in order to represent the present experimental set up for the high flow speed cases where the tension variations became significant the tension variations were due to the viv and the boundary conditions of the hanøytangen riser model huse 1998 1999 huse et al 1999 by applying the hanøytangen test data as a basis for validation the main objective of the present study was to improve the time domain load viv model with respect to making it more suitable for deepwater riser viv prediction another main objective was to explore the effect of including the non linear structural features reflected in the actual experimental test set up in section 2 a detailed review of the test and non linearities embedded in the test are given in section 3 the linear and non linear structural modeling procedures applied for the test set up are explained the theoretical background for the previous and new time domain viv model is reviewed in section 4 the empirical parameter sets for the previous and proposed load models are summarized in the same section in section 5 the prediction performances of different in line load models and parameter sets are compared based on a linear structural model the load model that was found to provide the best correlation with the test results was then used to explore the effects of the test set up structural non linearities as included in section 6 the prediction accuracy of the improved load model and the non linear structural model is summarized in section 7 the main observations and conclusions are discussed in section 8 2 large scale model test of deepwater riser 2 1 descriptions of the hanøytangen experiment the main purpose of the test was to investigate the high mode viv responses of a riser in a linearly sheared current condition in the test the riser was towed by a vessel along the floating quay and transducers that were installed on the riser at every 3 m were measuring bi directional bending strains in order to expose the riser to a linearly sheared current the bottom end of the riser was kept tensioned using the buoyancy arrangements the magnitude of pretension in each test was controlled by the number of buoyancy tanks and the amount of water inside the tanks the pretensions were divided into low and high pretension the detailed set up of the tests is illustrated in fig 1a and the main data of the hanøytangen riser model are summarized in table 1 when it comes to the test procedure the towing started 25 m west of the center and ended at the opposite side in each test the location where the riser stood upright over the pulley was designated as the center the towing was not stable until reaching the designated velocity due to the acceleration at the early phase of the towing the test procedure is illustrated in fig 1b 2 2 non linearities caused by the test set up due to the test set up non linear effects were inevitably observed in the measurements the main non linearities associated with the test set up are classified as the low frequency components of the vessel motion and buoyancy arrangements below 1 hz the friction between the pulley and rope system 3 of the pretension axial vibrations of the riser due to the cross flow and in line vibrations 2 ω and 4 ω vibrations among these the viv induced tension fluctuations at the top of the riser were significant as the current speed increased as discussed in section 6 moreover some of the tests were excluded from the analysis due to large waves during the test and significant deviations of measurements when the towing speed was low the viv was dominated by low frequent vessel motion and these tests were excluded in the present study accordingly the number of tests analyzed in this study was 32 out of the 60 two pre tension levels were applied in the test and the number of tests in each pretension group was 14 t l o w and 18 t h i g h respectively 3 numerical modeling of the hanøytangen test the hanøytangen riser model was numerically modeled in riflex sintef ocean 2017a which is based on the 3 d finite element method fem the hydrodynamic bodies related to the towing procedure were modeled in the computer program simo sintef ocean 2017c which is developed for simulation of motions and station keeping behavior of floating bodies riflex simo coupled simulations were implemented by means of the integrated software sima sintef ocean 2017b 3 1 simplified and advanced modeling methods for the hanøytangen riser model the hanøytangen riser model was modeled in two ways i e by means of a linear structural model with simplified boundary conditions and an non linear structural model which includes non linear aspects of the test set up regarding the former the main simplifications is related to neglecting the vessel and buoyancy arrangements and assuming a constant tension at the bottom end of the riser all translations and torsional degrees of freedom were kept fixed while the bending moments were free furthermore the pretension in the test was replaced with constant tension at the top of the riser applying same boundary conditions as in the bottom except for the free vertical motion in addition the current load was modeled as a stationary and linearly sheared current this riser modeling method is hereafter referred to as a simplified riser model and its schematic is shown in fig 2a for the non linear structural model the buoyancy arrangements buoyancy connecting rope and pulley were connected to the bottom end of the riser however the pulleys just played the role of changing the direction of the load vector and it was not possible to model the friction between the pulley and connection rope due to software limitations the buoyancy was modeled as a floating body where the mass and volumetric displacement of buoyancy were adjusted in each test the drag coefficients were roughly estimated by referring to baker et al 1983 and the added mass coefficients were set to be 1 0 in all directions also universal joints were applied at both ends of the riser and a shroud attached at the bottom part furthermore a prescribed motion was applied at the vessel end where the towing speed was gradually increased until its stationary value characteristic for each simulation when the riser passed the center point while keeping a static equilibrium configuration towing was regarded as stable and ended at 25 m east from the center point this riser modeling procedure is hereafter referred to as an advanced riser model the details of the advanced riser model are illustrated in fig 2b and the detailed input parameters for the model are summarized in table 2 3 2 numerical input parameters and post processing of signal the element numbers and time step size for the simulations were set based on the estimation of the highest possible viv response frequency f v s t u m a x d e and the strouhal number s t was set to 0 17 the cross flow mode number was estimated by referring to the tensioned beam theory baarholm et al 2006 structural damping of the riser was assumed proportional to the system stiffness i e c α 2 k where c and k are the global damping and stiffness matrices α 2 was set corresponding to a damping ratio of 0 3 at the frequency f v for each test in order to exclude the low frequencies i e motions induced by the vessel and the buoyancy arrangements the low frequencies below 1 hz were filtered out for the bending moment and tension signals furthermore for the bending moments the upper bound of the frequency was set to be twice the shedding frequency f v in order to exclude higher order viv i e 3 ω and 4 ω and it was applied to both the tests and simulations regarding the tension signal a very broad filtering range was applied in order to involve the high frequency tension fluctuations the numerical simulation input parameters and filtering range are summarized in table 3 for the test data the relatively stable time series were extracted from the stable towing range for each case especially the section of the signal corresponding to when the vessel was close to the center point was preferred this is because as the vessel approaches the end point the inclination angle of the riser was increasing resulting in a decreasing mean tension and a variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients extracted signals included roughly 150 to 200 steady state cross flow periods even though the length of the time window was short it was valid for observing the viv responses larsen et al 2012 examples of tension and bending moment signals corresponding to the time window are illustrated in fig 3 the same time window as applied for each experiment was applied to extract the results from the advanced riser model simulations for the simplified riser model the time window was set to include 200 steady state cross flow periods 4 time domain viv model 4 1 hydrodynamic load model the time domain viv model is based on strip theory the load model is formulated in terms of the incoming flow vectors the cylinder response vectors and the hydrodynamic coefficients the vectors and local coordinate systems of a cylinder in the flow are illustrated in fig 4 the incoming flow vector at any cylinder cross section u can be decomposed into a normal subscript n and a tangential component subscript t to the cylinder strip only considering the normal components of the flow u n the interaction between hydrodynamic loads and structure response x n can be simplified into a two dimensional problem in the cylinder plane i e the j 1 j 2 plane j 3 is the unit vector in the axial direction of the cylinder the vortex shedding forces and drag force follow a local axis system where the horizontal axis is parallel to the relative flow velocity vector v n u n x n the direction of the vortex shedding forces will be changing as the relative flow changes however local cross flow and in line directions will be systematically referred to as cross flow and in line in the present study based on these definitions the hydrodynamic loads acting on a cylinder strip per unit length is expressed in eq 1 by ulveseter et al 2018 1 f n c m ρ π d e 2 4 u n froude kriloff force c m 1 ρ π d e 2 4 x n added

shedding force f v y vortex shedding force terms where the first three terms are well known terms from morison s equation and c m c d d e and ρ are the inertia coefficient drag coefficient cylinder diameter and fluid density the remaining two terms are the in line and cross flow vortex shedding force c v x and c v y are in line and cross flow vortex shedding force coefficients ϕ exc x and ϕ exc y are the in line and cross flow instantaneous phases of the vortex shedding forces the load model was intended to be expressed as simply as possible while still including the main viv physics regardless of the frequency or amplitude of viv the hydrodynamic coefficients i e c m c d c v x and c v y were assumed constant within the reynolds number range of the present study therefore the reynolds number must be accounted for when applying specific coefficients to another case this approach excludes consideration of the reynolds number effect which is still an area of research see potts et al 2018 4 2 cross flow and in line synchronization the magnitude of the vortex shedding forces calculated from the eq 1 is determined by the coefficients c v x and c v y at the same time the oscillation of the forces is implemented by the time varying instantaneous phases ϕ exc x and ϕ exc y to simulate the lock in process associated with viv synchronization models are applied to each direction ensuring that the instantaneous frequency of the vortex shedding force can increase or decrease so that its phase can match the phase of the instantaneous phase of the cylinder velocity the synchronization is limited to happen only in the non dimensional frequency range i e the synchronization range in the case of cross flow the instantaneous frequency of the cross flow can be formulated as eqs 2 and 3 thorsen et al 2017 2 d ϕ exc y d t 2 π f exc y 2 π v n d e f ˆ exc y 3 f ˆ exc y f ˆ 0 y f ˆ max y f ˆ 0 y sin θ y θ y 0 f ˆ 0 y f ˆ 0 y f ˆ min y sin θ y θ y 0 where f ˆ min y f ˆ max y and f ˆ 0 y determine the cross flow synchronization range and the non dimensional frequency of maximum energy transfer θ y is the phase difference between the cylinder cross flow velocity ϕ y rel and the cross flow vortex shedding force ϕ exc y i e θ y ϕ y rel ϕ exc y based on eqs 2 and 3 synchronization of the cross flow occurs in the range between f ˆ min y and f ˆ max y and the instantaneous phase of the cross flow vortex shedding force ϕ exc y is to be in phase with the cylinder cross flow velocity at the frequency f ˆ 0 y i e ϕ y rel ϕ exc y when it comes to the in line vibration there are two types of in line responses one is the pure in line response which takes place at low current speed another is the in line response induced by the cross flow response and this is of main interest in this study for the in line response induced by the cross flow response the experimental observations showed that the in line vortex shedding frequency is about twice that of the cross flow vortex shedding dahl et al 2010 the cross flow dependent in line synchronization was suggested by ulveseter et al 2018 4 d ϕ exc x d t 2 π d ϕ exc y d t 1 α sin ϕ x rel ϕ exc x where ϕ x rel is the instantaneous phase of the local in line velocity of the cylinder and α indicates how much the frequency of the in line force depends on that of the cross flow force when α is zero d ϕ exc x d t 2 d ϕ exc y d t 4 3 self limiting process and drag amplification the synchronization concept makes it possible to simulate the self limiting process using the load model in the excitation region defined by f ˆ min y and f ˆ max y the phase of the vortex shedding force is close to the phase of the relative velocity of the cylinder this means that the component of the vortex shedding force in phase with the velocity will provide positive energy to the structural response the out of phase force component becomes the inertia force the center of the synchronization is determined by the f ˆ 0 y value around which most of the force is in phase with the velocity at the same time the damping force is created by the drag load term which increases with motion amplitude the combination of these force terms determines the response as a self limiting process furthermore the inertia force consists of an out of phase component of the vortex shedding force and the additional added mass term in morison s equation refer to eq 1 besides the drag amplification can be described the drag amplification refers to increased drag forces due to the cross flow responses compared to that of a fixed cylinder this is accounted for by the projected force in the global incoming flow direction arising from the vortex shedding force term in eq 1 this means that the drag force term in eq 1 defines the initial static deformation in the in line direction in addition the deformation will be further increased in the dynamic analysis when the vortex shedding force is activated 4 4 improvement of in line vortex shedding term the motivation for the load model update was inaccurate in line predictions while applying the previous time domain viv model for the hanøytangen test kim et al 2021 the previous model was based on an in line synchronization model that was linked to the cross flow synchronization model ulveseter et al 2019 in an effort to improve the in line predictions a new combination of in line and cross flow load models with separate synchronization models is introduced 4 4 1 independent synchronization of in line vortex shedding force the in line synchronization model in the previous section had been tested and validated for the ndp high mode viv tests ulveseter et al 2019 drengsrud 2019 however it was still questionable with respect to the in line synchronization depending on the cross flow synchronization a coupled motion of the cross flow and in line oscillation is a result of the dual resonance dahl et al 2010 and the resonances in each direction are independent of each other according to the respective natural frequencies in the two directions to implement this feature the principle for cross flow synchronization was set to be the same as the previous one i e eqs 2 and 3 whereas a new in line synchronization formulation as expressed by eqs 5 and 6 is proposed for simultaneous cross flow and in line vibrations this model is basically the same model as proposed by ulveseter for pure in line vibration of pipeline free spans ulveseter et al 2017 the idea adopted here is to apply the same approach for the in line force component related to cross flow viv then in principle by applying a sufficiently wide synchronization range both pure in line and combined cross flow and in line vibrations can be captured by the same synchronization model 5 d ϕ exc x d t 2 π f

range and the non dimensional frequency of maximum energy transfer θ x is the phase difference between the cylinder in line velocity ϕ x rel and the in line vortex shedding force ϕ exc x i e θ x ϕ x rel ϕ exc x 4 4 2 in line synchronization parameters to define the proper in line synchronization ranges information about the viv response characteristics of the hanøytangen riser model was required a comparison of viv response characteristics for different deepwater riser tests is provided in fig 5 the x axis gives the cross flow mode number n and the y axis gives the bending stiffness ratio f f n b f n t which is used to quantify the relative contribution of the bending stiffness to the total stiffness the test risers models can be modeled as a tensioned beam and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are given by the following equations 7 t e n s i o n e d b e a m f n t f n s 2 f n b 2 8 t e n s i o n e d s t r i n g f n s n 2 l t m 9 u n t e n s i o n e d b e a m f n b π n 2 2 l 2 e i m as seen in fig 5 for the hanøytangen riser model viv response mode order was relatively high and the stiffness of the structure was highly dominated by the bending stiffness compared to the same viv mode order as for miami ii and lake seneca in addition due to the shear flow condition the space sharing and time sharing processes associated with viv are both likely to be extensive this implies that the viv responses can be more unstable than other high mode riser model tests wu et al 2019 2020b to satisfy the test conditions one of the solutions would be by adjusting the number of viv modes participating in the responses when a large number of modes compete the dominating frequency of cross flow and in line may change in time for the hanøytangen test especially the time variation of the in line frequency was much more pronounced than for the other tests larsen et al 2012 kim et al 2021 therefore the in line synchronization range of the new load model needed to be wider than for the viv analysis of short and rigid pipes and this could be achieved by controlling the in line synchronization parameters to compare the performance of the new load model as a function of the in line synchronization parameters two empirical parameter sets were proposed for the first one all in line synchronization parameters had values that were twice those of the corresponding cross flow parameters as a result the in line frequency was about twice the cross flow frequency which coincides with the combined cross flow and in line vibration tests by dahl et al 2010 and it is referred to as the new1 model or narrow band synchronization nb for the second one the non dimensional frequency of the in line was set to between 0 1 and 0 7 and the maximum energy transfer would occur when the non dimensional frequency of the in line was 0 5 the parameters were estimated based on the results of the pure in line response tests aronsen 2007 ulveseter et al 2017 and it is referred to as the new2 model or the wide band synchronization model wb the previous model in eq 4 was also considered in order to compare with the new load model prediction performance referred to as prev the same c d c m c v y and c v x which were optimized by ulveseter et al 2018 were applied for all cases the empirical parameters of each load model are summarized in table 4 5 comparison of the in line load models based on simplified riser model the performance of the new load model was evaluated with respect to response levels and frequency prediction to focus on the load model performance only the simplified riser model was applied also the cases of high pretension were considered since this causes the interval between adjacent eigenfrequencies to become more narrow when the pretension increases as defined in eqs 7 to 9 this implies that the dominating frequency can be shifted easily into adjacent eigenfrequencies resulting in a wider synchronization range three test set ups were selected among the high tension cases and these comprise the lowest middle and highest current speeds u 0 38 m s 1 14 m s 1 96 m s the prev new1 and new2 load models were applied as basis for the time domain simulations 5 1 prediction of the synchronization range and dominating frequency wavelet analysis was applied in order to compare the frequency predictions the x axis y axis and the colormap of each wavelet represent the time frequency and strain psd wavelets were plotted for the cross flow and in line according to the current speed in fig 6 each figure included the test and simulation wavelets at three different locations these locations corresponded to the non dimensional coordinates z l 0 03 z l 0 33 and z l 0 93 where l is the riser length and z starts from the top of the riser the z l 0 33 was the location where the maximum stress was observed although the colormap scale of each plot was different from each other the main comparisons were the dominating frequency and change of the colormap in time the cross flow and in line results for the tests included the effect of the viv but also external loads which should be kept in mind as basis for the comparison as seen in figs 6a 6c and 6e the dominating frequencies of the cross flow showed a good correlation with respect to the measurements regardless of current speed locations and in line load models however the frequency variation of the cross flow in time i e time sharing process were different from each other which is likely to be related to different in line responses between the prev new1 and new2 models with respect to the in line frequency predictions seen in figs 6b 6d and 6f different frequency predictions were observed between the in line load models the time sharing processes and dominating frequency of prev were well predicted relative to the test results only for the lowest current speed in fig 6b the time sharing was getting irregular as the current speed increased as seen in figs 6d and 6e on the other hand the time sharing processes of the in line of the new1 and new2 models were regular regardless of the locations and current speeds however the in line synchronization ranges of new2 model were wider than that of new1 model and more similar to the test results in terms of the dominating frequency new1 gave better predictions than the new2 model for the low current velocity as seen in fig 6b however when the current speed increased the in line dominating frequency of new2 model was more accurate than for new1 model another difference in in line predictions between new1 model and new2 model was that the results of new1 showed the space sharing process near the bottom of the riser z l 0 93 the in line vibration synchronized not only with the high frequencies but also with the low frequencies due to the low current speed which also was observed in the test the results of new2 model showed weaker space sharing processes than those for new1 model for the previous load model the in line response was somewhat unstable and random because of its dependency on the cross flow synchronization however this lacking stability of the in line response was improved by introducing the independent in line synchronization and it was also able to describe different in line response characteristics in terms of the in line synchronization parameters new2 model fits the test results well with respect to the dominating frequency prediction and time sharing process however the prediction accuracy was lower than for the new1 model in the low velocity range and the space sharing process of new1 model was more realistic 5 2 stress and response characteristics of the new load model for the stress comparisons between new1 and new2 models the standard deviations std s of stress were calculated from the simulation for three different current speed cases the stds of stress induced by the cross flow and in line bending moments were calculated at every cross section and stds of stress were plotted along the riser length in fig 7 there were no significant differences in the cross flow results between new1 and new2 models regardless of the current speed as seen in figs 7a 7c and 7e on the other hand there were significant differences for the in line stress results for all the cases with different current magnitudes and the differences between the stress profiles were observed from the point where the maximum stress occurred z l is about 0 3 to the bottom end of the riser as shown in figs 7b 7d and 7f because of the higher in line mode order for new2 model than that of new1 model the in line stresses of new2 model were normally higher also as discussed in the previous section the space sharing process of new1 model was more dominant than for new2 model near the bottom of the riser this implies that new1 model was partially synchronized with the lower mode near the bottom end of the riser which might result in low stresses to illustrate the response characteristics depending on the parameter sets the trajectories of the viv motion for the lowest current speed are illustrated along the riser length in fig 8 the cross flow and in line responses were non dimensionalized with the diameter of the riser as seen in fig 8 the amplitude differences were not significant between new1 and new2 models except the in line amplitude at the lower part of the riser however the stability features of the response was different the trajectories of new1 model were more stable and varied along the riser while the results of new2 model showed chaotic responses in summary the in line response of the hanøytangen test showed a wide range of time sharing processes and unstable response due to the mode competition considering the results in figs 6 to 8 new2 model was found appropriate to describe the unstable viv response of the hanøytangen test in the following sections the new2 model was applied for all the time domain viv simulations the simulations with the simplified riser model are referred to as td s while td a hereafter refers to the advanced riser model 6 viv induced axial vibrations as discussed in section 2 2 tension fluctuations were observed at the top of the riser for all the tests and the magnitude of the tension variation increased for increasing towing speeds tension fluctuations are illustrated in relation to the riser configurations in fig 9 the riser in the flow is sagging due to the drag force relative to the initial configuration in fig 9a as shown in figs 9b and 9c correspondingly the riser oscillates twice i e runs through two periods in the vertical direction during one period of cross flow ω and in line 2 ω oscillation the frequencies of axial vibrations are 2 ω induced by the cross flow vibrations and twice that for the in line i e 4 ω induced by the in line vibration therefore the capabilities of the advanced riser model td a with respect to capturing such behavior are investigated in the following 6 1 axial non resonant vibrations caused by viv most of the tension fluctuations observed in the test and simulations where axial non resonant vibrations i e vibrations with a frequency outside the first axial vibration mode to quantify the top tension fluctuations statistically the coefficient of variation of the top tension t c o v t s t d t m e a n for td a and for the test are plotted in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the results for the cases with low tension t l o w were higher than those for the cases with high tension t h i g h both for the tests and the td a the low pretension decreased the system stiffness which allowed more tension fluctuation also the results of the test were amplified as the current speed increased regardless of tension magnitudes the axial vibrations induced by the cross flow are normally much higher than those induced by the in line since the magnitude of the axial vibrations is proportional to the square of amplitude in the case of the td a the results showed similar trends however the magnitude of the tension fluctuations were seen to be significantly lower than for the tests these differences might be related to the structural or the hydrodynamic damping viv response is more affected by hydrodynamic damping in the present study as the structural damping was low refer to section 3 2 the hydrodynamic damping force can be controlled by means of the drag coefficient c d or the vortex shedding forces c v x and c v y refer to eq 1 the sensitivities of tension fluctuations to the drag coefficients c d were investigated in order to throw light on this effect the results are plotted for the low and high current speed cases in fig 11 from the results in this figure the tension fluctuations of td a for both current speeds were getting similar to the test as the drag coefficient decreased however the lower drag coefficient than the proposed one allowed for large viv response and axial vibration the cross flow and in line vortex shedding force of the load model are correlated with the drag force term the drag force term in eq 1 leads to a smaller force due to the reduced c d value as a consequence of the decreased damping force both the in line and cross flow response amplitude and vortex shedding force will be amplified then the total force in the in line direction increases due to the higher projected vortex shedding force i e the increase of effective diameter in short the decrease of the drag coefficient does not necessarily mean a reduction of the total hydrodynamic damping the drag coefficient of the load model was set to be 1 2 which was based on fixed cylinder test data thorsen et al 2017 however the sensitivity analysis results suggested that the drag coefficient of flexible pipes could be smaller than 1 2 other uncertainties in the structural model may also contribute to the discrepancy e g there was no frictional force included in the pulley system and the vessel movement in the vertical direction was constrained hence excluding the effect of towing vessel mass and hydro static stiffness therefore rather than optimizing the empirical coefficients in the load model in order to agree as well as possible with the test results it was instead focused upon whether the tension fluctuation was captured by the simulations and how these were correlated to the overall viv response to compare the frequency of tension fluctuations between the test and the td a wavelet analysis was applied for both the tension and strain time series the low and high current speed results are illustrated in fig 12 figs 12a and 12b include the top tension z l 0 00 and the strain wavelets for two different in line and cross flow cases near the top end z l 0 03 and the point where maximum stress observed z l 0 33 the scales of the wavelets are different from each other however the correlation between the strains and the tension variations is clearly observed both for the tests and the td a for the low current speed in fig 12a the frequency of the tension is about twice that of the in line strain and its pattern is similar to the in line strains patterns at z l 0 03 for both the test and the td a for the case of the high current speed in fig 12b the results were similar to those for the low current speed case but the tension was dominated by the cross flow response the frequency variation and the dominating frequency were well predicted by the td a furthermore the frequency variations of the in line and cross flow strains were similar to each other at two points z l 0 03 and z l 0 33 for both the test and the td a this implies that the tension fluctuations affect the viv response not only near the top but also at other locations 6 2 axial resonant vibrations induced by the cross flow motion the axial resonant vibration occurs when the viv frequency coincides with the first mode of vibration in the axial direction of the riser resonance could be induced by both cross flow and in line effects but it was found that the cross flow induced resonance was the most severe for a steel riser the cross flow induced axial resonant vibration occurs when the current speed reaches the critical velocity formulated as below huse 1999 10 v c c d e 8 s t l where the v c is the critical velocity and c is the velocity of sound in steel 5130 m s for the hanøytangen riser the v c is about 1 26 m s when s t is 0 17 the equation was derived by assuming that the viv is high and single mode in uniform flow conditions however the dominating mode may vary in a sheared current due to the competition among the modes the axial resonant vibration could occur intermittently only when certain conditions are satisfied for the td a the cross flow was relatively stationary which caused axial resonance for the two cases to take place at the respective frequency which corresponded most to the critical velocity one of the cases i e the high velocity high tension case and the corresponding results from the test are analyzed in more detail in fig 13 the first row of figs 13a and 13b represents the tension signal at the top and the second row contains the wavelet for the tension psd the last row shows the contour of cross flow bending moment in time as observed from fig 13b the tension in the simulation gradually increased from 37 4 s and increased rapidly at 38 2 s when resonance is observed the cross flow bending moment significantly decreases not only near the top but also at the other locations this was referred to as to the feedback effect huse 1998 and might be due to the combination of an increase of dynamic stiffness and unstable viv response regarding the results from the test it was assumed that axial resonant vibrations were not fully developed as observed from fig 13a in order to compare the decrease of the stress due to the feedback effect the stds of the cross flow induced stresses are plotted along the riser length the results in fig 14a correspond to a lower current speed case with axial non resonant vibration furthermore the results in fig 14b correspond to a high current speed with axial resonant vibration taking place in the td a simulation in fig 14b an additional result of td a using a short time window where axial resonance is observed 38s 39s is included when the current speed increases it is expected that the stress levels will increase which is observed for the test results however the std of the stress for the td a simulation blue line is found to decrease somewhat as shown in fig 14b compared to that in fig 14a this is due to the axial resonance and when this occurs the stress near the top increases but the stress level at other locations decreases as seen from the black dot line in fig 14b it should also be kept in mind that the axial resonant vibration caused by in line effects was excluded from the discussion due to its relatively small magnitude however both for the tests and for the simulations axial vibration induced by in line effects can occur which can also influence the viv response however the td a capability of describing the axial resonance behavior observed in the test has been clearly demonstrated and as such represents a significant step forward with respect to viv modeling practice 7 validation of the new load model in this section the prediction performance of the new load model is evaluated and differences of viv predictions depending on the riser modeling choices discussed 7 1 differences of top tension between riser models to investigate the differences between td s and td a related to boundary conditions the percentwise errors in eq 11 were plotted as a function of current velocity in fig 15 11 t e r r o r t m e a n sim t m e a n exp t m e a n exp 100 it is seen that the errors of td s become larger when the current speed increases which is due to the top tension increase from the drag forces in order to obtain a similar top tension in the td s simulation to that for the tests the initial tension should be set to a level that reflected the drag force effect but no such optimization was performed however by analyzing the results obtained by the td a simulations it was seen that the relative errors were about 1 2 regardless of the current and tension level this implies that td a corresponds to a better riser modeling approach in order to represent the features of the tests 7 2 stress and frequency predictions for the stress comparisons the maximum standard deviation of the viv induced stress at each cross section was averaged along the riser length the results of td s and td a are compared in fig 16 both for the cross flow and in line cases the area below the diagonal line in figs 16a and 16b indicates which cases that give predictions that are lower than for the tests and the area above the diagonal corresponds to overprediction generally tests and both simulations showed good correlations however the td s tends to overestimate more than td a for both the cross flow and the in line cases the higher pretension of td s increased the eigenfrequency of the riser and resulted in higher mode viv in addition the tension fluctuations of td a gave rise to energy transfer in the axial direction of the riser as seen in fig 16a two cases of td a showed much lower stress results due to axial resonant vibrations when it comes to frequency prediction the peak frequency of the strain psd was defined as the dominating frequencies and the dominating frequency at z l 0 33 were compared to each other comparisons were made in the same way as for the mean std stress comparison provided by fig 17 overall the results of td s were more conservative than td a because of the higher pretension and showed a good correlation with the test for both cross flow and in line however it was difficult to conclude on the prediction accuracy due to the uncertainty of the empirical parameters as discussed in section 6 furthermore the in line results of td s and td a in fig 17b were more scattered than those for the cross flow to gain insights on the viv frequency along the riser the wavelets of the strains were compared for all methods at three different locations the most tension dominated cases and bending stiffness dominated cases were selected and results are shown in fig 18 in the case of the viv synchronization at low current speed as shown in figs 18a and 18b the synchronization ranges of td s and td a were similar to the test regardless of the locations however for the bending stiffness dominated case in figs 18c and 18d the frequency variation patterns of both td s and td a became irregular due to the instability of the viv response furthermore in the case of td s there were no significant differences in frequency characteristics according to the locations however as shown in figs 18c and 18d the results for the td a near the top displayed some irregularities due to tension fluctuations and a weak space sharing was also observed near the bottom in short although the results in fig 17 shows that td s gave better frequency predictions than td a the td a reflects the characteristics of the tests better the time and space sharing could be simulated simultaneously by application of the new in line load model combined with the td a which was able to reflect the test characteristics more adequately 7 3 fatigue damage predictions in order to compare the fatigue damage the maximum fatigue damage around the circumference at each cross section was plotted along the riser in fig 19 the fatigue damage was calculated using the bending stresses and the rainflow counting method which is implemented in the wafo matlab toolbox brodtkorb et al 2000 was applied the material constant log a was 11 687 and the slope of the s n curve k was 3 baarholm et al 2006 the results in fig 19 comprise a total of 6 cases that are distinguished by the tension levels and current speeds when it comes to the overall trends the high pretension results from the td a simulation in figs 19b 19c and 19d are relatively more irregular than the results of the low pretension cases in figs 19a 19c and 19e this was related to the number of modes participating in viv response as discussed in section 5 on the other hand in the case of td s all cases showed a stable fatigue damage profile a possible explanation is that the viv responses at each cross section were not coupled with the response of the other cross section furthermore the differences in the mode shape and the location of maximum fatigue damage between td s and td a were observed as seen in fig 19c which showed a more stable profile than other cases comparing the results in terms of the current speed for the low current speed when the in line is relatively dominant the prediction of td a showed better performance than that of td s as seen in figs 19a and 19b especially for the high tension cases although there was inconsistency in the lower part of the riser due to weak space sharing processes the irregularity of the profile was well predicted for the middle current speeds the dominance of the cross flow of the response is getting increased so that both in line and cross flow effects are important the axial non resonant vibration by both responses made the stability of response worse therefore the fatigue damages of the test were more evenly distributed along the riser than in low and high current speed cases as seen in figs 19c and 19d this means that the prediction accuracy of td a for the middle current speed will be lower than for the other current speed cases in the case of high current speed when the cross flow was dominant td s was found to be conservative while td a showed good correlation with the test results as seen in figs 19e and 19f in order to evaluate the fatigue damages for all cases the mean value of the fatigue along the whole riser was compared for the tests versus the simulations and a corresponding bias factor was defined i e λ f a t d m e a n sim d m e a n exp here d m e a n exp is the average of the fatigue damage at each sensor and d m e a n sim is the fatigue damage at the sensor locations which is estimated based on the results from the simulations the bias factor λ f a t is plotted as a function of current velocity according to the pretension level in fig 20 for low current speeds both the td s and the td a underpredict the fatigue damage while for increasing speeds they both overpredict the damage for the low tension cases as seen in fig 20a the results from the td a simulations showed a good correlation with the results from the test with a bias factor of 2 or less although the results for the intermediate current speeds are somewhat irregular for the high tension cases the td a gives even better predictions than for low tension as seen from fig 20b although the results in fig 20 only includes a comparison of the average fatigue damage the corresponding results in terms of the ratio between the values of the maximum fatigue damage is less than 4 regarding results from the td s simulations the bias factor is somewhat higher than for the td a in the case of high pretension for low pretension the bias factor is smaller than for td a for current velocities up to around 1 0 while above this value the ratio becomes higher than for td a 8 conclusions in the present study numerical simulations of the hanøytangen tests were performed in order to develop an improved time domain viv model that is suitable for the estimation of deepwater riser viv the main characteristics of the hanøytangen tests related to viv corresponded to a high mode viv response bending stiffness dominated behavior and sheared current when it comes to the prediction performance of the new load model the following notable results were obtained the improved in line synchronization concept is found to be reasonable in term of dominating frequency and time sharing prediction and it is found to be more robust with respect to modeling the in line response characteristics than the previous load model the improved load model with narrow synchronization bandwidth new1 gave a good prediction of the frequency at low current speeds and showed good performance with respect to representation of the space sharing process on the other hand the load model with wide synchronization bandwidth new2 gave good predictions of the frequency and a good representation of the time sharing process for the higher current speeds the new2 model is found to be favorable with respect to predicting deepwater riser viv responses characterized by a wide in line vibration frequency variation range due to the high mode viv and the sheared current in addition a comparison was made of the viv predictions based on the simplified linear and advanced non linear riser models the advanced riser model increased the viv prediction accuracy by capturing the main non linear effects inherent in the test due to tension fluctuations the insights based on the tension fluctuations can be summarized as the axial non resonant vibrations could be adequately simulated by the new load models although the degree of tension variations was quite different from the test the frequency characteristics of the tension variations were well predicted the tension fluctuation differences between tests and simulations seem to be related to the magnitude of viv responses the hydrodynamic damping is one of the contributing parameters to be further investigated resonant axial vibrations were observed in the simulation and it was observed that the viv response possibly decreases when axial resonant vibration occurs the tension fluctuations affect the stability of the viv process and thereby the prediction uncertainties along the riser therefore non linear time domain analysis needs to be considered for riser systems with large tension fluctuations from the present study it was demonstrated that not only good quality of the viv prediction model itself but also accurate structural modeling is required in order to achieve precise estimates and explain the inherent physics the proposed load model was found capable of capturing the key characteristics of the deepwater riser subjected to high mode viv responses however there are still uncertainties related to prediction accuracy especially with respect to hydrodynamic damping and other load coefficients the uncertainties associated with these empirical parameters need to be reduced by means of additional correlation studies based on suitable test data credit authorship contribution statement sang woo kim conceptualization methodology

20392,the raft type wave energy converter wec consisting of several hinged rafts and hydraulic power take off pto systems captures wave power in a line absorber manner whose scattered and radiated wave pattern is different from that of a point absorber this paper focuses on the latching control of a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto system to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the hydraulic pto system is modelled as a coulomb damping and the optimal latching control law is derived from a coulomb damping based model using the optimal control theory the effectiveness of latching control on improving power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system and the benefit introduced by latching control in terms of power improvement are investigated results show that the optimal latching control law derived from the coulomb damping based model can effectively improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system the benefit due to latching control can reach a peak value of 3 04 which is 2 times that introduced by load control moreover latching control can further benefit the raft type wec where load control has been performed keywords latching control raft type wave energy converter hydraulic power take off system coulomb damping optimal control method 1 introduction the ocean waves provide an abundant renewable energy resource that is taken as a promising alternative to the fossil energy due to its clean and environment friendly property if such a type of untapped energy source is extensively exploited it may make a great contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emission as well as to the electrical energy supply of countries with coasts facing the ocean though the first patent of wave energy conversion was proposed as early as 1799 large attention to the potential of wave energy converters wecs as a significant source of renewable energy did not draw until 1970s when the oil crisis occurred clément et al 2002 the raft type wec consisting of several semi submerged rafts hinged end to end by the joints equipped with power take off pto systems was proposed at that time and is known as its excellent survivability in extreme sea states mccormick 2007 nguyen et al 2020 the relative rotation between the adjacent joined rafts is utilized to drive the pto system for converting wave energy into electricity similar to other oscillating body wecs such as sharp eagle wanshan sheng et al 2017 searev cordonnier et al 2015 wavestar hansen et al 2013 or multi point absorber do et al 2018 the pto system adopted in the raft type wec is a hydraulic pto system since hydraulic system has the characteristics of large transmission power and torque with low frequency fast frequency response hydraulic overload protection and so on which is very adapted to large power and low frequency waves lin et al 2015 moreover the hydraulic system can easily facilitate the conversion of reciprocating motion to rotary motion to drive a generator and can be efficiently used to perform the continuous phase control of the wec movement with the aim of extracting the maximum power from the waves ahamed et al 2020 the hydraulic pto system usually consists of sets of hydraulic cylinders several control manifolds two gas accumulators and a hydraulic motor coupled with an electric generator gaspar et al 2016 active control valves are employed as the control manifolds to rectify the flow and are also used to vary the reaction torque besides the use of hydraulic gas accumulators provides short term energy storage to achieve the smooth electricity production required for a marketable machine the raft type wec which is an attenuator type wec and usually deployed in ocean region of high power density lies parallel to the dominant wave direction such that it can ride the wave and make use of the wave curvature to improve energy extraction cruz 2008 lu et al 2019 tay 2020 wang and ringwood 2021 using the raft type wecs to extract ocean wave energy is of great potential in reducing the pressure of traditional energy however compared with other more developed renewable energy resource such as solar wind or hydro energy wave energy is far less mature if wave energy is to compete with these developed energy sources on an equal footing and come into a commercial stage it is necessary to maximize the energy extraction of the wec such that the cost of energy is minimized to produce electricity at a competitive price to tackle this problem several control strategies were proposed one of the most extensively adopted strategies is latching control originally proposed by budal and falnes 1980 in contrast to the reactive control latching control is recognized by the unidirectional energy flow and it consists in holding the device in some time interval during its motion cycle and releasing it at an appropriate time so that the velocity of the device is in more phase with the wave excitation force to maximize the wave energy extraction bjarte larsson and falnes 2006 wang et al 2018 in previous research much attention was focused on the determination of the optimal latching duration babarit and clément 2006 applied a semi analytical solution and an optimal control method to deal with the optimal latching delay of a generic point absorber wec in regular and irregular waves respectively sheng et al 2015a 2015b used half a difference between the wave period and the natural period of the wec to determine the latching duration of a point absorber wec and results showed that the power capture performance is dramatically improved by such a method feng and kerrigan 2015 applied derivative free optimization to study the optimal latching delay for a heaving buoy wec more recently wu et al 2017 adopted a golden section search algorithm to numerically search the optimal latching duration for a solo duck wec with different load types and the performance improvement due to the latching control and its real time implementation were discussed in wu et al 2018 the fore motioned research all related to a single degree of freedom dof system such as the generic point absorber wecs besides the latching duration was determined on the assumption of a linear pto system for a wec being a multi dof system or including multiple oscillators latching control implemented by locking the device for a while and releasing it at a right time to aid its velocity in more phase with the wave excitation force loses the physical meaning the determination of the optimal latching duration becomes more complicated and difficult in this situation to tackle this challenge many researchers turned to the optimal control method based on the pontryagin s maximum principle korde 2002 2001 studied the implementation of latching control on a point absorber wec featuring an embarked reference including more than one float using the optimal control method in the following years latching control of a multi dof wec the searev was investigated by babarit and clément 2006 based on the optimal control method cândido and justino 2011 studied the latching control strategy for a two body point absorber wec using pontryagin s maximum principle c liu et al 2018a applied the optimal control method to investigate the benefit introduced by latching control to a raft type wec both in regular and irregular waves the optimal control theory was also adopted by li et al 2019a to study latching control of a point absorber wec in irregular waves and the wave force prediction was also addressed in their study unfortunately these studies were also performed on the basis of a linear pto unit however for the oscillating body wecs with hydraulic pto systems the resisting force gas pressure difference multiplied by the piston cross sectional area of the hydraulic cylinder produced by the hydraulic pto system is more like a coulomb damping not a linear one due to the use of hydraulic gas accumulators thus when the floater velocity become zero the body will remain stationary unless or until the hydrodynamic force on the body overcomes the resisting force this phenomenon was observed by falcão 2007 cargo et al 2012 liu et al 2017 penalba et al 2017 penalba and ringwood 2019 and dong et al 2021 and it leads to the power capture performance of a wec with a hydraulic pto system different from that with a linear one furthermore as it is revealed in wu et al 2017 that different pto types will result in different control effects and the pto control will affect the dynamic response and power ouput of the wec si et al 2021 considering the coulomb damping characteristics of the hydraulic pto system falcão 2008 studied the latching control of a generic point absorber wec in which a threshold of the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder chambers was given and the unlatching action occurred when the pressure exceeded the given threshold thus no calculation of the latching duration is required it is clear that most previous study mainly focused on the point absorber wecs based on a linear pto system for the raft type wec studied in this paper it consists of two oscillators with multi dofs and is a line absorber whose scattered and radiated wave pattern is different from that of a point absorber moreover the hydraulic pto system is a high nonlinear system that should not be treated as a linear one hence the determination of the optimal latching duration and the effectiveness of latching control on improving the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system should be specified and studied and this is the first aim of this paper furthermore it is also significant to estimate whether it is cost effective to apply latching control to a raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system to help us make a good estimation we should investigate to what extent latching control can benefit the raft type wec and this is the second aim of this paper for validation of the simulation results a hardware in the loop hil test rig is developed for providing experimental data the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of a raft type wec composed of two hinged rafts is given whereas its hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism is introduced in section 3 then the governing equations concerning the time domain hydrodynamic model of the raft type wec the determination of the optimal latching control law and the model of the hydraulic pto system are presented in section 4 the results and discussions about the effectiveness and the benefit due to latching control are shown in section 5 finally the conclusions are made in section 6 2 description of a raft type wec let us consider a hinged two cylindrical raft type wec floating on ocean waves in which the two hinged raft system is similar to the one studied by liu et al 2020 and c liu et al 2018b as shown in fig 1 it is composed of two slender cylindrical rafts and a hydraulic pto system the two cylindrical rafts with a gap d 0 between them are horizontally placed on water surface and they have the same length l diameter d and draft d f the center of each raft mass coincides well with the raft geometry center the mass is uniformly distributed in the raft shell and the water plane goes through the raft geometry center in still water the hydraulic pto system is located at the gap between the two rafts to convert the wave energy into useful energy a slack mooring system is placed at the front of the fore raft this facilitates self rectifying alignment with the local wave direction and helps the wec quickly adapt itself to the harsh sea conditions stansby et al 2015 paparella and ringwood 2017 a cartesian coordinate system xoyz with origin o being the center of the joint where the x and y axes take along the longitudinal and radial directions of the raft in still water surface respectively while the z axis is in the opposite direction of gravity acceleration is presented in fig 1 to describe the motion characteristics of the raft system only the surge heave and pitch modes of each raft are considered under the action of a head sea incident wave train due to the symmetry of the raft noad and porter 2017 3 working principle of a hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism a hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism is shown in fig 2 which is somewhat different from the one studied in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b instead of the four check valves adopted in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b two switching valves namely valve 1 and valve 2 are employed as the latching mechanism to implement latching control and as rectifying valves to rectify bidirectional flow the non piston rod chamber of the top hydraulic cylinder and the piston rod chamber of the bottom hydraulic cylinder are connected to be chamber 14 whereas the piston rod chamber of the top hydraulic cylinder is connected with the non piston rod chamber of the bottom hydraulic cylinder to be chamber 23 as the wave passes through the rafts the rafts output a relative pitch motion around the joint driving the hydraulic pistons to move reciprocally when the relative pitch motion of the two rafts activates the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to stretch the valve 2 switches to the left position so that the high pressure hp oil pumped from chamber 23 can flow through the hp gas accumulator and arrive at the inlet of the hydraulic motor whereas the valve 1 switches to the right position allowing chamber 14 sucking low pressure lp oil from the outlet of the hydraulic motor then the pressure difference between the hp and lp gas accumulators forces the hydraulic motor shaft to rotate and this rotation drives the generator to produce electricity similarly as the relative pitch motion of the two rafts drives the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to retract the valve 1 and valve 2 switch to the left position and the right position respectively to ensure the hp oil pumped from chamber 14 arrive at the inlet of the hydraulic motor and the chamber 23 sunk lp oil from the outlet of the hydraulic motor thus the valves rectify bidirectional flow and transport a unidirectional flow to the hydraulic motor nevertheless when latching control is applied the two valves switch to the middle position such that the oil flow is cut off and the hydraulic cylinders are locked in this situation the two rafts are locked and move as a whole thus no wave power flows into the hydraulic system in addition to improving the performance of the wec the latching mechanism that locks the two rafts by switching the two valves to the middle positions allows for the access of staff when the wec requires maintenance furthermore compared to the hydraulic pto system studied in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b another advantage of the present one is that it can protect the wec from extreme waves since the two rafts can be declutched from the hydraulic pto system by controlling all chambers to be connected with the lp gas accumulator which enables the two rafts to comply with the waves and consequently reduces the hydrodynamic impact forces 4 mathematical model in this section the hydrodynamic model of the wec is given in section 4 1 as stated in the introduction part the determination of the optimal latching duration is complicated and difficult especially when the wec is a multi dof system or includes multiple oscillators and the non linear hydraulic pto system is considered to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the optimal latching control law used to decide which time the two valves should switch to the middle positions is derived using the optimal control theory based on the pontryagin s maximum principle in section 4 2 by simplifying the hydraulic pto system as a coulomb damping then the mathematical model of the hydraulic pto system executing the optimal control command time series calculated from the coulomb damping based model is given in section 4 3 4 1 hydrodynamic model the total number of independent degrees of freedom of the two hinged raft system shown in fig 1 is four the heave and surge modes x 0 and z 0 of the joint and the pitch modes θ 1 and θ 2 of the fore and aft rafts respectively by adopting a generalized displacement vector x gen t x 0 z 0 θ 1 θ 2 t here superscript t indicates the transpose of a vector or a matrix liu et al 2017 applied the lagrange s equations to derive a time domain hydrodynamic model of the wec which has a form as 1 m a x gen t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ k gen x gen t f gen e t f m t where m is the generalized dry mass matrix a is the generalized added mass matrix at infinite frequency k gen is the generalized hydrostatic restoring stiffness matrix h t is the retardation function matrix regarding the generalized radiation forces f gen e t is the generalized wave excitation force vector f m t is the impeding force vector from the hydraulic pto mechanism the expressions of each term in eq 1 are given in detail in liu et al 2017 for accelerating the computation speed of solving eq 1 the convolution integral in eq 1 can be approximated by a state space model c liu et al 2018c 2 μ t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ x s t a s x s t b s x gen t μ t c s x s t where x s t is the state vector of radiation force approximation whose number of elements is n a s b s and c s are coefficient matrixes of the state space model in regular waves the wave excitation force acting on mode j of the raft can be given by falnes 2002 3 f e j t re a w γ j ω e i ω t a w γ j ω cos ω t γ j ω where re means real part of γ j ɷ is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient at mode j force per unit incident wave amplitude whose modulus and argument are γ j ɷ and γ j ɷ respectively ɷ and a w are the wave frequency and wave amplitude respectively here j 1 3 and 5 indicate the surge heave and pitch modes of the fore raft respectively whereas j 1 3 and 5 indicate the surge heave and pitch modes of the aft raft respectively the hydrodynamic model as shown in eq 1 has been validated in liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018c irregular waves feature a series of different frequency components and are characterized by the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p faltinsen 1990 in irregular waves the global excitation force acting on the raft can be obtained by summing the excitation forces corresponding to each frequency 4 f e j t v 1 k a w ω v γ j ω v cos ω v t γ j ω v ε v where k is a sufficiently large number ω v ε v and a w ω v are the wave frequency random phase angle and wave amplitude of the v th wave component respectively γ j ω v is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient on mode j corresponding to wave frequency ω v the wave amplitude corresponding to v th wave frequency can be written as 5 a w ω v 2 s ω v δ ω v where s ω is the wave spectrum and δω v is the difference between successive frequencies 4 2 determination of the optimal latching control law previous research has shown that the effect of hydraulic pto system is more like a coulomb load type not a linear one because of hydraulic gas accumulators hence to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching control law that maximizes the power captured by the hydraulic cylinders the hydraulic pto system is simplified as a coulomb load type numerical implementation of the coulomb damping force is difficult since the derivative will be infinite at θ 1 θ 2 0 which would result in non physical oscillations of the relative pitch velocity when it is around zero and consequently lead to erroneous values for the power capture zheng et al 2015 babarit et al 2012 similar to the study of zheng et al 2015 a criterion condition θ 1 θ 2 0 001 is adopted here when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 i e the hydrodynamic force is sufficiently large such that it can overcome the resisting force produced by the hydraulic cylinders and drive the hydraulic pistons to move smoothly the hydraulic cylinders act as energy absorber and transmit energy to the hydraulic motor when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 i e the hydrodynamic force is not sufficiently large such that it cannot drive the hydraulic pistons to move smoothly the hydraulic pto system will naturally lock the two rafts and make them move as a whole which is a natural way of achieving latching though no latching control command is applied falcão 2008 thus the impeding force applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism f m t acts as the pto force f pto t to capture energy during some time intervals while it acts as the natural latching force f lat1 t to lock the two rafts during some other time intervals thereby the pto force and the natural latching force can be written as 6 f pto t κ m pto 7 f lat 1 t κ m lat 1 8 m pto m 0 sign θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 0 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 9 m lat 1 0 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 min m 0 m check sign m check θ 1 θ 2 0 001 where κ 0 0 1 1 t m 0 is the equivalent coulomb damping coefficient m check is the moment needed at the joint to make the two rafts rotate as a whole i e the joint connection between the two rafts is rigid on the condition of m lat1 m check zheng et al 2015 when latching command is applied the two valves switch to the middle positions the optimal control law of the valves that maximizes the captured power can be derived from the optimal control theory based on the pontryagin s maximum principle in the study of latching control for a generic point absorber wec babarit and clément 2006 adopted the optimal control theory and employed a linear damping force as the latching force which is considered as a weak model of latching control to derive the optimal control law when the damping coefficient is sufficiently large the latching effect would trend to that of an absolute one here the latching force vector f lat2 t locking the relative pitch motion of the two rafts is modelled as 10 f lat 2 t κ m lat 2 11 m lat 2 m 0 sign θ 1 θ 2 n k θ 1 θ 2 0 001 min m 0 m check sign m check θ 1 θ 2 0 001 where n k is a sufficiently large number to ensure that the latching force can stiffly lock the two rafts thus the impeding force applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism f m t is written as 12 f m t f pto t 1 u f lat 1 t u f lat 2 t where u is the binary control variable with u 1 when latching command is executed and u 0 when no latching command is applied eq 1 can be described as a state space model by inserting eq 2 13 λ a λ v where 14 λ x gen x gen x s a 0 4 4 i 4 4 0 4 n m a 1 k gen 0 4 4 m a 1 c s 0 n 4 b s a s v 0 4 1 m a 1 f gen e t f m t 0 n 1 where the dimensions of state vector λ and matrix a are 8 n 1 and 8 n 8 n respectively as shown in eq 8 it is believed that no power flows into the hydraulic pto system when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 thus for simplicity the energy captured by the hydraulic cylinders over a given time interval 0 t f can be written as 15 e 0 t f m pto θ 1 θ 2 d t for maximizing the captured power over the given time interval 0 t f we should find the optimal control command time series of u that maximizes the captured energy as shown in eq 15 with the consideration of eq 13 a hamiltonian is defined as below to deal with this problem 16 h m pto θ 1 θ 2 λ t a λ v where λ is a column vector of the adjoint state corresponding to the state vector λ and it is given by 17 λ h λ by inserting eq 14 into eq 16 the hamiltonian h can be rewritten as 18 h m pto θ 1 θ 2 λ 1 4 t x gen λ 5 8 t m a 1 f gen e κ m pto κ 1 u m lat 1 κ u m lat 2 c s x s k gen x gen λ 9 n 8 t c s x s b s x gen where λ 1 4 λ 5 8 and λ 9 n 8 are vectors that consist of the elements with the index from 1 to 4 5 to 8 and 9 to n 8 from the adjoint state vector λ respectively the gradient of h with respect to u is 19 h h u λ 5 8 t m a 1 κ m lat 2 m lat 1 based on the pontryagin s maximum principle the control command time series u is optimal when it maximizes the hamiltonian h therefore the equation for the optimal latching control low is 20 u 1 if h 0 0 else 4 3 hydraulic pto model as shown in fig 2 when no latching command is applied the relative pitch motion of the two rafts drives the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to move reciprocally the resisting forces from the top and bottom hydraulic cylinders f t and f b can be written as 21 f t p 23 1 α a p p 14 a p f fric d t m p d t f b p 14 1 α a p p 23 a p f fric d b m p d b where a p and α are the piston cross section area and rod to piston cross section area ratio of the hydraulic cylinder respectively d t and d b are the displacements of the top and bottom hydraulic pistons respectively and d t d b r 0 θ 2 θ 1 here r 0 is the distance between the joint and the hydraulic cylinder p 14 and p 23 are the pressures in chamber 14 and chamber 23 respectively m p is the equivalent mass including the effects of piston rod and hydraulic oil in the chamber due to piston acceleration f fric is the friction force in the hydraulic cylinder which can be described by the stribeck model as shown in eq 22 22 f fric x f e i f f e f s and x 0 σ v x sign x f c f s f c exp x c st δ s i f x 0 sign f e f s i f f e f s and x 0 where σ v is the viscous friction coefficient f c is the coulomb friction coefficient f s and f e are the maximum static friction force and external force respectively c st and δ s are the stribeck velocity and corrective coefficient respectively the value of impeding force in pitch mode applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism i e the equivalent coulomb damping coefficient m 0 in eq 8 is written as 23 m 0 f t f b r 0 when the hydrodynamic force is not sufficiently large the two rafts will be naturally locked by the pto mechanism though valve 1 and valve 2 do not switch to the middle positions the pto force and the natural latching force applied by the pto mechanism can be obtained by eqs 6 9 as shown in fig 2 the flow continuity equations in chamber 14 and chamber 23 are 24 q l 4 2 c ip p 23 p 14 a p d t 1 α a p d b c ep p 14 β e v 14 0 a p d t 1 α a p d b p 14 q 23 a p d b 1 α

are in the neutral positions respectively q 14 is the flowrate flowing into the chamber 14 q 23 is the flowrate flowing out of the chamber 23 c ip and c ep are the internal and external leakage coefficients of the hydraulic cylinder respectively the switching valves rectify bidirectional flow and transport a unidirectional flow to the hydraulic motor thereby the hp flowrate q rh pumped from the compressed chamber of the hydraulic cylinders and the lp flowrate q rl flowing into the expanded chamber of the hydraulic cylinders are expressed as 25 q rh q 23 q rl q 14 if θ 2 θ 1 0 q rh q 14 q rl q 23 if θ 2 θ 1 0 the pressure propagation in the pipeline between the switching valves and the hp accumulator is analyzed by using the flow continuity and momentum equations assuming the pipeline consists of n elements the pressure dynamics in the element n can be described by 26 p h n β e q h n 1 q h n δ l pip n a pip n q h n a pip n p h n p h n 1 p fric q h n δ l pip n ρ oil where q h n and p h n are the flowrate and pressure across element n here n n 1 and q h 0 q rh a pip n and δl pip n are the cross sectional area and length of element n p fric q h n is the total pressure drop in element n which is evaluated by 27 p fric q h n λ n δ l pip n 2 d pip n ρ oil q h n a pip n 2 ξ n ρ oil 2 q h n a pip n 2 where d pip n is the diameter of element n ξ n is a friction coefficient for a

motor is described as 28 p h n β e q h n 1 q h q m δ l pip n a pip n v h0 v h where q h and q m are the flowrates to the hp accumulator and the hydraulic motor respectively v h0 and v h are the total volume and gas volume of the hp accumulator respectively for the hp and lp gas accumulators the compression or expansion process of gas is assumed an isentropic process there is hydraulic oil in the hp accumulator under the condition of the pressure in element n of the pipeline ph n larger than the pre charge pressure of the hp accumulator ph0 otherwise the hp accumulator is fully discharged thereby the model of the hp gas accumulator is written as 29 v h v h0 i f p h n p h0 v h0 p h0 p h n 1 γ i f p h n p h0 30 q h 0 i f p h n p h0 v h i f p h n p h0 where γ is the adiabatic index γ 1 4 in case of nitrogen the instantaneous gas pressure p l and gas volume v l in the lp accumulator are given by the isentropic pressure volume law gives as shown in eq 31 the flowrate q l to the lp accumulator is obtained by eq 32 31 v l v l0 0 t q l d t p l v l γ p l0 v l0 γ 32 q l d m ω m q rl where p l0 and v l0 are the pre charge pressure and total volume of the lp accumulator respectively d

m t nl t g where j is the inertia of the motor and generator t nl is the non load torque including stray load losses and mechanical losses and it expressed as 38 t nl b υ ω m t c sign ω m where b υ and t c are the losses coefficients when latching command is executed i e the two valves switch to the middle positions there is no relative pitch motion between the two rafts and no power flowing into the hydraulic pto system and the latching force is modelled by eqs 10 and 11 the power capture ability of a wec is widely evaluated by the capture width ratio η cap which is defined by the ratio of power captured by the device to wave power flowing through the device babarit et al 2012 39 η cap p ave cap p w d where d is the diameter of the raft p ave cap is the average power captured by the hydraulic cylinders p w is the incident wave power per unit width of the wave front and in regular waves it is given by falnes 2002 40 p w ρ g 2 c g a w 2 where ρ is the seawater density g is the gravity acceleration c g is the group velocity and it is written as 41 c g g 2 ω tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where k is the wave number h is the water depth as for the irregular wave the wave power

and discussion in this section we first investigate whether the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system then an investigation is conducted to see to what extent latching control can benefit the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system 5 1 wec behavior under latching control for a given wave state the coulomb damping coefficient m 0 is evaluated by the amplitude of hydraulic pto force in pitch mode when no latching control is applied and then the optimal control command time series can be determined on the basis of section 4 2 by an iterative process as shown in fig 3 similar to the iterative program in babarit and clément 2006 and c liu et al 2018a a conditional gradient method is adopted to search the control command time series and we start with u 0 at each time step in 0 t f i e no latching control is applied eq 13 is integrated from 0 to t f with the initial condition of the state vector λ 0 0 to determine the time series of the state vector λ then with the final condition of the adjoint state vector λ t f 0 the time series of λ can be obtained by integrating eq 17 backward from t f to 0 if the energy of the ith iteration is smaller than that of i 1 th iteration the step size is modified finally with the knowledge of the state vector λ and the adjoint state vector λ the control command time series can be obtained by eq 20 the entire iteration process is repeated until the calculation converges in regular wave simulations a time horizon of the calculation t f 400 s is adopted let us consider a raft type wec whose structure parameter configuration is shown in table 1 which is designed based on the china sea states in this paper the hydrodynamic parameters are computed by using the standard version of the boundary element method package ansys aqwa 2011 here only the hydrodynamic parameters in pitch mode of the two rafts are shown in fig 4 the parameter configuration of its hydraulic pto system is given in table 2 fig 5 shows the convergence of the numerical algorithm in a wave state with a w 0 5 m and t 5 4 s in which the amplitude of the hydraulic pto force in pitch mode is around 380 kn m i e m 0 380 kn m it can be seen from fig 5 that the energy captured by the coulomb load increases rapidly as the iteration increases and then it enhances slowly and is converged at a value of 1 135 104 kj in about 20 iterations implying that the latching control law derived in section 4 2 is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with coulomb load type when there is no latching control applied in the wec the power captured by the wec can be maximized by tuning the parameters of the hydraulic pto system such as the displacement of the hydraulic motor the resistance load of the generator and this is called load control falcão 2007 cargo et al 2012 in this paper the load control means the maximum captured power is obtained by tuning the displacement of the hydraulic motor here we numerically find the optimal displacement of the hydraulic motor corresponding to the maximum captured power by adjusting the displacement of the hydraulic motor and then the implementation of load control is performed by using the optimal displacement of the hydraulic motor after knowing the optimal command time series the implementation of latching control for the raft type wec with the hydraulic pto system can be performed based on the model presented in section 4 3 by using the optimal control command time series to implement latching control to the raft type wec fig 6 shows the time history of the optimal control command relative pitch velocity of the two rafts instantaneous power captured by the hydraulic cylinders p ins cap instantaneous power produced by the generator p ins g and energy production over the given time interval the results of the wec with load control and that without control are also plotted in fig 6 as references it can be seen from fig 6a that the control command switches frequently between 0 and 1 for u 1 the two valves switch to the middle positions such that the hydraulic circuit is cut off and the hydraulic cylinders are locked and consequently the relative pitch velocity of the two rafts slows down rapidly and vanishes due to the two valves switching stiffly to perform latching control when latching command is applied the relative pitch velocity of the two rafts is strictly kept at zero during the latching duration which is different from that of the wec using a linear pto system as shown in c liu et al 2018a and babarit and clément 2006 where a very large linear damping force is used as the latching mechanism to hold the floaters hence during the latching duration no power flows into the hydraulic pto system which can be seen in fig 6b as shown in fig 6a it can also be seen that for the wec with load control or without control there are some intervals during which the two rafts are naturally locked by the hydraulic pto system and move as a whole due to the hydrodynamic force not sufficiently large to overcome the resisting force produced by the hydraulic cylinders as it is well known that latching control is implemented by holding the floater and then releasing it at a favorable instant to achieve an approximate resonance state which implies that the improvement of the power capture ability of the wec due to latching control is accompanied by amplifying the velocity of the floater it can be seen from fig 6a that the amplitude of relative pitch velocity of the two rafts with latching control is around 0 21 rad s which is 1 57 and 1 26 times that without control and that with load control respectively as shown in fig 6b the amplitude of the instantaneous captured power p ins cap of the wec with latching control reaches a value of 89 59 kw which is 0 71 and 0 54 times larger than that of the wec without control and that with load control respectively the instantaneous electric power produced by the generator is shown in fig 6c it can be seen that the generator can continuously output power though the hydraulic cylinders are locked by the control command or naturally locked during some periods of the motion cycle this is because the hp gas accumulator will supply extra flow to the hydraulic motor to ensure the generator rotate at an approximately constant speed when the hydraulic cylinders are locked compared with the large fluctuating of the instantaneous captured power the instantaneous electric power produced by the generator could almost hold a constant value only with marginal deviation from the average value due to the effect of the hydraulic gas accumulators the captured energy over the given time interval is presented in fig 6d as expected the captured energy of the wec with latching control is greatly larger than that without control and that with load control and it reaches a value of 1 141 104 kj to summarize from the above analysis we find that the optimal latching control law derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system 5 2 benefit introduced by latching control to evaluate the benefit in terms of power improvement that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system in different wave states we conduct the simulation in different regular wave states with a w 0 5 m and t 3 s 9 s for removing the transient effect the data of the last 300 s is adopted to calculate the average captured power p ave cap in this paper the benefit due to the control in terms of power improvement is defined as the ratio of average captured power of the wec with control to that without control and is denoted as σ fig 7 a shows the average captured power of the wec with latching control and that of the wec without control whereas the benefit due to latching control is exhibited in fig 7b the results of the wec with load control are also plotted in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that t 4 2 s is a critical value for the benefit of latching control for t 4 2 s the average captured power of the wec with latching control is larger than that of the wec without control and it increases with the increase of wave period and then decrease after reaching a peak value of 23 06 kw which is 1 203 times that of the wec without control by contrast for t 4 2 s the captured power of the wec with latching control is slightly smaller than that of the wec without control which implies that the latching control poses a negative effect on the power capture at these wave periods i e σ 1 as shown in fig 7b this is due to the fact that the natural period in relative pitch mode of the wec t n is around 4 2 s and the latching control has both positive and negative effects on the power capture on the one hand the latching control consists in holding the floater in some time interval during its motion cycle and releasing it at an appropriate time to aid the velocity of the floater in more phase with the wave excitation force consequently enlarging the velocity of the floater and improving power capture on the other hand the pto system does not work during the latching duration leading to additional reduction in effective working time of the pto system as shown in fig 6a and consequently reducing power capture to get a better understanding of the two effects of the latching control we compare the velocity amplification and the additional reduction in working time of the pto system due to the latching control at different wave periods here the additional reduction in working time introduced by latching control means the difference between the time interval when the pto system does not work over a wave period of the wec with latching control and that without control the working time reduction ratio due to latching control is defined by the ratio of the additional reduction in working time due to latching control to the wave period and is denoted by r t the velocity amplification factor is defined by the ratio of amplitude of relative pitch velocity of the two rafts with latching control to that without control and is denoted by r v fig 8 shows the velocity amplification factor r v and the working time reduction ratio r t in the wave states with a w 0 5 m it can be seen from fig 8 that as the wave period decreases the velocity amplification factor decreases while the working time reduction ratio increases implying that at small wave period the amplification effect of the latching control on the velocity is less obvious while the reduction effect of the latching control on the working time is more pronounced this explains why latching control has a negative effect on the power capture at t 4 2 s since at these wave periods the positive effect caused by the velocity amplification cannot counteract the negative effect resulting from the additional reduction in working time by contrast at t 4 2 s the working time reduction ratio is relative small and the velocity amplification factor is large leading to the positive effect of latching control overcoming the negative effect and consequently resulting in latching control exhibiting an overall positive effect on the power capture at these wave periods this is the key reason why latching control is effective for wave periods larger than the natural period of the device nevertheless it offers us a guideline to find a new control strategy that improves the amplitude of velocity while without introducing additional reduction in working time at the wave periods smaller than the natural period of the device for the average captured power we can also see from fig 7a that generally as wave period increases the average captured power of device increases first and then decreases after reaching a peak value the variation of the benefit with the wave period is plotted in fig 7b for t 4 2 s the benefit due to the latching control is larger than one and it first increases with increasing wave period and then slightly decreases after reaching a peak value of 3 04 it can also be seen that for t 4 5 s the benefit due to latching control is larger than that due to load control whose peak value is 1 52 which is 0 5 times that due to latching control for t 4 2 s as expected we can see that the benefit due to latching control is smaller than one while that introduced by load control is still larger than one although to a small extent this is because the load control can be considered as a kind of resistive control in which there is an optimal resistive load at any wave state for validating the simulation results of the benefit that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system a hil test rig is developed to conduct dry test of a 1 2 scale model in the absence of wave tank fig 9 shows a photo of the hil test rig that consists of a real hydraulic pto system and a simulated plant that replicates the wave induced motion the working principle of the hil test rig is shown in detail in c liu et al 2018b as shown in fig 9 the beam and fixed base are treated as the aft and fore rafts respectively the relative pitch motion of the two rafts is real timely evaluated by the time domain hydrodynamic model which is run in a matlab xpc target real time machine a hydraulic power pack system is employed to replicate the relative pitch motion of the two rafts real timely through a hydraulic servo valve controlled a driving hydraulic cylinder which drives the beam outputs a relative rotation with respect to the fixed base the experimental data of the captured power and the benefit obtained from the hil test rig is shown in fig 10 a and b whereas the simulation results and the experiment data of the average electric power generated by the generator and the capture width ratio are presented in fig 10c and d respectively it can be seen from fig 10 that generally the simulation results display a good agreement with those of experimental data and the capture width ratio increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after arriving at a peak value of 2 4 and 2 2 for the wecs with latching control and with no control respectively similar to the tendency of average captured power the average electric power produced by the generator first increases with the increase of wave period and then decrease after arriving at a peak value the rafts are long thin cylinders and are horizontally placed on water surface such that the wec has a high water plane area to volume ratio water plane area affects the hydrostatic restoring force thus the influence of raft draft on the power absorption is also of great interest since raft draft changes the waterline fig 11 a shows the variation of the average captured power of the wec with latching control and that of the wec without control with raft draft normalized by raft diameter in the wave state with a w 0 5 m and t 5 5 s whereas the variation of the benefit with raft draft normalized by raft diameter is presented in fig 11b we can see that with raft draft increasing from 0 5d to 0 8d the hydrostatic restoring stiffness decreases resulting in the motion of the rafts being more severe and consequently contributing to relatively more captured power which was also observed by shengnan et al 2014 and zheng et al 2015 however it should be pointed out that as raft draft increases from 0 5d to 0 8d the problem of unsinkability and stability is more obvious and this should be considered in the process of device design for the benefit it can be seen from fig 11b that as raft draft increases from 0 5d to 0 8d the benefit slightly increases first and then decrease and generally it stays a value between 1 2 and 1 25 strictly speaking it is worth noting that the waterline will be real timely changed as the rafts move therefore for a high precise hydrodynamic model the nonlinear effect of the hydrostatic restoring force induced by the changing waterline must be accounted to see whether the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the wec in irregular waves we also carry out simulation in irregular wave environment the fully developed pierson moskowitz energy spectrum is used to simulate the irregular waves and a total simulation time 800 s is adopted in the simulation the prediction of wave force is not addressed here and we assume that the wave force has been already known since the aim of the paper is to assess how large the benefit that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system is however it should be noted that practically for the irregular waves the wave force must be predicted ahead and real time strategies are required to ensure that the control strategy can be performed real timely in irregular waves much valuable work has been done in this research field lopes et al 2009 proposed a non predictive strategy in which a threshold was given and the releasing action is executed when the wave excitation force exceeds the given threshold thus the control was implemented in real time and similar idea was also shown in falcão 2008 henriques et al 2016a 2016b studied an iterative predict ahead latching control strategy in which the iteration of repeat to convergence in the optimal command theory is removed and the code within the iteration is performed only once each time step within the receding horizon framework park et al 2017 proposed an active phase control by predicting the wave period using the information of velocity and acceleration and a novel maximum power point tracking method was adopted to keep the velocity in phase with the excitation force for maximizing the output power of a wec in li et al 2018 a multi layer artificial neural network was adopted and trained by deep machine learning algorithm to predict the wave forces and real time latching control was implemented by using the model predictive control to a point absorber wec k liu et al 2018 applied a force feedback latching control strategy to a two body wec by measuring the latching force thus real time implementation can be achieved li et al 2019a used the grey model to predict the wave forces and investigated the effect of prediction error on control efficiency and their results showed that the prediction error has a negative effect on the energy absorption in li et al 2019b a numerical model was established to predict short term wave force and a smart controller applied the model predictive control to implement real time control to the wec to eliminate the non causality arising in the implementation of real time control strategy a causal control strategy utilizing a causal approximation transfer function to link wave force to the desired floater velocity was proposed by li and gao 2020 for implementing real time control strategy two methods based upon kalman filters were tested by hillis et al 2020a with an experimental 1 25th scale multiple degree of freedom wec to real timely predict the wave excitation force and the effect of prediction errors on the performance of the wec was also investigated by hillis et al 2020b in the irregular wave simulations the last full cycle of data is adopted to calculate the average captured power fig 12 a shows the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control and with no control in the irregular waves with h s 1 m and t p 4 s 9 s whereas the benefit due to latching control and the capture width ratio are exhibited in fig 12b and c respectively it can be seen from fig 12a and b that the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control are larger than those of the wec with no control and the benefit increases with the increase of peak wave period from 1 04 to 1 97 implying that the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is also effective to improve the power capture ability of the wec in irregular waves as we all know the irregular waves are composed of a large number of wave components with different wave frequencies which leads to the power captured ability and the pto efficiency worse than those in regular wave states thereby as shown in figs 10a and 12a the captured power in irregular wave states is largely smaller than that in regular wave states though the significant wave height in irregular wave states is the same with the wave height in regular wave states as shown in fig 10a and c the pto efficiency is around 70 in the regular wave states while it will be smaller than 70 in the irregular wave states due to the irregularities of speed torque associated thereby it can be seen from fig 12a that the maximum captured power obtained by the latching control in the simulations reaches a value of 7 65 kw whereas the corresponding electric output power is 5 11 kw similar to the results in regular waves the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control first increase with the increase of peak wave period and then decrease after arriving at a peak value for the capture width ratio we can see from fig 12c that it increases with the increase of peak wave period and then decreases after reaching a peak value of 1 29 and 0 81 for the wecs with latching control and with no latching respectively to investigate whether latching control can further bring benefit to the wec where load control has been performed and how large the benefit is we further perform latching control to the wec where load control has been performed over a range of regular wave states fig 13 shows the average captured power and the benefit due to latching control in the wave states with a w 0 5 m here the benefit σ means the ratio of average captured power of the wec with both latching control and load control to that with load control it can be seen that the latching control can further improve the power capture ability of the wec where load control has been performed the peak average power of the wec with load control is 23 03 kw while it reaches a value of 31 40 kw when the latching control is further performed as shown in fig 13b the benefit due to latching control generally increases with the increase of wave period and it can reach a peak value of 2 35 for further validating the simulation results the experimental data obtained from the hil test rig is presented in fig 14 which shows the captured power the benefit the electric power generated by the generator and the capture width ratio respectively it can be seen from fig 14 that generally the simulation results agree well with the experimental data similar to the result in fig 10c and d it can be seen from fig 14c and d that the final electric power of the wec where load control has been performed can be further improved by latching control and the capture width ratio increases with the increase of wave period and then decreases after reaching a peak value 6 conclusion this paper focuses on the latching control of a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto system to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the hydraulic pto system is modelled as a coulomb damping and the optimal latching control law is derived from a coulomb damping based model using the optimal control theory the effectiveness of latching control on improving the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system and the benefit introduced by latching control in terms of power improvement are investigated the simulation results are validated by the data obtained from a hil test rig from the above investigation the following conclusions can be made 1 the optimal latching control law derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system at wave periods larger than the natural period of the wec 2 latching control has both positive and negative effects on the power capture due to the amplification of velocity and additional reduction in working time of the pto system respectively for t 4 2 s the positive effect is predominant resulting in the benefit larger than one and reaching a peak value of 3 04 for t 4 2 s the negative effect is dominant leading to the benefit smaller than one 3 at most wave periods the benefit due to latching control is larger than that introduced by load control and latching control can further bring benefit to the raft type wec where load control has been performed future research will focus on developing a real time strategy for the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system in irregular waves and finding a new control strategy that improves the amplitude of velocity while without introducing additional reduction in working time at the wave

20392,the raft type wave energy converter wec consisting of several hinged rafts and hydraulic power take off pto systems captures wave power in a line absorber manner whose scattered and radiated wave pattern is different from that of a point absorber this paper focuses on the latching control of a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto system to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the hydraulic pto system is modelled as a coulomb damping and the optimal latching control law is derived from a coulomb damping based model using the optimal control theory the effectiveness of latching control on improving power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system and the benefit introduced by latching control in terms of power improvement are investigated results show that the optimal latching control law derived from the coulomb damping based model can effectively improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system the benefit due to latching control can reach a peak value of 3 04 which is 2 times that introduced by load control moreover latching control can further benefit the raft type wec where load control has been performed keywords latching control raft type wave energy converter hydraulic power take off system coulomb damping optimal control method 1 introduction the ocean waves provide an abundant renewable energy resource that is taken as a promising alternative to the fossil energy due to its clean and environment friendly property if such a type of untapped energy source is extensively exploited it may make a great contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emission as well as to the electrical energy supply of countries with coasts facing the ocean though the first patent of wave energy conversion was proposed as early as 1799 large attention to the potential of wave energy converters wecs as a significant source of renewable energy did not draw until 1970s when the oil crisis occurred clément et al 2002 the raft type wec consisting of several semi submerged rafts hinged end to end by the joints equipped with power take off pto systems was proposed at that time and is known as its excellent survivability in extreme sea states mccormick 2007 nguyen et al 2020 the relative rotation between the adjacent joined rafts is utilized to drive the pto system for converting wave energy into electricity similar to other oscillating body wecs such as sharp eagle wanshan sheng et al 2017 searev cordonnier et al 2015 wavestar hansen et al 2013 or multi point absorber do et al 2018 the pto system adopted in the raft type wec is a hydraulic pto system since hydraulic system has the characteristics of large transmission power and torque with low frequency fast frequency response hydraulic overload protection and so on which is very adapted to large power and low frequency waves lin et al 2015 moreover the hydraulic system can easily facilitate the conversion of reciprocating motion to rotary motion to drive a generator and can be efficiently used to perform the continuous phase control of the wec movement with the aim of extracting the maximum power from the waves ahamed et al 2020 the hydraulic pto system usually consists of sets of hydraulic cylinders several control manifolds two gas accumulators and a hydraulic motor coupled with an electric generator gaspar et al 2016 active control valves are employed as the control manifolds to rectify the flow and are also used to vary the reaction torque besides the use of hydraulic gas accumulators provides short term energy storage to achieve the smooth electricity production required for a marketable machine the raft type wec which is an attenuator type wec and usually deployed in ocean region of high power density lies parallel to the dominant wave direction such that it can ride the wave and make use of the wave curvature to improve energy extraction cruz 2008 lu et al 2019 tay 2020 wang and ringwood 2021 using the raft type wecs to extract ocean wave energy is of great potential in reducing the pressure of traditional energy however compared with other more developed renewable energy resource such as solar wind or hydro energy wave energy is far less mature if wave energy is to compete with these developed energy sources on an equal footing and come into a commercial stage it is necessary to maximize the energy extraction of the wec such that the cost of energy is minimized to produce electricity at a competitive price to tackle this problem several control strategies were proposed one of the most extensively adopted strategies is latching control originally proposed by budal and falnes 1980 in contrast to the reactive control latching control is recognized by the unidirectional energy flow and it consists in holding the device in some time interval during its motion cycle and releasing it at an appropriate time so that the velocity of the device is in more phase with the wave excitation force to maximize the wave energy extraction bjarte larsson and falnes 2006 wang et al 2018 in previous research much attention was focused on the determination of the optimal latching duration babarit and clément 2006 applied a semi analytical solution and an optimal control method to deal with the optimal latching delay of a generic point absorber wec in regular and irregular waves respectively sheng et al 2015a 2015b used half a difference between the wave period and the natural period of the wec to determine the latching duration of a point absorber wec and results showed that the power capture performance is dramatically improved by such a method feng and kerrigan 2015 applied derivative free optimization to study the optimal latching delay for a heaving buoy wec more recently wu et al 2017 adopted a golden section search algorithm to numerically search the optimal latching duration for a solo duck wec with different load types and the performance improvement due to the latching control and its real time implementation were discussed in wu et al 2018 the fore motioned research all related to a single degree of freedom dof system such as the generic point absorber wecs besides the latching duration was determined on the assumption of a linear pto system for a wec being a multi dof system or including multiple oscillators latching control implemented by locking the device for a while and releasing it at a right time to aid its velocity in more phase with the wave excitation force loses the physical meaning the determination of the optimal latching duration becomes more complicated and difficult in this situation to tackle this challenge many researchers turned to the optimal control method based on the pontryagin s maximum principle korde 2002 2001 studied the implementation of latching control on a point absorber wec featuring an embarked reference including more than one float using the optimal control method in the following years latching control of a multi dof wec the searev was investigated by babarit and clément 2006 based on the optimal control method cândido and justino 2011 studied the latching control strategy for a two body point absorber wec using pontryagin s maximum principle c liu et al 2018a applied the optimal control method to investigate the benefit introduced by latching control to a raft type wec both in regular and irregular waves the optimal control theory was also adopted by li et al 2019a to study latching control of a point absorber wec in irregular waves and the wave force prediction was also addressed in their study unfortunately these studies were also performed on the basis of a linear pto unit however for the oscillating body wecs with hydraulic pto systems the resisting force gas pressure difference multiplied by the piston cross sectional area of the hydraulic cylinder produced by the hydraulic pto system is more like a coulomb damping not a linear one due to the use of hydraulic gas accumulators thus when the floater velocity become zero the body will remain stationary unless or until the hydrodynamic force on the body overcomes the resisting force this phenomenon was observed by falcão 2007 cargo et al 2012 liu et al 2017 penalba et al 2017 penalba and ringwood 2019 and dong et al 2021 and it leads to the power capture performance of a wec with a hydraulic pto system different from that with a linear one furthermore as it is revealed in wu et al 2017 that different pto types will result in different control effects and the pto control will affect the dynamic response and power ouput of the wec si et al 2021 considering the coulomb damping characteristics of the hydraulic pto system falcão 2008 studied the latching control of a generic point absorber wec in which a threshold of the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder chambers was given and the unlatching action occurred when the pressure exceeded the given threshold thus no calculation of the latching duration is required it is clear that most previous study mainly focused on the point absorber wecs based on a linear pto system for the raft type wec studied in this paper it consists of two oscillators with multi dofs and is a line absorber whose scattered and radiated wave pattern is different from that of a point absorber moreover the hydraulic pto system is a high nonlinear system that should not be treated as a linear one hence the determination of the optimal latching duration and the effectiveness of latching control on improving the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system should be specified and studied and this is the first aim of this paper furthermore it is also significant to estimate whether it is cost effective to apply latching control to a raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system to help us make a good estimation we should investigate to what extent latching control can benefit the raft type wec and this is the second aim of this paper for validation of the simulation results a hardware in the loop hil test rig is developed for providing experimental data the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of a raft type wec composed of two hinged rafts is given whereas its hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism is introduced in section 3 then the governing equations concerning the time domain hydrodynamic model of the raft type wec the determination of the optimal latching control law and the model of the hydraulic pto system are presented in section 4 the results and discussions about the effectiveness and the benefit due to latching control are shown in section 5 finally the conclusions are made in section 6 2 description of a raft type wec let us consider a hinged two cylindrical raft type wec floating on ocean waves in which the two hinged raft system is similar to the one studied by liu et al 2020 and c liu et al 2018b as shown in fig 1 it is composed of two slender cylindrical rafts and a hydraulic pto system the two cylindrical rafts with a gap d 0 between them are horizontally placed on water surface and they have the same length l diameter d and draft d f the center of each raft mass coincides well with the raft geometry center the mass is uniformly distributed in the raft shell and the water plane goes through the raft geometry center in still water the hydraulic pto system is located at the gap between the two rafts to convert the wave energy into useful energy a slack mooring system is placed at the front of the fore raft this facilitates self rectifying alignment with the local wave direction and helps the wec quickly adapt itself to the harsh sea conditions stansby et al 2015 paparella and ringwood 2017 a cartesian coordinate system xoyz with origin o being the center of the joint where the x and y axes take along the longitudinal and radial directions of the raft in still water surface respectively while the z axis is in the opposite direction of gravity acceleration is presented in fig 1 to describe the motion characteristics of the raft system only the surge heave and pitch modes of each raft are considered under the action of a head sea incident wave train due to the symmetry of the raft noad and porter 2017 3 working principle of a hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism a hydraulic pto system with latching mechanism is shown in fig 2 which is somewhat different from the one studied in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b instead of the four check valves adopted in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b two switching valves namely valve 1 and valve 2 are employed as the latching mechanism to implement latching control and as rectifying valves to rectify bidirectional flow the non piston rod chamber of the top hydraulic cylinder and the piston rod chamber of the bottom hydraulic cylinder are connected to be chamber 14 whereas the piston rod chamber of the top hydraulic cylinder is connected with the non piston rod chamber of the bottom hydraulic cylinder to be chamber 23 as the wave passes through the rafts the rafts output a relative pitch motion around the joint driving the hydraulic pistons to move reciprocally when the relative pitch motion of the two rafts activates the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to stretch the valve 2 switches to the left position so that the high pressure hp oil pumped from chamber 23 can flow through the hp gas accumulator and arrive at the inlet of the hydraulic motor whereas the valve 1 switches to the right position allowing chamber 14 sucking low pressure lp oil from the outlet of the hydraulic motor then the pressure difference between the hp and lp gas accumulators forces the hydraulic motor shaft to rotate and this rotation drives the generator to produce electricity similarly as the relative pitch motion of the two rafts drives the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to retract the valve 1 and valve 2 switch to the left position and the right position respectively to ensure the hp oil pumped from chamber 14 arrive at the inlet of the hydraulic motor and the chamber 23 sunk lp oil from the outlet of the hydraulic motor thus the valves rectify bidirectional flow and transport a unidirectional flow to the hydraulic motor nevertheless when latching control is applied the two valves switch to the middle position such that the oil flow is cut off and the hydraulic cylinders are locked in this situation the two rafts are locked and move as a whole thus no wave power flows into the hydraulic system in addition to improving the performance of the wec the latching mechanism that locks the two rafts by switching the two valves to the middle positions allows for the access of staff when the wec requires maintenance furthermore compared to the hydraulic pto system studied in cargo et al 2016 2014 penalba and ringwood 2019 liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018b another advantage of the present one is that it can protect the wec from extreme waves since the two rafts can be declutched from the hydraulic pto system by controlling all chambers to be connected with the lp gas accumulator which enables the two rafts to comply with the waves and consequently reduces the hydrodynamic impact forces 4 mathematical model in this section the hydrodynamic model of the wec is given in section 4 1 as stated in the introduction part the determination of the optimal latching duration is complicated and difficult especially when the wec is a multi dof system or includes multiple oscillators and the non linear hydraulic pto system is considered to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the optimal latching control law used to decide which time the two valves should switch to the middle positions is derived using the optimal control theory based on the pontryagin s maximum principle in section 4 2 by simplifying the hydraulic pto system as a coulomb damping then the mathematical model of the hydraulic pto system executing the optimal control command time series calculated from the coulomb damping based model is given in section 4 3 4 1 hydrodynamic model the total number of independent degrees of freedom of the two hinged raft system shown in fig 1 is four the heave and surge modes x 0 and z 0 of the joint and the pitch modes θ 1 and θ 2 of the fore and aft rafts respectively by adopting a generalized displacement vector x gen t x 0 z 0 θ 1 θ 2 t here superscript t indicates the transpose of a vector or a matrix liu et al 2017 applied the lagrange s equations to derive a time domain hydrodynamic model of the wec which has a form as 1 m a x gen t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ k gen x gen t f gen e t f m t where m is the generalized dry mass matrix a is the generalized added mass matrix at infinite frequency k gen is the generalized hydrostatic restoring stiffness matrix h t is the retardation function matrix regarding the generalized radiation forces f gen e t is the generalized wave excitation force vector f m t is the impeding force vector from the hydraulic pto mechanism the expressions of each term in eq 1 are given in detail in liu et al 2017 for accelerating the computation speed of solving eq 1 the convolution integral in eq 1 can be approximated by a state space model c liu et al 2018c 2 μ t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ x s t a s x s t b s x gen t μ t c s x s t where x s t is the state vector of radiation force approximation whose number of elements is n a s b s and c s are coefficient matrixes of the state space model in regular waves the wave excitation force acting on mode j of the raft can be given by falnes 2002 3 f e j t re a w γ j ω e i ω t a w γ j ω cos ω t γ j ω where re means real part of γ j ɷ is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient at mode j force per unit incident wave amplitude whose modulus and argument are γ j ɷ and γ j ɷ respectively ɷ and a w are the wave frequency and wave amplitude respectively here j 1 3 and 5 indicate the surge heave and pitch modes of the fore raft respectively whereas j 1 3 and 5 indicate the surge heave and pitch modes of the aft raft respectively the hydrodynamic model as shown in eq 1 has been validated in liu et al 2017 and c liu et al 2018c irregular waves feature a series of different frequency components and are characterized by the significant wave height h s and the peak wave period t p faltinsen 1990 in irregular waves the global excitation force acting on the raft can be obtained by summing the excitation forces corresponding to each frequency 4 f e j t v 1 k a w ω v γ j ω v cos ω v t γ j ω v ε v where k is a sufficiently large number ω v ε v and a w ω v are the wave frequency random phase angle and wave amplitude of the v th wave component respectively γ j ω v is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient on mode j corresponding to wave frequency ω v the wave amplitude corresponding to v th wave frequency can be written as 5 a w ω v 2 s ω v δ ω v where s ω is the wave spectrum and δω v is the difference between successive frequencies 4 2 determination of the optimal latching control law previous research has shown that the effect of hydraulic pto system is more like a coulomb load type not a linear one because of hydraulic gas accumulators hence to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching control law that maximizes the power captured by the hydraulic cylinders the hydraulic pto system is simplified as a coulomb load type numerical implementation of the coulomb damping force is difficult since the derivative will be infinite at θ 1 θ 2 0 which would result in non physical oscillations of the relative pitch velocity when it is around zero and consequently lead to erroneous values for the power capture zheng et al 2015 babarit et al 2012 similar to the study of zheng et al 2015 a criterion condition θ 1 θ 2 0 001 is adopted here when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 i e the hydrodynamic force is sufficiently large such that it can overcome the resisting force produced by the hydraulic cylinders and drive the hydraulic pistons to move smoothly the hydraulic cylinders act as energy absorber and transmit energy to the hydraulic motor when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 i e the hydrodynamic force is not sufficiently large such that it cannot drive the hydraulic pistons to move smoothly the hydraulic pto system will naturally lock the two rafts and make them move as a whole which is a natural way of achieving latching though no latching control command is applied falcão 2008 thus the impeding force applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism f m t acts as the pto force f pto t to capture energy during some time intervals while it acts as the natural latching force f lat1 t to lock the two rafts during some other time intervals thereby the pto force and the natural latching force can be written as 6 f pto t κ m pto 7 f lat 1 t κ m lat 1 8 m pto m 0 sign θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 0 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 9 m lat 1 0 θ 1 θ 2 0 001 min m 0 m check sign m check θ 1 θ 2 0 001 where κ 0 0 1 1 t m 0 is the equivalent coulomb damping coefficient m check is the moment needed at the joint to make the two rafts rotate as a whole i e the joint connection between the two rafts is rigid on the condition of m lat1 m check zheng et al 2015 when latching command is applied the two valves switch to the middle positions the optimal control law of the valves that maximizes the captured power can be derived from the optimal control theory based on the pontryagin s maximum principle in the study of latching control for a generic point absorber wec babarit and clément 2006 adopted the optimal control theory and employed a linear damping force as the latching force which is considered as a weak model of latching control to derive the optimal control law when the damping coefficient is sufficiently large the latching effect would trend to that of an absolute one here the latching force vector f lat2 t locking the relative pitch motion of the two rafts is modelled as 10 f lat 2 t κ m lat 2 11 m lat 2 m 0 sign θ 1 θ 2 n k θ 1 θ 2 0 001 min m 0 m check sign m check θ 1 θ 2 0 001 where n k is a sufficiently large number to ensure that the latching force can stiffly lock the two rafts thus the impeding force applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism f m t is written as 12 f m t f pto t 1 u f lat 1 t u f lat 2 t where u is the binary control variable with u 1 when latching command is executed and u 0 when no latching command is applied eq 1 can be described as a state space model by inserting eq 2 13 λ a λ v where 14 λ x gen x gen x s a 0 4 4 i 4 4 0 4 n m a 1 k gen 0 4 4 m a 1 c s 0 n 4 b s a s v 0 4 1 m a 1 f gen e t f m t 0 n 1 where the dimensions of state vector λ and matrix a are 8 n 1 and 8 n 8 n respectively as shown in eq 8 it is believed that no power flows into the hydraulic pto system when θ 1 θ 2 0 001 thus for simplicity the energy captured by the hydraulic cylinders over a given time interval 0 t f can be written as 15 e 0 t f m pto θ 1 θ 2 d t for maximizing the captured power over the given time interval 0 t f we should find the optimal control command time series of u that maximizes the captured energy as shown in eq 15 with the consideration of eq 13 a hamiltonian is defined as below to deal with this problem 16 h m pto θ 1 θ 2 λ t a λ v where λ is a column vector of the adjoint state corresponding to the state vector λ and it is given by 17 λ h λ by inserting eq 14 into eq 16 the hamiltonian h can be rewritten as 18 h m pto θ 1 θ 2 λ 1 4 t x gen λ 5 8 t m a 1 f gen e κ m pto κ 1 u m lat 1 κ u m lat 2 c s x s k gen x gen λ 9 n 8 t c s x s b s x gen where λ 1 4 λ 5 8 and λ 9 n 8 are vectors that consist of the elements with the index from 1 to 4 5 to 8 and 9 to n 8 from the adjoint state vector λ respectively the gradient of h with respect to u is 19 h h u λ 5 8 t m a 1 κ m lat 2 m lat 1 based on the pontryagin s maximum principle the control command time series u is optimal when it maximizes the hamiltonian h therefore the equation for the optimal latching control low is 20 u 1 if h 0 0 else 4 3 hydraulic pto model as shown in fig 2 when no latching command is applied the relative pitch motion of the two rafts drives the piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder to move reciprocally the resisting forces from the top and bottom hydraulic cylinders f t and f b can be written as 21 f t p 23 1 α a p p 14 a p f fric d t m p d t f b p 14 1 α a p p 23 a p f fric d b m p d b where a p and α are the piston cross section area and rod to piston cross section area ratio of the hydraulic cylinder respectively d t and d b are the displacements of the top and bottom hydraulic pistons respectively and d t d b r 0 θ 2 θ 1 here r 0 is the distance between the joint and the hydraulic cylinder p 14 and p 23 are the pressures in chamber 14 and chamber 23 respectively m p is the equivalent mass including the effects of piston rod and hydraulic oil in the chamber due to piston acceleration f fric is the friction force in the hydraulic cylinder which can be described by the stribeck model as shown in eq 22 22 f fric x f e i f f e f s and x 0 σ v x sign x f c f s f c exp x c st δ s i f x 0 sign f e f s i f f e f s and x 0 where σ v is the viscous friction coefficient f c is the coulomb friction coefficient f s and f e are the maximum static friction force and external force respectively c st and δ s are the stribeck velocity and corrective coefficient respectively the value of impeding force in pitch mode applied by the hydraulic pto mechanism i e the equivalent coulomb damping coefficient m 0 in eq 8 is written as 23 m 0 f t f b r 0 when the hydrodynamic force is not sufficiently large the two rafts will be naturally locked by the pto mechanism though valve 1 and valve 2 do not switch to the middle positions the pto force and the natural latching force applied by the pto mechanism can be obtained by eqs 6 9 as shown in fig 2 the flow continuity equations in chamber 14 and chamber 23 are 24 q l 4 2 c ip p 23 p 14 a p d t 1 α a p d b c ep p 14 β e v 14 0 a p d t 1 α a p d b p 14 q 23 a p d b 1 α

are in the neutral positions respectively q 14 is the flowrate flowing into the chamber 14 q 23 is the flowrate flowing out of the chamber 23 c ip and c ep are the internal and external leakage coefficients of the hydraulic cylinder respectively the switching valves rectify bidirectional flow and transport a unidirectional flow to the hydraulic motor thereby the hp flowrate q rh pumped from the compressed chamber of the hydraulic cylinders and the lp flowrate q rl flowing into the expanded chamber of the hydraulic cylinders are expressed as 25 q rh q 23 q rl q 14 if θ 2 θ 1 0 q rh q 14 q rl q 23 if θ 2 θ 1 0 the pressure propagation in the pipeline between the switching valves and the hp accumulator is analyzed by using the flow continuity and momentum equations assuming the pipeline consists of n elements the pressure dynamics in the element n can be described by 26 p h n β e q h n 1 q h n δ l pip n a pip n q h n a pip n p h n p h n 1 p fric q h n δ l pip n ρ oil where q h n and p h n are the flowrate and pressure across element n here n n 1 and q h 0 q rh a pip n and δl pip n are the cross sectional area and length of element n p fric q h n is the total pressure drop in element n which is evaluated by 27 p fric q h n λ n δ l pip n 2 d pip n ρ oil q h n a pip n 2 ξ n ρ oil 2 q h n a pip n 2 where d pip n is the diameter of element n ξ n is a friction coefficient for a

motor is described as 28 p h n β e q h n 1 q h q m δ l pip n a pip n v h0 v h where q h and q m are the flowrates to the hp accumulator and the hydraulic motor respectively v h0 and v h are the total volume and gas volume of the hp accumulator respectively for the hp and lp gas accumulators the compression or expansion process of gas is assumed an isentropic process there is hydraulic oil in the hp accumulator under the condition of the pressure in element n of the pipeline ph n larger than the pre charge pressure of the hp accumulator ph0 otherwise the hp accumulator is fully discharged thereby the model of the hp gas accumulator is written as 29 v h v h0 i f p h n p h0 v h0 p h0 p h n 1 γ i f p h n p h0 30 q h 0 i f p h n p h0 v h i f p h n p h0 where γ is the adiabatic index γ 1 4 in case of nitrogen the instantaneous gas pressure p l and gas volume v l in the lp accumulator are given by the isentropic pressure volume law gives as shown in eq 31 the flowrate q l to the lp accumulator is obtained by eq 32 31 v l v l0 0 t q l d t p l v l γ p l0 v l0 γ 32 q l d m ω m q rl where p l0 and v l0 are the pre charge pressure and total volume of the lp accumulator respectively d

the generator are taken as torque losses in the dynamic equation concerning the coupling between the hydraulic motor and the generator as the mechanical losses do which gives liu et al 2020 37 j ω m t m t nl t g where j is the inertia of the motor and generator t nl is the non load torque including stray load losses and mechanical losses and it expressed as 38 t nl b υ ω m t c sign ω m where b υ and t c are the losses coefficients when latching command is executed i e the two valves switch to the middle positions there is no relative pitch motion between the two rafts and no power flowing into the hydraulic pto system and the latching force is modelled by eqs 10 and 11 the power capture ability of a wec is widely evaluated by the capture width ratio η cap which is defined by the ratio of power captured by the device to wave power flowing through the device babarit et al 2012 39 η cap p ave cap p w d where d is the diameter of the raft p ave cap is the average power captured by the hydraulic cylinders p w is the incident wave power per unit width of the wave front and in regular waves it is given by falnes 2002 40 p w ρ g 2 c g a w 2 where ρ is the seawater density g is the

and discussion in this section we first investigate whether the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system then an investigation is conducted to see to what extent latching control can benefit the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system 5 1 wec behavior under latching control for a given wave state the coulomb damping coefficient m 0 is evaluated by the amplitude of hydraulic pto force in pitch mode when no latching control is applied and then the optimal control command time series can be determined on the basis of section 4 2 by an iterative process as shown in fig 3 similar to the iterative program in babarit and clément 2006 and c liu et al 2018a a conditional gradient method is adopted to search the control command time series and we start with u 0 at each time step in 0 t f i e no latching control is applied eq 13 is integrated from 0 to t f with the initial condition of the state vector λ 0 0 to determine the time series of the state vector λ then with the final condition of the adjoint state vector λ t f 0 the time series of λ can be obtained by integrating eq 17 backward from t f to 0 if the energy of the ith iteration is smaller than that of i 1 th iteration the step size is modified finally with the knowledge of the state vector λ and the adjoint state vector λ the control command time series can be obtained by eq 20 the entire iteration process is repeated until the calculation converges in regular wave simulations a time horizon of the calculation t f 400 s is adopted let us consider a raft type wec whose structure parameter configuration is shown in table 1 which is designed based on the china sea states in this paper the hydrodynamic parameters are computed by using the standard version of the boundary element method package ansys aqwa 2011 here only the hydrodynamic parameters in pitch mode of the two rafts are shown in fig 4 the parameter configuration of its hydraulic pto system is given in table 2 fig 5 shows the convergence of the numerical algorithm in a wave state with a w 0 5 m and t 5 4 s in which the amplitude of the hydraulic pto force in pitch mode is around 380 kn m i e m 0 380 kn m it can be seen from fig 5 that the energy captured by the coulomb load increases rapidly as the iteration increases and then it enhances slowly and is converged at a value of 1 135 104 kj in about 20 iterations implying that the latching control law derived in section 4 2 is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with coulomb load type when there is no latching control applied in the wec the power captured by the wec can be maximized by tuning the parameters of the hydraulic pto system such as the displacement of the hydraulic motor the resistance load of the generator and this is called load control falcão 2007 cargo et al 2012 in this paper the load control means the maximum captured power is obtained by tuning the displacement of the hydraulic motor here we numerically find the optimal displacement of the hydraulic motor corresponding to the maximum captured power by adjusting the displacement of the hydraulic motor and then the implementation of load control is performed by using the optimal displacement of the hydraulic motor after knowing the optimal command time series the implementation of latching control for the raft type wec with the hydraulic pto system can be performed based on the model presented in section 4 3 by using the optimal control command time series to implement latching control to the raft type wec fig 6 shows the time history of the optimal control command relative pitch velocity of the two rafts instantaneous power captured by the hydraulic cylinders p ins cap instantaneous power produced by the generator p ins g and energy production over the given time interval the results of the wec with load control and that without control are also plotted in fig 6 as references it can be seen from fig 6a that the control command switches frequently between 0 and 1 for u 1 the two valves switch to the middle positions such that the hydraulic circuit is cut off and the hydraulic cylinders are locked and consequently the relative pitch velocity of the two rafts slows down rapidly and vanishes due to the two valves switching stiffly to perform latching control when latching command is applied the relative pitch velocity of the two rafts is strictly kept at zero during the latching duration which is different from that of the wec using a linear pto system as shown in c liu et al 2018a and babarit and clément 2006 where a very large linear damping force is used as the latching mechanism to hold the floaters hence during the latching duration no power flows into the hydraulic pto system which can be seen in fig 6b as shown in fig 6a it can also be seen that for the wec with load control or without control there are some intervals during which the two rafts are naturally locked by the hydraulic pto system and move as a whole due to the hydrodynamic force not sufficiently large to overcome the resisting force produced by the hydraulic cylinders as it is well known that latching control is implemented by holding the floater and then releasing it at a favorable instant to achieve an approximate resonance state which implies that the improvement of the power capture ability of the wec due to latching control is accompanied by amplifying the velocity of the floater it can be seen from fig 6a that the amplitude of relative pitch velocity of the two rafts with latching control is around 0 21 rad s which is 1 57 and 1 26 times that without control and that with load control respectively as shown in fig 6b the amplitude of the instantaneous captured power p ins cap of the wec with latching control reaches a value of 89 59 kw which is 0 71 and 0 54 times larger than that of the wec without control and that with load control respectively the instantaneous electric power produced by the generator is shown in fig 6c it can be seen that the generator can continuously output power though the hydraulic cylinders are locked by the control command or naturally locked during some periods of the motion cycle this is because the hp gas accumulator will supply extra flow to the hydraulic motor to ensure the generator rotate at an approximately constant speed when the hydraulic cylinders are locked compared with the large fluctuating of the instantaneous captured power the instantaneous electric power produced by the generator could almost hold a constant value only with marginal deviation from the average value due to the effect of the hydraulic gas accumulators the captured energy over the given time interval is presented in fig 6d as expected the captured energy of the wec with latching control is greatly larger than that without control and that with load control and it reaches a value of 1 141 104 kj to summarize from the above analysis we find that the optimal latching control law derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system 5 2 benefit introduced by latching control to evaluate the benefit in terms of power improvement that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system in different wave states we conduct the simulation in different regular wave states with a w 0 5 m and t 3 s 9 s for removing the transient effect the data of the last 300 s is adopted to calculate the average captured power p ave cap in this paper the benefit due to the control in terms of power improvement is defined as the ratio of average captured power of the wec with control to that without control and is denoted as σ fig 7 a shows the average captured power of the wec with latching control and that of the wec without control whereas the benefit due to latching control is exhibited in fig 7b the results of the wec with load control are also plotted in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that t 4 2 s is a critical value for the benefit of latching control for t 4 2 s the average captured power of the wec with latching control is larger than that of the wec without control and it increases with the increase of wave period and then decrease after reaching a peak value of 23 06 kw which is 1 203 times that of the wec without control by contrast for t 4 2 s the captured power of the wec with latching control is slightly smaller than that of the wec without control which implies that the latching control poses a negative effect on the power capture at these wave periods i e σ 1 as shown in fig 7b this is due to the fact that the natural period in relative pitch mode of the wec t n is around 4 2 s and the latching control has both positive and negative effects on the power capture on the one hand the latching control consists in holding the floater in some time interval during its motion cycle and releasing it at an appropriate time to aid the velocity of the floater in more phase with the wave excitation force consequently enlarging the velocity of the floater and improving power capture on the other hand the pto system does not work during the latching duration leading to additional reduction in effective working time of the pto system as shown in fig 6a and consequently reducing power capture to get a better understanding of the two effects of the latching control we compare the velocity amplification and the additional reduction in working time of the pto system due to the latching control at different wave periods here the additional reduction in working time introduced by latching control means the difference between the time interval when the pto system does not work over a wave period of the wec with latching control and that without control the working time reduction ratio due to latching control is defined by the ratio of the additional reduction in working time due to latching control to the wave period and is denoted by r t the velocity amplification factor is defined by the ratio of amplitude of relative pitch velocity of the two rafts with latching control to that without control and is denoted by r v fig 8 shows the velocity amplification factor r v and the working time reduction ratio r t in the wave states with a w 0 5 m it can be seen from fig 8 that as the wave period decreases the velocity amplification factor decreases while the working time reduction ratio increases implying that at small wave period the amplification effect of the latching control on the velocity is less obvious while the reduction effect of the latching control on the working time is more pronounced this explains why latching control has a negative effect on the power capture at t 4 2 s since at these wave periods the positive effect caused by the velocity amplification cannot counteract the negative effect resulting from the additional reduction in working time by contrast at t 4 2 s the working time reduction ratio is relative small and the velocity amplification factor is large leading to the positive effect of latching control overcoming the negative effect and consequently resulting in latching control exhibiting an overall positive effect on the power capture at these wave periods this is the key reason why latching control is effective for wave periods larger than the natural period of the device nevertheless it offers us a guideline to find a new control strategy that improves the amplitude of velocity while without introducing additional reduction in working time at the wave periods smaller than the natural period of the device for the average captured power we can also see from fig 7a that generally as wave period increases the average captured power of device increases first and then decreases after reaching a peak value the variation of the benefit with the wave period is plotted in fig 7b for t 4 2 s the benefit due to the latching control is larger than one and it first increases with increasing wave period and then slightly decreases after reaching a peak value of 3 04 it can also be seen that for t 4 5 s the benefit due to latching control is larger than that due to load control whose peak value is 1 52 which is 0 5 times that due to latching control for t 4 2 s as expected we can see that the benefit due to latching control is smaller than one while that introduced by load control is still larger than one although to a small extent this is because the load control can be considered as a kind of resistive control in which there is an optimal resistive load at any wave state for validating the simulation results of the benefit that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system a hil test rig is developed to conduct dry test of a 1 2 scale model in the absence of wave tank fig 9 shows a photo of the hil test rig that consists of a real hydraulic pto system and a simulated plant that replicates the wave induced motion the working principle of the hil test rig is shown in detail in c liu et al 2018b as shown in fig 9 the beam and fixed base are treated as the aft and fore rafts respectively the relative pitch motion of the two rafts is real timely evaluated by the time domain hydrodynamic model which is run in a matlab xpc target real time machine a hydraulic power pack system is employed to replicate the relative pitch motion of the two rafts real timely through a hydraulic servo valve controlled a driving hydraulic cylinder which drives the beam outputs a relative rotation with respect to the fixed base the experimental data of the captured power and the benefit obtained from the hil test rig is shown in fig 10 a and b whereas the simulation results and the experiment data of the average electric power generated by the generator and the capture width ratio are presented in fig 10c and d respectively it can be seen from fig 10 that generally the simulation results display a good agreement with those of experimental data and the capture width ratio increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after arriving at a peak value of 2 4 and 2 2 for the wecs with latching control and with no control respectively similar to the tendency of average captured power the average electric power produced by the generator first increases with the increase of wave period and then decrease after arriving at a peak value the rafts are long thin cylinders and are horizontally placed on water surface such that the wec has a high water plane area to volume ratio water plane area affects the hydrostatic restoring force thus the influence of raft draft on the power absorption is also of great interest since raft draft changes the waterline fig 11 a shows the variation of the average captured power of the wec with latching control and that of the wec without control with raft draft normalized by raft diameter in the wave state with a w 0 5 m and t 5 5 s whereas the variation of the benefit with raft draft normalized by raft diameter is presented in fig 11b we can see that with raft draft increasing from 0 5d to 0 8d the hydrostatic restoring stiffness decreases resulting in the motion of the rafts being more severe and consequently contributing to relatively more captured power which was also observed by shengnan et al 2014 and zheng et al 2015 however it should be pointed out that as raft draft increases from 0 5d to 0 8d the problem of unsinkability and stability is more obvious and this should be considered in the process of device design for the benefit it can be seen from fig 11b that as raft draft increases from 0 5d to 0 8d the benefit slightly increases first and then decrease and generally it stays a value between 1 2 and 1 25 strictly speaking it is worth noting that the waterline will be real timely changed as the rafts move therefore for a high precise hydrodynamic model the nonlinear effect of the hydrostatic restoring force induced by the changing waterline must be accounted to see whether the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the wec in irregular waves we also carry out simulation in irregular wave environment the fully developed pierson moskowitz energy spectrum is used to simulate the irregular waves and a total simulation time 800 s is adopted in the simulation the prediction of wave force is not addressed here and we assume that the wave force has been already known since the aim of the paper is to assess how large the benefit that latching control can bring to the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system is however it should be noted that practically for the irregular waves the wave force must be predicted ahead and real time strategies are required to ensure that the control strategy can be performed real timely in irregular waves much valuable work has been done in this research field lopes et al 2009 proposed a non predictive strategy in which a threshold was given and the releasing action is executed when the wave excitation force exceeds the given threshold thus the control was implemented in real time and similar idea was also shown in falcão 2008 henriques et al 2016a 2016b studied an iterative predict ahead latching control strategy in which the iteration of repeat to convergence in the optimal command theory is removed and the code within the iteration is performed only once each time step within the receding horizon framework park et al 2017 proposed an active phase control by predicting the wave period using the information of velocity and acceleration and a novel maximum power point tracking method was adopted to keep the velocity in phase with the excitation force for maximizing the output power of a wec in li et al 2018 a multi layer artificial neural network was adopted and trained by deep machine learning algorithm to predict the wave forces and real time latching control was implemented by using the model predictive control to a point absorber wec k liu et al 2018 applied a force feedback latching control strategy to a two body wec by measuring the latching force thus real time implementation can be achieved li et al 2019a used the grey model to predict the wave forces and investigated the effect of prediction error on control efficiency and their results showed that the prediction error has a negative effect on the energy absorption in li et al 2019b a numerical model was established to predict short term wave force and a smart controller applied the model predictive control to implement real time control to the wec to eliminate the non causality arising in the implementation of real time control strategy a causal control strategy utilizing a causal approximation transfer function to link wave force to the desired floater velocity was proposed by li and gao 2020 for implementing real time control strategy two methods based upon kalman filters were tested by hillis et al 2020a with an experimental 1 25th scale multiple degree of freedom wec to real timely predict the wave excitation force and the effect of prediction errors on the performance of the wec was also investigated by hillis et al 2020b in the irregular wave simulations the last full cycle of data is adopted to calculate the average captured power fig 12 a shows the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control and with no control in the irregular waves with h s 1 m and t p 4 s 9 s whereas the benefit due to latching control and the capture width ratio are exhibited in fig 12b and c respectively it can be seen from fig 12a and b that the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control are larger than those of the wec with no control and the benefit increases with the increase of peak wave period from 1 04 to 1 97 implying that the optimal control command derived from a coulomb damping based model is also effective to improve the power capture ability of the wec in irregular waves as we all know the irregular waves are composed of a large number of wave components with different wave frequencies which leads to the power captured ability and the pto efficiency worse than those in regular wave states thereby as shown in figs 10a and 12a the captured power in irregular wave states is largely smaller than that in regular wave states though the significant wave height in irregular wave states is the same with the wave height in regular wave states as shown in fig 10a and c the pto efficiency is around 70 in the regular wave states while it will be smaller than 70 in the irregular wave states due to the irregularities of speed torque associated thereby it can be seen from fig 12a that the maximum captured power obtained by the latching control in the simulations reaches a value of 7 65 kw whereas the corresponding electric output power is 5 11 kw similar to the results in regular waves the average captured power and the average electric power of the wec with latching control first increase with the increase of peak wave period and then decrease after arriving at a peak value for the capture width ratio we can see from fig 12c that it increases with the increase of peak wave period and then decreases after reaching a peak value of 1 29 and 0 81 for the wecs with latching control and with no latching respectively to investigate whether latching control can further bring benefit to the wec where load control has been performed and how large the benefit is we further perform latching control to the wec where load control has been performed over a range of regular wave states fig 13 shows the average captured power and the benefit due to latching control in the wave states with a w 0 5 m here the benefit σ means the ratio of average captured power of the wec with both latching control and load control to that with load control it can be seen that the latching control can further improve the power capture ability of the wec where load control has been performed the peak average power of the wec with load control is 23 03 kw while it reaches a value of 31 40 kw when the latching control is further performed as shown in fig 13b the benefit due to latching control generally increases with the increase of wave period and it can reach a peak value of 2 35 for further validating the simulation results the experimental data obtained from the hil test rig is presented in fig 14 which shows the captured power the benefit the electric power generated by the generator and the capture width ratio respectively it can be seen from fig 14 that generally the simulation results agree well with the experimental data similar to the result in fig 10c and d it can be seen from fig 14c and d that the final electric power of the wec where load control has been performed can be further improved by latching control and the capture width ratio increases with the increase of wave period and then decreases after reaching a peak value 6 conclusion this paper focuses on the latching control of a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto system to reduce the complexity of finding the optimal latching duration the hydraulic pto system is modelled as a coulomb damping and the optimal latching control law is derived from a coulomb damping based model using the optimal control theory the effectiveness of latching control on improving the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system and the benefit introduced by latching control in terms of power improvement are investigated the simulation results are validated by the data obtained from a hil test rig from the above investigation the following conclusions can be made 1 the optimal latching control law derived from a coulomb damping based model is effective to improve the power capture ability of the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system at wave periods larger than the natural period of the wec 2 latching control has both positive and negative effects on the power capture due to the amplification of velocity and additional reduction in working time of the pto system respectively for t 4 2 s the positive effect is predominant resulting in the benefit larger than one and reaching a peak value of 3 04 for t 4 2 s the negative effect is dominant leading to the benefit smaller than one 3 at most wave periods the benefit due to latching control is larger than that introduced by load control and latching control can further bring benefit to the raft type wec where load control has been performed future research will focus on developing a real time strategy for the raft type wec with a hydraulic pto system in irregular waves and finding a new control strategy that improves the amplitude of velocity while without introducing additional reduction in working time at the wave

20393,an important part of establishing a prediction model for maritime search and rescue and oil spill drift is to quantify the uncertainty in particle motion simulation a regional sub grid velocity model based on drifting buoy data is proposed to simulate the unsolved velocity which is composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors tase in the ocean model contrary to most of the traditional drift trajectory prediction models the presented method divided the experimental area into 69 custom grids the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficients of each grid were obtained by using the fitting velocity difference of buoy velocity current velocity and wind velocity and autocorrelation analysis of time series two sub grid velocity models the random flight model and the random walk model were built respectively and were combined with the lagrangian particle tracking model to simulate the drifting buoy trajectory in the process of lagrange particle tracking fourth order runge kutta was used to interpolate the velocity and kernel density estimate method was used to calculate the predicted range of 95 confidence interval for evaluation and validation the experimental results of several different settings indicated that the prediction performance of the random flight model was better than that of the random walk model when the tase diffusion coefficient was determined by this method and the prediction performance of models with different diffusion coefficients is better than that of models with the same diffusion coefficient this work also proved the value of using the trajectory data of drifting buoys to build a sub grid velocity model for trajectory prediction keywords oil spill search and rescue sub grid scale velocity model diffusion drifter buoys 1 introduction with the rapid development of global marine economy maritime activities such as exploitation of marine resources and maritime transport become more and more frequent and at the same time a series of disastrous maritime accidents and marine environmental problems were brought about the impacts of maritime disasters and accidents mainly include two categories one is the direct threat to people s life safety according to the statistics of the china maritime search and rescue center china has verified 11 556 maritime distress accidents searched and rescued 10040 ships and 87141 persons in distress from 2014 to 2019 the other is the harm to the marine environment the most common accident of this kind is oil spill accidents such as the sanchi collision accident chen et al 2020 and deepwater horizon oil rig explosion in the gulf of mexico mariano et al 2011 compared with the former although the harm to the marine environment does not directly endanger human life the economic loss it brings is incalculable to deal with emergencies and minimize such consequences research and development of accurate and reliable models to predict the evolution of maritime disasters and accidents to provide decision making assistance for oil spill emergency events and maritime search and rescue sar has become a research topic of concern for many scientists the monte carlo perturbation combined with particle tracking method is the most commonly used and effective method for ensemble prediction of oil spill drift and it is also widely used in the operational model of maritime search and rescue zhang et al 2017 toz a c and b koseoglu 2018 although the movement of floating targets is mainly affected by surface wind current and waves the simulation of the movement process of floating targets is a rather complicated process because the movement of floating targets is disturbed by too many uncertain factors at every moment zhu et al 2019 the intervention of the monte carlo method is to simulate and quantify these uncertain factors and then simulate the prediction area of target drift to guide the emergency action effectively in this sense search and rescue and oil spill tracking have the same characteristics while the oil spill needs to simulate the chemical process of oil drift zhang et al 2017 in general the main sources of uncertainties in oil spill and sar operations are the result of the intrinsic complexity of ocean dynamics and can be summarized as sayol et al 2014 1 the initial conditions of particles released in the prediction model are uncertain the exact location and even the time of the accidents usually are unknown at the beginning of many maritime accidents 2 the navier stokes equations governing the physics of the ocean are non linear and therefore due to the chaotic nature of the ocean small variations of the initial conditions will provide large deviation of the forecast fields that will increase with time 3 the uncertainties from the drifting dynamics model the drifting motion of an object at sea depends on the ratio of its surface area exposed to water and water these influences are usually included in the wind drag coefficient which is empirically determined sometimes after a trial error process 4 the uncertainties from oceanic environment data operational models for oceanic and atmospheric forecasting do not resolve the small scale but they parametrize the turbulent motions in other words no information at the sub grid scale is provided in previous work many researchers proposed different prediction schemes and established a series of drift prediction models aiming at the uncertainties in 1 3 above the probabilistic models based on the leeway dynamics model a a allen 2005 a a allen and jeffery v plourde 1999 brushett et al 2017 is one of the most widely used approaches to describe the uncertainties on the drifting trajectory of an object yan li et al 2019 designed five numeric simulation scenarios and then input the different current and wind forcing data into the forecasting system and set the different oil released time in the five scenarios to reveal the major error sources besides a lot of studies ullman o donnell et al 2006 abascal et al 2009a minguez et al 2012 abascal et al 2017a applied frequency coastal radars current data to particle tracking model danchuk and willson 2010 studied the effects of shoreline sensitivity on oil spill trajectory modeling of the lower mississippi river for the uncertainty of environmental field data the usual modeling scheme is the random walk model or the random flight model in the studies of griffa 1996 drouin et al 2019 abascal et al 2012 2017b the random walk model with fixed diffusion coefficients is adopted in the study of david s ullman ullman o donnell et al 2006 monte carlo particle trajectory simulations using surface currents derived from standard range and long range radar systems were performed using random walk and random flight models of the unresolved velocities melsom et al 2012 compared the dispersion of passive tracers in a 100 member ensemble of the topaz ocean prediction system to the dispersion found adding random flight perturbations to the ensemble mean vector field and a deterministic vector field chiri et al 2020 simulated 125 patterns of 1 month met ocean evolutions in the north sea obtained by applying k means algorithms techniques found similar dispersion maps than the obtained with a monte carlo simulation based on 1000 met ocean scenarios however the above studies all treat the diffusion coefficient of the study area as a constant the spatial variation of the diffusion coefficient in different areas was not taken into account it can be predicted that when the movement trajectory of oil slick or search and rescue target is long enough to cross a large area it will bring some inevitable precision loss to the drifting prediction simulation of targets if the diffusion coefficient of the whole area is still considered as a constant therefore the research objective of this work is to divide the test area into regions and then modeling the velocity at the sub grid scale in different regions using drifting buoy data and verify their influence in this work an ensemble drift prediction model which can be used for offshore oil spill and search and rescue operation is established based on sub grid current data simulation the sea area studied is the north pacific ocean on the west coast of the united states firstly the lagrangian particle tracking model was introduced to predict the object s velocity under the forces of wind and current then the experimental area was divided into 69 custom grids two sub grid velocity models the random flight model and the random walk model were built respectively to calculate the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficient of each grid furthermore four groups of comparison tests were set up and the kernel density estimation method was used to calculate the predicted range of 95 confidence interval of the four groups of tests finally the performance of the random flight model and the random walk model as well as the influence of the diffusion coefficient of regional variation on the model were verified by the evaluation and comparison of the results of four groups of tests 2 data and methods 2 1 lagrangian particle tracking model particles on the sea surface are transported by the combined effect of surface ocean currents winds waves and turbulent dispersion abascal et al 2009 this transport is governed by the transport equation in the lagrangian form 1 d x d t u a x t u s x t where x x y is the positioning vector and u a and u s are advection and diffusion velocity vectors respectively both positioning and velocities are time t dependent processes the advection velocity u a can be expressed as a linear combination of surface currents ekman drift baroclinic motion tidal and inertial currents leeway velocity due to wind and stokes drift induced by waves abascal et al 2009 2 u a x t u c x t u l x t c h u h x t where u c is the surface current velocity vector u l x t is wind induced drift velocity leeway velocity u h is wave induced stokes drift velocity and c h corresponds to the wave coefficient for small targets the wave coefficient u h was not a significant parameter of the model rixen and ferreira coelho 2007 therefore the wave induced stokes drift could be discarded in the particle tracking model in addition the area of the drifting buoy exposed above sea surface is small thus we assume to neglect the crosswind component of the leeway l c and the advection term is deterministic the leeway velocity vector is defined as 3 u l x t l d x t c d u w x t where l d is the downwind component of leeway u w is the wind velocity at a height of 10 m over the sea surface c d is the drag coefficient which generally ranges from 1 to 2 for drift buoys mauri gerin et al 2009 2 2 sub grid scale velocity model in the lagrange particle tracking calculation the surface current velocity and wind velocity used to calculate particle advection velocity u a are usually derived from the oceanic and meteorological numerical models however due to the limited grid resolution of numerical oceanic and meteorological models it is insufficient to describe small scale turbulence vortices and the fine grained dynamic processes caused by elaborate topography and shoreline therefore in the simulated wind field and current field involved in maritime sar and oil spill drift prediction model some drift velocities cannot be resolved by grid scale these velocities are called sub grid velocities or diffusion velocities u s which mainly consist of turbulence and advection simulation errors since drifters are now routinely launched there is potentially substantial value in a methodology that allows the estimation of the statistics of u s from the comparison of drifters and oceanic field velocities ullman d s et al 2006 for drifting buoys which are mainly affected by current it can be considered that the diffusion velocity u s of the sub grid model is mainly composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors two models of sub grid scale velocities were examined both are members of the hierarchy of stochastic particle models reviewed by griffa 1996 and assume that the two horizontal components are independent the so called random walk and random flight models both assume that the particle position is markovian the latter also assumes that the particle velocity is a markovian variable both of the 2 models are often used to describe unstable movements in many past studies the 2 models have been used to simulate diffusion velocity the random flight model recognizes that the diffusion velocity fluctuations have a finite temporal correlation scale whereas the random walk model assumes that the correlation scale is infinitesimal when the same tase velocity variance is used in the two models one expects greater particle dispersion with the random flight version in this work the 2 models would be used to simulate tase velocity respectively the random walk formulation for the components of u s can be expressed as 4 u s d s d t k w 1 2 d w 5 k w σ 2 t where ds is the displacement due only to the tase velocity k w is the diffusion coefficient σ is the velocity standard deviation and dw is a normally distributed random increment with zero mean and second moment d w d w 2 d t where dt the time step for the integration of 1 note that the tase timescale t in the discrete problem is not actually infinitesimal but is constrained to equal dt 2 to obtain consistency between 4 and the definition of velocity variance the evolution of the tase velocity in the random flight model is described by 6 d u s 1 t u s d t k f 1 2 d w ˆ 7 k f σ 2 t k w t 2 the first term on the right of 7 introduces memory with a timescale t to the model of the tase and the second term is as in the random walk model a random impulse k f is the diffusion coefficient as is easily demonstrated the autocorrelation function of the u s in 7 decays exponentially with an e folding time or integral timescale equal to t griffa 1996 2 3 experimental data the ocean model used to provide current forcing to the particle tracking model is the us hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom https www ncdc noaa gov data access model data model datasets navoceano hycom glb this system provides 4

atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80 km this analysis uses position and horizontal velocity data from both undrogued and 15 m drogued drifters of the global drifter program gdp this dataset is archived and distributed by the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration aoml noaa http www aoml noaa gov phod dac index php laurindo mariano et al the time range of the drifter data set used in this work was from may 2015 to dec 2019 in total two sets of drifting buoys have more than 240 000 positioning samples in the experimental area their drift trajectories are shown in fig 1 3 model calibration 3 1 best calibration coefficients according to the transport equation 1 the velocity of particle u consists of advection velocity u a and diffusion velocity u s according to the above analysis the diffusion is mainly composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors tase u s also represents tase velocity the advection velocity u a could be divided into 3 parts in equation 2 current velocity wind induced drift velocity and wave induced drift velocity however tase velocity u s is not a variable that could be calculated directly therefore equation 1 was rewritten as 8 d x d t u a x t u s x t u c x t c w u w x t c h u h x t σ e firstly we used an optimal parameter estimation method to solve these three parameters related to u a here σ e is the fitting residual in the above equation and is assumed as the tase velocity considering that the wave induced stokes drift velocity could be ignored only the wind induced drift coefficient needs to be calculated by the optimal fitting for the next step the objective function j was defined as following to calculate c w abascal et al 2009a b 9 j θ j m i n u b x u c x c w u w x 2 u b y u c y c w u w y 2 where θ c w eq 4 represents the difference between the predicted particle velocities and the drifter velocities u bx and u by are the drifter velocity d x d t components in the x w e and y n s direction respectively u cx and u cy are the surface current velocity components in the x and y direction respectively u wx and u wy are the wind velocity components in the x and y direction respectively m and n are the numbers of drifters and time intervals the automatic calibration aimed to find the optimal combination of the parameter c w that minimizes the objective function j in this analysis the optimal coefficients for undrogued drifters were found to be c ˆ w 0 019 in the interval 0 015 0 023 for drogued drifters c ˆ w 0 008 in the interval 0 006 0 01 3 2 estimate of tase velocity statistics in this work we refer to the method provided by ullman o donnell et al 2006 to calculated parameters σ k f t and k w the difference is that we divided the study area 120 w 144 w 20 ñ50 n into 69 custom grids see fig 2 there are two main criterions for dividing the grids in this paper firstly the nearshore grid should be denser because the simulation errors of near shore advection and influence of turbulence are relatively larger at the same grid scale secondly the custom grids should not be too small to ensure that the sample size in each grid is greater than 50 the diffusivity in each grid is assumed to be constant in time and spatially variable thus the four parameters above should be calculated in different grid separately practical implementation of the aforementioned tase models to determine the random velocity components in 4 5 requires specification of the velocity variance σ 2 and for the random flight case the tase timescale t if the trajectories of clusters of drifters released simultaneously at a variety of locations were available one could estimate the dispersion coefficient k and compute σ 2 and t if necessary from 8 the tase velocity is 10 u s x t d x d t u a x t d x d t u c x t c ˆ w u w x t to calculate the tase time scale t in different areas time series of u s for each drifter trajectories in different grids were used to compute the autocorrelation function for the u sx and u sy components take u sx for example the autocorrelation function acf can be described as 11 ρ h c o v u s x t u s x t h v a r u s x t v a r u s x t h n 1 t 1 n h u s x t u s x u s x t h u s x σ u s x 2 tase integral timescales for the two velocity components were estimated by fitting exponential autocorrelation functions to the observed autocovariance at lags of 6 h although computationally much simpler than the method of moments technique used by griffa 1996 this method is similar to theirs in that only autocovariance at short lags which are statistically most reliable are used to estimate the tase timescale these were subsequently averaged over all drifter trajectories in different grids to produce the curves shown in fig 3 take grid 3 grid 19 and grid 49 for example the best fit exponential autocovariance functions are shown as dashed curves in fig 3 and the parameter estimated for whole grids are given in table 1 however the acf value of samples in most regions rapidly approached 0 fluctuating between 0 2 0 2 after 24 h 3 3 estimates of different types of buoys it should be noted that although the movements of the two different types of buoys are affected slightly differently by the sea surface environment the undrogued drifters are more influenced by the wind drag but firstly we assumed that the difference in wind effects is not significant in addition it is difficult to divide appropriate custom grids according to the sample size no matter the undrogued buoys or drogued buoys were used alone for the study of the experimental area this is mainly because the sample size of the two types of buoys in the nearshore area is insufficient and the distribution is uneven the nearshore area is the most concerned area in the search and rescue and oil spill work drogued buoys have less than 20 samples in grids 42 44 45 46 47 and 50 while undrogued buoys have less than 20 samples in grids 55 56 57 62 69 under the above assumptions and premises both the undrogued and drogued buoys were used to perform parameter calculations in different grid areas buoys velocities were interpolated according to latitude longitude and time however to verify this hypothesis this paper also used two types of buoys to analyze the standard deviation and time scale of tase velocities in different sub grid areas respectively the corresponding results are shown in figs 4 5 in figs 4 and 5 the dotted and solid lines represent the standard deviation and time scale of the velocities components of tase respectively the fitting lines obtained in the figures were disconnected because parts of the grids did not have enough samples when a single type of buoys was used for the standard deviations of the tase velocities the standard deviations obtained by using undrogued buoys were generally slightly larger for both eastward and northward direction components so as the cases in 43 of 58 grids this may be due to the undrogued buoys being affected slightly more by wind and the wind field also contains certain errors however the standard deviations of the tase velocities components obtained by the two types of buoys were basically the same the difference of standard deviations of the tase velocity components σx and σy of the two types of buoys are less than 0 03 in each grid for the time scale of tase velocities components the two types of buoys did not show significant differences and the time scales obtained were basically the same therefore it could be considered that the hypothesis in this paper is basically valid based on the above analysis results 3 4 calculation of diffusion coefficients based on the above data and methods the diffusion coefficients and tase timescales of the random flight model and the random walk model were calculated in the 69 grids in the experimental area meanwhile the tase velocities in different grids were decomposed into u and v components for solving respectively the parameter calibration results of the complete 69 grids are shown in table 1 it should be noted that only k w value is given in the table for the random flight model k f k w t 2 to understand the variation of diffusion coefficient in different regions more intuitively the diffusion coefficient in the east west direction and north south direction was vector summed in this paper and the comprehensive diffusion coefficient was defined as k k x 2 k y 2 the distribution of the comprehensive diffusion coefficient in different grids was shown in fig 6 and fig 7 according to figs 6 7 it could be found that the standard deviation and the tase diffusion coefficient obtained by the calibration of both the random flight model and the random walk model showed a larger trend in the nearshore area at the same time in some grids of the nearshore area 41 48 the diffusion coefficient in the north south direction was significantly higher than that in the east west direction this could be because these areas are mainly affected by coastal currents however the tase timescale t which mainly ranges from 5 to 12 h did not show specific regional characteristics 4 simulation and validation after the diffusion coefficient and other parameters of each grid in the test area were obtained the trajectory simulation of a series of drifting buoy samples was carried out by using random walk model and random flight model respectively based on the monte carlo method 4 1 monte carlo stochastic model based on formula 2 the lagrangian stochastic model is used to simulate the trajectories of drifting buoys lagrangian stochastic model has been widely used in oceanography and meteorology to represent the unresolved velocity variability in ocean currents and winds gao et al 2018 afenyo et al 2016 yin et al 2018 due to the relatively rough resolution of the marine meteorological environmental fields used the calculation time step and output time step of particle tracking in this work are 1 h and 3 h respectively the interpolation of wind field and current field is divided into the following two parts 1 to interpolate the wind field and current field velocities to the positions of the current particle coordinates using a three dimensional interpolation of latitude longitude and time 2 the fourth order runge kutta horizontal interpolation breivik and allen 2008 scott et al 2012 of the wind field and the current field was used to drive the particle in the calculation of the particle continuous trajectory for each sample 1000 particles were generated by the monte carlo stochastic perturbation method based on random flight and random walk models respectively for particle tracking in this work only the coefficients in the random flight model and the random walk model were disturbed the corresponding tase diffusion coefficients in the monte carlo disturbance were also different when the particles drift into different girds the perturbation of some other relative coefficients was ignored such as the wind induced drift coefficient and the coefficients in the oil spill model which simulate some chemical processes the final positions of the 1000 simulated trajectories varied depending on the random coefficients generated in the particle tracking model and they provide a set of numerical locations that define the search area for the buoy s location 4 2 search area probability density calculation whether in maritime search and rescue or oil spill emergency support systems the most instructive significance for researchers and decision makers is usually the target search range and probability distribution of the output of the prediction model adopted however the reference value and importance of the trajectory prediction of a single particle are weaker than the former because of its randomness and fortuitousness therefore it is crucial for search and rescue and oil spill prediction models whether their output search range can cover the position of real drifting targets at different times and it is also an important index to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the models the range predicted by the model is determined by the horizontal position distribution of the simulated particles at different times in this work a closed curve containing 95 particle positions is calculated using the kernel density estimate method abascal et al 2009 martinez w l martinez a r 2002 and the region contained in this curve is the predicted search range with a confidence interval of 95 for a sample of size n where each observation is a d dimensional vector xi i 1 n the kernel density estimate is defined as martinez w l martinez a r 2002 12 f ˆ k e r x 1 n h 1 h d i 1 n j 1 d κ x j x i j h j where xij is the jth component of the ith observation κ is the kernel function and h is the smoothing parameter or window width the parameter h is defined as 13 h j k e r 4 n d 2 1 d 4 σ j j 1 d where σ j is the standard deviation of the jth component the kernel equation for density estimation was considered as a gaussian function 14 κ x 1 2 π exp x 2 2 4 3 comparison and analysis the samples used for verification were the buoy trajectory data from january 1st 2017 to january 31st 2017 and this long trajectory data was not used for parameter calibration of the two sub grid velocity models mentioned above as shown in fig 8 the buoy crossed five grids along the coastline from south to north 41 42 43 44 25 the total distance of the buoy trajectory was about 650 km and the average velocity was about 0 24 m s firstly the drift trajectory data for a total of 31 days was divided into several time intervals the length of a single sample was set at 120 h and the time sliding window was set to 48 h which means each segment overlapping the previous one by 48 h in addition the hycom model lost about three days of data from january 5 to january 7 therefore a total of 10 cases were obtained in this work fig 8 shows the full trajectory of the buoy for 31 days and two of its intercepted cases in order to verify the performance of the predicted results of the models four groups of simulation schemes were set up for each sample in this work for comparison as follows 1 the random flight model using diffusion coefficients from different grids 2 the random walk model using diffusion coefficients from different grids 3 the random flight model using diffusion coefficients from the same grids the mean of the diffusion coefficients of all the grids 4 the random walk model using diffusion coefficients from the same grids the mean of the diffusion coefficients of all the grids two validation indicators for the models were set as follows 1 the average prediction error the average distance between the real position of the buoy and the 1000 simulated particle the average prediction error was calculated for every 3 h of each sample 2 the probability of success pos that the current drifting buoy position is within the area the model predicted taking the buoy data from january 8th 2017 to january 31st 2017 as an example figs 9 10 show the simulation results of two of the ten cases segmented from this long trajectory dotted lines in each figure represent the predicted area of four sets of simulation schemes with simulation time of 24 h and 120 h in the vast majority of cases the predicted areas of the four simulation schemes cover the real buoy position when the simulation time is 24 h however when the simulation period comes to 120 h the simulation results are much worse in case 1 only the simulation results of group 1 and group 2 cover the real drifting buoy position in case 3 only the simulation result of group 1 covers the real drifting buoy position the complete statistical results of all 10 cases are shown in fig 11 and table 2 in addition it is easy to find that the speed of regional diffusion predicted by the random flight model is much higher than that of the random walk model the predicted area in group 1 and group 3 are slightly larger than those in group 2 and group 4 which means that the diffusion coefficient used is larger the diffusion velocity of the predicted area will also be larger in both the random flight and random walk model the average prediction errors of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in fig 11 the mean prediction error increases almost linearly with time however there is no significant difference in the average prediction errors of the groups of simulation the difference of the average prediction error of the four groups of simulations in each period is within 6 km the statistical results of the pos of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in table 2 the pos of each group of simulations within 48 h is higher than 60 and then they decline significantly over time the pos of group 1 4 is 60 20 40 20 respectively when the simulation period is 120 h in general the pos of the four groups of simulations are ranked descending order as follows group 1 group 3 group 2 and group 4 it can be found that the ability of the random flight model to successfully cover the real target position is significantly stronger than that of the random walk model in addition as can be seen from the comparison between group 1 and group 3 as well as the comparison between group 2 and group 4 the predicted areas simulated by the sub grid velocity model with different diffusion coefficient schemes have better pos values the proper diffusion coefficient can improve the performance of both two models the average predicted areas of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in table 3 it is well known that the larger the prediction area is the more likely it is to cover the real target location however it will also bring many difficulties to rescue or oil spill emergency work if the predicted area is too wide which would reduce the probability of successful rescue frost j and stone lawrence 2001 therefore the experimental results seem to be less convincing when the random flight model achieved a higher pos with a larger predicted area however it also needs to be noted that on the one hand the stochastic flight model considered the temporal correlation of simulated particle velocity under a reasonable physical mechanism which leads to faster diffusion velocity on the other hand the results of random flight model simulation do not form too unreasonable large prediction range and it has a better balance between prediction range and pos in addition from the comparison between group 1 and group 3 as well as the comparison between group 2 and group 4 it could be found that the mean predicted areas simulated by the sub grid velocity model with different diffusion coefficient schemes are smaller than those with the same diffusion coefficient schemes for most of the time except for the 72 nd h combined with the statistical results of pos it can be found that the establishment of the regional sub grid velocity model can improve the simulation and prediction performance of the random walk model and the random flight model 5 conclusion in this work a maritime search and rescue and oil spill drift prediction model based on the regional sub grid velocity model was established contrary to most of traditional drift trajectory prediction models the presented method divided the experimental area into 69 custom grids more than 240 000 positioning data from drifting buoys were used to rate the tase diffusion coefficients and tase time scale for two sub grid velocity models in each grid on this basis the target drift prediction area is calculated by using lagrange stochastic model and kernel density estimate the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficient of each grid were obtained by using the fitting velocity difference of buoy velocity current velocity and wind velocity and autocorrelation analysis of time series the results indicated that the tase diffusion coefficients of the two sub grid velocity models random flight model and random walk model were significantly larger in the nearshore area k w 700 m2 s k f 10 6 m2 s3 the diffusion coefficients for random walk model of all grids were between 382 m2 s and 1080 m2 s while the diffusion coefficients for random flight model were between 5 3 10 7 m2 s3 and 1 9 10 6 m2 s3 which basically coincides with the assumption that the nearshore tase has a large influence the evaluation and comparison of 95 confidence area calculated by kernel density estimate in the four groups of experiments indicated that the simulation results of the random flight model were significantly better than that of the random walk model on the premise of using the same method to obtain the tase velocity standard deviation and time scale the pos of the two random flight model simulation schemes were 60 and 40 at 120 h while the pos of the two random walk model simulation schemes were only 20 in addition the simulation results of different diffusion coefficient schemes can obtain higher pos values under the premise of smaller average predicted area this further proves the value of the regional sub grid tase velocity model based on the drifting buoy trajectory data the numerical simulation and trajectory verification in this paper were carried out using drifting buoy data while the disturbance of wind induced drift coefficient current induced drift coefficient and chemical process such as weathering of oil spill were not taken into account in monte carlo calculation of particle trajectory the interference and influence between the sub grid tase model and other disturbance coefficients need further study credit

20393,an important part of establishing a prediction model for maritime search and rescue and oil spill drift is to quantify the uncertainty in particle motion simulation a regional sub grid velocity model based on drifting buoy data is proposed to simulate the unsolved velocity which is composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors tase in the ocean model contrary to most of the traditional drift trajectory prediction models the presented method divided the experimental area into 69 custom grids the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficients of each grid were obtained by using the fitting velocity difference of buoy velocity current velocity and wind velocity and autocorrelation analysis of time series two sub grid velocity models the random flight model and the random walk model were built respectively and were combined with the lagrangian particle tracking model to simulate the drifting buoy trajectory in the process of lagrange particle tracking fourth order runge kutta was used to interpolate the velocity and kernel density estimate method was used to calculate the predicted range of 95 confidence interval for evaluation and validation the experimental results of several different settings indicated that the prediction performance of the random flight model was better than that of the random walk model when the tase diffusion coefficient was determined by this method and the prediction performance of models with different diffusion coefficients is better than that of models with the same diffusion coefficient this work also proved the value of using the trajectory data of drifting buoys to build a sub grid velocity model for trajectory prediction keywords oil spill search and rescue sub grid scale velocity model diffusion drifter buoys 1 introduction with the rapid development of global marine economy maritime activities such as exploitation of marine resources and maritime transport become more and more frequent and at the same time a series of disastrous maritime accidents and marine environmental problems were brought about the impacts of maritime disasters and accidents mainly include two categories one is the direct threat to people s life safety according to the statistics of the china maritime search and rescue center china has verified 11 556 maritime distress accidents searched and rescued 10040 ships and 87141 persons in distress from 2014 to 2019 the other is the harm to the marine environment the most common accident of this kind is oil spill accidents such as the sanchi collision accident chen et al 2020 and deepwater horizon oil rig explosion in the gulf of mexico mariano et al 2011 compared with the former although the harm to the marine environment does not directly endanger human life the economic loss it brings is incalculable to deal with emergencies and minimize such consequences research and development of accurate and reliable models to predict the evolution of maritime disasters and accidents to provide decision making assistance for oil spill emergency events and maritime search and rescue sar has become a research topic of concern for many scientists the monte carlo perturbation combined with particle tracking method is the most commonly used and effective method for ensemble prediction of oil spill drift and it is also widely used in the operational model of maritime search and rescue zhang et al 2017 toz a c and b koseoglu 2018 although the movement of floating targets is mainly affected by surface wind current and waves the simulation of the movement process of floating targets is a rather complicated process because the movement of floating targets is disturbed by too many uncertain factors at every moment zhu et al 2019 the intervention of the monte carlo method is to simulate and quantify these uncertain factors and then simulate the prediction area of target drift to guide the emergency action effectively in this sense search and rescue and oil spill tracking have the same characteristics while the oil spill needs to simulate the chemical process of oil drift zhang et al 2017 in general the main sources of uncertainties in oil spill and sar operations are the result of the intrinsic complexity of ocean dynamics and can be summarized as sayol et al 2014 1 the initial conditions of particles released in the prediction model are uncertain the exact location and even the time of the accidents usually are unknown at the beginning of many maritime accidents 2 the navier stokes equations governing the physics of the ocean are non linear and therefore due to the chaotic nature of the ocean small variations of the initial conditions will provide large deviation of the forecast fields that will increase with time 3 the uncertainties from the drifting dynamics model the drifting motion of an object at sea depends on the ratio of its surface area exposed to water and water these influences are usually included in the wind drag coefficient which is empirically determined sometimes after a trial error process 4 the uncertainties from oceanic environment data operational models for oceanic and atmospheric forecasting do not resolve the small scale but they parametrize the turbulent motions in other words no information at the sub grid scale is provided in previous work many researchers proposed different prediction schemes and established a series of drift prediction models aiming at the uncertainties in 1 3 above the probabilistic models based on the leeway dynamics model a a allen 2005 a a allen and jeffery v plourde 1999 brushett et al 2017 is one of the most widely used approaches to describe the uncertainties on the drifting trajectory of an object yan li et al 2019 designed five numeric simulation scenarios and then input the different current and wind forcing data into the forecasting system and set the different oil released time in the five scenarios to reveal the major error sources besides a lot of studies ullman o donnell et al 2006 abascal et al 2009a minguez et al 2012 abascal et al 2017a applied frequency coastal radars current data to particle tracking model danchuk and willson 2010 studied the effects of shoreline sensitivity on oil spill trajectory modeling of the lower mississippi river for the uncertainty of environmental field data the usual modeling scheme is the random walk model or the random flight model in the studies of griffa 1996 drouin et al 2019 abascal et al 2012 2017b the random walk model with fixed diffusion coefficients is adopted in the study of david s ullman ullman o donnell et al 2006 monte carlo particle trajectory simulations using surface currents derived from standard range and long range radar systems were performed using random walk and random flight models of the unresolved velocities melsom et al 2012 compared the dispersion of passive tracers in a 100 member ensemble of the topaz ocean prediction system to the dispersion found adding random flight perturbations to the ensemble mean vector field and a deterministic vector field chiri et al 2020 simulated 125 patterns of 1 month met ocean evolutions in the north sea obtained by applying k means algorithms techniques found similar dispersion maps than the obtained with a monte carlo simulation based on 1000 met ocean scenarios however the above studies all treat the diffusion coefficient of the study area as a constant the spatial variation of the diffusion coefficient in different areas was not taken into account it can be predicted that when the movement trajectory of oil slick or search and rescue target is long enough to cross a large area it will bring some inevitable precision loss to the drifting prediction simulation of targets if the diffusion coefficient of the whole area is still considered as a constant therefore the research objective of this work is to divide the test area into regions and then modeling the velocity at the sub grid scale in different regions using drifting buoy data and verify their influence in this work an ensemble drift prediction model which can be used for offshore oil spill and search and rescue operation is established based on sub grid current data simulation the sea area studied is the north pacific ocean on the west coast of the united states firstly the lagrangian particle tracking model was introduced to predict the object s velocity under the forces of wind and current then the experimental area was divided into 69 custom grids two sub grid velocity models the random flight model and the random walk model were built respectively to calculate the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficient of each grid furthermore four groups of comparison tests were set up and the kernel density estimation method was used to calculate the predicted range of 95 confidence interval of the four groups of tests finally the performance of the random flight model and the random walk model as well as the influence of the diffusion coefficient of regional variation on the model were verified by the evaluation and comparison of the results of four groups of tests 2 data and methods 2 1 lagrangian particle tracking model particles on the sea surface are transported by the combined effect of surface ocean currents winds waves and turbulent dispersion abascal et al 2009 this transport is governed by the transport equation in the lagrangian form 1 d x d t u a x t u s x t where x x y is the positioning vector and u a and u s are advection and diffusion velocity vectors respectively both positioning and velocities are time t dependent processes the advection velocity u a can be expressed as a linear combination of surface currents ekman drift baroclinic motion tidal and inertial currents leeway velocity due to wind and stokes drift induced by waves abascal et al 2009 2 u a x t u c x t u l x t c h u h x t where u c is the surface current velocity vector u l x t is wind induced drift velocity leeway velocity u h is wave induced stokes drift velocity and c h corresponds to the wave coefficient for small targets the wave coefficient u h was not a significant parameter of the model rixen and ferreira coelho 2007 therefore the wave induced stokes drift could be discarded in the particle tracking model in addition the area of the drifting buoy exposed above sea surface is small thus we assume to neglect the crosswind component of the leeway l c and the advection term is deterministic the leeway velocity vector is defined as 3 u l x t l d x t c d u w x t where l d is the downwind component of leeway u w is the wind velocity at a height of 10 m over the sea surface c d is the drag coefficient which generally ranges from 1 to 2 for drift buoys mauri gerin et al 2009 2 2 sub grid scale velocity model in the lagrange particle tracking calculation the surface current velocity and wind velocity used to calculate particle advection velocity u a are usually derived from the oceanic and meteorological numerical models however due to the limited grid resolution of numerical oceanic and meteorological models it is insufficient to describe small scale turbulence vortices and the fine grained dynamic processes caused by elaborate topography and shoreline therefore in the simulated wind field and current field involved in maritime sar and oil spill drift prediction model some drift velocities cannot be resolved by grid scale these velocities are called sub grid velocities or diffusion velocities u s which mainly consist of turbulence and advection simulation errors since drifters are now routinely launched there is potentially substantial value in a methodology that allows the estimation of the statistics of u s from the comparison of drifters and oceanic field velocities ullman d s et al 2006 for drifting buoys which are mainly affected by current it can be considered that the diffusion velocity u s of the sub grid model is mainly composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors two models of sub grid scale velocities were examined both are members of the hierarchy of stochastic particle models reviewed by griffa 1996 and assume that the two horizontal components are independent the so called random walk and random flight models both assume that the particle position is markovian the latter also assumes that the particle velocity is a markovian variable both of the 2 models are often used to describe unstable movements in many past studies the 2 models have been used to simulate diffusion velocity the random flight model recognizes that the diffusion velocity fluctuations have a finite temporal correlation scale whereas the random walk model assumes that the correlation scale is infinitesimal when the same tase velocity variance is used in the two models one expects greater particle dispersion with the random flight version in this work the 2 models would be used to simulate tase velocity respectively the random walk formulation for the components of u s can be expressed as 4 u s d s d t k w 1 2 d w 5 k w σ 2 t where ds is the displacement due only to the tase velocity k w is the diffusion coefficient σ is the velocity standard deviation and dw is a normally distributed random increment with zero mean and second moment d w d w 2 d t where dt the time step for the integration of 1 note that the tase timescale t in the discrete problem is not actually infinitesimal but is constrained to equal dt 2 to obtain consistency between 4 and the definition of velocity variance the evolution of the tase velocity in the random flight model is described by 6 d u s 1 t u s d t k f 1 2 d w ˆ 7 k f σ 2 t k w t 2 the first term on the right of 7 introduces memory with a timescale t to the model of the tase and the second term is as in the random walk model a random impulse k f is the diffusion coefficient as is easily demonstrated the autocorrelation function of the u s in 7 decays exponentially with an e folding time or integral timescale equal to t griffa 1996 2 3 experimental data the ocean model used to provide current forcing to the particle tracking model is the us hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom https www ncdc noaa gov data access model data model datasets navoceano hycom glb this system provides 4 day forecasts at 3 h time steps navy global hycom has a resolution of 1 12 in the horizontal and uses hybrid isopycnal sigma z level coordinates in the vertical the output is interpolated onto a

atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80 km this analysis uses position and horizontal velocity data from both undrogued and 15 m drogued drifters of the global drifter program gdp this dataset is archived and distributed by the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration aoml noaa http www aoml noaa gov phod dac index php laurindo mariano et al the time range of the drifter data set used in this work was from may 2015 to dec 2019 in total two sets of drifting buoys have more than 240 000 positioning samples in the experimental area their drift trajectories are shown in fig 1 3 model calibration 3 1 best calibration coefficients according to the transport equation 1 the velocity of particle u consists of advection velocity u a and diffusion velocity u s according to the above analysis the diffusion is mainly composed of turbulence and advection simulation errors tase u s also represents tase velocity the advection velocity u a could be divided into 3 parts in equation 2 current velocity wind induced drift velocity and wave induced drift velocity however tase velocity u s is not a variable that could be calculated directly therefore equation 1 was rewritten as 8 d x d t u a x t u s x t u c x t c w u w x t c h u h x t σ e firstly we used an optimal parameter estimation method to solve these three parameters related to u a here σ e is the fitting residual in the above equation and is assumed as the tase velocity considering that the wave induced stokes drift velocity could be ignored only the wind induced drift coefficient needs to be calculated by the optimal fitting for the next step the objective function j was defined as following to calculate c w abascal et al 2009a b 9 j θ j m i n u b x u c x c w u w x 2 u b y u c y c w u w y 2 where θ c w eq 4 represents the difference between the predicted particle velocities and the drifter velocities u bx and u by are the drifter velocity d x d t components in the x w e and y n s direction respectively u cx and u cy are the surface current velocity components in the x and y direction respectively u wx and u wy are the wind velocity components in the x and y direction respectively m and n are the numbers of drifters and time intervals the automatic calibration aimed to find the optimal combination of the parameter c w that minimizes the objective function j in this analysis the optimal coefficients for undrogued drifters were found to be c ˆ w 0 019 in the interval 0 015 0 023 for drogued drifters c ˆ w 0 008 in the interval 0 006 0 01 3 2 estimate of tase velocity statistics in this work we refer to the method provided by ullman o donnell et al 2006 to calculated parameters σ k f t and k w the difference is that we divided the study area 120 w 144 w 20 ñ50 n into 69 custom grids see fig 2 there are two main criterions for dividing the grids in this paper firstly the nearshore grid should be denser because the simulation errors of near shore advection and influence of turbulence are relatively larger at the same grid scale secondly the custom grids should not be too small to ensure that the sample size in each grid is greater than 50 the diffusivity in each grid is assumed to be constant in time and spatially variable thus the four parameters above should be calculated in different grid separately practical implementation of the aforementioned tase models to determine the random velocity components in 4 5 requires specification of the velocity variance σ 2 and for the random flight case the tase timescale t if the trajectories of clusters of drifters released simultaneously at a variety of locations were available one could estimate the dispersion coefficient k and compute σ 2 and t if necessary from 8 the tase velocity is 10 u s x t d x d t u a x t d x d t u c x t c ˆ w u w x t to calculate the tase time scale t in different areas time series of u s for each drifter trajectories in different grids were used to compute the autocorrelation function for the u sx and u sy components take u sx for example the autocorrelation function acf can be described as 11 ρ h c o v u s x t u s x t h v a r u s x t v a r u s x t h n 1 t 1 n h u s x t u s x u s x t h u s x σ u s x 2 tase integral timescales for the two velocity components were estimated by fitting exponential autocorrelation functions to the observed autocovariance at lags of 6 h although computationally much simpler than the method of moments technique used by griffa 1996 this method is similar to theirs in that only autocovariance at short lags which are statistically most reliable are used to estimate the tase timescale these were subsequently averaged over all drifter trajectories in different grids to produce the curves shown in fig 3 take grid 3 grid 19 and grid 49 for example the best fit exponential autocovariance functions are shown as dashed curves in fig 3 and the parameter estimated for whole grids are given in table 1 however the acf value of samples in most regions rapidly approached 0 fluctuating between 0 2 0 2 after 24 h 3 3 estimates of different types of buoys it should be noted that although the movements of the two different types of buoys are affected slightly differently by the sea surface environment the undrogued drifters are more influenced by the wind drag but firstly we assumed that the difference in wind effects is not significant in addition it is difficult to divide appropriate custom grids according to the sample size no matter the undrogued buoys or drogued buoys were used alone for the study of the experimental area this is mainly because the sample size of the two types of buoys in the nearshore area is insufficient and the distribution is uneven the nearshore area is the most concerned area in the search and rescue and oil spill work drogued buoys have less than 20 samples in grids 42 44 45 46 47 and 50 while undrogued buoys have less than 20 samples in grids 55 56 57 62 69 under the above assumptions and premises both the undrogued and drogued buoys were used to perform parameter calculations in different grid areas buoys velocities were interpolated according to latitude longitude and time however to verify this hypothesis this paper also used two types of buoys to analyze the standard deviation and time scale of tase velocities in different sub grid areas respectively the corresponding results are shown in figs 4 5 in figs 4 and 5 the dotted and solid lines represent the standard deviation and time scale of the velocities components of tase respectively the fitting lines obtained in the figures were disconnected because parts of the grids did not have enough samples when a single type of buoys was used for the standard deviations of the tase velocities the standard deviations obtained by using undrogued buoys were generally slightly larger for both eastward and northward direction components so as the cases in 43 of 58 grids this may be due to the undrogued buoys being affected slightly more by wind and the wind field also contains certain errors however the standard deviations of the tase velocities components obtained by the two types of buoys were basically the same the difference of standard deviations of the tase velocity components σx and σy of the two types of buoys are less than 0 03 in each grid for the time scale of tase velocities components the two types of buoys did not show significant differences and the time scales obtained were basically the same therefore it could be considered that the hypothesis in this paper is basically valid based on the above analysis results 3 4 calculation of diffusion coefficients based on the above data and methods the diffusion coefficients and tase timescales of the random flight model and the random walk model were calculated in the 69 grids in the experimental area meanwhile the tase velocities in different grids were decomposed into u and v components for solving respectively the parameter calibration results of the complete 69 grids are shown in table 1 it should be noted that only k w value is given in the table for the random flight model k f k w t 2 to understand the variation of diffusion coefficient in different regions more intuitively the diffusion coefficient in the east west direction and north south direction was vector summed in this paper and the comprehensive diffusion coefficient was defined as k k x 2 k y 2 the distribution of the comprehensive diffusion coefficient in different grids was shown in fig 6 and fig 7 according to figs 6 7 it could be found that the standard deviation and the tase diffusion coefficient obtained by the calibration of both the random flight model and the random walk model showed a larger trend in the nearshore area at the same time in some grids of the nearshore area 41 48 the diffusion coefficient in the north south direction was significantly higher than that in the east west direction this could be because these areas are mainly affected by coastal currents however the tase timescale t which mainly ranges from 5 to 12 h did not show specific regional characteristics 4 simulation and validation after the diffusion coefficient and other parameters of each grid in the test area were obtained the trajectory simulation of a series of drifting buoy samples was carried out by using random walk model and random flight model respectively based on the monte carlo method 4 1 monte carlo stochastic model based on formula 2 the lagrangian stochastic model is used to simulate the trajectories of drifting buoys lagrangian stochastic model has been widely used in oceanography and meteorology to represent the unresolved velocity variability in ocean currents and winds gao et al 2018 afenyo et al 2016 yin et al 2018 due to the relatively rough resolution of the marine meteorological environmental fields used the calculation time step and output time step of particle tracking in this work are 1 h and 3 h respectively the interpolation of wind field and current field is divided into the following two parts 1 to interpolate the wind field and current field velocities to the positions of the current particle coordinates using a three dimensional interpolation of latitude longitude and time 2 the fourth order runge kutta horizontal interpolation breivik and allen 2008 scott et al 2012 of the wind field and the current field was used to drive the particle in the calculation of the particle continuous trajectory for each sample 1000 particles were generated by the monte carlo stochastic perturbation method based on random flight and random walk models respectively for particle tracking in this work only the coefficients in the random flight model and the random walk model were disturbed the corresponding tase diffusion coefficients in the monte carlo disturbance were also different when the particles drift into different girds the perturbation of some other relative coefficients was ignored such as the wind induced drift coefficient and the coefficients in the oil spill model which simulate some chemical processes the final positions of the 1000 simulated trajectories varied depending on the random coefficients generated in the particle tracking model and they provide a set of numerical locations that define the search area for the buoy s location 4 2 search area probability density calculation whether in maritime search and rescue or oil spill emergency support systems the most instructive significance for researchers and decision makers is usually the target search range and probability distribution of the output of the prediction model adopted however the reference value and importance of the trajectory prediction of a single particle are weaker than the former because of its randomness and fortuitousness therefore it is crucial for search and rescue and oil spill prediction models whether their output search range can cover the position of real drifting targets at different times and it is also an important index to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the models the range predicted by the model is determined by the horizontal position distribution of the simulated particles at different times in this work a closed curve containing 95 particle positions is calculated using the kernel density estimate method abascal et al 2009 martinez w l martinez a r 2002 and the region contained in this curve is the predicted search range with a confidence interval of 95 for a sample of size n where each observation is a d dimensional vector xi i 1 n the kernel density estimate is defined as martinez w l martinez a r 2002 12 f ˆ k e r x 1 n h 1 h d i 1 n j 1 d κ x j x i j h j where xij is the jth component of the ith observation κ is the kernel function and h is the smoothing parameter or window width the parameter h is defined as 13 h j k e r 4 n d 2 1 d 4 σ j j 1 d where σ j is the standard deviation of the jth component the kernel equation for density estimation was considered as a gaussian function 14 κ x 1 2 π exp x 2 2 4 3 comparison and analysis the samples used for verification were the buoy trajectory data from january 1st 2017 to january 31st 2017 and this long trajectory data was not used for parameter calibration of the two sub grid velocity models mentioned above as shown in fig 8 the buoy crossed five grids along the coastline from south to north 41 42 43 44 25 the total distance of the buoy trajectory was about 650 km and the average velocity was about 0 24 m s firstly the drift trajectory data for a total of 31 days was divided into several time intervals the length of a single sample was set at 120 h and the time sliding window was set to 48 h which means each segment overlapping the previous one by 48 h in addition the hycom model lost about three days of data from january 5 to january 7 therefore a total of 10 cases were obtained in this work fig 8 shows the full trajectory of the buoy for 31 days and two of its intercepted cases in order to verify the performance of the predicted results of the models four groups of simulation schemes were set up for each sample in this work for comparison as follows 1 the random flight model using diffusion coefficients from different grids 2 the random walk model using diffusion coefficients from different grids 3 the random flight model using diffusion coefficients from the same grids the mean of the diffusion coefficients of all the grids 4 the random walk model using diffusion coefficients from the same grids the mean of the diffusion coefficients of all the grids two validation indicators for the models were set as follows 1 the average prediction error the average distance between the real position of the buoy and the 1000 simulated particle the average prediction error was calculated for every 3 h of each sample 2 the probability of success pos that the current drifting buoy position is within the area the model predicted taking the buoy data from january 8th 2017 to january 31st 2017 as an example figs 9 10 show the simulation results of two of the ten cases segmented from this long trajectory dotted lines in each figure represent the predicted area of four sets of simulation schemes with simulation time of 24 h and 120 h in the vast majority of cases the predicted areas of the four simulation schemes cover the real buoy position when the simulation time is 24 h however when the simulation period comes to 120 h the simulation results are much worse in case 1 only the simulation results of group 1 and group 2 cover the real drifting buoy position in case 3 only the simulation result of group 1 covers the real drifting buoy position the complete statistical results of all 10 cases are shown in fig 11 and table 2 in addition it is easy to find that the speed of regional diffusion predicted by the random flight model is much higher than that of the random walk model the predicted area in group 1 and group 3 are slightly larger than those in group 2 and group 4 which means that the diffusion coefficient used is larger the diffusion velocity of the predicted area will also be larger in both the random flight and random walk model the average prediction errors of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in fig 11 the mean prediction error increases almost linearly with time however there is no significant difference in the average prediction errors of the groups of simulation the difference of the average prediction error of the four groups of simulations in each period is within 6 km the statistical results of the pos of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in table 2 the pos of each group of simulations within 48 h is higher than 60 and then they decline significantly over time the pos of group 1 4 is 60 20 40 20 respectively when the simulation period is 120 h in general the pos of the four groups of simulations are ranked descending order as follows group 1 group 3 group 2 and group 4 it can be found that the ability of the random flight model to successfully cover the real target position is significantly stronger than that of the random walk model in addition as can be seen from the comparison between group 1 and group 3 as well as the comparison between group 2 and group 4 the predicted areas simulated by the sub grid velocity model with different diffusion coefficient schemes have better pos values the proper diffusion coefficient can improve the performance of both two models the average predicted areas of 10 cases using 4 groups of simulation schemes are shown in table 3 it is well known that the larger the prediction area is the more likely it is to cover the real target location however it will also bring many difficulties to rescue or oil spill emergency work if the predicted area is too wide which would reduce the probability of successful rescue frost j and stone lawrence 2001 therefore the experimental results seem to be less convincing when the random flight model achieved a higher pos with a larger predicted area however it also needs to be noted that on the one hand the stochastic flight model considered the temporal correlation of simulated particle velocity under a reasonable physical mechanism which leads to faster diffusion velocity on the other hand the results of random flight model simulation do not form too unreasonable large prediction range and it has a better balance between prediction range and pos in addition from the comparison between group 1 and group 3 as well as the comparison between group 2 and group 4 it could be found that the mean predicted areas simulated by the sub grid velocity model with different diffusion coefficient schemes are smaller than those with the same diffusion coefficient schemes for most of the time except for the 72 nd h combined with the statistical results of pos it can be found that the establishment of the regional sub grid velocity model can improve the simulation and prediction performance of the random walk model and the random flight model 5 conclusion in this work a maritime search and rescue and oil spill drift prediction model based on the regional sub grid velocity model was established contrary to most of traditional drift trajectory prediction models the presented method divided the experimental area into 69 custom grids more than 240 000 positioning data from drifting buoys were used to rate the tase diffusion coefficients and tase time scale for two sub grid velocity models in each grid on this basis the target drift prediction area is calculated by using lagrange stochastic model and kernel density estimate the standard deviation of tase velocity tase time scale and tase diffusion coefficient of each grid were obtained by using the fitting velocity difference of buoy velocity current velocity and wind velocity and autocorrelation analysis of time series the results indicated that the tase diffusion coefficients of the two sub grid velocity models random flight model and random walk model were significantly larger in the nearshore area k w 700 m2 s k f 10 6 m2 s3 the diffusion coefficients for random walk model of all grids were between 382 m2 s and 1080 m2 s while the diffusion coefficients for random flight model were between 5 3 10 7 m2 s3 and 1 9 10 6 m2 s3 which basically coincides with the assumption that the nearshore tase has a large influence the evaluation and comparison of 95 confidence area calculated by kernel density estimate in the four groups of experiments indicated that the simulation results of the random flight model were significantly better than that of the random walk model on the premise of using the same method to obtain the tase velocity standard deviation and time scale the pos of the two random flight model simulation schemes were 60 and 40 at 120 h while the pos of the two random walk model simulation schemes were only 20 in addition the simulation results of different diffusion coefficient schemes can obtain higher pos values under the premise of smaller average predicted area this further proves the value of the regional sub grid tase velocity model based on the drifting buoy trajectory data the numerical simulation and trajectory verification in this paper were carried out using drifting buoy data while the disturbance of wind induced drift coefficient current induced drift coefficient and chemical process such as weathering of oil spill were not taken into account in monte carlo calculation of particle trajectory the interference and influence between the sub grid tase model and other disturbance coefficients need further study credit

20394,splitter plates have been recognized as useful passive devices to reduce drag mitigate flow induced vibration and enhance heat transfer efficiency of a circular cylinder however undesired torsional flow induced vibrations due to splitter plate attachment require further investigation this paper numerically studies the flow induced torsional vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate in laminar flow with a reynolds number of 100 a finite volume formulation is utilized to solve the incompressible two dimensional fluid governing equations torsional vortex induced vibrations vivs are observed at lower reduced flow velocities while a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurs as the reduced flow velocity increases after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around a nonzero equilibrium angle the numerical results show that the synchronization range of viv extends the peak viv amplitude increases and the critical reduced flow velocity for the bifurcation decreases with decreasing the moment of inertia the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the structural restoring moment and the flow induced moment the critical reduced velocity of the bifurcation and the nonzero equilibrium angle at any reduced velocity can be calculated based on the mean moment coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly the flow induced moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the splitter plate s upper and lower surfaces the phase difference between the torsional moment and displacement is 0 at lower reduced velocities while the phase difference jumps to 180 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 the mean drag coefficient of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than the mean drag coefficient of a stationary circular cylinder but often higher than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly the dominant frequency of the drag force is twice the vibration frequency before the symmetry breaking bifurcation while the dominant frequency becomes consistent with the vibration frequency after the bifurcation the typical 2s mode of vortex shedding is identified for all considered moments of inertia and reduced flow velocities however the timing of a non shedding vortex changes at the critical flow velocities for the phase jump and symmetry breaking bifurcation the observed torsional vibrations suggest that circular cylinders with splitter plate attachments may be competitive candidates for viv based energy harvesting while they may not be good choices for heat

introduction the flow past a circular cylinder is one of the most classical problems in fluid mechanics the resulting flow induced forces and vibrations are of practical concern for many engineering structures païdoussis et al 2010 williamson and govardhan 2004 e g chimneys ruscheweyh and galemann 1996 vickery and basu 1983 marine risers liu et al 2020 trim et al 2005 bridge cables jafari et al 2020 xu et al 2021 and heat exchanger tubes païdoussis et al 2010 zhang and øiseth 2021 flow induced forces and vibrations are often undesirable since they may seriously impact structural fatigue life and safety zhang et al 2020a song et al 2020 2021 however vibrations may be beneficial since they can serve as a clean and sustainable energy source wang et al 2020a 2020b yu and zhang 2021 various passive and active techniques have been developed to modify vortex shedding around a circular cylinder reduce flow induced forces and mitigate or enlarge flow induced vibrations demartino and ricciardelli 2017 zdravkovich 1981 a thin rigid plate later referred to as a splitter plate placed in the wake of a circular cylinder has been widely studied as a passive control device investigations on flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate can be traced back to roshko 1954 who showed that an attached splitter plate could increase the base pressure reduce the drag narrow the wake width and affect the strouhal number st f s d u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency of the static structure d is the diameter of the circular cylinder and u is the flow velocity following roshko s pioneering study the effects of a splitter plate attached to or detached from the circular cylinder on the flow around a stationary cylinder were investigated by several authors anderson and szewczyk 1997 apelt et al 1973 dehkordi and jafari 2010 gerrard 1966 hwang and yang 2007 hwang et al 2003 kwon and choi 1996 ozono 1999 it was determined that a detached splitter plate can also increase the base pressure and reduce the drag of a circular cylinder while the detached splitter plate becomes ineffective once the gap between the cylinder and the plate exceeds a critical value dehkordi and jafari 2010 hwang and yang 2007 hwang et al 2003 ozono 1999 for a specific reynolds number there is a critical plate length beyond which vortex shedding can be completely suppressed and an optimal length at which a minimum drag can be achieved since the splitter plate reduces the vortex shedding strength it is also expected to suppress the vortex induced vibration viv of a circular cylinder experiments by kawai 1990 showed that the viv of a circular cylinder could not be entirely mitigated by a splitter plate with a length of l 1d 4d while a splitter plate with a length of l 8d was found to mitigate the viv completely in addition all tested cylinder plate assemblies were found to exhibit galloping type vibrations at higher reduced flow velocities nakamura et al 1994 presented a wind tunnel experiment studying the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a detached splitter plate they showed that the circular cylinder can gallop due to a splitter plate with a length of l 31 3d nakamura et al 1994 also showed that quasi steady aerodynamic theory cannot predict the onset galloping velocity assia et al 2009 proposed suppressing the viv using a splitter plate that is rotatable around the circular cylinder s centre they showed that a rotatable plate with a suitable torsional resistance could mitigate the viv without initiating any galloping type vibration sun et al 2020 performed a numerical study on the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate with a length of l 0d 1 5d three vibration modes were successively observed with increasing plate length i e viv coupled viv and galloping and separated viv and galloping the effects of an attached or detached splitter plate on the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder have also been studied by stappenbelt 2010 huera huarte 2014 assi and bearman 2015 liang et al 2018 sahu et al 2019a 2019b and zhu et al 2020 in addition splitter plates are also used in heat exchanger tube arrays to enhance the heat transfer efficiency weaver et al 2001 izadpanah et al 2019 although many studies have been conducted to investigate the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a splitter plate attachment almost all existing studies considered a single degree of freedom vibration in the transverse direction or a two degree of freedom vibration in the transverse and in flow directions the flow induced vibration of a cylinder plate assembly in a torsional degree of freedom has received less attention cimbala and co authors cimbala and chen 1994 cimbala and garg 1991 performed a series of experiments on freely rotatable cylinder plate assemblies i e rotatable without any mechanical stiffness around the centre of the cylinder a cylinder plate assembly with a long splitter plate e g l 4d was found to vibrate slightly around its original mean position with the plate parallel to the freestream direction however for a cylinder plate assembly with a short splitter plate e g l 3d the equilibrium position rotated to a nonzero angle at either side of its central line with an equal probability the off axis equilibrium angle and the vibration amplitude were dependent on the reynolds number re ρud μ where ρ is the fluid mass density and μ is the dynamic viscosity the migration of the equilibrium position was also investigated numerically by xu et al 1993 1990 who showed that the phenomenon is a symmetry breaking bifurcation due to the flow in the separation bubble behind the cylindrical part of the assembly recently lu et al 2016 studied the torsional flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly they confirmed that symmetry breaking bifurcation also occurs for an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly furthermore the torsional vibration amplitude of the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly can be much larger than that of a freely rotatable assembly however the underlying mechanisms of the flow induced vibration and the symmetry breaking bifurcation as well as the effects of the structural dynamical property e g the moment of inertia of the assembly require further investigation thus this paper presents a numerical investigation on the flow induced torsional vibration of a cylinder plate assembly with various moments of inertia the assembly is elastically mounted about the torsional degree of freedom while the transverse and in flow degrees of freedom are not considered the flow induced vibrations within a reduced flow velocity range of u r u f 0 d 2 to 50 are investigated where f 0 is the natural frequency of the cylinder plate assembly the flow induced forces and the wake patterns during the vibrations are also discussed the remainder of this paper is organized as follows governing equations of the fluid structure interaction system and a description and validation of the numerical code are provided in section 2 simulation results of the flow induced vibrations of the considered cylinder plate assembly are presented and discussed in section 3 the main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 governing equations numerical methodology and code validation this section introduces the model configuration and the governing equations of the fluid structure interaction problem the numerical methodology used to solve the governing equations is described the numerical code is then validated by comparing the simulated results with previously published numerical results 2 1 model configuration and governing equations the considered model configuration is a circular cylinder with a rigid splitter plate attached to its back stagnation point as shown in fig 1 the cylinder plate assembly is subjected to a cross flow and allowed to vibrate about a torsional degree of freedom the transverse and streamwise degrees of freedom are not considered in these simulations the length l of the splitter plate is the same as the diameter d of the circular cylinder and the height of the splitter plate is h 0 02d the oncoming flow is uniform with a constant velocity of u the continuity and the navier stokes equations can describe the flow by assuming that the viscous newtonian flow is homogeneous and incompressible the nondimensional governing equations of the flow domain can be written in an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation as 1 u x v y 0 2 u τ u u x v u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 v τ u v x v v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where x and y are the coordinates in the in flow and cross flow directions respectively normalized by d u and v represent the velocity components normalized by u in the x and y directions respectively τ is the dimensionless time normalized by d u p is the pressure normalized by ρu 2 and ρ is the density of the fluid the equation of motion of the cylinder plate assembly can be expressed as 4 i θ c θ k θ f m where i is the moment of inertia per unit length c is the structural damping coefficient k is the spring stiffness θ is the torsional displacement the overdot represents the derivative with respect to time t and f m is the fluid induced torsional moment acting on the cylinder plate assembly per unit length the structural natural frequency in hz is defined as f 0 k i 2 π and the dimensionless structural damping ratio over critical damping is ξ 0 c 2 k i equation 4 can be expressed in a dimensionless form as 5 θ 4 π ξ 0 u r θ 2 π u r 2 θ 50 25 π 2 f m m where the prime represents the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time τ ut d u r u f 0 d is the reduced flow velocity f m is the dimensionless fluid induced torsional moment and m is the mass ratio between the cylinder plate assembly and the displaced fluid 6 f m f m ρ i u 2 2 m s 7 m m s π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 where m s is the mass of the cylinder plate assembly per unit length the flow induced forces on the cylinder plate assembly can be calculated by integrating the normal pressure and the shear stress throughout its surface these forces are then normalized to obtain the dimensionless force coefficients 8 c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 d 9 c l f l 0 5 ρ u 2 d 10 c m f m 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 where f d is the drag force f l is the lift force and c d c l and c m are the dimensionless drag coefficient lift coefficient and moment coefficient respectively the drag force lift force and torsional moment are positive in the downstream upward and counterclockwise directions respectively 2 2 numerical methodology the finite volume method is used to discretize the fluid governing equations the first order implicit time integration scheme is used for temporal discretization the second order upwind scheme and the least square cell based scheme are used for spatial discretization of the convection term and diffusion term respectively the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm is used to solve the pressure velocity coupled algebraic equations and the flow field is solved by the commercial program ansys fluent the equation of motion of the cylinder plate assembly is solved using a standard 4th order runge kutta method the flow and structure solvers are then merged following the loosely coupled partitioned approach the solver has demonstrated an excellent accuracy and stability in simulating the flow induced vibrations of bluff cylinders such as bridge decks and rectangular cylinders ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a b 2 3 code validation the viv of a circular cylinder and the coupled transverse streamwise flow induced vibration of the cylinder plate assembly are simulated first to examine the accuracy and stability of the numerical solver the computational domain and the boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 1 the computational domain is set as 50d 100d and the blockage ratio is 2 the two dimensional flow field is divided into three subregions i e a rigid region a deforming region and a static region the rigid region moves together with the model to guarantee a near wall mesh quality which directly affects the simulation accuracy the deforming region is then used for the dynamic mesh to accommodate the displacement of the inner rigid region the mesh in the static region remains static during the entire simulation hybrid grids structured dense quadrangular grids for the rigid region and unstructured triangular grids for the deforming region are then used to maximize the accuracy and efficiency for the cylinder plate assembly three meshes of different grid densities i e mesh 1 coarse mesh 2 medium and mesh 3 fine are first generated to obtain grid independent results fig 2 shows the global view and a partial enlargement of mesh 2 for mesh 2 276 grid cells are allocated on the cylinder surface while 94 cells are distributed on each side of the splitter plate the height of the first layer grids close to the model surface is approximately 0 0033d mesh 1 and mesh 3 are generated by increasing and decreasing the growth factor of the grid size along the radial direction of the circular cylinder and along the orthogonal direction of the splitter plate surface respectively the torsional flow induced vibration for a cylinder plate assembly with m m s π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 10 and ξ 0 0 is simulated at u r 5 0 and re 100 the circular cylinder is considered to be a pipe with a thickness of h 0 02d and the density of the cylinder plate assembly is uniform table 1 presents the vibration amplitudes and frequencies simulated using different mesh resolutions the value in the bracket is the relative difference between the results in the present row and the previous row the results almost converge at mesh 2 since the difference between the results based on mesh 2 and mesh 3 are less than 0 3 in table 2 the vibration amplitude and frequency of the considered case are calculated by mesh 2 with different dimensionless time steps δτ the changes in the results due to the reduction of δτ from 0 01 to 0 005 are less than 0 7 hence mesh 2 and δτ 0 01 are adopted in the following simulations it is noted that in this paper the mesh is more refined and the computational domain is larger than those used in some previous studies lu et al 2016 sun et al 2020 fig 3 a presents the simulated viv amplitudes h max of a circular cylinder together with some previously published numerical simulations bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 as well as the experimental results of anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 all numerical simulations were conducted at re 100 m m s π ρ d 2 4 10 and ξ 0 0 while the experiment was conducted at re 90 159 m 149 and ξ 0 0 12 0 15 the present numerical results agree well with the previous numerical results however the experimental lock in range is considerably smaller than that of the numerical simulations a smaller lock in range may be mainly due to the larger mass damping parameter of the experiment the different flow conditions and boundary conditions of the experiment and numerical simulations may also contribute to the different lock in ranges fig 3 b compares the simulated vertical vibration amplitudes h max of the cylinder plate assembly with the numerical results of sun et al 2020 both the present simulations and the simulations of sun et al 2020 were conducted at re 100 m m s π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 10 and ξ 0 0 again the present results agree with previously published results to further validate the numerical code the strouhal number st the mean drag coefficient c d mean and the time averaged separation bubble length l w are simulated for the cylinder plate assembly at re 100 as presented in table 3 the results of the present simulation agree well with previous simulations 3 numerical results and discussion the torsional flow induced vibration of a cylinder plate assembly l d is simulated using the numerical procedure described in section 2 the reynolds number is re 100 throughout the simulations hence the flow is two dimensional and laminar the circular cylinder is a pipe with a thickness of h 0 02d and the thickness of the splitter plate is also h 0 02d the cylinder plate assembly has a uniform mass density of ρ s m π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 π d h d h hence the moment of inertia of the cylinder plate assembly can be calculated as 11 i ρ s π d h d 2 2 ρ s d h 13 d 2 12 four mass ratios i e m 5 10 20 and 40 are considered to investigate the effect of the mass ratio or equivalently the moment of inertia on the flow induced vibrations the moment of inertia for each mass ratio can be calculated from eq 11 the mechanical damping ratio is always considered to be ξ 0 0 for each reduced flow velocity the cylinder plate assembly starts to vibrate from a static condition due to the oncoming flow and the simulation is performed sufficiently long to obtain the steady state response 3 1 displacement signal vibration amplitude and frequency typical time histories of the torsional displacement signal of the cylinder plate assembly with m 5 are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a a well organized and quasi harmonic torsional vibration is developed at a very low reduced velocity of u r 3 0 the vibration amplitude increases with time and a constant amplitude vibration with an amplitude of θ max 0 26 is achieved after τ 150 at u r 4 5 as given in fig 4 b the vibration exhibits a noticeable fluctuation due to the multiple frequency components involved in the vibration fig 4 c shows that as the reduced frequency increases to u r 4 625 the vibration amplitude modulates significantly which is a clear beating phenomenon of the vibration involving two closely spaced frequencies the vibration amplitude exhibits a dramatic increase around u r 4 75 fig 4 d at which point the steady vibration amplitude is θ max 12 20 the large vibration makes the configuration a competitive candidate for viv based energy harvesting however the vibration also suggests that tubes with straight fins may not be good choices for heat exchangers the intensive vibration remains until u r 5 25 fig 4 e after which the vibration amplitude begins to decrease gradually with a further increasing reduced velocity at u r 14 0 the steady vibration amplitude in fig 4 h drops to θ max 2 54 as observed in fig 4 i a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurs at u r 15 00 after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around θ mean 9 50 instead of θ mean 0 symmetry breaking bifurcation also occurs for higher reduced velocities e g u r 20 0 in fig 4 j while the absolute value of the mean displacement θ mean increases with increasing reduced velocity it is noted that the equilibrium position after the bifurcation can rotate to either side of the original central line fig 4 j shows the displacement signals at u r 20 0 starting from two different initializations of the flow field the equilibrium angle can be either positive or negative depending on the initialization the variation in the vibration characteristics with increasing reduced velocity is in agreement with the numerical simulations of lu et al 2016 it is noted that the simulations of lu et al 2016 were conducted for a cylinder plate assembly with m 10 while their moment of inertia is much lower than the values in this paper because they considered a solid circular cylinder with a uniform mass density fig 5 presents the steady state torsional displacement amplitudes θ max and the absolute mean displacements θ mean of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios as shown in fig 5 a torsional vivs were observed for the cylinder plate assembly for all considered mass ratios the peak amplitude of viv increases slightly and the synchronization range extends with decreasing the mass ratio the peak amplitude of viv is 10 0 12 2 depending on the mass ratio the results are lower than the value of 13 2 reported by lu et al 2016 which should mainly be due to the lower moment of inertia considered in their simulations the sharp jump in the vibration amplitude and the symmetry breaking bifurcation both occur at lower reduced flow velocities u r 4 2 and u r 11 0 respectively in the study of lu et al 2016 due to the lower moment of inertia for a structure with a large mass ratio it is believed that the peak amplitude of viv remains unchanged for a constant mass damping parameter khalak and williamson 1999 zhang et al 2019a b 2020b 2021 2020b in the present simulation the mass damping parameter is always zero however this is not true for a structure with a low mass ratio for example yu et al 2018 reported the numerically simulated peak viv amplitudes of a circular cylinder at a zero damping ratio and several low mass ratios m 0 1 4 and 5 they found that the peak amplitude decreases with increasing mass ratio despite the constant mass damping parameter in the present simulations considerable efforts were designated to capture the peak viv amplitudes at various mass ratios as seen from fig 5 a the peak viv amplitude also decreases slightly with increasing the mass ratio as shown in fig 5 b a symmetry breaking bifurcation comes into existence as u r increases over a critical value the critical u r increases with increasing the mass ratio xu et al 1990 showed that the symmetry breaking bifurcation for a freely rotatable cylinder plate assembly is related to its c m mean θ 0 curve where θ 0 is the initial angle of attack of the assembly relative to the oncoming flow the freely rotatable assembly comes to rest on a nonzero θ mean at which c m mean 0 hence the equilibrium angle of a freely rotatable cylinder plate assembly can be determined by xu et al 1990 12 c m mean 0 13 d c m mean d θ mean 0 for the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly in the present simulation the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment the mean structural restoring moment f r mean and the mean flow induced moment f m mean can be respectively expressed as 14 f r mean i 2 π f 0 2 θ mean 15 f m m e a n 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 c m mean the equilibrium angle for an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly is achieved when the mean flow induced moment is balanced by the mean structural restoring moment hence the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly vibrates around an equilibrium angle satisfying eqs 13 and 16 16 θ mean 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 c m mean i 2 π f 0 2 the c m mean values of the cylinder plate assembly are simulated using the continuous torsional motion technique developed by ying et al 2018 as presented in fig 6 the cylinder plate assembly is forced to vibrate in the torsional degree of freedom with a low frequency of 0 00005 hz and an amplitude of 20 the numerical methodology utilized to solve the governing equations is the same as that described in section 2 the self excited force is negligible if the vibration frequency is extremely low hence the total flow induced force acting on the cylinder plate assembly is approximately equal to the aerostatic force the c m mean values at various angles of attack can be calculated based on the forced vibration displacement and the resulting flow induced force according to eq 10 this shows that the c m mean increases with increasing θ 0 and achieves a peak value around θ 0 13 after which the c m mean begins to decrease the variation in c m mean versus θ 0 is similar to that at a lower reynolds number reported by xu et al 1993 1990 the mean displacements θ mean of the cylinder plate assembly are calculated based on the c m mean θ 0 curve using eqs 13 and 16 as shown in fig 5 b the results calculated based on the c m mean θ 0 curve agree well with the numerically simulated results the error may be mainly ascribed to the unsteady effects induced by the torsional vibration and the identification error of the c m mean θ 0 curve the comparison in fig 5 b proves that the symmetry breaking bifurcation for the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly is indeed due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment fig 7 shows the vibration frequencies f of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios in which f 0 is the natural frequency of the assembly in a vacuum the normalized vortex shedding frequency f s f 0 of the stationary assembly is also shown for comparison where f s s t u d at low reduced velocities the slope of the vibration frequency is close to the vortex shedding frequency as the reduced velocity increases the vibration frequency exhibits a jump around u r 5 and the slope approaches that of the natural frequency f 0 with further increasing the reduced velocity the slope of the vibration frequency increases and becomes close to the vortex shedding frequency again no significant change occurs in the slope of the vibration frequency at higher reduced velocities the overall profile of the f u r curve is similar to that observed for the transverse viv of a circular cylinder with a very low mass ratio willden and graham 2006 yu et al 2018 the jump of the vibration frequency is found to occur at the same reduced velocity as the jump of the vibration amplitude as presented in fig 5 a the vibration frequency intersects with the natural frequency f 0 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 regardless of the mass ratio the vibration after the symmetry breaking bifurcation is a forced vibration induced by periodic vortex shedding while the vibration frequency is slightly higher than the vortex shedding frequency for the cylinder plate assembly at a 0 initial angle of attack this higher vibration frequency is due to an increased strouhal number at a nonzero equilibrium angle for the same cylinder plate assembly an increase in the strouhal number with increasing the initial angle of attack was also reported by akansu et al 2004 for reynolds numbers between 8 000 and 60 000 3 2 flow induced forces fig 8 shows the torsional displacement signals and the flow induced force coefficients c d c l and c m of the m 5 cylinder plate assembly at u r 0 5 25 8 50 and 20 0 in which the solid blue line represents the displacement or force coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly while the dashed green lines and the dashed red line represent the force coefficients of the circular cylinder and the splitter plater respectively it is noted that the drag coefficient of the splitter plate is close to zero and the result presented in fig 8 is the actual drag coefficient added by 1 2 as seen from fig 8 a the flow induced drag force lift force and torsional moment for a stationary cylinder plate assembly are periodic functions and the dominant frequency of the drag force is twice that of the lift force and the torsional moment these features are similar to the flow induced forces for a stationary circular cylinder for a vibrating cylinder plate assembly the dominant frequency of the lift force and torsional moment are the same as the vibration frequency however the drag force s dominant frequency is twice the vibration frequency at u r 5 25 and 8 50 the frequency of the drag force is doubled because the vortices shedding from alternate sides of the cylinder plate assembly have different effects on the lift force and the torsional moment while they have the same effects on the drag force this will be further discussed and explained based on the flow pattern in subsection 3 4 after symmetry breaking bifurcation the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around a nonzero equilibrium angle and the assembly becomes asymmetrical about the oncoming flow direction the effects of vortices shedding from alternate sides on the drag force are therefore different hence the frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency as demonstrated by the case of u r 20 0 presented in fig 8 d fig 8 shows that the contribution from the splitter plate dominates the torsional moment on the cylinder plater assembly indeed numerical simulations prove that the shear stress magnitude is much smaller than that of the pressure since the pressure on the circular cylinder cannot produce any torsional moment it is the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the splitter plate that produces the torsional moment the torsional moment is in phase with the torsional displacement at u r 5 25 however there is a 180 phase difference between the torsional moment and the torsional displacement at u r 8 50 and 20 0 fig 9 shows the mean values of the flow induced force coefficients c d mean c l mean and c m mean and the standard deviations of the torsional moment coefficients c m std for the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios the mean drag coefficients for a stationary circular cylinder and a stationary cylinder plate assembly are also shown in fig 9 a for a comparison fig 9 a shows that the mean drag coefficient c d mean of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly at a low reduced flow velocity is smaller than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly c d mean exhibits a sharp jump and then decreases continuously with increasing the reduced velocity the maximum value of c d mean seems almost independent of the mass ratio c d mean decreases to a lower value with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation after which c d mean increases smoothly with increasing reduced flow velocity the c d mean u r curve for the assembly of m 5 suggests that the mean drag coefficient finally approaches a constant value for all the considered mass ratios and reduced flow velocities the c d mean of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than that of a stationary circular cylinder figs 9 b and 9 c show that the mean lift coefficient c l mean and the mean moment coefficient c m mean vary in a similar trend c l mean and c m mean are close to zero at lower reduced velocities and jump sharply with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation c l mean and c m mean continue to increase for a while after the jump and then begin to decrease until the largest simulated reduced velocity the maximum values of c l mean and c m mean are almost independent of the mass ratio while the maximum values are achieved at different reduced flow velocities for cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios as seen in fig 9 d the standard deviations of the moment coefficient c m std are very small at lower reduced velocities c m std then exhibits a sharp increase and a sharp drop after these sharp jumps c m std varies smoothly with increasing reduced velocity similar to the peak viv amplitude the peak value of c m std decreases with increasing the mass ratio a remarkable reduction in c m std is observed together with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation no significant change is observed in c m std with further increasing reduced velocity 3 3 phase difference between displacement and torsional moment fig 10 shows the phase difference φ between the torsional moment and the displacement of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios for all mass ratios φ is approximately 0 for lower reduced flow velocities with increasing reduced velocity a 180 jump in the phase difference is observed which is similar to the phase jump observed in the transverse viv of a circular cylinder the phase jump occurs at the same reduced velocity i e u r 6 5 at which the vibration frequency intersects the natural frequency as shown in fig 7 before the phase jump the oncoming flow produces a negative stiffness effect and hence the vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency the fluid elastic stiffness becomes positive after the phase jump which results in a vibration frequency that is higher than the natural frequency the reduced velocity for the phase jump is insignificantly dependent on the mass ratio the phase jump will be further discussed and explained based on the flow pattern in subsection 3 4 3 4 flow pattern figs 11 and 12 show the streamlines and the pressure fields of the cylinder plate assembly with m 5 at three typical reduced flow velocities the two cases before the symmetry breaking bifurcation i e u r 5 25 and 8 50 are representative before and after the phase jump shown in fig 10 respectively the case of u r 20 0 is representative after symmetry breaking bifurcation for each case the streamlines and pressure fields are given at seven time instants within one vibration cycle t the uppermost images i e t 0 in figs 11 and 12 correspond to a time instant when the cylinder plate assembly is at the position with the largest angle the assembly then rotates clockwise to the equilibrium position at t 2t 8 and the lowest angle at t 4t 8 then the assembly rotates counterclockwise to the equilibrium position at t 6t 8 and the largest angle at t t as seen in fig 11 a at t 0 there is a large vortex a and a small vortex b downside and upside the splitter plate respectively vortex a moves downstream and finally sheds from the splitter plate tip at approximately t t 8 after which vortex a moves further downstream t 2t 8 vortex b does not shed but disappears with increasing time t 2t 8 a new vortex a forms upside the splitter plate t 3t 8 grows in size t 4t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate t 5t 8 meanwhile a new vortex b forms t 4t 8 and then disappears t 5t 8 downside the splitter plate since two single vortices are shed on alternate sides of the splitter plate vortex shedding belongs to the typical 2s mode as classified by williamson and roshko 1988 it is evident that the instantaneous streamline fields at t 4t 8 5t 8 6t 8 and 7t 8 are anti symmetric counterparts of the instantaneous streamline fields at t 0 1t 8 2t 8 and 3t 8 respectively this anti symmetry is also confirmed by the instantaneous pressure fields presented in fig 12 a the pressure fields suggest that the anti symmetric flow patterns have opposite effects on the lift force and torsional moment while they have the same effects on the drag force hence the frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is the same as the vibration frequency while the frequency of the drag force is twice the vibration frequency it has been discussed in subsection 3 2 that the torsional moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the splitter plate as seen in fig 12 a at t 0 the pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate is negative and has a large absolute value due to the existence of vortex b the pressure on the lower surface of the splitter plater is also negative but has a lower absolute value hence the torsional moment is positive i e counterclockwise at t 2t 8 a strong negative pressure exists in two regions i e the upper surface and the lower right part of the splitter plate these two regions produce opposite torsional moments hence the overall moment is close to zero similarly the overall moment is negative i e clockwise at t 4t 8 and close to zero at t 6t 8 the pressure fields suggest that the torsional moment is in phase with the displacement which agrees with the results in figs 8 b and fig 10 the vortex shedding mode for u r 8 50 also belongs to the 2s mode and the flow patterns within the former and latter half cycles are anti symmetric as seen in figs 11 b and 12 b the pressure fields suggest that the frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is consistent with the vibration frequency while the frequency of the drag force is doubled which agrees with the time histories given in fig 8 c the timing of vortices a and a for u r 8 50 seems close to that for u r 5 25 however vortices b and b for u r 8 50 are delayed compared to those for u r 5 25 as seen in figs 12 a and 12 b at t 0 the pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate for u r 8 50 is increased compared to that for u r 5 25 due to the change in the timing of vortex b as a result the torsional moment for u r 8 50 is negative i e clockwise at this time instant at t 2t 8 a negative pressure exists in two regions i e the upper left and lower right parts of the splitter plate these two regions produce an overall moment close to zero similarly the overall moment is positive i e counterclockwise at t 4t 8 and close to zero at t 6t 8 hence the torsional moment is 180 out of phase with the displacement from the preceding discussion it is known that the phase jump shown in fig 10 is induced by the change in the timing of vortices b and b figs 11 c and 12 c show the streamlines and pressure fields for a case after the symmetry breaking bifurcation as seen from fig 11 c at t 0 there is a large vortex a and a small vortex b downside and upside the splitter plate respectively vortex a grows in size t 2t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate at approximately t 2t 8 after which vortex a moves further downstream t 3t 8 vortex b does not shed but exists on the splitter plater s upper surface throughout the vibration cycle a new vortex c forms at the tip of the splitter plater at approximately t 4t 8 grows in size t 5t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate at approximately t 6t 8 although the flow patterns are quite different from those of the case before the symmetry breaking bifurcation the vortex shedding at u r 20 is still in the 2s mode it is noted that the flow patterns are no longer anti symmetric within two half cycles as seen in fig 12 c the effects on the drag force of the former half cycle and the latter half cycle are now different hence the dominant frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency due to the existence of vortex b the negative pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate results in a strong suction and hence a positive i e counterclockwise mean torsional moment comparing the pressure fields at t 0 and 2t 8 4t 8 it is evident that the torsional moment at t 0 is smaller than that at t 2t 8 and both of the former are smaller than that at t 4t 8 this observation is consistent with the 180 phase difference between the torsional moment and displacement as shown in figs 8 d and fig 10 4 conclusions numerical simulations were conducted to study the flow induced torsional vibrations of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate in laminar flow using the commercial program ansys fluent the cylinder plate assembly which was elastically mounted in a torsional degree of freedom was subjected to a cross flow with a reynolds number of 100 simulations were then performed at reduced flow velocities of u r 2 50 for several mass ratios or equivalently moments of inertia torsional vortex induced vibrations vivs with large vibration amplitudes were observed at approximately 4 u r 10 while a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurred as the reduced flow velocity increased after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrated around a nonzero equilibrium angle the peak viv amplitude of the considered cylinder plate assembly exceeds 12 making the configuration a competitive candidate for viv based energy harvesting the torsional vibrations also suggested that tubes with straight fins may not be good choices for heat exchangers the peak viv amplitude decreases slightly with increasing the mass ratio although the mass damping parameter is always zero the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment the critical reduced flow velocity of the bifurcation and the nonzero equilibrium angle at any reduced velocity can be calculated based on the mean torsional moment coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly the critical reduced velocity of the bifurcation increases with increasing the mass ratio the mean drag coefficient of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than that of a stationary circular cylinder while it is often higher than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly for a reduced velocity before the symmetry breaking bifurcation the dominant frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is the same as the vibration frequency while the dominant frequency of the drag force is doubled after symmetry breaking bifurcation the dominant frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency the flow induced torsional moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the splitter plate s upper and lower surfaces the phase difference between the torsional moment and the displacement is 0 at lower reduced velocities while it jumps to 180 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 significant fluctuations are observed for the torsional moment within the synchronization range of viv the typical 2s mode of vortex shedding is identified for all considered mass ratios and reduced flow velocities the flow patterns are antisymmetric for a reduced velocity before the symmetry breaking bifurcation within two half cycles of vibration the phase jump is induced by a change in the timing of a pair of non shedding vortices after the symmetry breaking bifurcation the flow patterns are no longer anti symmetric within two half cycles a vortex exists on one surface of the splitter plater throughout the vibration cycle this vortex results in a strong suction on the corresponding surface and hence a nonzero mean torsional moment credit authorship contribution statement mingjie zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis data formal

20394,splitter plates have been recognized as useful passive devices to reduce drag mitigate flow induced vibration and enhance heat transfer efficiency of a circular cylinder however undesired torsional flow induced vibrations due to splitter plate attachment require further investigation this paper numerically studies the flow induced torsional vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate in laminar flow with a reynolds number of 100 a finite volume formulation is utilized to solve the incompressible two dimensional fluid governing equations torsional vortex induced vibrations vivs are observed at lower reduced flow velocities while a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurs as the reduced flow velocity increases after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around a nonzero equilibrium angle the numerical results show that the synchronization range of viv extends the peak viv amplitude increases and the critical reduced flow velocity for the bifurcation decreases with decreasing the moment of inertia the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the structural restoring moment and the flow induced moment the critical reduced velocity of the bifurcation and the nonzero equilibrium angle at any reduced velocity can be calculated based on the mean moment coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly the flow induced moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the splitter plate s upper and lower surfaces the phase difference between the torsional moment and displacement is 0 at lower reduced velocities while the phase difference jumps to 180 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 the mean drag coefficient of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than the mean drag coefficient of a stationary circular cylinder but often higher than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly the dominant frequency of the drag force is twice the vibration frequency before the symmetry breaking bifurcation while the dominant frequency becomes consistent with the vibration frequency after the bifurcation the typical 2s mode of vortex shedding is identified for all considered moments of inertia and reduced flow velocities however the timing of a non shedding vortex changes at the critical flow velocities for the phase jump and symmetry breaking bifurcation the

introduction the flow past a circular cylinder is one of the most classical problems in fluid mechanics the resulting flow induced forces and vibrations are of practical concern for many engineering structures païdoussis et al 2010 williamson and govardhan 2004 e g chimneys ruscheweyh and galemann 1996 vickery and basu 1983 marine risers liu et al 2020 trim et al 2005 bridge cables jafari et al

and safety zhang et al 2020a song et al 2020 2021 however vibrations may be beneficial since they can serve as a clean and sustainable energy source wang et al 2020a 2020b yu and zhang 2021 various passive and active techniques have been developed to modify vortex shedding around a circular cylinder reduce flow induced forces and mitigate or enlarge flow induced vibrations demartino and ricciardelli 2017 zdravkovich 1981 a thin rigid plate later referred to as a splitter plate placed in the wake of a circular cylinder has been widely studied as a passive control device investigations on flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate can be traced back to roshko 1954 who showed that an attached splitter plate could increase the base pressure reduce the drag narrow the wake width and affect the strouhal number st f s d u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency of the static structure d is the diameter of the circular cylinder and u is the flow velocity following roshko s pioneering study the effects of a splitter plate attached to or detached from the circular cylinder on the flow around a stationary cylinder were investigated by several authors anderson and szewczyk 1997 apelt et al 1973 dehkordi and jafari 2010 gerrard 1966 hwang and yang 2007 hwang et al 2003 kwon and choi 1996 ozono 1999 it was determined that a detached splitter plate can also increase the base pressure and reduce the drag of a circular cylinder while the detached splitter plate becomes ineffective once the gap between the cylinder and the plate exceeds a critical value dehkordi and jafari 2010 hwang and yang 2007 hwang et al 2003 ozono 1999 for a specific reynolds number there is a critical plate length beyond which vortex shedding can be completely suppressed and an optimal length at which a minimum drag can be achieved since the splitter plate reduces the vortex shedding strength it is also expected to suppress the vortex induced vibration viv of a circular cylinder experiments by kawai 1990 showed that the viv of a circular cylinder could not be entirely mitigated by a splitter plate with a length of l 1d 4d while a splitter plate with a length of l 8d was found to mitigate the viv completely in addition all tested cylinder plate assemblies were found to exhibit galloping type vibrations at higher reduced flow velocities nakamura et al 1994 presented a wind tunnel experiment studying the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a detached splitter plate they showed that the circular cylinder can gallop due to a splitter plate with a length of l 31 3d nakamura et al 1994 also showed that quasi steady aerodynamic theory cannot predict the onset galloping velocity assia et al 2009 proposed suppressing the viv using a splitter plate that is rotatable around the circular cylinder s centre they showed that a rotatable plate with a suitable torsional resistance could mitigate the viv without initiating any galloping type vibration sun et al 2020 performed a numerical study on the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate with a length of l 0d 1 5d three vibration modes were successively observed with increasing plate length i e viv coupled viv and galloping and separated viv and galloping the effects of an attached or detached splitter plate on the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder have also been studied by stappenbelt 2010 huera huarte 2014 assi and bearman 2015 liang et al 2018 sahu et al 2019a 2019b and zhu et al 2020 in addition splitter plates are also used in heat exchanger tube arrays to enhance the heat transfer efficiency weaver et al 2001 izadpanah et al 2019 although many studies have been conducted to investigate the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a splitter plate attachment almost all existing studies considered a single degree of freedom vibration in the transverse direction or a two degree of freedom vibration in the transverse and in flow directions the flow induced vibration of a cylinder plate assembly in a torsional degree of freedom has received less attention cimbala and co authors cimbala and chen 1994 cimbala and garg 1991 performed a series of experiments on freely rotatable cylinder plate assemblies i e rotatable without any mechanical stiffness around the centre of the cylinder a cylinder plate assembly with a long splitter plate e g l 4d was found to vibrate slightly around its original mean position with the plate parallel to the freestream direction however for a cylinder plate assembly with a short splitter plate e g l 3d the equilibrium position rotated to a nonzero angle at either side of its central line with an equal probability the off axis equilibrium angle and the vibration amplitude were dependent on the reynolds number re ρud μ where ρ is the fluid mass density and μ is the dynamic viscosity the migration of the equilibrium position was also investigated numerically by xu et al 1993 1990 who showed that the phenomenon is a symmetry breaking bifurcation due to the flow in the separation bubble behind the cylindrical part of the assembly recently lu et al 2016 studied the torsional flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly they confirmed that symmetry breaking bifurcation also occurs for an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly furthermore the torsional vibration amplitude of the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly can be much larger than that of a freely rotatable assembly however the underlying mechanisms of the flow induced vibration and the symmetry breaking bifurcation as well as the effects of the structural dynamical property e g the moment of inertia of the assembly require further investigation thus this paper presents a numerical investigation on the flow induced torsional vibration of a cylinder plate assembly with various moments of inertia the assembly is elastically mounted about the torsional degree of freedom while the transverse and in flow degrees of freedom are not considered the flow induced vibrations within a reduced flow velocity range of u r u f 0 d 2 to 50 are investigated where f 0 is the natural frequency of the cylinder plate assembly the flow induced forces and the wake patterns during the vibrations are also discussed the remainder of this paper is organized as follows governing equations of the fluid structure interaction system and a description and validation of the numerical code are provided in section 2 simulation results of the flow induced vibrations of the considered cylinder plate assembly are presented and discussed in section 3 the main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 governing equations numerical methodology and code validation this section introduces the model configuration and the governing equations of the fluid structure interaction problem the numerical methodology used to solve the governing equations is described the numerical code is then validated by comparing the simulated results with previously published numerical results 2 1 model configuration and governing equations the considered model configuration is a circular cylinder with a rigid splitter plate attached to its back stagnation point as shown in fig 1 the cylinder plate assembly is subjected to a cross flow and allowed to vibrate about a torsional degree of freedom the transverse and streamwise degrees of freedom are not considered in these simulations the length l of the splitter plate is the same as the diameter d of the circular cylinder and the height of the splitter plate is h 0 02d the oncoming flow is uniform with a constant velocity of u the continuity and the navier stokes equations can describe the flow by assuming that the viscous newtonian flow is homogeneous and incompressible the nondimensional governing equations of the flow domain can be written in an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation as 1 u x v y 0 2 u τ u u x v u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 v τ u v x v v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where x and y are the coordinates in the in flow and cross flow directions

are positive in the downstream upward and counterclockwise directions respectively 2 2 numerical methodology the finite volume method is used to discretize the fluid governing equations the first order implicit time integration scheme is used for temporal discretization the second order upwind scheme and the least square cell based scheme are used for spatial discretization of the convection term and diffusion term respectively the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm is used to solve the pressure velocity coupled algebraic equations and the flow field is solved by the commercial program ansys fluent the equation of motion of the cylinder plate assembly is solved using a standard 4th order runge kutta method the flow and structure solvers are then merged following the loosely coupled partitioned approach the solver has demonstrated an excellent accuracy and stability in simulating the flow induced vibrations of bluff cylinders such as bridge decks and rectangular cylinders ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a b 2 3 code validation the viv of a circular cylinder and the coupled transverse streamwise flow induced vibration of the cylinder plate assembly are simulated first to examine the accuracy and stability of the numerical solver the computational domain and the boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 1 the computational domain is set as 50d 100d and the blockage ratio is 2 the two dimensional flow field is divided into three subregions i e a rigid region a deforming region and a static region the rigid region moves together with the model to guarantee a near wall mesh quality which directly affects the simulation accuracy the deforming region is then used for the dynamic mesh to accommodate the displacement of the inner rigid region the mesh in the static region remains static during the entire simulation hybrid grids structured dense quadrangular grids for the rigid region and unstructured triangular grids for the deforming region are then used to maximize the accuracy and efficiency for the cylinder plate assembly three meshes of different grid densities i e mesh 1 coarse mesh 2 medium and mesh 3 fine are first generated to obtain grid independent results fig 2 shows the global view and a partial enlargement of mesh 2 for mesh 2 276 grid cells are allocated on the cylinder surface while 94 cells are distributed on each side of the splitter plate the height of the first layer grids close to the model surface is approximately 0 0033d mesh 1 and mesh 3 are generated by increasing and decreasing the growth factor of the grid size along the radial direction of the circular cylinder and along the orthogonal direction of the splitter plate surface respectively the torsional flow induced vibration for a cylinder plate assembly with m m s π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 10 and ξ 0 0 is simulated at u r 5 0 and re 100 the circular cylinder is considered to be a pipe with a thickness of h 0 02d and the density of the cylinder plate assembly is uniform table 1 presents the vibration amplitudes and frequencies simulated using different mesh resolutions the value in the bracket is the relative difference between the results in the present row and the previous row the results almost converge at mesh 2 since the difference between the results based on mesh 2 and mesh 3 are less than 0 3 in table 2 the vibration amplitude and frequency of the considered case are calculated by mesh 2 with different dimensionless time steps δτ the changes in the results due to the reduction of δτ from 0 01 to 0 005 are less than 0 7 hence mesh 2 and δτ 0 01 are adopted in the following simulations it is noted that in this paper the mesh is more refined and the computational domain is larger than those used in some previous studies lu et al 2016 sun et al 2020 fig 3 a presents the simulated viv amplitudes h max of a circular cylinder together with some previously published numerical simulations bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 as well as the experimental results of anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 all numerical simulations were conducted at re 100 m m s π ρ d 2 4 10 and ξ 0 0 while the experiment was conducted at re 90 159 m 149 and ξ 0 0 12 0 15 the present numerical results agree well with the previous numerical results however the experimental lock in range is considerably smaller than that of the numerical simulations a smaller lock in range may be mainly due to the larger mass damping parameter of the experiment the different flow conditions and boundary conditions of the experiment and numerical simulations may also contribute to the different lock in ranges fig 3 b compares the simulated vertical vibration amplitudes h max of the cylinder plate assembly with the numerical results of sun et al 2020 both the present simulations and the simulations of sun et al 2020 were conducted at re 100 m m s π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 10 and ξ 0 0 again the present results agree with previously published results to further validate the numerical code the strouhal number st the mean drag coefficient c d mean and the time averaged separation bubble length l w are simulated for the cylinder plate assembly at re 100 as presented in table 3 the results of the present simulation agree well with previous simulations 3 numerical results and discussion the torsional flow induced vibration of a cylinder plate assembly l d is simulated using the numerical procedure described in section 2 the reynolds number is re 100 throughout the simulations hence the flow is two dimensional and laminar the circular cylinder is a pipe with a thickness of h 0 02d and the thickness of the splitter plate is also h 0 02d the cylinder plate assembly has a uniform mass density of ρ s m π ρ d 2 4 ρ d 2 50 π d h d h hence the moment of inertia of the cylinder plate assembly can be calculated as 11 i ρ s π d h d 2 2 ρ s d h 13 d 2 12 four mass ratios i e m 5 10 20 and 40 are considered to investigate the effect of the mass ratio or equivalently the moment of inertia on the flow induced vibrations the moment of inertia for each mass ratio can be calculated from eq 11 the mechanical damping ratio is always considered to be ξ 0 0 for each reduced flow velocity the cylinder plate assembly starts to vibrate from a static condition due to the oncoming flow and the simulation is performed sufficiently long to obtain the steady state response 3 1 displacement signal vibration amplitude and frequency typical time histories of the torsional displacement signal of the cylinder plate assembly with m 5 are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a a well organized and quasi harmonic torsional vibration is developed at a very low reduced velocity of u r 3 0 the vibration amplitude increases with time and a constant amplitude vibration with an amplitude of θ max 0 26 is achieved after τ 150 at u r 4 5 as given in fig 4 b the vibration exhibits a noticeable fluctuation due to the multiple frequency components involved in the vibration fig 4 c shows that as the reduced frequency increases to u r 4 625 the vibration amplitude modulates significantly which is a clear beating phenomenon of the vibration involving two closely spaced frequencies the vibration amplitude exhibits a dramatic increase around u r 4 75 fig 4 d at which point the steady vibration amplitude is θ max 12 20 the large vibration makes the configuration a competitive candidate for viv based energy harvesting however the vibration also suggests that tubes with straight fins may not be good choices for heat exchangers the intensive vibration remains until u r 5 25 fig 4 e after which the vibration amplitude begins to decrease gradually with a further increasing reduced velocity at u r 14 0 the steady vibration amplitude in fig 4 h drops to θ max 2 54 as observed in fig 4 i a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurs at u r 15 00 after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around θ mean 9 50 instead of θ mean 0 symmetry breaking bifurcation also occurs for higher reduced velocities e g u r 20 0 in fig 4 j while the absolute value of the mean displacement θ mean increases with increasing reduced velocity it is noted that the equilibrium position after the bifurcation can rotate to either side of the original central line fig 4 j shows the displacement signals at u r 20 0 starting from two different initializations of the flow field the equilibrium angle can be either positive or negative depending on the initialization the variation in the vibration characteristics with increasing reduced velocity is in agreement with the numerical simulations of lu et al 2016 it is noted that the simulations of lu et al 2016 were conducted for a cylinder plate assembly with m 10 while their moment of inertia is much lower than the values in this paper because they considered a solid circular cylinder with a uniform mass density fig 5 presents the steady state torsional displacement amplitudes θ max and the absolute mean displacements θ mean of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios as shown in fig 5 a torsional vivs were observed for the cylinder plate assembly for all considered mass ratios the peak amplitude of viv increases slightly and the synchronization range extends with decreasing the mass ratio the peak amplitude of viv is 10 0 12 2 depending on the mass ratio the results are lower than the value of 13 2 reported by lu et al 2016 which should mainly be due to the lower moment of inertia considered in their simulations the sharp jump in the vibration amplitude and the symmetry breaking bifurcation both occur at lower reduced flow velocities u r 4 2 and u r 11 0 respectively in the study of lu et al 2016 due to the lower moment of inertia for a structure with a large mass ratio it is believed that the peak amplitude of viv remains unchanged for a constant mass damping parameter khalak and williamson 1999 zhang et al 2019a b 2020b 2021 2020b in the present simulation the mass damping parameter is always zero however this is not true for a structure with a low mass ratio for example yu et al 2018 reported the numerically simulated peak viv amplitudes of a circular cylinder at a zero damping ratio and several low mass ratios m 0 1 4 and 5 they found that the peak amplitude decreases with increasing mass ratio despite the constant mass damping parameter in the present simulations considerable efforts were designated to capture the peak viv amplitudes at various mass ratios as seen from fig 5 a the peak viv amplitude also decreases slightly with increasing the mass ratio as shown in fig 5 b a symmetry breaking bifurcation comes into existence as u r increases over a critical value the critical u r increases with increasing the mass ratio xu et al 1990 showed that the symmetry breaking bifurcation for a freely rotatable cylinder plate assembly is related to its c m mean θ 0 curve where θ 0 is the initial angle of attack of the assembly relative to the oncoming flow the freely rotatable assembly comes to rest on a nonzero θ mean at which c m mean 0 hence the equilibrium angle of a freely rotatable cylinder plate assembly can be determined by xu et al 1990 12 c m mean 0 13 d c m mean d θ mean 0 for the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly in the present simulation the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment the mean structural restoring moment f r mean and the mean flow induced moment f m mean can be respectively expressed as 14 f r mean i 2 π f 0 2 θ mean 15 f m m e a n 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 c m mean the equilibrium angle for an elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly is achieved when the mean flow induced moment is balanced by the mean structural restoring moment hence the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly vibrates around an equilibrium angle satisfying eqs 13 and 16 16 θ mean 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 c m mean i 2 π f 0 2 the c m mean values of the cylinder plate assembly are simulated using the continuous torsional motion technique developed by ying et al 2018 as presented in fig 6 the cylinder plate assembly is forced to vibrate in the torsional degree of freedom with a low frequency of 0 00005 hz and an amplitude of 20 the numerical methodology utilized to solve the governing equations is the same as that described in section 2 the self excited force is negligible if the vibration frequency is extremely low hence the total flow induced force acting on the cylinder plate assembly is approximately equal to the aerostatic force the c m mean values at various angles of attack can be calculated based on the forced vibration displacement and the resulting flow induced force according to eq 10 this shows that the c m mean increases with increasing θ 0 and achieves a peak value around θ 0 13 after which the c m mean begins to decrease the variation in c m mean versus θ 0 is similar to that at a lower reynolds number reported by xu et al 1993 1990 the mean displacements θ mean of the cylinder plate assembly are calculated based on the c m mean θ 0 curve using eqs 13 and 16 as shown in fig 5 b the results calculated based on the c m mean θ 0 curve agree well with the numerically simulated results the error may be mainly ascribed to the unsteady effects induced by the torsional vibration and the identification error of the c m mean θ 0 curve the comparison in fig 5 b proves that the symmetry breaking bifurcation for the elastically mounted cylinder plate assembly is indeed due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment fig 7 shows the vibration frequencies f of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios in which f 0 is the natural frequency of the assembly in a vacuum the normalized vortex shedding frequency f s f 0 of the stationary assembly is also shown for comparison where f s s t u d at low reduced velocities the slope of the vibration frequency is close to the vortex shedding frequency as the reduced velocity increases the vibration frequency exhibits a jump around u r 5 and the slope approaches that of the natural frequency f 0 with further increasing the reduced velocity the slope of the vibration frequency increases and becomes close to the vortex shedding frequency again no significant change occurs in the slope of the vibration frequency at higher reduced velocities the overall profile of the f u r curve is similar to that observed for the transverse viv of a circular cylinder with a very low mass ratio willden and graham 2006 yu et al 2018 the jump of the vibration frequency is found to occur at the same reduced velocity as the jump of the vibration amplitude as presented in fig 5 a the vibration frequency intersects with the natural frequency f 0 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 regardless of the mass ratio the vibration after the symmetry breaking bifurcation is a forced vibration induced by periodic vortex shedding while the vibration frequency is slightly higher than the vortex shedding frequency for the cylinder plate assembly at a 0 initial angle of attack this higher vibration frequency is due to an increased strouhal number at a nonzero equilibrium angle for the same cylinder plate assembly an increase in the strouhal number with increasing the initial angle of attack was also reported by akansu et al 2004 for reynolds numbers between 8 000 and 60 000 3 2 flow induced forces fig 8 shows the torsional displacement signals and the flow induced force coefficients c d c l and c m of the m 5 cylinder plate assembly at u r 0 5 25 8 50 and 20 0 in which the solid blue line represents the displacement or force coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly while the dashed green lines and the dashed red line represent the force coefficients of the circular cylinder and the splitter plater respectively it is noted that the drag coefficient of the splitter plate is close to zero and the result presented in fig 8 is the actual drag coefficient added by 1 2 as seen from fig 8 a the flow induced drag force lift force and torsional moment for a stationary cylinder plate assembly are periodic functions and the dominant frequency of the drag force is twice that of the lift force and the torsional moment these features are similar to the flow induced forces for a stationary circular cylinder for a vibrating cylinder plate assembly the dominant frequency of the lift force and torsional moment are the same as the vibration frequency however the drag force s dominant frequency is twice the vibration frequency at u r 5 25 and 8 50 the frequency of the drag force is doubled because the vortices shedding from alternate sides of the cylinder plate assembly have different effects on the lift force and the torsional moment while they have the same effects on the drag force this will be further discussed and explained based on the flow pattern in subsection 3 4 after symmetry breaking bifurcation the cylinder plate assembly vibrates around a nonzero equilibrium angle and the assembly becomes asymmetrical about the oncoming flow direction the effects of vortices shedding from alternate sides on the drag force are therefore different hence the frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency as demonstrated by the case of u r 20 0 presented in fig 8 d fig 8 shows that the contribution from the splitter plate dominates the torsional moment on the cylinder plater assembly indeed numerical simulations prove that the shear stress magnitude is much smaller than that of the pressure since the pressure on the circular cylinder cannot produce any torsional moment it is the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the splitter plate that produces the torsional moment the torsional moment is in phase with the torsional displacement at u r 5 25 however there is a 180 phase difference between the torsional moment and the torsional displacement at u r 8 50 and 20 0 fig 9 shows the mean values of the flow induced force coefficients c d mean c l mean and c m mean and the standard deviations of the torsional moment coefficients c m std for the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios the mean drag coefficients for a stationary circular cylinder and a stationary cylinder plate assembly are also shown in fig 9 a for a comparison fig 9 a shows that the mean drag coefficient c d mean of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly at a low reduced flow velocity is smaller than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly c d mean exhibits a sharp jump and then decreases continuously with increasing the reduced velocity the maximum value of c d mean seems almost independent of the mass ratio c d mean decreases to a lower value with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation after which c d mean increases smoothly with increasing reduced flow velocity the c d mean u r curve for the assembly of m 5 suggests that the mean drag coefficient finally approaches a constant value for all the considered mass ratios and reduced flow velocities the c d mean of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than that of a stationary circular cylinder figs 9 b and 9 c show that the mean lift coefficient c l mean and the mean moment coefficient c m mean vary in a similar trend c l mean and c m mean are close to zero at lower reduced velocities and jump sharply with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation c l mean and c m mean continue to increase for a while after the jump and then begin to decrease until the largest simulated reduced velocity the maximum values of c l mean and c m mean are almost independent of the mass ratio while the maximum values are achieved at different reduced flow velocities for cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios as seen in fig 9 d the standard deviations of the moment coefficient c m std are very small at lower reduced velocities c m std then exhibits a sharp increase and a sharp drop after these sharp jumps c m std varies smoothly with increasing reduced velocity similar to the peak viv amplitude the peak value of c m std decreases with increasing the mass ratio a remarkable reduction in c m std is observed together with the occurrence of the symmetry breaking bifurcation no significant change is observed in c m std with further increasing reduced velocity 3 3 phase difference between displacement and torsional moment fig 10 shows the phase difference φ between the torsional moment and the displacement of the cylinder plate assemblies with various mass ratios for all mass ratios φ is approximately 0 for lower reduced flow velocities with increasing reduced velocity a 180 jump in the phase difference is observed which is similar to the phase jump observed in the transverse viv of a circular cylinder the phase jump occurs at the same reduced velocity i e u r 6 5 at which the vibration frequency intersects the natural frequency as shown in fig 7 before the phase jump the oncoming flow produces a negative stiffness effect and hence the vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency the fluid elastic stiffness becomes positive after the phase jump which results in a vibration frequency that is higher than the natural frequency the reduced velocity for the phase jump is insignificantly dependent on the mass ratio the phase jump will be further discussed and explained based on the flow pattern in subsection 3 4 3 4 flow pattern figs 11 and 12 show the streamlines and the pressure fields of the cylinder plate assembly with m 5 at three typical reduced flow velocities the two cases before the symmetry breaking bifurcation i e u r 5 25 and 8 50 are representative before and after the phase jump shown in fig 10 respectively the case of u r 20 0 is representative after symmetry breaking bifurcation for each case the streamlines and pressure fields are given at seven time instants within one vibration cycle t the uppermost images i e t 0 in figs 11 and 12 correspond to a time instant when the cylinder plate assembly is at the position with the largest angle the assembly then rotates clockwise to the equilibrium position at t 2t 8 and the lowest angle at t 4t 8 then the assembly rotates counterclockwise to the equilibrium position at t 6t 8 and the largest angle at t t as seen in fig 11 a at t 0 there is a large vortex a and a small vortex b downside and upside the splitter plate respectively vortex a moves downstream and finally sheds from the splitter plate tip at approximately t t 8 after which vortex a moves further downstream t 2t 8 vortex b does not shed but disappears with increasing time t 2t 8 a new vortex a forms upside the splitter plate t 3t 8 grows in size t 4t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate t 5t 8 meanwhile a new vortex b forms t 4t 8 and then disappears t 5t 8 downside the splitter plate since two single vortices are shed on alternate sides of the splitter plate vortex shedding belongs to the typical 2s mode as classified by williamson and roshko 1988 it is evident that the instantaneous streamline fields at t 4t 8 5t 8 6t 8 and 7t 8 are anti symmetric counterparts of the instantaneous streamline fields at t 0 1t 8 2t 8 and 3t 8 respectively this anti symmetry is also confirmed by the instantaneous pressure fields presented in fig 12 a the pressure fields suggest that the anti symmetric flow patterns have opposite effects on the lift force and torsional moment while they have the same effects on the drag force hence the frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is the same as the vibration frequency while the frequency of the drag force is twice the vibration frequency it has been discussed in subsection 3 2 that the torsional moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the splitter plate as seen in fig 12 a at t 0 the pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate is negative and has a large absolute value due to the existence of vortex b the pressure on the lower surface of the splitter plater is also negative but has a lower absolute value hence the torsional moment is positive i e counterclockwise at t 2t 8 a strong negative pressure exists in two regions i e the upper surface and the lower right part of the splitter plate these two regions produce opposite torsional moments hence the overall moment is close to zero similarly the overall moment is negative i e clockwise at t 4t 8 and close to zero at t 6t 8 the pressure fields suggest that the torsional moment is in phase with the displacement which agrees with the results in figs 8 b and fig 10 the vortex shedding mode for u r 8 50 also belongs to the 2s mode and the flow patterns within the former and latter half cycles are anti symmetric as seen in figs 11 b and 12 b the pressure fields suggest that the frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is consistent with the vibration frequency while the frequency of the drag force is doubled which agrees with the time histories given in fig 8 c the timing of vortices a and a for u r 8 50 seems close to that for u r 5 25 however vortices b and b for u r 8 50 are delayed compared to those for u r 5 25 as seen in figs 12 a and 12 b at t 0 the pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate for u r 8 50 is increased compared to that for u r 5 25 due to the change in the timing of vortex b as a result the torsional moment for u r 8 50 is negative i e clockwise at this time instant at t 2t 8 a negative pressure exists in two regions i e the upper left and lower right parts of the splitter plate these two regions produce an overall moment close to zero similarly the overall moment is positive i e counterclockwise at t 4t 8 and close to zero at t 6t 8 hence the torsional moment is 180 out of phase with the displacement from the preceding discussion it is known that the phase jump shown in fig 10 is induced by the change in the timing of vortices b and b figs 11 c and 12 c show the streamlines and pressure fields for a case after the symmetry breaking bifurcation as seen from fig 11 c at t 0 there is a large vortex a and a small vortex b downside and upside the splitter plate respectively vortex a grows in size t 2t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate at approximately t 2t 8 after which vortex a moves further downstream t 3t 8 vortex b does not shed but exists on the splitter plater s upper surface throughout the vibration cycle a new vortex c forms at the tip of the splitter plater at approximately t 4t 8 grows in size t 5t 8 and finally sheds from the tip of the splitter plate at approximately t 6t 8 although the flow patterns are quite different from those of the case before the symmetry breaking bifurcation the vortex shedding at u r 20 is still in the 2s mode it is noted that the flow patterns are no longer anti symmetric within two half cycles as seen in fig 12 c the effects on the drag force of the former half cycle and the latter half cycle are now different hence the dominant frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency due to the existence of vortex b the negative pressure on the upper surface of the splitter plate results in a strong suction and hence a positive i e counterclockwise mean torsional moment comparing the pressure fields at t 0 and 2t 8 4t 8 it is evident that the torsional moment at t 0 is smaller than that at t 2t 8 and both of the former are smaller than that at t 4t 8 this observation is consistent with the 180 phase difference between the torsional moment and displacement as shown in figs 8 d and fig 10 4 conclusions numerical simulations were conducted to study the flow induced torsional vibrations of a circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate in laminar flow using the commercial program ansys fluent the cylinder plate assembly which was elastically mounted in a torsional degree of freedom was subjected to a cross flow with a reynolds number of 100 simulations were then performed at reduced flow velocities of u r 2 50 for several mass ratios or equivalently moments of inertia torsional vortex induced vibrations vivs with large vibration amplitudes were observed at approximately 4 u r 10 while a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurred as the reduced flow velocity increased after which the cylinder plate assembly vibrated around a nonzero equilibrium angle the peak viv amplitude of the considered cylinder plate assembly exceeds 12 making the configuration a competitive candidate for viv based energy harvesting the torsional vibrations also suggested that tubes with straight fins may not be good choices for heat exchangers the peak viv amplitude decreases slightly with increasing the mass ratio although the mass damping parameter is always zero the symmetry breaking bifurcation is due to a combined effect of the mechanical restoring moment and the flow induced moment the critical reduced flow velocity of the bifurcation and the nonzero equilibrium angle at any reduced velocity can be calculated based on the mean torsional moment coefficients of the cylinder plate assembly the critical reduced velocity of the bifurcation increases with increasing the mass ratio the mean drag coefficient of the vibrating cylinder plate assembly is lower than that of a stationary circular cylinder while it is often higher than that of a stationary cylinder plate assembly for a reduced velocity before the symmetry breaking bifurcation the dominant frequency of the lift force and the torsional moment is the same as the vibration frequency while the dominant frequency of the drag force is doubled after symmetry breaking bifurcation the dominant frequency of the drag force becomes consistent with the vibration frequency the flow induced torsional moment is mainly induced by the pressure difference between the splitter plate s upper and lower surfaces the phase difference between the torsional moment and the displacement is 0 at lower reduced velocities while it jumps to 180 at a reduced velocity of approximately 6 5 significant fluctuations are observed for the torsional moment within the synchronization range of viv the typical 2s mode of vortex shedding is identified for all considered mass ratios and reduced flow velocities the flow patterns are antisymmetric for a reduced velocity before the symmetry breaking bifurcation within two half cycles of vibration the phase jump is induced by a change in the timing of a pair of non shedding vortices after the symmetry breaking bifurcation the flow patterns are no longer anti symmetric within two half cycles a vortex exists on one surface of the splitter plater throughout the vibration cycle this vortex results in a strong suction on the corresponding surface and hence a nonzero mean torsional moment credit authorship contribution statement mingjie zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis data formal
