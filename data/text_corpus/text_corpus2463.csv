12315,groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio economic activities however the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place therefore for sustainable development and management accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi arid regions this study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches viz influencing factors if frequency ratio fr and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping a total eight parameters such as lithology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and ahp models based on existing knowledge frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in gis environment the validation results exhibit that the map produced using fr model is more efficient 75 accuracy compared to the if 71 accuracy and ahp techniques 70 accuracy based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential however the groundwater potential maps prepared in this study will be helpful for effective planning and groundwater management in vaitarna basin graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential frequency ratio ahp influencing factor geospatial technique vaitarna india 1 introduction groundwater can be defined as the water in the saturated areas which packs the pore space of soil beneath the water table fitts 2002 freeze and cherry 1979 naghibi et al 2015 about 30 of earth s fresh water is hidden and reserved as groundwater while surface water in the form of lake reservoirs and rivers accounts only 0 3 shiklomanov 1993 senanayake et al 2016 the source of groundwater is mainly rainwater or snowmelt water which leach down through the soil pores into the aquifer banks and robins 2002 consumption of groundwater is more reliable and fresh compared to the surface water as it is less vulnerable to the catastrophic activities which occur on the earth s surface since last century due to the rapid industrialization and population growth demand of fresh water is an increasing concern worldwide manap et al 2012 das et al 2017 therefore extraction of groundwater has become an essential part in water management and planning mainly in rural sectors senanayake et al 2016 das and pardeshi 2018a occurrence of the groundwater at any place is a ramification of interaction between geological hydrological atmospheric and biological factors therefore the movement of groundwater through soil pores be determined by regional lithological variation topographic condition gradient geological structures climate soil type and many more greenbaum 1992 mukherjee 1996 oh et al 2011 das et al 2017 2018 das and pardeshi 2018b by considering all these factors it is easier to anticipate the groundwater potential of a region by implementing diverse approaches many approaches are applied to explore groundwater includes geological geophysical remote sensing techniques since past few decades das et al 2017 some of the methods are more effective accurate time and cost effective however all the traditional methods are very expensive and time consuming for an accurate investigation of groundwater potential of a region nampak et al 2014 sander et al 1996 by contrast geographical information system gis based modelling coupled with remote sensing data and geo hydrological investigation has the ability to predict groundwater zones with very high efficiency jasrotia et al 2007 hammouri et al 2014 das et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 numerous studies have been undertaken through implementation of different multi criteria decision making approach and machine learning algorithms jasrotia et al 2007 dinesh kumar et al 2007 vijith 2007 solomon and quiel 2006 pradhan 2009 thomas et al 2009 dar et al 2011 chowdhury et al 2009 srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 ballukraya and kalimuthu 2010 nampak et al 2014 das et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 das 2018 among these weighted overlay influencing factor is a common method implemented by many researcher senanayake et al 2016 magesh et al 2012 das et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018c many researchers have made an attempt to delineate groundwater potential map using ahp model worldwide rao and jugran 2003 lokesha et al 2005 mondal et al 2008 jha et al 2010 elewa and qaddah 2011 jasrotia et al 2013 kumar and shankar 2014 rahmati et al 2015 jenifer and jha 2017 frequency ratio model to delineate groundwater potential is not widely used instead a very few works are found where frequency ratio has been applied naghibi et al 2015 balamurugan et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018c recent days several advanced methodological approaches are taken by various researchers for groundwater exploration among which weights of evidence model lee et al 2012 nejad et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017 logistic model tree rahmati et al 2018a b dempster shafer model rahmati and melesse 2016 statistical approaches falah et al 2017 certainty factor razandi et al 2015 hou et al 2018

et al 2018 have been successfully implemented groundwater exploration has become more advanced with development of various gis tools such as height above the nearest drainage hand rahmati et al 2018a b yin et al 2018 developed a gis based model for prediction of potential groundwater yield through analytical process and trapezoidal fuzzy number in china province all these methodological approaches made the groundwater exploration easier cost and time effective vaitarna basin exhibits a severe drought condition every year despite of substantial rainfall occurrence during monsoon because of semi arid nature a large area of vaitarna basin is covering agricultural land hence irrigation for crop firming is a common practice therefore groundwater is a valuable natural resource in this region however due to the semi arid climatic condition water is easier to consume only during monsoon season during summer a serious water scarceness situation occurs in the study area an accurate groundwater potential map can reduce the groundwater vulnerability in this area through proper utilization and management therefore in this study an attempt has been made to delineate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin using if ahp and fr models and compare these models to evaluate the efficiency in the application of groundwater potentiality mapping 2 study area depending on the groundwater availability vaitarna basin is considered as an area facing water resource scarcity in western coastal region of maharashtra india fig 1 vaitarna basin encompasses an area of 3800 km2 with an expansion from 19 25 to 20 05 n and 72 45 to 73 35 e the study area is located in the lap of western ghat of konkan coastal belt kcb from a geological perspective the vaitarna basin comprises a small area of the deccan volcanic province dvp which is one of the most astonishing geological formations in india occurred in the cretaceous tertiary period courtillot et al 1986 duncan and pyle 1988 pande et al 1988 widdowson and cox 1996 vaitarna basin shows an abundance of dykes fractures joints and faults das and pardeshi 2018b the study area exhibits a diverse geomorphological variation where the eastern most areas are characterized by very steep dip 5 10 escarpment the central part shows gentle undulating plateau with dissected low elevated hills made of flood basalt and the western most part is konkan coastal area with profusion of deep alluvium das 2017 das and pardeshi 2018b the main stream network within the study area is vaitarna and its tributaries all the rivers in vaitarna basin are originating from the majestic western ghat s escarpment and flowing into the arabian sea vaitarna basin in konkan coastal belt kcb is a semi arid region where enormous orographic rainfall occurs from june sept because of the moist cloud brought by arabian branch of monsoon doke et al 2018 during monsoon the rainfall is very high fig 2 however as soon as the indian monsoon retreats the region becomes extremely dry and a serious water resource scarcity situation occurs almost every year the primary economic activity in this area is agriculture by consuming surface water and groundwater hence water resource management is an essential concern in vaitarna basin 3 material and methods geographical information system based techniques are applied in this study to demarcate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin india several parameters such as lithology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture soil depth are assessed together through knowledge based weighted analysis analytical hierarchy process and statistics based frequency ratio models to prepare groundwater potential maps the complete methodology performed in this study has been presented in the schematic diagram fig 3 3 1 preparation of thematic layers to demarcate suitable zones of different groundwater potentiality several satellite images traditional published maps and climatic data have been collected from different websites and organizations to prepare thematic layers lithology of an area influences the porosity and permeability of an aquifer chowdhury et al 2010 rahmati and melesse 2016 golkarian and rahmati 2018 these two properties affect the movement and the existence of groundwater significantly shahid et al 2000 ozdemir 2011 lithology map and geomorphology map of the study area have been obtained from the geological survey of india gsi arcgis software has been employed to digitize the map intended for further analysis numerous studies suggest that areas with low drainage density are more appropriate for groundwater development as high level of drainage decrease the infiltration process and increase the runoff dinesh kumar et al 2007 magesh et al 2012 golkarian and rahmati 2018 shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem of 90 m resolution have been obtained from the cgiar official website www cgiar csi org srtm dem have been used to prepare slope map and drainage density map for the purpose of preparing drainage density map at first dem has been filled later by using flow direction and flow accumulation commands in arcgis a detailed drainage map has been prepared vectorization of the raster drainage map is done by using conversion tools finally using line density command the drainage density map has been prepared in arcgis environment land use pattern of an area influences the groundwater potential highly built up areas generally show low potential while agricultural land natural vegetation and regions near to the large water bodies show higher groundwater potential das et al 2017 landsat 8 satellite images are very useful for mapping the land use of an area landsat 8 data of 30 m spatial resolution has been obtained from usgs official website https earthexplorer usgs gov and classified in erdas imagine software six land use classes are obtained from the data are waterbodies which are generally large reservoirs rivers agricultural land natural vegetation built up areas and barren rocks lineaments play a fundamental role in groundwater potential of an area as structural weaknesses increase the capacity of infiltration of a rocky terrain das et al 2018 cartosat dem of 30 m resolution have been acquired from bhuvan portal http bhuvan nrsc gov in and an endeavor has been made to prepare lineament map from this dataset as it provides higher surface information than other data freely available in internet das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 the traditional way to prepare lineament map is visual interpretation from various satellite images and aerial photographs however modern techniques show that more accurate extraction can be done using shaded relief maps with a proper validation using satellite images das et al 2018 in this study the lineament map has been prepared by visual interpretation of lineaments using shaded relief map the validation of the extracted lineament is done by comparing results with landsat 8 data and google earth during validation all the anthropogenic features such as roads railway track canals etc have been eliminated from the final lineament map rosette diagram is a comprehensive way of statistical analysis to understand the orientation of lineaments das et al 2018 construction of rose diagram is done in rockworks software the major two sources of groundwater are glacial melt and precipitation das and pardeshi 2018c therefore regions having higher amount of precipitation generally have higher groundwater potential compared to the dry areas pixel based daily rainfall data of the study area for 63 years 1950 2013 has been obtained from india meteorological department imd and the average annual rainfall map is prepared by interpolation technique in arcgis soil texture is another important factor to control groundwater potential of a region as infiltration capacity depends on soil pores soil texture and depth data of the vaitarna basin are taken from national bureau of soil survey and land utilization planning nbss lup the data are processed in arcgis software and spatial maps are prepared 3 2 influencing factor technique influencing factor is one of the most elementary and comprehensive technique to execute multi criteria decision analysis based on author s existing knowledge of relative importance of different factors this technique is very common to map groundwater potential sites worldwide several studies have been performed just by engaging this technique which is highly time and cost effective magesh et al 2012 senanayake et al 2016 manikandan et al 2014 riad et al 2011 saraf and choudhury 1998 das et al 2017 the foundation of the method lies in the author s proficiency to provide appropriate ranks and weights to different factors which control the groundwater availability of a region in this study prior to assign ranks and weights several literature have been thoroughly assessed to get sufficient knowledge regarding the ranking of factors in different environmental conditions in different regions jaiswal et al 2003 basavaraj and nijagunappa 2011 yeh et al 2014 das et al 2017 the ranks and weights are assigned to each parameter and the different classes based on their relative contribution for the potentiality table 1 thereafter all these parameters are integrated into arcgis software and the resulting map is created through the raster calculation followed by the equation 1 g p z i 0 n w i r i l g w l g r g m w g m r s l w s l r d d w d d r l u w l u r l d w l d r r i w r i r s t w s t r s d w s d r where gpz is the groundwater potential zones w is weight of each factor r is rank of each class lg is the lithology gm is geomorphology sl is slope dd is drainage density lu is land use ld is lineament density ri is the rainfall concentration st is soil texture and sd is soil depth 3 3 frequency ratio frequency ratio can be defined as the prospect of occurrence of a certain factor bonham carter 1994 the basis of frequency ratio is the relationship between distribution of observational wells and the factors related to the groundwater potentiality frequency ratio of a certain factor can easily be calculated by the following expression 2 f r p g w t g w p f t f w e l l s p i x e l s where fr is frequency ratio pgw is the number of pixels with wells for each parameter tgw is the number of total wells pf is the number of pixels in the classes of a parameter tf is the total number of pixels of a parameter table 1 to prepare the groundwater potential zonation map all the factors with their frequency ratio are integrated in arcgis 10 3 and summed using the following expression 3 g p z i 1 n f r l g f r g m f r s l f r d d f r l u f r l d f r r i f r s t f r s d f r where gpz is groundwater potential zones fr is frequency ratio to perform frequency ratio model a total number of 796 wells are used as training dataset and 302 wells are used as validation dataset all the wells within vaitarna basin are digitized from topographical maps published by the survey of india soi and well locations given in central ground water board cgwb 2013 official report 3 4 analytical hierarchy process ahp sener et al 2011 defined ahp as a comprehensive technique that integrates pragmatic and subjective opinion of the experts to accomplish decision making through assessing multiple factors this method accelerates decision making process through identifying and weighting of different criteria kumar and krishna 2018 the significances of each factor within each section are accomplished by assessing each set of elements in a pairwise comparison for each of the factors fitting to the higher section the factors are ranked on a scale of 1 equal significance to 9 extreme significance shown in table 2 this comparison evaluates the significance of each parameter which influence groundwater potential independently rezaei moghaddam and karami 2008 in the pare wise comparison matrix the rows follow the inverse value of each parameter and its significance with another parameter 4 a a i j n n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n a i i 1 a i j 1 a j i a i j 0 the standard pair wise comparison matrix is built by normalizing pair wise comparison matrix table 3 thereafter the weights are calculated by using weighted arithmetic mean method which can be expressed as 5 a w λ m a x w the consistency index ci is calculated by the following equation given by saaty 1980 6 c r c i r i 7 c i λ m a x n n 1 where cr is consistency ratio ci is consistency index ri is random index λ m a x is the principle eigenvalue of matrix n is number of factors ri values are computed by the number of components in saaty s 1980 paper ri values are directly taken from the table provided by saaty 1980 which depends on the number of components the consistency ratio cr accepted into this study if the value is not more than 0 1 and this value is reasonable to map groundwater potential if the value of cr is found more than 0 1 then the value is readjusted by assigning different values in the pair wise comparison matrix according to saaty 1977 all the parameters are classified into subclasses and same method has been performed to assign rank scores to sub classes table 4 thereafter all these parameters are integrated in arcgis software and the resultant map is created through the raster calculation by using same equation employed in overlay analysis eq 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameters to control groundwater potential all the eight parameters govern groundwater potential of an area is described below in detail lithological variation of a region is considered to be the major controlling factor the vaitarna basin comprises three different types of lithology are flood basalt of cretaceous tertiary in the eastern and central region alluvium of quaternary period in the east central part and marine sediment along the coastal areas fig 4 a geomorphologically major three types of distinct landforms are lava plateau in the eastern section near escarpment structural hills on the central part and rocky benches in the western central region of the study area fig 4 b from fig 4 c it can be seen that eastern part of the study area is having steeper slope dip 20 compared to the central region moreover numerous structural hills on the western part make the gradient steeper it is apparent from fig 4 d that drainage density in vaitarna basin is moderate ranges from 0 to 1 66 km km 2 and higher towards eastern section the theme of land use in fig 4 e shows that a large part of the area is covered by agricultural land and natural vegetation in the eastern part of vaitarna basin bare rock is found which is not suitable for any economic activities however an insignificant amount of the study area is covering several water reservoirs rivers and built up areas lineaments can be defined as the linear or curvilinear features on the surface topography which are dykes shears fractures etc licker 2003 das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 in hard rock terrain lineaments play a major role in the infiltration process through the weaknesses in the rock from fig 5 it can be seen that the eastern part of the area is having very high lineament density and these lineaments are trending on nne ssw direction rainfall is the only source of water in vaitarna basin to produce groundwater the rainfall map of the study area shows rain is very high in the eastern part mainly due to the obstruction of western ghat escarpment which create huge amounts of orographic rainfall fig 6 a however the coastal area experiences the lowest average annual rainfall the soil texture and soil depth map exhibit that a major part of the study area is covered by shallow clay loamy soil fig 6 b deep clay type of soil is found only in case of the east section and the coastal areas fig 6 c 4 2 groundwater potential zonation maps the resultant maps computed by influence factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques have been categorized into four different groundwater potential zones are high moderate low and very low fig 7 4 2 1 influencing factor influence factor model is calculated on the basis of relative ranking of different factors and their sub categories most of the literature is found where geology and geomorphology is considered as the most important factor for the groundwater potentiality of an area magesh et al 2012 rahmati et al 2015 tahmassebllpoor et al 2016 das et al 2017 slope also plays a crucial role in case of groundwater availability and recharge in the hard rock terrain other factors have direct but minor impact on the groundwater potentiality all these factors are given weights according to their importance and the groundwater map has been generated using this influencing factor model about 25 of the total study area shows high groundwater potential while 31 area shows moderate potentiality about 43 areas are found to have low and very low potential of groundwater using this model fig 7 a 4 2 2 frequency ratio in frequency ratio model the ratio is made between the percentage of availability of wells under a certain class and the percentage of area falling under the class of a factor razandi et al 2015 the frequency ratio value 1 55 of geology is higher followed by marine sediment category table 1 in case of geomorphology rocky benches show highest fr 1 92 observation shows that as the lithological gradient is increasing the ratio is decreasing earlier similar observation also made in the study of naghibi et al 2015 highest fr value 1 71 is found in case of 0 3 63 slope category another notable observation is made in this study that regions with higher drainage density have higher frequency ratio value regions characterized by drainage density more than 1 26 km km 2 have fr value of 1 77 razandi et al 2015 reported a similar observation that higher drainage density generally shows higher frequency ratio values considering the land use pattern results indicate that built up and agricultural areas are having probability of large number of wells hence frequency ratio is high 1 79 and 1 78 respectively lineament zones are generally the structural weakness which influence the groundwater to be infiltrated in the sub surface das et al 2017 2018 das and pardeshi 2018b 2018c in case of vaitarna basin the higher lineament density regions are concentrated in the upstream region and encompassing very small area therefore an abundance of well is found where lineament density is least fr 1 59 the rainfall factor shows the lowest rainfall regions are having maximum frequency ratio 1 78 regions with moderately deep clay soil highest value of fr is found 6 53 and 1 85 respectively the groundwater potential map prepared through frequency ratio model show that only about 5 area in vaitarna basin is having high groundwater potential and about 27 area falls under moderate groundwater potential region rest of the areas are having low and very low groundwater potential fig 7 b 4 2 3 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is a very common technique extensively used for multi criteria decision making analysis since last few decades das 2019 in this study geology geomorphology and slope have been considered as the primary factors to delineate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin basic requirement to perform ahp model is that every parameter necessitate minimum three sub categories all the parameters except soil texture are classified more than three sub categories while only two types of soil textures are found in the study area as a result of this soil texture has been excluded from the ahp model the resultant map prepared by ahp model shows about 6 and 30 of the total study area having high and moderate groundwater potential respectively fig 7 c rest of the area is having low to very low groundwater potential 4 3 comparison among if ahp and fr models to perform groundwater potential mapping various methods have been implemented globally using geospatial techniques magesh et al 2012 performed influencing factor method to monitor groundwater potential zones on a district scale in india naghibi et al 2015 employed frequency ratio and shanon s entropy model to find out groundwater potential regions in iran jenifer and jha 2017 compared analytical hierarchy process catastrophe and entropy techniques to evaluate groundwater prospect zones in a hard rock region das and pardeshi 2018c implemented influencing factor if and frequency ratio fr models to map groundwater potential of a basaltic region pravara basin india however many more multi criteria decision making and machine learning approaches are adapted by many researchers for groundwater zonation in case of influencing factor technique the approach is very subjective where the accuracy depends on the factors and the weightage given to prepare the map senanayake et al 2016 the accuracy of analytical hierarchy process also depends on similar endeavors of assigning appropriate weights to the factors however frequency ratio is the ratio between incidence to the available area in this study lithology geomorphology and slope are the prime influential factor of groundwater potential in case of if and ahp models the study of magesh et al 2012 and razandi et al 2015 also demonstrates similar ranking where these components are given the highest weights the consistency ratio cr is 0 04 which indicates considerably good accuracy of the ahp model in the pair wise comparison matrix all the resultant maps constructed through if ahp and fr techniques show that the western section of the vaitarna basin near coastal area are having very good groundwater potential and this is common in case of all three models however comparing the area distribution with different potential zones indicate the map derived through if technique is comprising a very large area where the probability of groundwater is high in contrast ahp and fr shows that high probability of groundwater is confined only in coastal regions fig 7 area distribution for moderate and low groundwater probability is almost identical for all the three methods if technique shows a considerably low area distribution compared to the ahp and fr models although all these three approaches provide fairly accurate results it is always better to follow statistical approaches such as ahp or fr compared to the selective if method as the level of accuracy depends on user based ranking in if technique earlier influencing factor method has been implemented to map groundwater potential zones in numerous studies which are considerably accurate magesh et al 2012 nag and ray 2015 das et al 2017 additionally if method is the simplest user based ranking method which consume very less time to get a fair result several previous studies reported that frequency ratio model is a reliable and effective approach for groundwater potential mapping oh et al 2011 manap et al 2012 razandi et al 2015 in addition the performance of ahp technique is also found highly efficient in various researches li et al 2009 nazari et al 2012 das 2018 according to jha et al 2010 pourghasemi et al 2013 kaliraj et al 2014 and razandi et al 2015 ahp approach coupled with gis is an expert knowledge based technique which is capable of solving complex decision related problems 4 4 validation the most important processes to check the accuracy of any model lies in the validation of the results without validation the models are not much significant scientifically chung and fabbri 2003 several methods are widely used to validate groundwater potential maps such as receiver operating characteristics roc analysis area under curve auc groundwater yield estimation of wells during field visits etc pradhan 2009 mohammady et al 2012 pourghasemi et al 2013 regmi et al 2014 in this study comparison between influence factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy processes is done through plotting the cumulative areas under different groundwater zones and the cumulative number of wells available in each potential region based on the graph area under curve auc has been calculated the influencing factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process show the auc value of 71 75 and 70 respectively fig 8 a razandi et al 2015 reported similar observations that in their study fr is the most accurate and efficient model compared to the ahp and certainty factor models even the report shows that the auc value of fr is about 77 followed by ahp auc 73 therefore there is a strong agreement that performance of frequency ratio is the most accurate compared to ahp and if the study of das and pardeshi 2018c also reveals that the performance of fr is greater than the selective and knowledge based influencing factor model in addition the present study agrees the report given by rahmati et al 2014 which shows a gis ahp coupled groundwater potential mapping in iran finally it can be expressed that all the models applied in this study are showing a reasonably good accuracy furthermore number of wells within each groundwater potential zone have been plotted to compare all these models fig 8 b moreover the resultant maps are validated with the groundwater yield data provided by central groundwater board cgwb report in is observed that wells located in the eastern regions near to the western ghat generally having very low yield 0 5 lps and increasing towards coast 2 5 lps apart from auc and yield data groundwater potential map can also be validated by examining seasonal groundwater fluctuation data of an area generally regions with higher fluctuation indicates seasonal groundwater vulnerability in this study 20 different well s water depth bgl data have been collected from wris portal http www india wris nrsc gov in for the period of 2016 2017 based on the groundwater depth data three seasonal groundwater maps have been prepared i e pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon fig 9 illustrates the spatial variability of groundwater depth during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons in vaitarna basin it can be observed that during all seasons the coastal lowland region is having homogeneous groundwater depth notice the swath plot of groundwater depth in fig 9 however a greater variability is found in the central region where the groundwater potential is medium to low in the central region during monsoon the water depth is near to the surface but as monsoon retreats and season becomes dry the groundwater depth declines significantly which creates groundwater scarceness in case of eastern most region the groundwater fluctuation rate again decreases as a large water reservoir is found in this region which play a role to the groundwater availability during dry seasons notice the maps prepared through if and ahp techniques in fig 7 from above discussion it can be clearly understood that the groundwater potential maps predicted in this study are indicating a very high level of accuracy therefore the resultant maps generated in this study can assist for artificial recharge planning and other similar groundwater management in vaitarna basin 5 conclusion demarcation of groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin maharashtra is carried out by using influencing factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process models in gis environment researchers have emphasized that present days remote sensing and gis tools are the most cost and time effective tools for groundwater studies the groundwater potentiality of a region depends on direct and indirect influence of several environmental factors total nine layers of different factors such as geology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture and depth are integrated together with gis and resultant maps are generated three way validation is performed in this study to check the accuracy of resultant groundwater potential maps a total 302 wells are identified for validation of each model using area under the curve auc analysis the auc for frequency ratio model is 75 followed by 71 and 70 for influencing factor and ahp respectively hence the performance of fr model is considerably higher than if and ahp model if and ahp methods depend on the assignment of a relative score according to their importance which requires considerable knowledge of the factors by contrast frequency ratio is easier and accurate which do not depend on user based scoring to the different factors the groundwater potential maps indicate that the coastal regions are having higher groundwater potential in contrast to the central and eastern section of vaitarna basin which is efficiently supported by groundwater yield data and the groundwater fluctuation maps apart from the significant results the present study is highly valuable towards groundwater planning management and artificial recharge projects in vaitarna basin maharashtra acknowledgement the author wishes to thank all the faculty members of department of geography savitribai phule pune university for providing necessary facilities to carry out this study critical and constructive comments from dr jochen bundschuh editor in chief dr pierre glynn and two anonymous reviewers improved the final manuscript significantly 
12315,groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio economic activities however the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place therefore for sustainable development and management accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi arid regions this study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches viz influencing factors if frequency ratio fr and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping a total eight parameters such as lithology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and ahp models based on existing knowledge frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in gis environment the validation results exhibit that the map produced using fr model is more efficient 75 accuracy compared to the if 71 accuracy and ahp techniques 70 accuracy based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential however the groundwater potential maps prepared in this

diverse approaches many approaches are applied to explore groundwater includes geological geophysical remote sensing techniques since past few decades das et al 2017 some of the methods are more effective accurate time and cost effective however all the traditional methods are very expensive and time consuming for an accurate investigation of groundwater potential of a region nampak et al 2014 sander et al 1996 by contrast geographical information system gis based modelling coupled with remote sensing data and geo hydrological investigation has the ability to predict groundwater zones with very high efficiency jasrotia et al 2007 hammouri et al 2014 das et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 numerous studies have been undertaken through implementation of different multi criteria decision making approach and machine learning algorithms jasrotia et al 2007 dinesh kumar et al 2007 vijith 2007 solomon and quiel 2006 pradhan 2009 thomas et al 2009 dar et al 2011 chowdhury et al 2009 srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 ballukraya and kalimuthu 2010 nampak et al 2014 das et al 2017 al shabeeb et al 2018 das 2018 among these weighted overlay influencing factor is a common method implemented by many researcher senanayake et al 2016 magesh et al 2012 das et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018c many researchers have made an attempt to delineate groundwater potential map using ahp model worldwide rao and jugran 2003 lokesha et al 2005 mondal et al 2008 jha et al 2010 elewa and qaddah 2011 jasrotia et al 2013 kumar and shankar 2014 rahmati et al 2015 jenifer and jha 2017 frequency ratio model to delineate groundwater potential is not widely used instead a very few works are found where frequency ratio has been applied naghibi et al 2015 balamurugan et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018c recent days several advanced methodological approaches are taken by various researchers for groundwater exploration among which weights of evidence model lee et al 2012 nejad et al 2017

et al 2018 have been successfully implemented groundwater exploration has become more advanced with development of various gis tools such as height above the nearest drainage hand rahmati et al 2018a b yin et al 2018 developed a gis based model for prediction of potential groundwater yield through analytical process and trapezoidal fuzzy number in china province all these methodological approaches made the groundwater exploration easier cost and time effective vaitarna basin exhibits a severe drought condition every year despite of substantial rainfall occurrence during monsoon because of semi arid nature a large area of vaitarna basin is covering agricultural land hence irrigation for crop firming is a common practice therefore groundwater is a valuable natural resource in this region however due to the semi arid climatic condition water is easier to consume only during monsoon season during summer a serious water scarceness situation occurs in the study area an accurate groundwater potential map can reduce the groundwater vulnerability in this area through proper utilization and management therefore in this study an attempt has been made to delineate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin using if ahp and fr models and compare these models to evaluate the efficiency in the application of groundwater potentiality mapping 2 study area depending on the groundwater availability vaitarna basin is considered as an area facing water resource scarcity in western coastal region of maharashtra india fig 1 vaitarna basin encompasses an area of 3800 km2 with an expansion from 19 25 to 20 05 n and 72 45 to 73 35 e the study area is located in the lap of western ghat of konkan coastal belt kcb from a geological perspective the vaitarna basin comprises a small area of the deccan volcanic province dvp which is one of the most astonishing geological formations in india occurred in the cretaceous tertiary period courtillot et al 1986 duncan and pyle 1988 pande et al 1988 widdowson and cox 1996 vaitarna basin shows an abundance of dykes fractures joints and faults das and pardeshi 2018b the study area exhibits a diverse geomorphological variation where the eastern most areas are characterized by very steep dip 5 10 escarpment the central part shows gentle undulating plateau with dissected low elevated hills made of flood basalt and the western most part is konkan coastal area with profusion of deep alluvium das 2017 das and pardeshi 2018b the main stream network within the study area is vaitarna and its tributaries all the rivers in vaitarna basin are originating from the majestic western ghat s escarpment and flowing into the arabian sea vaitarna basin in konkan coastal belt kcb is a semi arid region where enormous orographic rainfall occurs from june sept because of the moist cloud brought by arabian branch of monsoon doke et al 2018 during monsoon the rainfall is very high fig 2 however as soon as the indian monsoon retreats the region becomes extremely dry and a serious water resource scarcity situation occurs almost every year the primary economic activity in this area is agriculture by consuming surface water and groundwater hence water resource management is an essential concern in vaitarna basin 3 material and methods geographical information system based techniques are applied in this study to demarcate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin india several parameters such as lithology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture soil depth are assessed together through knowledge based weighted analysis analytical hierarchy process and statistics based frequency ratio models to prepare groundwater potential maps the complete methodology performed in this study has been presented in the schematic diagram fig 3 3 1 preparation of thematic layers to demarcate suitable zones of different groundwater potentiality several satellite images traditional published maps and climatic data have been collected from different websites and organizations to prepare thematic layers lithology of an area influences the porosity and permeability of an aquifer chowdhury et al 2010 rahmati and melesse 2016 golkarian and rahmati 2018 these two properties affect the movement and the existence of groundwater significantly shahid et al 2000 ozdemir 2011 lithology map and geomorphology map of the study area have been obtained from the geological survey of india gsi arcgis software has been employed to digitize the map intended for further analysis numerous studies suggest that areas with low drainage density are more appropriate for groundwater development as high level of drainage decrease the infiltration process and increase the runoff dinesh kumar et al 2007 magesh et al 2012 golkarian and rahmati 2018 shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem of 90 m resolution have been obtained from the cgiar official website www cgiar csi org srtm dem have been used to prepare slope map and drainage density map for the purpose of preparing drainage density map at first dem has been filled later by using flow direction and flow accumulation commands in arcgis a detailed drainage map has been prepared vectorization of the raster drainage map is done by using conversion tools finally using line density command the drainage density map has been prepared in arcgis environment land use pattern of an area influences the groundwater potential highly built up areas generally show low potential while agricultural land natural vegetation and regions near to the large water bodies show higher groundwater potential das et al 2017 landsat 8 satellite images are very useful for mapping the land use of an area landsat 8 data of 30 m spatial resolution has been obtained from usgs official website https earthexplorer usgs gov and classified in erdas imagine software six land use classes are obtained from the data are waterbodies which are generally large reservoirs rivers agricultural land natural vegetation built up areas and barren rocks lineaments play a fundamental role in groundwater potential of an area as structural weaknesses increase the capacity of infiltration of a rocky terrain das et al 2018 cartosat dem of 30 m resolution have been acquired from bhuvan portal http bhuvan nrsc gov in and an endeavor has been made to prepare lineament map from this dataset as it provides higher surface information than other data freely available in internet das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 the traditional way to prepare lineament map is visual interpretation from various satellite images and aerial photographs however modern techniques show that more accurate extraction can be done using shaded relief maps with a proper validation using satellite images das et al 2018 in this study the lineament map has been prepared by visual interpretation of lineaments using shaded relief map the validation of the extracted lineament is done by comparing results with landsat 8 data and google earth during validation all the anthropogenic features such as roads railway track canals etc have been eliminated from the final lineament map rosette diagram is a comprehensive way of statistical analysis to understand the orientation of lineaments das et al 2018 construction of rose diagram is done in rockworks software the major two sources of groundwater are glacial melt and precipitation das and pardeshi 2018c therefore regions having higher amount of precipitation generally have higher groundwater potential compared to the dry areas pixel based daily rainfall data of the study area for 63 years 1950 2013 has been obtained from india meteorological department imd and the average annual rainfall map is prepared by interpolation technique in arcgis soil texture is another important factor to control groundwater potential of a region as infiltration capacity depends on soil pores soil texture and depth data of the vaitarna basin are taken from national bureau of soil survey and land utilization planning nbss lup the data are processed in arcgis software and spatial maps are prepared 3 2 influencing factor technique influencing factor is one of the most elementary and comprehensive technique to execute multi criteria decision analysis based on author s existing knowledge of relative importance of different factors this technique is very common to map groundwater potential sites worldwide several studies have been performed just by engaging this technique which is highly time and cost effective magesh et al 2012 senanayake et al 2016 manikandan et al 2014 riad et al 2011 saraf and choudhury 1998 das et al 2017 the foundation of the method lies in the author s proficiency to provide appropriate ranks and weights to different factors which control the groundwater availability of a region in this study prior to assign ranks and weights several literature have been thoroughly assessed to get sufficient knowledge regarding the ranking of factors in different environmental conditions in different regions jaiswal et al 2003 basavaraj and nijagunappa 2011 yeh et al 2014 das et al 2017 the ranks and weights are assigned to each parameter and the different classes based on their relative contribution for the potentiality table 1 thereafter all these parameters are integrated into arcgis software and the resulting map is created through the raster calculation followed by the equation 1 g p z i 0 n w i r i l g w l g r g m w g m r s l w s l r d d w d d r l u w l u r l d w l d r r i w r i r s t w s t r s d w s d r where gpz is the groundwater potential zones w is weight of each factor r is rank of each class lg is the lithology gm is geomorphology sl is slope dd is drainage density lu is land use ld is lineament density ri is the rainfall concentration st is soil texture and sd is soil depth 3 3 frequency ratio frequency ratio can be defined as the prospect of occurrence of a certain factor bonham carter 1994 the basis of frequency ratio is the relationship between distribution of observational wells and the factors related to the groundwater potentiality frequency ratio of a certain factor can easily be calculated by the following expression 2 f r p g w t g w p f t f w e l l s p i x e l s where fr is frequency ratio pgw is the number of pixels with wells for each parameter tgw is the number of total wells pf is the number of pixels in the classes of a parameter tf is the total number of pixels of a parameter table 1 to prepare the groundwater potential zonation map all the factors with their frequency ratio are integrated in arcgis 10 3 and summed using the following expression 3 g p z i 1 n f r l g f r g m f r s l f r d d f r l u f r l d f r r i f r s t f r s d f r where gpz is groundwater potential zones fr is frequency ratio to perform frequency ratio model a total number of 796 wells are used as training dataset and 302 wells are used as validation dataset all the wells within vaitarna basin are digitized from topographical maps published by the survey of india soi and well locations given in central ground water board cgwb 2013 official report 3 4 analytical hierarchy process ahp sener et al 2011 defined ahp as a comprehensive technique that integrates pragmatic and subjective opinion of the experts to accomplish decision making through assessing multiple factors this method accelerates decision making process through identifying and weighting of different criteria kumar and krishna 2018 the significances of each factor within each section are accomplished by assessing each set of elements in a pairwise comparison for each of the factors fitting to the higher section the factors are ranked on a scale of 1 equal significance to 9 extreme significance shown in table 2 this comparison evaluates the significance of each parameter which influence groundwater potential independently rezaei moghaddam and karami 2008 in the pare wise comparison matrix the rows follow the inverse value of each parameter and its significance with another parameter 4 a a i j n n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n a i i 1 a i j 1 a j i a i j 0 the standard pair wise comparison matrix is built by normalizing pair wise comparison matrix table 3 thereafter the weights are calculated by using weighted arithmetic mean method which can be expressed as 5 a w λ m a x w the consistency index ci is calculated by the following equation given by saaty 1980 6 c r c i r i 7 c i λ m a x n n 1 where cr is consistency ratio ci is consistency index ri is random index λ m a x is the principle eigenvalue of matrix n is number of factors ri values are computed by the number of components in saaty s 1980 paper ri values are directly taken from the table provided by saaty 1980 which depends on the number of components the consistency ratio cr accepted into this study if the value is not more than 0 1 and this value is reasonable to map groundwater potential if the value of cr is found more than 0 1 then the value is readjusted by assigning different values in the pair wise comparison matrix according to saaty 1977 all the parameters are classified into subclasses and same method has been performed to assign rank scores to sub classes table 4 thereafter all these parameters are integrated in arcgis software and the resultant map is created through the raster calculation by using same equation employed in overlay analysis eq 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameters to control groundwater potential all the eight parameters govern groundwater potential of an area is described below in detail lithological variation of a region is considered to be the major controlling factor the vaitarna basin comprises three different types of lithology are flood basalt of cretaceous tertiary in the eastern and central region alluvium of quaternary period in the east central part and marine sediment along the coastal areas fig 4 a geomorphologically major three types of distinct landforms are lava plateau in the eastern section near escarpment structural hills on the central part and rocky benches in the western central region of the study area fig 4 b from fig 4 c it can be seen that eastern part of the study area is having steeper slope dip 20 compared to the central region moreover numerous structural hills on the western part make the gradient steeper it is apparent from fig 4 d that drainage density in vaitarna basin is moderate ranges from 0 to 1 66 km km 2 and higher towards eastern section the theme of land use in fig 4 e shows that a large part of the area is covered by agricultural land and natural vegetation in the eastern part of vaitarna basin bare rock is found which is not suitable for any economic activities however an insignificant amount of the study area is covering several water reservoirs rivers and built up areas lineaments can be defined as the linear or curvilinear features on the surface topography which are dykes shears fractures etc licker 2003 das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 in hard rock terrain lineaments play a major role in the infiltration process through the weaknesses in the rock from fig 5 it can be seen that the eastern part of the area is having very high lineament density and these lineaments are trending on nne ssw direction rainfall is the only source of water in vaitarna basin to produce groundwater the rainfall map of the study area shows rain is very high in the eastern part mainly due to the obstruction of western ghat escarpment which create huge amounts of orographic rainfall fig 6 a however the coastal area experiences the lowest average annual rainfall the soil texture and soil depth map exhibit that a major part of the study area is covered by shallow clay loamy soil fig 6 b deep clay type of soil is found only in case of the east section and the coastal areas fig 6 c 4 2 groundwater potential zonation maps the resultant maps computed by influence factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques have been categorized into four different groundwater potential zones are high moderate low and very low fig 7 4 2 1 influencing factor influence factor model is calculated on the basis of relative ranking of different factors and their sub categories most of the literature is found where geology and geomorphology is considered as the most important factor for the groundwater potentiality of an area magesh et al 2012 rahmati et al 2015 tahmassebllpoor et al 2016 das et al 2017 slope also plays a crucial role in case of groundwater availability and recharge in the hard rock terrain other factors have direct but minor impact on the groundwater potentiality all these factors are given weights according to their importance and the groundwater map has been generated using this influencing factor model about 25 of the total study area shows high groundwater potential while 31 area shows moderate potentiality about 43 areas are found to have low and very low potential of groundwater using this model fig 7 a 4 2 2 frequency ratio in frequency ratio model the ratio is made between the percentage of availability of wells under a certain class and the percentage of area falling under the class of a factor razandi et al 2015 the frequency ratio value 1 55 of geology is higher followed by marine sediment category table 1 in case of geomorphology rocky benches show highest fr 1 92 observation shows that as the lithological gradient is increasing the ratio is decreasing earlier similar observation also made in the study of naghibi et al 2015 highest fr value 1 71 is found in case of 0 3 63 slope category another notable observation is made in this study that regions with higher drainage density have higher frequency ratio value regions characterized by drainage density more than 1 26 km km 2 have fr value of 1 77 razandi et al 2015 reported a similar observation that higher drainage density generally shows higher frequency ratio values considering the land use pattern results indicate that built up and agricultural areas are having probability of large number of wells hence frequency ratio is high 1 79 and 1 78 respectively lineament zones are generally the structural weakness which influence the groundwater to be infiltrated in the sub surface das et al 2017 2018 das and pardeshi 2018b 2018c in case of vaitarna basin the higher lineament density regions are concentrated in the upstream region and encompassing very small area therefore an abundance of well is found where lineament density is least fr 1 59 the rainfall factor shows the lowest rainfall regions are having maximum frequency ratio 1 78 regions with moderately deep clay soil highest value of fr is found 6 53 and 1 85 respectively the groundwater potential map prepared through frequency ratio model show that only about 5 area in vaitarna basin is having high groundwater potential and about 27 area falls under moderate groundwater potential region rest of the areas are having low and very low groundwater potential fig 7 b 4 2 3 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is a very common technique extensively used for multi criteria decision making analysis since last few decades das 2019 in this study geology geomorphology and slope have been considered as the primary factors to delineate groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin basic requirement to perform ahp model is that every parameter necessitate minimum three sub categories all the parameters except soil texture are classified more than three sub categories while only two types of soil textures are found in the study area as a result of this soil texture has been excluded from the ahp model the resultant map prepared by ahp model shows about 6 and 30 of the total study area having high and moderate groundwater potential respectively fig 7 c rest of the area is having low to very low groundwater potential 4 3 comparison among if ahp and fr models to perform groundwater potential mapping various methods have been implemented globally using geospatial techniques magesh et al 2012 performed influencing factor method to monitor groundwater potential zones on a district scale in india naghibi et al 2015 employed frequency ratio and shanon s entropy model to find out groundwater potential regions in iran jenifer and jha 2017 compared analytical hierarchy process catastrophe and entropy techniques to evaluate groundwater prospect zones in a hard rock region das and pardeshi 2018c implemented influencing factor if and frequency ratio fr models to map groundwater potential of a basaltic region pravara basin india however many more multi criteria decision making and machine learning approaches are adapted by many researchers for groundwater zonation in case of influencing factor technique the approach is very subjective where the accuracy depends on the factors and the weightage given to prepare the map senanayake et al 2016 the accuracy of analytical hierarchy process also depends on similar endeavors of assigning appropriate weights to the factors however frequency ratio is the ratio between incidence to the available area in this study lithology geomorphology and slope are the prime influential factor of groundwater potential in case of if and ahp models the study of magesh et al 2012 and razandi et al 2015 also demonstrates similar ranking where these components are given the highest weights the consistency ratio cr is 0 04 which indicates considerably good accuracy of the ahp model in the pair wise comparison matrix all the resultant maps constructed through if ahp and fr techniques show that the western section of the vaitarna basin near coastal area are having very good groundwater potential and this is common in case of all three models however comparing the area distribution with different potential zones indicate the map derived through if technique is comprising a very large area where the probability of groundwater is high in contrast ahp and fr shows that high probability of groundwater is confined only in coastal regions fig 7 area distribution for moderate and low groundwater probability is almost identical for all the three methods if technique shows a considerably low area distribution compared to the ahp and fr models although all these three approaches provide fairly accurate results it is always better to follow statistical approaches such as ahp or fr compared to the selective if method as the level of accuracy depends on user based ranking in if technique earlier influencing factor method has been implemented to map groundwater potential zones in numerous studies which are considerably accurate magesh et al 2012 nag and ray 2015 das et al 2017 additionally if method is the simplest user based ranking method which consume very less time to get a fair result several previous studies reported that frequency ratio model is a reliable and effective approach for groundwater potential mapping oh et al 2011 manap et al 2012 razandi et al 2015 in addition the performance of ahp technique is also found highly efficient in various researches li et al 2009 nazari et al 2012 das 2018 according to jha et al 2010 pourghasemi et al 2013 kaliraj et al 2014 and razandi et al 2015 ahp approach coupled with gis is an expert knowledge based technique which is capable of solving complex decision related problems 4 4 validation the most important processes to check the accuracy of any model lies in the validation of the results without validation the models are not much significant scientifically chung and fabbri 2003 several methods are widely used to validate groundwater potential maps such as receiver operating characteristics roc analysis area under curve auc groundwater yield estimation of wells during field visits etc pradhan 2009 mohammady et al 2012 pourghasemi et al 2013 regmi et al 2014 in this study comparison between influence factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy processes is done through plotting the cumulative areas under different groundwater zones and the cumulative number of wells available in each potential region based on the graph area under curve auc has been calculated the influencing factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process show the auc value of 71 75 and 70 respectively fig 8 a razandi et al 2015 reported similar observations that in their study fr is the most accurate and efficient model compared to the ahp and certainty factor models even the report shows that the auc value of fr is about 77 followed by ahp auc 73 therefore there is a strong agreement that performance of frequency ratio is the most accurate compared to ahp and if the study of das and pardeshi 2018c also reveals that the performance of fr is greater than the selective and knowledge based influencing factor model in addition the present study agrees the report given by rahmati et al 2014 which shows a gis ahp coupled groundwater potential mapping in iran finally it can be expressed that all the models applied in this study are showing a reasonably good accuracy furthermore number of wells within each groundwater potential zone have been plotted to compare all these models fig 8 b moreover the resultant maps are validated with the groundwater yield data provided by central groundwater board cgwb report in is observed that wells located in the eastern regions near to the western ghat generally having very low yield 0 5 lps and increasing towards coast 2 5 lps apart from auc and yield data groundwater potential map can also be validated by examining seasonal groundwater fluctuation data of an area generally regions with higher fluctuation indicates seasonal groundwater vulnerability in this study 20 different well s water depth bgl data have been collected from wris portal http www india wris nrsc gov in for the period of 2016 2017 based on the groundwater depth data three seasonal groundwater maps have been prepared i e pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon fig 9 illustrates the spatial variability of groundwater depth during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons in vaitarna basin it can be observed that during all seasons the coastal lowland region is having homogeneous groundwater depth notice the swath plot of groundwater depth in fig 9 however a greater variability is found in the central region where the groundwater potential is medium to low in the central region during monsoon the water depth is near to the surface but as monsoon retreats and season becomes dry the groundwater depth declines significantly which creates groundwater scarceness in case of eastern most region the groundwater fluctuation rate again decreases as a large water reservoir is found in this region which play a role to the groundwater availability during dry seasons notice the maps prepared through if and ahp techniques in fig 7 from above discussion it can be clearly understood that the groundwater potential maps predicted in this study are indicating a very high level of accuracy therefore the resultant maps generated in this study can assist for artificial recharge planning and other similar groundwater management in vaitarna basin 5 conclusion demarcation of groundwater potential zones in vaitarna basin maharashtra is carried out by using influencing factor frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy process models in gis environment researchers have emphasized that present days remote sensing and gis tools are the most cost and time effective tools for groundwater studies the groundwater potentiality of a region depends on direct and indirect influence of several environmental factors total nine layers of different factors such as geology geomorphology slope drainage density land use lineament density rainfall soil texture and depth are integrated together with gis and resultant maps are generated three way validation is performed in this study to check the accuracy of resultant groundwater potential maps a total 302 wells are identified for validation of each model using area under the curve auc analysis the auc for frequency ratio model is 75 followed by 71 and 70 for influencing factor and ahp respectively hence the performance of fr model is considerably higher than if and ahp model if and ahp methods depend on the assignment of a relative score according to their importance which requires considerable knowledge of the factors by contrast frequency ratio is easier and accurate which do not depend on user based scoring to the different factors the groundwater potential maps indicate that the coastal regions are having higher groundwater potential in contrast to the central and eastern section of vaitarna basin which is efficiently supported by groundwater yield data and the groundwater fluctuation maps apart from the significant results the present study is highly valuable towards groundwater planning management and artificial recharge projects in vaitarna basin maharashtra acknowledgement the author wishes to thank all the faculty members of department of geography savitribai phule pune university for providing necessary facilities to carry out this study

endeavours should be made to instate sub surface water pre eminence as securely as feasible in spite of colossal significance of sub surface water in north eastern haryana few investigations were conducted on assessment of sub surface water pre eminence hence there is an intense demand to assess the sub surface water pre eminence for a superior picture of the perspective of sub surface water system so as to efficiently utilise this resource for ensuring long term sustainability in domestic agriculture and industrial purposes studies have proved that pre eminence of sub surface water in north eastern haryana is in huge risk that exigency instant consideration the finding development and monograph of sub surface water resources are still emerging the study though at the preliminary level gives a reasonably deep insight into the quality of groundwater of the north eastern areas of the state of haryana 2 description of the study area north eastern region of the state of haryana has been identified as the study region for monitoring and analysing the sub surface water haryana state extends between 74º27 to 77º36 e longitude and 27 39 to 30 35 n latitude with just 1 37 percent of the total geographical region and less than 2 percent of india s population haryana is mainly an agrarian economy with a growing base of industrialization urbanization tourism and commercialism backed technology in addition the province has a good fosse network for irrigation such as jawahar lal nehru canal jui canal bhakra canal western yamuna canal agra canal and gurgaon canal politically the study area forms districts of yamunanagar and ambala the geo graphical position of the concerned n e area in the province of haryana is shown via fig 1 river yamuna which is perennial runs along the north eastern boundary of the state besides stream ghaggar markanda tangri and beghna are running through the study region the natural slope of the ground is from north east to south west the sub surface water investigation manifested the impendence of 03 aquifer clusters down to a depth of 450 m consist of kankar with occasional gravel clay silt and fine to medium grained sand the average elevation of the region from the mean sea level is 245 m 255 m out of the total geographical region of 3330 sq km of the districts about 1990 sq km is irrigated by tube wells bore wells cgwb 2012 the major water bearing formation of the ground is alluvium sand and gravel ground water exploration has been carried out in various phases and so far 33 exploratory wells 07 slim holes and 28 piezometers have been constructed in the districts cgwb 2012 for monitoring of groundwater 30 numbers of wells have been drilled by cgwb with ranges of depth 27 5 m 460 m discharge 248 4800 lpm storativity 1 39

anthropogenic activities enhanced population and inappropriate drainage system have potential to impact the sub surface water pre eminence in the current perusal an effort has made to carry out extensive and orderly analysis of chemical elements of sub surface water and thus the study shall help the researchers water managers morality creators and policy makers to take appropriate remedies towards statue of safe drinking water to the human being 3 methodology the present study is a field cum laboratory study covering 30 sites in the yamunanagar and ambala districts first set of samples were collected during april 2017 and these were categorised as pre monsoon samples to obtain good water sampling representation over the study region the sampling sites were handpicked with an objective to cover commercial residential agricultural and industrial regions and with an element of discretion the water samples were collected directly from hand pumps tube wells after running the aqua for about three to 5 min to ascertain that sub surface aqua to be sampled was demonstrative of sub surface aqua aquifer aqua samples to detect the presence of hydro chemical parameters were collected in precleaned sterilized poly ethylene bottles of 01 l capacity each the groundwater samples were brought to the laboratory for detailed physico chemical appraisals the groundwater samples were mainly analyzed in the environmental laboratory of national institute of technology kurukshetra also some tests were conducted in the public health department laboratory of kurukshetra the physico chemical appraisal was done following analytical standard techniques apha 2005 the details of the sampling sites and methods are presented in fig 1 and tables 1 3 before analysing the data the accuracy of the hydro chemical appraisal was identified by computing ion balance error ibe in meq l using aqua chem software where the percent error in most of the water samples was generally below 5 for the pre monsoon period 14 different parameters comprising of hydro chemical elements heavy metals and the resultant analytical parameters were tested analysed and presented in an easily comprehensible format 4 results and discussion data of physico chemical elements 13 and metal ions 01 for the water samples from 30 sites in districts yamunanagar and ambala during the pre monsoon period of year 2017 is presented in table 2 co3 and cr were also appraised for all groundwater samples however due to the continuous absence in the groundwater samples of the study region they have not been included for any further discussion in the present study the table also gives the mean sd standard deviation and cv coefficient of variation of the dataset for the sake of ready reference the desirable limits as per the who world health organization and bis bureau of indian standards have also been included in the same table for discussion and analysis of the results the 14 parameters have been categorised as hydro chemical elements 09 cations 04 anions 05 analytical parameters 04 heavy metals 01 4 1 cations calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k have been considered and discussed under this head calcium ca 2 calcium is most profusion element in the sub surface water it may dissolve readily from lime stones caco3 and carbonate co3 2 rocks or may be leached from soils in humans it is important for proper functioning of nervous system cardiac function and in coagulation of blood khurshid and basheer 1998 it aids in maintaining the structure of soils and plant cells and a low level of ca in drinking aqua may cause hazards of osteoporosis stroke and hypertension defective teeth and rickets nephrolithiasis kidney stones colorectal cancer obesity insulin resistance and coronary artery ailment the desirable range of ca2 in drinking aqua is 75 mg per litre as represented in fig 2 bis 2003 however upto 200 mg l the sample can pass off to be within the permissible range in sub surface water of the perusal region the concentrations of ca2 range from 36 to 188 mg l nearly 40 of the groundwater samples of the perusal region fall below the desirable range of 75 mg per litre and the remaining 56 67 of the groundwater samples traversed the acceptable range but were well within the allowable range specified for drinking one odd groundwater sample of the perusal region with a ca2 level of 212 mg l exceeded the maximal allowable stipulated level of 200 mg l for ca2 this sample had been collected from the matedi bus stand of ambala magnesium mg 2 magnesium is a moderately toxic element and its concentration in water is comparatively lesser than that of calcium if its concentration in drinking water is high in which case its combination with sulphate results in laxative effect investigations have also shown that for persons living in hard water areas magnesium and potassium are significantly increased in heart muscles whereas the ratio of mg2 and k is usually low in person from soft water areas it is a constituent of bones it is necessary for normal metabolism of calcium its scarcity may cause to protein energy malnutrition the acceptable and allowable range of mg2 in drinking aqua is 30 mg per litre and 100 mg per litre respectively as shown in fig 3 bis 2003 in the region under observation the concentrations of mg2 varied from 4 8 to 88 8 mg per litre nearly 46 67 of the groundwater samples fall well within the acceptable range of 30 mg per litre and the remaining 53 33 of the groundwater samples though exceed the acceptable range yet are below the maximum permissible range and hence are acceptable for drinking no groundwater sample of the perusal region exceeded the maximal allowable range stipulated for mg2 in the water samples of the pre monsoon season sodium na sodium salts are found in all food and drinking water na salts are normally highly soluble in aqua and are leached from the terrestrial atmosphere to sub surface aqua although it is normally agreed that na is important to the people there is no agreement on the minimal daily need who 2003 na is accountable for maintaining for the normal osmotic pressure in cells normally na salts are not acutely toxic because of the efficiency with which mature kidneys excrete na however on the basis of existing dataset no substantial conclusions have been drawn concerning the presumable association between the occurrence of hyper tension and na in drinking aqua who 2003 no well being rooted standard level is therefore specified by who however na may influence the taste of drinking aqua at values above about 200 mg per litre who 2011 the content of na is quite high in the perusal region and for the pre monsoon season it has been observed to be varying from 8 5 to 97 9 mg l as presented in fig 4 potassium k potassium is an important element for humans and occurs widely in all natural waters it is much copious in feculent or sedimentary rocks and normally exists in at4o8 feldspar xy2 3z4o10 oh f 2 mica and another marl or clay minerals it is a co factor for many enzymes it is required for the carbohydrate metabolism creatinine phosphorylation protein synthesis and secretion of insulin it also maintains the normal osmotic pressure in cells concentrations of k found in drinking water are normally low and do not pose any health problem adverse effects may also occur when k intake from drinking aqua is well below the value at which adverse well being influences may occur however it is not considered essential to establish a well being rooted standard level for k in drinking aqua due to its occurrence in drinking aqua at levels well below those of well being concern who 2011 the concentration of k in the present observations was also quite low and varied from 0 to 20 9 mg per litre as shown in fig 5 neither bis nor who has specified any limits for specified any limits for acceptance of drinking water vis a vis concentration of potassium the eec eec 1980 has stipulated the standard scale of k at 10 mg l in drinking aqua by this yardstick all the samples except sample numbers 10 16 and 18 while 10 is in yamunanagar and 16 and 18 are in ambala district of the perusal region come within the standard scale of 10 mg per litre the failed samples though account for only 10 of the total samples yet the highest concentration of 20 90 mg l at sample no 16 is certainly not acceptable 4 2 anions chloride cl fluoride f sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 and bicarbonate hco3 have been considered and discussed under this head chloride cl it is an anion that occurs naturally in water chloride may originate from diverse sources such as intrusion of sea water weathering and leaching of sedimentary rocks etc the most important source of chlorides in the waters is the discharge of domestic sewage mohanraj et al 2000 and shanthi et al 2002 it produces salty taste in the range of 250 500 mg l the cl level in sub surface water of districts yamunanagar and ambala is low and has been observed to be varying from 56 8 to 766 8 mg l as shown in fig 6 two samples in the perusal region cross the maximum desirable range of 250 mg per litre a range of 250 mg per litre cl has been suggested as maximal acceptable range for drinking aqua supplies bis 2003 who 2011 notwithstanding no bad well being impacts on humans have been observed from intake of aqua inclusive an even higher concentration of cl fluoride f in sub surface water f values vary with the type of rock the aqua runs via various epidemiological investigations of presumable adverse impacts of the long term ingestion of fluorides through drinking aqua have been carried out that install effects of fluorides on bones and teeth skeletal tissues low contents of f endow protection against dental abrosia in children however f can also have an adverse influence on tooth enamel f may also give increase to mild dental fluorosis at drinking aqua levels between 0 9 and 1 2 mg per litre dean 1942 levels above 1 5 mg per litre carry an amplifying hazard of dental fluorosis and much elevated levels account to skeletal fluorosis for the samples collected during the pre monsoon period of 2017 the fluoride content of the two districts yamunanagar and ambala varies from a minimum of 0 14 mg l to 1 65 mg l as shown in fig 7 about 93 33 of the samples of the perusal region come below the maximal desirable range of 1 0 mg l two samples of the total data traverse the desirable range where as one of these two fall within the maximal permissible value of 1 5 mg per litre the other crossed this value sulphate so 4 2 the so4 2 level in sub surface water commonly occurs as dissoluble salts of ca2 mg2 and na the so4 2 level transforms emphatically with time during intrusion of precipitation and sub surface aqua recharge which frequently takes place from still static aqua furrows and surface runoff aqua accumulated in low lying regions jain et al 2009 the level of so4 in the perusal region varied from 18 to 460 mg l as shown in fig 8 about 93 33 of the samples of the perusal region come below the maximal desirable range of 200 mg per litre nearly 3 33 of the samples traverse the maximum desirable range but are within the maximal allowable range of 400 mg l one groundwater sample location 23 of the perusal region traversed the maximal allowable range of 400 mg l nitrate no 3 no3 concentration in drinking aqua is assumed significant owing to its adverse well being impacts jain et al 2009 no3 is a dominant rooter nutritive and is moderately toxin an upper range of 45 mg l has been imposed by who 2011 and bis 2003 for safe drinking aqua supplies its levels above 45 mg per litre may turn hazardous to human well being presence of no3 in high levels may cause an ailment called blue babies methaemoglobinaemia which commonly harms bottle fed babies encored heavy quantities of no3 on swallowing may also account carcinogenetic ailments the nitrate content in districts yamunanagar and ambala varied from 0 4 to 2 7 mg per litre as shown in fig 9 with all samples declining below the maximum acceptable range of 45 mg per litre as such the sub surface aqua of districts yamunanagar and ambala does not cause any no3 danger to humans bicarbonate hco 3 co3 and hco3 in aqua are present principally in association with ca2 and mg2 hco3 describes the main form because they are made in adequate quantity from the action of co3 2 upon the basic materials in the soil jain et al 2009 it presents only in aqueous solution containing the co3 hco3 and ca ions together with dissolved co2 the relative values of these carbons containing species rely on the ph hco3 pre dominates within the limit 6 35 10 26 in clean aqua all aqua in contact with the environment absorb co2 and as these aqua come into contact with sediments and rocks they acquire metal ions most commonly ca and mg so most natural aqua that come from lakes rivers and especially dug wells tube wells can be regarded as dilute solutions of these hco3 they are more susceptible to hardness these hard aquas tend to form co3 scale in boilers and pipes and they react with soaps to form an unacceptable scum neither bis nor who has specified any limits for acceptance of drinking water vis a vis concentration of bicarbonate hco3 content varied from 244 to 1061 4 mg per litre as represented in fig 10 the ratio maximum minimum of hco3 is greater than 4 35 about 40 of the samples of the perusal region come below the range of 500 mg per litre about 56 67 of the groundwater samples crossed the value of 500 mg per litre but were within the range of 1000 mg per litre one groundwater sample location 22 of the perusal region traverses the range of 1000 mg l 4 3 analytical parameters besides the discussion on regular cations and anions certain analytical elements like ph total dissolved solids tds total alkalinity ta and total hardness th which give an insight of the quality of water have been considered and discussed under this head the hydrogen ion activity ph ph is a significant parameter in appraising the pre eminence of aqua and is applied to manifest the intensity of alkaline or acidic conditions alkaline conditions will prevail as the ph value increases and acidic conditions will prevail as ph value decreases ph levels in the sub surface water of districts yamunanagar and ambala are mostly confined within the range 7 07 8 12 fig 11 the ph levels of most of the groundwater samples are good as they are within the ranges fixed by bureau of indian standards 2003 and world health organization 2011 for different purposes of aqua including drinking and the other household applications the outcomes shown that all the groundwater samples were within allowable ranges of 8 5 total dissolved solids tds the mensuration of tds is directly concerned with the level of ionized material in aqua and may also be concerned to issues of intense hardness and or another mining pollution in ordinary waters tds consists primely of inorganic salts such as so4 cl hco3 co3 and no3 of k na mg ca fe etc and a little quantity of organic substance and decomposed gases water inclusive tds greater than 500 mg l originates gastrointestinal exasperation bureau of indian standard 2003 in the current study the concentrations of total dissolved solids in the sub surface aqua varied from 220 to 2770 pointing inferior mineralization in the region in common the total dissolved solids levels are high in aqua samples in the season due to high residence period respectively nearly 36 67 of the samples examined were observed below the maximum acceptable range of 500 mg per litre while nearly 60 of the groundwater samples were observed beyond the maximum acceptable range but within the maximal allowable range of 2000 mg per litre and the remaining about 3 33 of the groundwater samples were observed above the allowable range of 2000 mg per litre the total dissolved solids content at profound strata 115 feet deepness is relatively less in all the groundwater samples and fall below and within the maximum acceptable range of 500 mg per litre so it may be educed that there is less mineralization of sub surface water upto a depth of 115 feet the total dissolved solids trace appraisal graphs for the pre monsoon season are demonstrated in fig 12 water inclusive greater than 500 mg per litre of total dissolved solids is not reckoned acceptable for drinking aqua supplies although at times much large mineralized aqua is also consumed where superior aqua is not present one sample of district ambala traversed the maximal allowable range of 2000 mg l total alkalinity ta the huge ta concentrations at some places may be due to the action of co3 2 upon the base paraphernalia s in the soil ca2 and mg2 along with their co3 2 so4 2 and cl make the aqua hard jain et al 2009 a total alkalinity desirable range of 200 mg l has been suggested for drinkable water bureau of indian standards 2003 the impendence of co3 2 hco3 and oh are the major problem of salinity in natural waters ta value in the sub surface aqua varied from 200 to 870 mg per litre as caco3 3 33 of the samples of the perusal region come within the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg per litre nearly 80 of the groundwater samples traversed the maximum desirable range but were within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre five samples of the perusal region traverse the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre ta trace concentration graphs are represented in fig 13 total hardness th hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and cl of ca2 and mg2 are mainly contributed the th so the principal th causing ions are ca2 and mg2 the acceptable range of total hardness is 200 mg l conventionally total hardness is expressed as caco3 equivalent in mg l and equal to the sum of the ca h calcium hardness ca reported as caco3 equivalent and mg h magnesium hardness mg2 reported as caco3 equivalent as calcium magnesium and total hardness should lied with a maximal desirable error of 2 9 edta titration method 2340 c it revealed that the dataset were inside the desirable error limit the th concentrations in the perusal region extend from 120 to 900 mg l as caco3 in normal the th concentrations are varying in aqua samplers in the season as obvious from the outcomes nearly 6 66 of the groundwater samples come within the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg l the rest 76 66 of the groundwater samples increased the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg per litre but were well within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre about 13 33 of the groundwater samples fall below the acceptable range of 200 mg per litre one sample of the perusal region location 23 traverses the maximal allowable range of 600 mg l the th trace concentration graph for the pre monsoon season is represented in fig 14 4 4 heavy metals the behaviour of sub surface aqua by metal ions has received significant attention during last decades due to their venomousness and accumulative behaviour accordingly in the present study also have been considered and discussed in the under mentioned paragraphs iron fe elemental fe is rarely observed in atmosphere as the fe ions fe3 and fe2 readily combine with sulphur and oxygen containing compounds to form carbonates sulphides hydroxides and oxides fe is most commonly observed in environment in the form of its oxides knepper 1981 elinder 1986 huge values of fe normally produce sable gustatory bitter and astringent relish it can also descend fabrics piping fitments and account scaling which encrusts pipes ample level may encourage germinal activities in duct and service mains or major tap producing catastrophic odour and scarlet ailment in aqua the level of fe in sub surface aqua of districts yamunanagar and ambala varied from 0 01 to 1 41 mg per litre fig 15 the bis has suggested 0 3 mg per litre as the maximal acceptable range and 1 0 mg per litre as the maximal allowable range for drinking aqua bureau of indian standards 2003 it is obvious from the outcomes that nearly 93 33 of the samples come below the maximum desirable range of 0 3 mg l and hence are acceptable for drinking water two samples of the perusal region location 8 and 27 even exceed the maximal allowable range of 1 0 mg l nearly 16 67 sources hand pumps of the specimen is greater than the mean x 0 1370 and the remaining 83 34 of the samples is less than the mean such aaqua should be treated for fe expulsion prior to being consumed for domestic utilities 5 benchmarking of water samples the benchmarking of the results of the water samples has been done with the help of a piper diagram b gibbs plot 5 1 piper trilinear diagram one diagram namely piper trilinear diagram 1944 fig 16 has been applied in the current study to assess the hydro chemical facies the trilinear figure links three regions two trigonal regions one each of anions and cations and one intervening sparkler shaped region mixed zone it is a dominant technique in segregating appraisal dataset with respect to sources of the mixed elements in sub surface aqua modifications in the properties of aqua as it crosses via a region and concerned hydro geochemical issues piper 1944 effectively it represents proportionality in the chemistry of aqua rooted on primary anions and cations hydro chemical dataset of representative groundwater samples from the study region are represented by delineating them on the piper plot for pre monsoon period the diagram showed that most of the sub surface water samples fall in the field of mixed ca2 mg2 hco3 cl type of aqua fig 16 some groundwater samples have also represented na cl and ca cl types from the diagram it is easy to observe that calcium and magnesium alkaline earths significantly exceeded the sodium and potassium alkalis and bicarbonates and carbonates weak acids exceeded the chloride and sulphate strong acids 5 2 gibbs plot the gibbs plot is widely applied to determine the relationship of aquifer litho logical characteristics and aqua composition gibbs 1970 it comprises of three separate regions i e water rock interaction dominance evaporation dominance and rainfall dominance regions fig 17 the results of the present study when superimposed on the typical gibbs showed a heavy bias in the water rock interaction dominance region the pre dominant groundwater samples fall in the water rock interaction dominance and few groundwater samples evaporation dominance region of the gibbs plot the water rock interaction dominance region indicated the interaction between chemistry of the rock and the percolation aqua chemistry under the ground gibbs proportion i for anion cl cl hco3 gibbs proportion ii for cation na k na k ca2 recommendations in light of the prevailing situation in the study region though broadly the groundwater samples have been reported to be satisfactory in majority of the sampling sites yet there are about 25 sites which have one or the other element to be existing in undesirable quantity therefore it is recommended that the location no 23 hand pump at matedi bus stand should be abandoned the water samples of eight sites namely 8 19 22 23 24 27 29 and 30 need to be rechecked and if confirmed the water should be treated by suitable means continuous monitoring and maintenance of the remaining sites so as to ensure provision of good quality water to the inhabitants of the ambala and yamunanagar districts 6 conclusions a field cum laboratory study has been conducted for the study area of district yamunanagar and ambala and collection and detection of certain chemical elements and heavy metals has been carried out 30 sampling locations 15 each in the two districts were identified and studied the conclusions drawn from the results and their discussion are as follows a all the four cations

endeavours should be made to instate sub surface water pre eminence as securely as feasible in spite of colossal significance of sub surface water in north eastern haryana few investigations were conducted on assessment of sub surface water pre eminence hence there is an intense demand to assess the sub surface water pre eminence for a superior picture of the perspective of sub surface water system so as to efficiently utilise this resource for ensuring long term sustainability in domestic agriculture and industrial purposes studies have proved that pre eminence of sub surface water in north eastern haryana is in huge risk that exigency instant consideration the finding development and monograph of sub surface water resources are still emerging the study though at the preliminary level gives a reasonably deep insight into the quality of groundwater of the north eastern areas of the state of haryana 2 description of the study area north eastern region of the state of haryana has been identified as the study region for monitoring and analysing the sub surface water haryana state extends between 74º27 to 77º36 e longitude and 27 39 to 30 35 n latitude with just 1 37 percent of the total geographical region and less than 2 percent of india s population haryana is mainly an agrarian economy with a growing base of industrialization urbanization tourism and commercialism backed technology in addition the province has a good fosse network for irrigation such as jawahar lal nehru canal jui canal bhakra canal western yamuna canal agra canal and gurgaon canal politically the study area forms districts of yamunanagar and ambala the geo graphical position of the concerned n e area in the province of haryana is shown via fig 1 river yamuna which is perennial runs along the north eastern boundary of the state besides stream ghaggar markanda tangri and beghna are running through the study region the natural slope of the ground is from north east to south west the sub surface water investigation manifested the impendence of 03 aquifer clusters down to a depth of 450 m consist of kankar with occasional gravel clay silt and fine to medium grained sand the average elevation of the region from the mean sea level is 245 m 255 m out of the total geographical region of 3330 sq km of the districts about 1990 sq km is irrigated by tube wells bore wells cgwb 2012 the major water bearing formation of the ground is alluvium sand and gravel ground water exploration has been carried out in various phases and so far 33 exploratory wells 07 slim holes and 28 piezometers have been constructed in the districts cgwb 2012 for monitoring of groundwater 30 numbers of wells have been drilled by cgwb with ranges of depth 27 5 m 460 m discharge 248 4800 lpm storativity 1 39 10 4 2 1 10 2 and transmissivity 154 4900 m2 day cgwb 2012 the sub surface water pre eminence of the perusal region is contrarily influenced by the industrialization and urbanization and other anthropogenic activities enhanced population and inappropriate drainage system have potential to impact the sub surface water pre eminence in the current perusal an effort has made to carry out extensive and orderly analysis of chemical elements of sub surface water and thus the study shall help the researchers water managers morality creators and policy makers to take appropriate remedies towards statue of safe drinking water to the human being 3 methodology the present study is a field cum laboratory study covering 30 sites in the yamunanagar and ambala districts first set of samples were collected during april 2017 and these were categorised as pre monsoon samples to obtain good water sampling representation over the study region the sampling sites were handpicked with an objective to cover commercial residential agricultural and industrial regions and with an element of discretion the water samples were collected directly from hand pumps tube wells after running the aqua for about three to 5 min to ascertain that sub surface aqua to be sampled was demonstrative of sub surface aqua aquifer aqua samples to detect the presence of hydro chemical parameters were collected in precleaned sterilized poly ethylene bottles of 01 l capacity each the groundwater samples were brought to the laboratory for detailed physico chemical appraisals the groundwater samples were mainly analyzed in the environmental laboratory of national institute of technology kurukshetra also some tests were conducted in the public health department laboratory of kurukshetra the physico chemical appraisal was done following analytical standard techniques apha 2005 the details of the sampling sites and methods are presented in fig 1 and tables 1 3 before analysing the data the accuracy of the hydro chemical appraisal was identified by computing ion balance error ibe in meq l using aqua chem software where the percent error in most of the water samples was generally below 5 for the pre monsoon period 14 different parameters comprising of hydro chemical elements heavy metals and the resultant analytical parameters were tested analysed and presented in an easily comprehensible format 4 results and discussion data of physico chemical elements 13 and metal ions 01 for the water samples from 30 sites in districts yamunanagar and ambala during the pre monsoon period of year 2017 is presented in table 2 co3 and cr were also appraised for all groundwater samples however due to the continuous absence in the groundwater samples of the study region they have not been included for any further discussion in the present study the table also gives the mean sd standard deviation and cv coefficient of variation of the dataset for the sake of ready reference the desirable limits as per the who world health organization and bis bureau of indian standards have also been included in the same table for discussion and analysis of the results the 14 parameters have been categorised as hydro chemical elements 09 cations 04 anions 05 analytical parameters 04 heavy metals 01 4 1 cations calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k have been considered and discussed under this head calcium ca 2 calcium is most profusion element in the sub surface water it may dissolve readily from lime stones caco3 and carbonate co3 2 rocks or may be leached from soils in humans it is important for proper functioning of nervous system cardiac function and in coagulation of blood khurshid and basheer 1998 it aids in maintaining the structure of soils and plant cells and a low level of ca in drinking aqua may cause hazards of osteoporosis stroke and hypertension defective teeth and rickets nephrolithiasis kidney stones colorectal cancer obesity insulin resistance and coronary artery ailment the desirable range of ca2 in drinking aqua is 75 mg per litre as represented in fig 2 bis 2003 however upto 200 mg l the sample can pass off to be within the permissible range in sub surface water of the perusal region the concentrations of ca2 range from 36 to 188 mg l nearly 40 of the groundwater samples of the perusal region fall below the desirable range of 75 mg per litre and the remaining 56 67 of the groundwater samples traversed the acceptable range but were well within the allowable range specified for drinking one odd groundwater sample of the perusal region with a ca2 level of 212 mg l exceeded the maximal allowable stipulated level of 200 mg l for ca2 this sample had been collected from the matedi bus stand of ambala magnesium mg 2 magnesium is a moderately toxic element and its concentration in water is comparatively lesser than that of calcium if its concentration in drinking water is high in which case its combination with sulphate results in laxative effect investigations have also shown that for persons living in hard water areas magnesium and potassium are significantly increased in heart muscles whereas the ratio of mg2 and k is usually low in person from soft water areas it is a constituent of bones it is necessary for normal metabolism of calcium its scarcity may cause to protein energy malnutrition the acceptable and allowable range of mg2 in drinking aqua is 30 mg per litre and 100 mg per litre respectively as shown in fig 3 bis 2003 in the region under observation the concentrations of mg2 varied from 4 8 to 88 8 mg per litre nearly 46 67 of the groundwater samples fall well within the acceptable range of 30 mg per litre and the remaining 53 33 of the groundwater samples though exceed the acceptable range yet are below the maximum permissible range and hence are acceptable for drinking no groundwater sample of the perusal region exceeded the maximal allowable range stipulated for mg2 in the water samples of the pre monsoon season sodium na sodium salts are found in all food and drinking water na salts are normally highly soluble in aqua and are leached from the terrestrial atmosphere to sub surface aqua although it is normally agreed that na is important to the people there is no agreement on the minimal daily need who 2003 na is accountable for maintaining for the normal osmotic pressure in cells normally na salts are not acutely toxic because of the efficiency with which mature kidneys excrete na however on the basis of existing dataset no substantial conclusions have been drawn concerning the presumable association between the occurrence of hyper tension and na in drinking aqua who 2003 no well being rooted standard level is therefore specified by who however na may influence the taste of drinking aqua at values above about 200 mg per litre who 2011 the content of na is quite high in the perusal region and for the pre monsoon season it has been observed to be varying from 8 5 to 97 9 mg l as presented in fig 4 potassium k potassium is an important element for humans and occurs widely in all natural waters it is much copious in feculent or sedimentary rocks and normally exists in at4o8 feldspar xy2 3z4o10 oh f 2 mica and another marl or clay minerals it is a co factor for many enzymes it is required for the carbohydrate metabolism creatinine phosphorylation protein synthesis and secretion of insulin it also maintains the normal osmotic pressure in cells concentrations of k found in drinking water are normally low and do not pose any health problem adverse effects may also occur when k intake from drinking aqua is well below the value at which adverse well being influences may occur however it is not considered essential to establish a well being rooted standard level for k in drinking aqua due to its occurrence in drinking aqua at levels well below those of well being concern who 2011 the concentration of k in the present observations was also quite low and varied from 0 to 20 9 mg per litre as shown in fig 5 neither bis nor who has specified any limits for specified any limits for acceptance of drinking water vis a vis concentration of potassium the eec eec 1980 has stipulated the standard scale of k at 10 mg l in drinking aqua by this yardstick all the samples except sample numbers 10 16 and 18 while 10 is in yamunanagar and 16 and 18 are in ambala district of the perusal region come within the standard scale of 10 mg per litre the failed samples though account for only 10 of the total samples yet the highest concentration of 20 90 mg l at sample no 16 is certainly not acceptable 4 2 anions chloride cl fluoride f sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 and bicarbonate hco3 have been considered and discussed under this head chloride cl it is an anion that occurs naturally in water chloride may originate from diverse sources such as intrusion of sea water weathering and leaching of sedimentary rocks etc the most important source of chlorides in the waters is the discharge of domestic sewage mohanraj et al 2000 and shanthi et al 2002 it produces salty taste in the range of 250 500 mg l the cl level in sub surface water of districts yamunanagar and ambala is low and has been observed to be varying from 56 8 to 766 8 mg l as shown in fig 6 two samples in the perusal region cross the maximum desirable range of 250 mg per litre a range of 250 mg per litre cl has been suggested as maximal acceptable range for drinking aqua supplies bis 2003 who 2011 notwithstanding no bad well being impacts on humans have been observed from intake of aqua inclusive an even higher concentration of cl fluoride f in sub surface water f values vary with the type of rock the aqua runs via various epidemiological investigations of presumable adverse impacts of the long term ingestion of fluorides through drinking aqua have been carried out that install effects of fluorides on bones and teeth skeletal tissues low contents of f endow protection against dental abrosia in children however f can also have an adverse influence on tooth enamel f may also give increase to mild dental fluorosis at drinking aqua levels between 0 9 and 1 2 mg per litre dean 1942 levels above 1 5 mg per litre carry an amplifying hazard of dental fluorosis and much elevated levels account to skeletal fluorosis for the samples collected during the pre monsoon period of 2017 the fluoride content of the two districts yamunanagar and ambala varies from a minimum of 0 14 mg l to 1 65 mg l as shown in fig 7 about 93 33 of the samples of the perusal region come below the maximal desirable range of 1 0 mg l two samples of the total data traverse the desirable range where as one of these two fall within the maximal permissible value of 1 5 mg per litre the other crossed this value sulphate so 4 2 the so4 2 level in sub surface water commonly occurs as dissoluble salts of ca2 mg2 and na the so4 2 level transforms emphatically with time during intrusion of precipitation and sub surface aqua recharge which frequently takes place from still static aqua furrows and surface runoff aqua accumulated in low lying regions jain et al 2009 the level of so4 in the perusal region varied from 18 to 460 mg l as shown in fig 8 about 93 33 of the samples of the perusal region come below the maximal desirable range of 200 mg per litre nearly 3 33 of the samples traverse the maximum desirable range but are within the maximal allowable range of 400 mg l one groundwater sample location 23 of the perusal region traversed the maximal allowable range of 400 mg l nitrate no 3 no3 concentration in drinking aqua is assumed significant owing to its adverse well being impacts jain et al 2009 no3 is a dominant rooter nutritive and is moderately toxin an upper range of 45 mg l has been imposed by who 2011 and bis 2003 for safe drinking aqua supplies its levels above 45 mg per litre may turn hazardous to human well being presence of no3 in high levels may cause an ailment called blue babies methaemoglobinaemia which commonly harms bottle fed babies encored heavy quantities of no3 on swallowing may also account carcinogenetic ailments the nitrate content in districts yamunanagar and ambala varied from 0 4 to 2 7 mg per litre as shown in fig 9 with all samples declining below the maximum acceptable range of 45 mg per litre as such the sub surface aqua of districts yamunanagar and ambala does not cause any no3 danger to humans bicarbonate hco 3 co3 and hco3 in aqua are present principally in association with ca2 and mg2 hco3 describes the main form because they are made in adequate quantity from the action of co3 2 upon the basic materials in the soil jain et al 2009 it presents only in aqueous solution containing the co3 hco3 and ca ions together with dissolved co2 the relative values of these carbons containing species rely on the ph hco3 pre dominates within the limit 6 35 10 26 in clean aqua all aqua in contact with the environment absorb co2 and as these aqua come into contact with sediments and rocks they acquire metal ions most commonly ca and mg so most natural aqua that come from lakes rivers and especially dug wells tube wells can be regarded as dilute solutions of these hco3 they are more susceptible to hardness these hard aquas tend to form co3 scale in boilers and pipes and they react with soaps to form an unacceptable scum neither bis nor who has specified any limits for acceptance of drinking water vis a vis concentration of bicarbonate hco3 content varied from 244 to 1061 4 mg per litre as represented in fig 10 the ratio maximum minimum of hco3 is greater than 4 35 about 40 of the samples of the perusal region come below the range of 500 mg per litre about 56 67 of the groundwater samples crossed the value of 500 mg per litre but were within the range of 1000 mg per litre one groundwater sample location 22 of the perusal region traverses the range of 1000 mg l 4 3 analytical parameters besides the discussion on regular cations and anions certain analytical elements like ph total dissolved solids tds total alkalinity ta and total hardness th which give an insight of the quality of water have been considered and discussed under this head the hydrogen ion activity ph ph is a significant parameter in appraising the pre eminence of aqua and is applied to manifest the intensity of alkaline or acidic conditions alkaline conditions will prevail as the ph value increases and acidic conditions will prevail as ph value decreases ph levels in the sub surface water of districts yamunanagar and ambala are mostly confined within the range 7 07 8 12 fig 11 the ph levels of most of the groundwater samples are good as they are within the ranges fixed by bureau of indian standards 2003 and world health organization 2011 for different purposes of aqua including drinking and the other household applications the outcomes shown that all the groundwater samples were within allowable ranges of 8 5 total dissolved solids tds the mensuration of tds is directly concerned with the level of ionized material in aqua and may also be concerned to issues of intense hardness and or another mining pollution in ordinary waters tds consists primely of inorganic salts such as so4 cl hco3 co3 and no3 of k na mg ca fe etc and a little quantity of organic substance and decomposed gases water inclusive tds greater than 500 mg l originates gastrointestinal exasperation bureau of indian standard 2003 in the current study the concentrations of total dissolved solids in the sub surface aqua varied from 220 to 2770 pointing inferior mineralization in the region in common the total dissolved solids levels are high in aqua samples in the season due to high residence period respectively nearly 36 67 of the samples examined were observed below the maximum acceptable range of 500 mg per litre while nearly 60 of the groundwater samples were observed beyond the maximum acceptable range but within the maximal allowable range of 2000 mg per litre and the remaining about 3 33 of the groundwater samples were observed above the allowable range of 2000 mg per litre the total dissolved solids content at profound strata 115 feet deepness is relatively less in all the groundwater samples and fall below and within the maximum acceptable range of 500 mg per litre so it may be educed that there is less mineralization of sub surface water upto a depth of 115 feet the total dissolved solids trace appraisal graphs for the pre monsoon season are demonstrated in fig 12 water inclusive greater than 500 mg per litre of total dissolved solids is not reckoned acceptable for drinking aqua supplies although at times much large mineralized aqua is also consumed where superior aqua is not present one sample of district ambala traversed the maximal allowable range of 2000 mg l total alkalinity ta the huge ta concentrations at some places may be due to the action of co3 2 upon the base paraphernalia s in the soil ca2 and mg2 along with their co3 2 so4 2 and cl make the aqua hard jain et al 2009 a total alkalinity desirable range of 200 mg l has been suggested for drinkable water bureau of indian standards 2003 the impendence of co3 2 hco3 and oh are the major problem of salinity in natural waters ta value in the sub surface aqua varied from 200 to 870 mg per litre as caco3 3 33 of the samples of the perusal region come within the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg per litre nearly 80 of the groundwater samples traversed the maximum desirable range but were within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre five samples of the perusal region traverse the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre ta trace concentration graphs are represented in fig 13 total hardness th hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and cl of ca2 and mg2 are mainly contributed the th so the principal th causing ions are ca2 and mg2 the acceptable range of total hardness is 200 mg l conventionally total hardness is expressed as caco3 equivalent in mg l and equal to the sum of the ca h calcium hardness ca reported as caco3 equivalent and mg h magnesium hardness mg2 reported as caco3 equivalent as calcium magnesium and total hardness should lied with a maximal desirable error of 2 9 edta titration method 2340 c it revealed that the dataset were inside the desirable error limit the th concentrations in the perusal region extend from 120 to 900 mg l as caco3 in normal the th concentrations are varying in aqua samplers in the season as obvious from the outcomes nearly 6 66 of the groundwater samples come within the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg l the rest 76 66 of the groundwater samples increased the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg per litre but were well within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre about 13 33 of the groundwater samples fall below the acceptable range of 200 mg per litre one sample of the perusal region location 23 traverses the maximal allowable range of 600 mg l the th trace concentration graph for the pre monsoon season is represented in fig 14 4 4 heavy metals the behaviour of sub surface aqua by metal ions has received significant attention during last decades due to their venomousness and accumulative behaviour accordingly in the present study also have been considered and discussed in the under mentioned paragraphs iron fe elemental fe is rarely observed in atmosphere as the fe ions fe3 and fe2 readily combine with sulphur and oxygen containing compounds to form carbonates sulphides hydroxides and oxides fe is most commonly observed in environment in the form of its oxides knepper 1981 elinder 1986 huge values of fe normally produce sable gustatory bitter and astringent relish it can also descend fabrics piping fitments and account scaling which encrusts pipes ample level may encourage germinal activities in duct and service mains or major tap producing catastrophic odour and scarlet ailment in aqua the level of fe in sub surface aqua of districts yamunanagar and ambala varied from 0 01 to 1 41 mg per litre fig 15 the bis has suggested 0 3 mg per litre as the maximal acceptable range and 1 0 mg per litre as the maximal allowable range for drinking aqua bureau of indian standards 2003 it is obvious from the outcomes that nearly 93 33 of the samples come below the maximum desirable range of 0 3 mg l and hence are acceptable for drinking water two samples of the perusal region location 8 and 27 even exceed the maximal allowable range of 1 0 mg l nearly 16 67 sources hand pumps of the specimen is greater than the mean x 0 1370 and the remaining 83 34 of the samples is less than the mean such aaqua should be treated for fe expulsion prior to being consumed for domestic utilities 5 benchmarking of water samples the benchmarking of the results of the water samples has been done with the help of a piper diagram b gibbs plot 5 1 piper trilinear diagram one diagram namely piper trilinear diagram 1944 fig 16 has been applied in the current study to assess the hydro chemical facies the trilinear figure links three regions two trigonal regions one each of anions and cations and one intervening sparkler shaped region mixed zone it is a dominant technique in segregating appraisal dataset with respect to sources of the mixed elements in sub surface aqua modifications in the properties of aqua as it crosses via a region and concerned hydro geochemical issues piper 1944 effectively it represents proportionality in the chemistry of aqua rooted on primary anions and cations hydro chemical dataset of representative groundwater samples from the study region are represented by delineating them on the piper plot for pre monsoon period the diagram showed that most of the sub surface water samples fall in the field of mixed ca2 mg2 hco3 cl type of aqua fig 16 some groundwater samples have also represented na cl and ca cl types from the diagram it is easy to observe that calcium and magnesium alkaline earths significantly exceeded the sodium and potassium alkalis and bicarbonates and carbonates weak acids exceeded the chloride and sulphate strong acids 5 2 gibbs plot the gibbs plot is widely applied to determine the relationship of aquifer litho logical characteristics and aqua composition gibbs 1970 it comprises of three separate regions i e water rock interaction dominance evaporation dominance and rainfall dominance regions fig 17 the results of the present study when superimposed on the typical gibbs showed a heavy bias in the water rock interaction dominance region the pre dominant groundwater samples fall in the water rock interaction dominance and few groundwater samples evaporation dominance region of the gibbs plot the water rock interaction dominance region indicated the interaction between chemistry of the rock and the percolation aqua chemistry under the ground gibbs proportion i for anion cl cl hco3 gibbs proportion ii for cation na k na k ca2 recommendations in light of the prevailing situation in the study region though broadly the groundwater samples have been reported to be satisfactory in majority of the sampling sites yet there are about 25 sites which have one or the other element to be existing in undesirable quantity therefore it is recommended that the location no 23 hand pump at matedi bus stand should be abandoned the water samples of eight sites namely 8 19 22 23 24 27 29 and 30 need to be rechecked and if confirmed the water should be treated by suitable means continuous monitoring and maintenance of the remaining sites so as to ensure provision of good quality water to the inhabitants of the ambala and yamunanagar districts 6 conclusions a field cum laboratory study has been conducted for the study area of district yamunanagar and ambala and collection and detection of certain chemical elements and heavy metals has been carried out 30 sampling locations 15 each in the two districts were identified and studied the conclusions drawn from the results and their discussion are as follows a all the four cations ca2 mg2 na and k show a very large scatter and about 86 67 26 out of 30 of the groundwater samples are within the maximum allowable limit of their presence in the potable water b all the six anions cl f so4 2 no3 co3 2 and hco3 do not show a very large scatter and about 93 33 28 out of 30 of the groundwater samples are within the maximum allowable limit of their presence in the potable water c analytical parameters ph almost all the samples are in the basic zone with all the 30 values falling above the standard value of 7 0 tds tds exceed the maximum desirable range of 500 mg per litre in nearly 60 of the groundwater samples but the concentrations were well within the maximal allowable range of 2000 mg per litre in almost all the groundwater samples ta the ta concentrations exceed the maximum acceptable range of 200 mg per litre in nearly 80 of the groundwater samples but these were within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre th nearly 6 66 of the groundwater samples were within maximal acceptable range and nearly 76 66 samples though exceeded the maximum acceptable range but were within the maximal allowable range of 600 mg per litre d heavy metals fe and cr the value of fe present in water exceeds the maximum allowable range in only two samples which may be attributed to few localised factors the presence of chromium was not detected in any of the samples of the perusal region e location 23 matedi bus stand has been observed to be adversely affected by excess of ca2 so4 2 tds ta and th the values of total hardness total alkalinity total dissolved solids sulphate and calcium were 900 mg per litre 740 mg per litre 2770 mg per litre 460 mg per litre and 212 mg per litre respectively matedi bus stand site number 23 suffers from undesirable limits of five elements and is declared to be falling in the red zone f besides location 23 there are seven sampling sites nos 8 19 22 24 27 29 and 30 which are suffering from one element and hence are categorised to be falling in grey zone remaining sites have been found to be safe g based on hydro chemical facies the water of the region during pre monsoon seasons of the year 2017that predominates fall in the ca mg hco3 cl type from the plot calcium and magnesium alkaline earths significantly exceeded the sodium and potassium alkalis and bicarbonates and carbonates weak acids exceeded the chloride and sulphate strong acids gibb s plot revealed that most of the sub surface water samples fall in the water rock dominance region the water rock interaction dominance region indicated the interaction between chemistry of the percolation aqua and the rock chemistry under the ground in general the concentrations of different water pre eminence elements are huge concentrations of different elements are in general high in aqua samples from hand pumps as compared to tube well aqua samples the study is expected to help the planners and officials of local bodies to take suitable remedial measures

12317,the groundwater vulnerability analysis addresses the degree of sensitivity of groundwater system towards changes in both intrinsic inherent and extrinsic factors with this aim an integrated fahp gis based modified drastic drastic l method was followed in order to address the response of various hydro geological indicators towards attenuation of pollutant to sub surface hydrological regime in two differently urbanized clusters of kozhikode district in kerala southern india rating for the drastic l factors was derived with the aid of fuzzy based analytical hierarchical process fahp spatial and non spatial information was integrated into a gis environment the resultant spatial data thus generated depicted that about 71 of urban and 22 of peri urban zones of the study area which are characterised by porous and permeable vadose media with shallow groundwater table have a high to very high vulnerability index value majority of highly vulnerable urban area extends 0 10 km from the coastal line and has a dense population of the total study area 8 urban and 38 5 of peri urban area with low index value indicated that the groundwater in the zone is protected from contaminant s leaching due to its inherent hydrogeology low porous vadose media and the presence of steep slope terrain favors this low vulnerability besides the remaining area shows moderate vulnerability to contamination single parameter and map removal sensitivity analyses highlighted that vadose zone characteristic has the highest influence on vulnerability assessment the resultant vulnerability index values validated with composite groundwater quality index data depicted the significant correlation among them thus the groundwater vulnerability index map is an efficient tool for water sensitive

mohammadi et al 2009 in indian context gis mcdm based gw vulnerability assessments had also been adopted in several parts including in alluvial track of indo gangetic plain khan et al 2010 shallow weathered rock aquifers brindha and elango 2012 basaltic prasad and shukla 2014 hard rock granitic terrain prasad et al 2011 saha and alam 2014 ghosh et al 2015 tiwari et al 2016 mondal et al 2018 etc of the country the area selected for the study are the urban and peri urban phreatic aquifers of kozhikode district southern india which was susceptible to contamination from various anthropogenic activities in the context of climate change and urbanisation jesiya and gopinath 2019 shallow aquifer system laid in coastal line of the study area comprised with high rate of urban sprawl and population thereby facing adverse impacts due to increase in groundwater demand diffusion in contaminants from polluted surface waterbodies landfill leachate seawater intrusion etc nazimuddin 1993 cgwb 2012 salaj et al 2018 hence in order to manage the groundwater system which having intrinsic hydrogeological factors and varying level of urban impressions a customised drastic model drastic l was employed in the study through gis based fuzzy ahp analysis 1 1 environmental settings the study area constitutes the urban and selected peri urban clusters in kozhikode district of kerala laid along the south west coast of india and has an areal extent of 525 km2 with 36 km seashore geographical extent of the study area is located between the longitude 75 7 e to 75 96 e and the latitude 11 12 n to 11 48 n fig 1 urban and peri urban zone of the study area delineated as per the state urbanisation report kerala 2012 in which urban clusters are areas with high density physical development and with more than two closely located higher order up to 5th order urban centres jesiya and gopinath 2019 areas occurred on the fringes of the urban cluster delineated as peri urban zone the population density basic infrastructure development pattern built up nature and administrative set up of this peri urban cluster together indicating the tendency of merging some of these centres with urban cluster in near future census of india 2011 state urbanisation report 2012 both urban and peri urban clusters are in a humid tropical region with an average annual rainfall of about 3400 mm cgwb 2012 physiographically the area encompasses narrow coastal plain low land extending as a narrow stretch of land lying along the coast interrupted by steep laterite cliffs and rock outcrops and mid land regions geomorphology of the area is dominated by lateritic forms followed by valley fills floodplain fluvial water body and minor pockets of residual hills geological survey of india 2005 a detailed field reconnaissance revealed that urban growth pattern of the study area particularly visible in fringe zone is following an unscientific development leading to filling up of water bodies conversion of agricultural lands low lying marshy areas and wetlands for urban needs residential area followed by the commercial sector occupied a significant portion of the urban cluster of the study area people mostly depend on well water dug wells as well as piped water supply from the public water supply scheme the primary threat to the groundwater system of the study area is the localized pollution particularly in urban clusters mainly from sewage discharge from commercial industrial and residential areas working conditions of the primary canals natural and man made secondary drainages are in a poor state to carry peak flows it is mainly because of low coverage and lack of scientifically designed drainage system amrut kerala 2017 silts and waste materials filled most of the ponds and tanks in the area due to this the siltation ponds are not recharging groundwater system cgwb 2012 besides the existing sanitation facilities in the area are mainly septic tanks and shallow pit latrines since no proper liquid and solid waste management is being practised presently in these areas direct discharge of wastewater into the ground soil and leakage from improper drainage system contributes to permanent input of contaminants to groundwater 2 materials and method the word drastic is an acronym abbreviated for the geological and hydrological factors such as depth to water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i conductivity of aquifer c which control the groundwater flow into through and out of an area şener and şener 2015 hence the study area confronted with various impacts from the urbanisation and the existing drastic model was not enough to explain those impacts in vulnerability assessment therefore an additional parameter land use landcover l of the study area were included in the gw vulnerability analysis fahp gis based drastic l vulnerability index method was used in the study to compute aquifer vulnerability scores for the urban and peri urban environments a flow chart designed for fahp drastic l method is given below fig 2 it involves three steps viz designation of drastic l layers relative ranking of these features through numerical ranking method fuzzy analytical hierarchical method fahp and spatial and non spatial integration through arcgis 10 5 1 1 preparation of geo database of modified drastic drastic l parameters study area boundary delineated with the help of survey of india soi topographical maps bhuvan isro s geoportal and various local self government departments a detailed field reconnaissance was carried out in the study area for the well inventory and thereby groundwater level measurements geology and hydrogeology map of the study area were analysed through the district resource map of geological survey of india soil permeability derived using the map of department of soil survey and soil conservation and national bureau of soil science scale 1 50 000 india kerala information from the indian meteorological department imd was collected for rainfall data of the study area hydrogeological data such as litholog and hydraulic conductivity were collected from the central groundwater board thiruvananthapuram and india wris http www india wris nrsc gov in web portal system consequently the above said spatial and non spatial data sources undergone a series of geo processing functions such as digitization geo statistical analysis etc in the arcgis software point features such as well depth and rainfall layer were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw algorithm in gis landuse landcover data obtained from the supervised classification of irs p6 liss iii 23 5 m spatial resolution satellite data also slope in analysis was performed with srtm dem 30 m using spatial analyst tool of arcgis 2 deriving numerical index using fuzzy ahp method the hierarchy model network for eight hydro geological parameters was constructed with the aid of a web application fuzzyahp to evaluate groundwater vulnerability index each drastic l parameter was assigned a subjective ranking of 1 10 based on experts opinion and from relevant scientific outcomes ranking 1 was assigned for components with least contaminant potential and 10 for the highest contaminant potential these ratings were again rescaled with a saaty s 1 9 analytical scale these judgments scores were further undergone fuzzy ahp analytical hierarchical process to determine a composite normalized index value apart from ahp in fahp method pair wise comparison of criteria and sub criteria elements are expressed with triangular fuzzy numbers tfns tfns enables to avoid vagueness imprecision and uncertainty of the linguistic scale the numbers 1 2 3 2 1 5 2 2 7 2 3 7 2 4 and 9 2 were used as fuzzy scaling ratios corresponding to the strength of potential for one element over another with interval values instead of crisp numbers the linguistic scale of importance such as just equal equally important weakly more important moderately more important strongly more important and very strongly more important was assigned with these fuzzy scaling ratios for pair wise comparisons of one attribute over another in fuzzy ahp method the criteria and sub criteria with varying rate of potential to vulnerability different scale of importance were assigned with the above said tfns and transformed to a pair wise comparison matrix pair wise matrix was established using prior knowledge of the goodness of fit each of the parameters was assigned the subjective rating between 1 and 9 from least to most vulnerable to contamination defuzzification processes were carried out in order to obtain normalized criteria weights from fuzzy membership values the crisp value obtained from fuzzy ahp was used to calculate groundwater vulnerability index using the equation 1 g w v i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w where r is the rating and w is the weight assigned to each criterion involved in the analysis the pair wise comparison matrices were prepared for drastic l parameters and each parameter with its composite weightage is given in table 1 3 geospatial analysis eight data layers prepared in arcgis were converted to raster format with a uniform grid size of 25 m resolution the normalized weights were integrated into corresponding raster layers using reclassification analysis and carried out a fuzzy overlay analysis in arcgis 2 1 sensitivity analysis to reduce the subjectivity arising as a result of composite weightage derivation and to confirm the reliability of the assessment sensitivity analyses were carried out the map removal sensitivity analysis lodwick et al 1990 used in the study to measure the sensitivity of the vulnerability map towards each drastic l parameter the analysis was performed by removing each parameter by equation 2 2 si v n v n where si is sensitivity measurement si of the ith parameter v is the total vulnerability index derived through eq 1 v is the vulnerability index value of the individual parameter which is excluded in the remaining parameter during the integration of model n and n are the total numbers of parameters applied to calculate the v and v the negative value of this measure means that the removal of factors increases the vulnerability values thereby reducing the calculated vulnerability validation of the resultant drastic l map was carried out using the groundwater hydro chemical data of the study area 3 result and discussion 3 1 analysis of drastic l parameters depth to water level dwl determines the thickness of the medium through which the infiltrating water must travel before reaching the aquifer rahman 2008 stated that it has a direct influence on the degree extent physical and chemical attenuation and degradation processes of diffusing contaminant and sub surface materials such as air mineral and water with the increase in dwl the chance of contamination decreases because it needs more distance to travel before contacting with groundwater the dwl in the study area varied from 0 7 to 13 7 m fig 3 based on dwl the wells are classified into shallow wells 0 2 m depth covering 9 9 km2 of the study area moderately deep well 2 6 m depth 373 km2 deep well 6 10 m depth 139 4 km2 and very deep well 10 m depth in coastal alluvium zone the distance to groundwater table was 0 7 6 m well depth varied from 0 7 to 13 m in lateritic aquifer system of the study area majority of the study area was occupied with shallow to moderately deep wells which favours the contaminant attenuation by surface activities or conditions the probability of contamination by seepage from septic systems and effluent untreated sewage systems was more in the shallow aquifers in the study area therefore highest weightages were given to zones with shallow wells traditionally people mostly rely on groundwater sources like dug wells shallow tube wells stone spouts etc to meet their water needs the areas with 10 m deep wells are assigned with moderate rating because there is a fair chance to transfer the contaminant into or through the aquifer due to the spatial continuity between overland and the aquifer net aquifer recharge determines the rate of water that infiltrates into the ground surface and reaches the water table brindha and elango 2015 the recharge factor forms the important vehicle to transport pollutants to the groundwater zone it is the amount of water unit area of land that penetrates the ground surface and reaches the water table rahman 2008 the rate of recharge due to rainfall in any area depends on several factors including precipitation permeability of the rocks soil and sediments in the vadose zone depth to water table moisture topography vegetation and temperature among others belden 1996 the resultant map of soil permeability rainfall and slope data addressed the net recharge index of the study area fig 4 and the values ranged from 14 to 21 classified as 15 15 20 20 zones the recharge water can carry contaminants vertically to the water table and horizontally within the aquifer and hence a substantial net recharge value corresponds to high potential for groundwater pollution aller et al 1987 an area with a gentle slope with rapid permeability soil type and high rainfall are considered as the highest recharge rate zone and hence a high recharge index of 20 13 of the area mostly the western region of the study area is characterised by coarse textural class like sand which facilitates high infiltration and hence high recharge rate for a net recharge the pollution potential of an area with confined aquifer is less than that of an unconfined one because of the presence of a confining layer the entire study area with heavy rainfall plays a significant role in transportation of leachate and other surface pollutants through the infiltration process voudouris et al 2010 the area with recharge index of 15 is having moderate recharge characteristics such as moderate to steep terrain and moderate to slow permeable soil steep slope terrain which facilitates the high surface runoff along with silt and clay textures inhibits infiltration and therefore the contaminant transport amount of recharge due to rainfall in the study area was estimated as per gec 1997 water table fluctuation method average water table fluctuations are 1 2 m and 1 4 m for alluvial and lateritic zones of the study area respectively and recharge for the coastal alluvial zone is 11 65 mcm and that of the lateritic zone is 43 01 mcm the aquifer media in drastic l indicates the inherent hydrogeology of the subsurface according to remesan and panda 2008 the subsurface hydrological processes such as subsurface flow pollutant transfer groundwater recharge etc are influenced by the aquifer media characteristics the aquifer systems occupied in the study area are coastal sandy formations coastal sandy laterite aquifer laterite aquifer weathered rock formations weathered rock aquifer and fractured rock aquifer cgwb 2012 however coastal sandy formations coastal sandy laterite aquifer area are the dominant aquifer formations occupied in the study area quaternary deposits are marine and fluvial in origin constituted coal sandy formations occupying an area of 107 sq km 19 of the total study area periyar formation is a fluvial deposit comprising an admixture of sand silt and clay guruvayur formation is a strand line deposit of palaeo marine origin and mostly comprises medium to fine sand kadappuram formation represents contemporary marine deposits constituting the present and barrier beach fig 5 coastal sandy aquifers are with medium to fine sand with an admixture of shells aquifer media have a moderate control in contaminant attenuation of a geological area the coastal region with sand silt clay composition is assigned with high rating due to its potential to contaminant transport pebble beds occur on the coast and along banks of the beypore river the grit and clay constitute pebble bed and it is lateritised it comprises well rounded pebbles of quartz granite quartzite and granulite sporadic laterite 0 4 occurs from the charnockite country to the southwest lateritic zone composes of charnockite and horneblende biotite gneiss composition assigned with moderate to least vulnerability index to contamination soil textures determine the potential of groundwater vulnerability in such a way that brindha and elango 2015 the grain size of soil controls the mobility of pollutants from the surface to the water table hydrogeologically the study area consists of four distinct layers the topsoil highly weathered rocks moderately weathered rocks and massive rock there are mainly four types of soil textures visible in the study area which are sandy loam to sandy clay loam type i loam to clay type ii sandy loam to clay loam type iii and gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay type iv as shown in fig 6 type i consists of sandy loam to sandy clay loam texture having a thickness ranging from 150 to 175 cm sand content ranges from 80 and clay up to 15 even though these soils have a high water table the water holding capacity is weak due to the predominance of sand they are excessive drained with moderately rapid to rapid permeability on vulnerability index assessment medium to coarse textured soil assigned with the highest ranking according to its higher potential to contaminant transfer the dominant soil category of the study area is gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay textured soil it is a well drained type with moderate to moderately slow permeability therefore the assigned drastic l rating is moderate the gravel content of this type of soil is 15 40 pockets of sandy loam to clay loam textured soil types occurred in between gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay texture and formed in the riverine alluvium of gently sloping terrain with a thickness of 140 cm 160cm it is imperfectly drained with slow permeability gw table was found high in this soil and therefore the weightage is moderate to high another type of soil present in the area is excessively drained gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay textured soil with moderately to moderately slow permeability its gravel content was found to be 50 80 topography directs the surface runoff efficiency and the time for the infiltration more or less flat surface results in less runoff and more infiltration with the possibility of higher risk of groundwater pollution aller et al 1987 hence high weightage the slope value in derived after dem analysis fig 1 ranged from 0 to 55 with a mean value of 6 and the groundwater vulnerability potential consistent with slope factor ranged from highest to moderate based on the slope value an area of 277 6 km2 53 occurred under gentle slope terrain slope value of 5 and sloped down towards the western side of the study area the 5 slope terrain with sandy textures permits to retain water for a long time facilitating infiltration and rapid contaminant transfer into aquifers kaliraj et al 2015 therefore this region was assigned the highest ratings towards vulnerability remaining 5 15 area comes under moderate sloping category contributing moderate vulnerability to contamination only 10 of the area with 15 steep slope terrain consists of hillocks assigned to least rating the reason for least rating is that the steep terrain enhances surface runoff and permitting rapid movement of water and thus decreasing the percolation rate the unsaturated layer present above the water table is defined as the vadose zone it controls contaminant transfer along with soil permeability vadose zone characteristics were derived after the analysis of litholog data collected from the central ground water board hydrogeology of the area includes the weathered fissured and fractured crystalline rocks laterite and alluvium structures in which area covered by laterite and followed by coastal alluvium are the dominant structures the alluvium consists of unconsolidated materials such as sand silt and clay its thickness varying between 2 and 8 m and the groundwater occurring under phreatic condition alluvium formation of the study area consists of riverine and coastal formations coastal alluvium occurs in the western part of the study area and the riverine alluvium occurs along river courses influence of vadose zone on contaminant transfer is similar to that of soil cover and vadose media characteristics the soil permeability of this zone is high therefore the impact of the vadose zone in coastal alluvium attained high rating towards vulnerability porous laterite covered the remaining part of the fig 5 terrain and formed potential phreatic aquifers along topographic lows and valleys the permeability of the vadose zone is varying from moderate to low and therefore assigned as moderate to low vulnerability index the ability of the aquifer material to transmit water is termed as hydraulic conductivity which determines the rate at which groundwater can flow thereby the distance of transport of pollutants through the aquifer can be assessed fig 7 illustrates the hydraulic conductivity values in m d of the study area weightage for vulnerability gives as per lesser the hydraulic conductivity the aquifer is less prone to pollution and vice versa landuse pattern of the study area included with the drastic l parameters because the type of land use pattern of the study area have a remarkable influence on the urban hydrologic regime khosravi et al 2018 major landuse classes of the study area are divided into built up land vegetation water body and others fig 8 the intensity of pollution is varying with changing land use pattern such as urban commercial agricultural types majority of the study area is occupied with residential commercial built up areas that are causing changes on hydrological properties of the area through the addition of urban and domestic wastes leakages from septic tanks and waste dumping sites the impervious area increases with urbanisation and subsequently the rainfall recharge to ground reduces tam and nga 2018 in the meantime recharge may increase due to leakage from leach pits waste water drainage system etc both the situation adversely affects hydrogeology qualitatively and quantitatively respectively therefore built up land assigned as high vulnerability index towards contaminant attenuation followed by areas in the vicinity of water bodies vegetation land etc the overall vulnerability index was derived after estimation of sensitivity of all these parameters to contamination and summarised as gw vulnerability map fig 9 the site specific map was divided the urban and peri urban zone into several hydrogeological sub regions with different levels of severity from the contamination point of view the gw vulnerability index map had divided the study area fig 9 into four zones such as low moderate high and very high vulnerable zones areal distribution of groundwater vulnerability class occurred in the urban and peri urban zones given in table 2 of the urban cluster 70 8 occupied with a high to very high vulnerable category which is characterised with nearshore high density urban settlements and vicinity of water bodies the aquifers underlying these urban zones composed of coastal sand and alluvial sandy formations that are more sensitive to infiltrate contaminants these vulnerable zones are heavily confronted with contaminants due to sewage discharge landfill leachate solid waste dumping and seawater intrusion salaj et al 2018 part of peri urban zone laid in the coastal zone characterised with high to very high vulnerable zone covering 21 9 of the total peri urban area the area surrounded by this zone categorized as moderate vulnerable zone comprised 20 7 and 39 5 of the urban and peri urban zones of the study area respectively underlying lateritic formations weathered charnockite rocks and other vulnerability influencing parameters occurred in these zones are moderately permeable to runoff and contaminants to the aquifer however groundwater sources under moderately vulnerable zones are frequently influenced by diffusion of contaminants from the high and very high vulnerable zones low vulnerable zone covers 8 4 and 38 5 of urban and peri urban zone respectively sub surface hydrogeological structures and properties of the low vulnerable zones have protected the aquifer from the transmission of contaminants into the groundwater overall observation revealed that groundwater zones under highest vulnerable zone were more confronted with urban growth and related anthropogenic activities than low vulnerable zone therefore diffusion of contaminants was deteriorated the groundwater quality to a level where it becomes unsuitable for drinking domestic and developments purposes in future 3 2 sensitivity and validation analysis the impact of individual parameters to aquifer vulnerability was evaluated through the single parameter sensitivity analysis from the effective weight of each parameter it is clear that vadose zone classes have the lead role in determining the sensitivity of the overall performance table 3 this was followed by depth to water level and net recharge rate a slight fluctuation in these factors leads to variations in aquifer vulnerability of the study area groundwater samples 85nos were collected after a detailed field survey on the urban and peri urban cluster of the study area and hydrochemical analysis which determines the water quality status of the study area were carried out water quality factors including physical ph tds mg l and electrical conductivity μs cm chemical major cations and anions and biological parameters thus obtained integrated through gis based mcdm method jesiya and gopinath 2019 and derived the groundwater quality index gwqi values of the study area the index value gwqi thus obtained table 4 were addressed the overall water quality status of the study area and used for a validation analysis of groundwater vulnerability index gwvi data the validation analysis depicted that there is a strong correlation is existing between the gwqi data and groundwater vulnerability index gwvi data fig 10 sensitivity analysis explained that the vadose zone has significant impacts on determining the groundwater vulnerability status of the geographical area therefore statistical student s t test was conducted for gwvi values without vadose zone table 4 against wqi and it was found that there was a significant difference between the means p value 2 7 10 6 0 05 whereas for gwvi with drastic l p value 0 07 0 05 indicating that there was no significant difference between the means all water quality parameters in the poor water quality indexed zone laid beyond the permissible limits for drinking water the area with poor gwqi was seen along the coastal zone mainly in the urban clusters sewage discharge poor working condition of canals the closeness of septic tanks and shallow pit latrines due to land constraints were enhanced the occurrence of water pollutants in the area from the spatial and statistical analysis it is clear that the area with highest potential for groundwater contamination is having poor water quality status and vice versa 4 conclusion the study area selected for the work is with urban zone characteristics and peri urban zone which are migrated from rural to the urban continuum the study focused on to delineate the groundwater vulnerable zones of the phreatic aquifer through the analysis of inherent geological and hydrogeological factors which influence the vulnerability of the area due to the importance of the accuracy of weights and rating values of the drastic l parameters for the validity of this method the fuzzy ahp method was combined with a drastic l method to determine the weight and rating values of the parameters sensitivity analysis of fuzzy ahp derived weights depicted that vadose zone has the most important influence on protection from pollutants from the vulnerability analysis the study area is classified into very high to highly vulnerable moderate and poor vulnerable zones the highest vulnerable zones occurred in the alluvium formation with a shallow groundwater table constrained due to intense urban activities the resultant spatial data can be used as a connecting link between the changing urban and peri urban spatial structures and water quality parameters

12317,the groundwater vulnerability analysis addresses the degree of sensitivity of groundwater system towards changes in both intrinsic inherent and extrinsic factors with this aim an integrated fahp gis based modified drastic drastic l method was followed in order to address the response of various hydro geological indicators towards attenuation of pollutant to sub surface hydrological regime in two differently urbanized clusters of kozhikode district in kerala southern india rating for the drastic l factors was derived with the aid of fuzzy based analytical hierarchical process fahp spatial and non spatial information was integrated into a gis environment the resultant spatial data thus generated depicted that about 71 of urban and 22 of peri urban zones of the study area which are characterised by porous and permeable vadose media with shallow groundwater table have a high to very high vulnerability index value majority of highly vulnerable urban area extends 0 10 km from the coastal line and has a dense population of the total study area 8 urban and 38 5 of peri urban area with low index value indicated that the groundwater in the zone is protected from contaminant s leaching due to its inherent hydrogeology low porous vadose media and the presence of steep slope terrain favors this low vulnerability besides the remaining area shows moderate vulnerability to contamination single parameter and map removal sensitivity analyses highlighted that vadose zone characteristic has the highest influence on vulnerability assessment the resultant vulnerability index values validated with composite groundwater quality index data depicted the significant correlation among them thus the groundwater vulnerability index map is an efficient tool for water sensitive

detailed field reconnaissance revealed that urban growth pattern of the study area particularly visible in fringe zone is following an unscientific development leading to filling up of water bodies conversion of agricultural lands low lying marshy areas and wetlands for urban needs residential area followed by the commercial sector occupied a significant portion of the urban cluster of the study area people mostly depend on well water dug wells as well as piped water supply from the public water supply scheme the primary threat to the groundwater system of the study area is the localized pollution particularly in urban clusters mainly from sewage discharge from commercial industrial and residential areas working conditions of the primary canals natural and man made secondary drainages are in a poor state to carry peak flows it is mainly because of low coverage and lack of scientifically designed drainage system amrut kerala 2017 silts and waste materials filled most of the ponds and tanks in the area due to this the siltation ponds are not recharging groundwater system cgwb 2012 besides the existing sanitation facilities in the area are mainly septic tanks and shallow pit latrines since no proper liquid and solid waste management is being practised presently in these areas direct discharge of wastewater into the ground soil and leakage from improper drainage system contributes to permanent input of contaminants to groundwater 2 materials and method the word drastic is an acronym abbreviated for the geological and hydrological factors such as depth to water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i conductivity of aquifer c which control the groundwater flow into through and out of an area şener and şener 2015 hence the study area confronted with various impacts from the urbanisation and the existing drastic model was not enough to explain those impacts in vulnerability assessment therefore an additional parameter land use landcover l of the study area were included in the gw vulnerability analysis fahp gis based drastic l vulnerability index method was used in the study to compute aquifer vulnerability scores for the urban and peri urban environments a flow chart designed for fahp drastic l method is given below fig 2 it involves three steps viz designation of drastic l layers relative ranking of these features through numerical ranking method fuzzy analytical hierarchical method fahp and spatial and non spatial integration through arcgis 10 5 1 1 preparation of geo database of modified drastic drastic l parameters study area boundary delineated with the help of survey of india soi topographical maps bhuvan isro s geoportal and various local self government departments a detailed field reconnaissance was carried out in the study area for the well inventory and thereby groundwater level measurements geology and hydrogeology map of the study area were analysed through the district resource map of geological survey of india soil permeability derived using the map of department of soil survey and soil conservation and national bureau of soil science scale 1 50 000 india kerala information from the indian meteorological department imd was collected for rainfall data of the study area hydrogeological data such as litholog and hydraulic conductivity were collected from the central groundwater board thiruvananthapuram and india wris http www india wris nrsc gov in web portal system consequently the above said spatial and non spatial data sources undergone a series of geo processing functions such as digitization geo statistical analysis etc in the arcgis software point features such as well depth and rainfall layer were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw algorithm in gis landuse landcover data obtained from the supervised classification of irs p6 liss iii 23 5 m spatial resolution satellite data also slope in analysis was performed with srtm dem 30 m using spatial analyst tool of arcgis 2 deriving numerical index using fuzzy ahp method the hierarchy model network for eight hydro geological parameters was constructed with the aid of a web application fuzzyahp to evaluate groundwater vulnerability index each drastic l parameter was assigned a subjective ranking of 1 10 based on experts opinion and from relevant scientific outcomes ranking 1 was assigned for components with least contaminant potential and 10 for the highest contaminant potential these ratings were again rescaled with a saaty s 1 9 analytical scale these judgments scores were further undergone fuzzy ahp analytical hierarchical process to determine a composite normalized index value apart from ahp in fahp method pair wise comparison of criteria and sub criteria elements are expressed with triangular fuzzy numbers tfns tfns enables to avoid vagueness imprecision and uncertainty of the linguistic scale the numbers 1 2 3 2 1 5 2 2 7 2 3 7 2 4 and 9 2 were used as fuzzy scaling ratios corresponding to the strength of potential for one element over another with interval values instead of crisp numbers the linguistic scale of importance such as just equal equally important weakly more important moderately more important strongly more important and very strongly more important was assigned with these fuzzy scaling ratios for pair wise comparisons of one attribute over another in fuzzy ahp method the criteria and sub criteria with varying rate of potential to vulnerability different scale of importance were assigned with the above said tfns and transformed to a pair wise comparison matrix pair wise matrix was established using prior knowledge of the goodness of fit each of the parameters was assigned the subjective rating between 1 and 9 from least to most vulnerable to contamination defuzzification processes were carried out in order to obtain normalized criteria weights from fuzzy membership values the crisp value obtained from fuzzy ahp was used to calculate groundwater vulnerability index using the equation 1 g w v i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w where r is the rating and w is the weight assigned to each criterion involved in the analysis the pair wise comparison matrices were prepared for drastic l parameters and each parameter with its composite weightage is given in table 1 3 geospatial analysis eight data layers prepared in arcgis were converted to raster format with a uniform grid size of 25 m resolution the normalized weights were integrated into corresponding raster layers using reclassification analysis and carried out a fuzzy overlay analysis in arcgis 2 1 sensitivity analysis to reduce the subjectivity arising as a result of composite weightage derivation and to confirm the reliability of the assessment sensitivity analyses were carried out the map removal sensitivity analysis lodwick et al 1990 used in the study to measure the sensitivity of the vulnerability map towards each drastic l parameter the analysis was performed by removing each parameter by equation 2 2 si v n v n where si is sensitivity measurement si of the ith parameter v is the total vulnerability index derived through eq 1 v is the vulnerability index value of the individual parameter which is excluded in the remaining parameter during the integration of model n and n are the total numbers of parameters applied to calculate the v and v the negative value of this measure means that the removal of factors increases the vulnerability values thereby reducing the calculated vulnerability validation of the resultant drastic l map was carried out using the groundwater hydro chemical data of the study area 3 result and discussion 3 1 analysis of drastic l parameters depth to water level dwl determines the thickness of the medium through which the infiltrating water must travel before reaching the aquifer rahman 2008 stated that it has a direct influence on the degree extent physical and chemical attenuation and degradation processes of diffusing contaminant and sub surface materials such as air mineral and water with the increase in dwl the chance of contamination decreases because it needs more distance to travel before contacting with groundwater the dwl in the study area varied from 0 7 to 13 7 m fig 3 based on dwl the wells are classified into shallow wells 0 2 m depth covering 9 9 km2 of the study area moderately deep well 2 6 m depth 373 km2 deep well 6 10 m depth 139 4 km2 and very deep well 10 m depth in coastal alluvium zone the distance to groundwater table was 0 7 6 m well depth varied from 0 7 to 13 m in lateritic aquifer system of the study area majority of the study area was occupied with shallow to moderately deep wells which favours the contaminant attenuation by surface activities or conditions the probability of contamination by seepage from septic systems and effluent untreated sewage systems was more in the shallow aquifers in the study area therefore highest weightages were given to zones with shallow wells traditionally people mostly rely on groundwater sources like dug wells shallow tube wells stone spouts etc to meet their water needs the areas with 10 m deep wells are assigned with moderate rating because there is a fair chance to transfer the contaminant into or through the aquifer due to the spatial continuity between overland and the aquifer net aquifer recharge determines the rate of water that infiltrates into the ground surface and reaches the water table brindha and elango 2015 the recharge factor forms the important vehicle to transport pollutants to the groundwater zone it is the amount of water unit area of land that penetrates the ground surface and reaches the water table rahman 2008 the rate of recharge due to rainfall in any area depends on several factors including precipitation permeability of the rocks soil and sediments in the vadose zone depth to water table moisture topography vegetation and temperature among others belden 1996 the resultant map of soil permeability rainfall and slope data addressed the net recharge index of the study area fig 4 and the values ranged from 14 to 21 classified as 15 15 20 20 zones the recharge water can carry contaminants vertically to the water table and horizontally within the aquifer and hence a substantial net recharge value corresponds to high potential for groundwater pollution aller et al 1987 an area with a gentle slope with rapid permeability soil type and high rainfall are considered as the highest recharge rate zone and hence a high recharge index of 20 13 of the area mostly the western region of the study area is characterised by coarse textural class like sand which facilitates high infiltration and hence high recharge rate for a net recharge the pollution potential of an area with confined aquifer is less than that of an unconfined one because of the presence of a confining layer the entire study area with heavy rainfall plays a significant role in transportation of leachate and other surface pollutants through the infiltration process voudouris et al 2010 the area with recharge index of 15 is having moderate recharge characteristics such as moderate to steep terrain and moderate to slow permeable soil steep slope terrain which facilitates the high surface runoff along with silt and clay textures inhibits infiltration and therefore the contaminant transport amount of recharge due to rainfall in the study area was estimated as per gec 1997 water table fluctuation method average water table fluctuations are 1 2 m and 1 4 m for alluvial and lateritic zones of the study area respectively and recharge for the coastal alluvial zone is 11 65 mcm and that of the lateritic zone is 43 01 mcm the aquifer media in drastic l indicates the inherent hydrogeology of the subsurface according to remesan and panda 2008 the subsurface hydrological processes such as subsurface flow pollutant transfer groundwater recharge etc are influenced by the aquifer media characteristics the aquifer systems occupied in the study area are coastal sandy formations coastal sandy laterite aquifer laterite aquifer weathered rock formations weathered rock aquifer and fractured rock aquifer cgwb 2012 however coastal sandy formations coastal sandy laterite aquifer area are the dominant aquifer formations occupied in the study area quaternary deposits are marine and fluvial in origin constituted coal sandy formations occupying an area of 107 sq km 19 of the total study area periyar formation is a fluvial deposit comprising an admixture of sand silt and clay guruvayur formation is a strand line deposit of palaeo marine origin and mostly comprises medium to fine sand kadappuram formation represents contemporary marine deposits constituting the present and barrier beach fig 5 coastal sandy aquifers are with medium to fine sand with an admixture of shells aquifer media have a moderate control in contaminant attenuation of a geological area the coastal region with sand silt clay composition is assigned with high rating due to its potential to contaminant transport pebble beds occur on the coast and along banks of the beypore river the grit and clay constitute pebble bed and it is lateritised it comprises well rounded pebbles of quartz granite quartzite and granulite sporadic laterite 0 4 occurs from the charnockite country to the southwest lateritic zone composes of charnockite and horneblende biotite gneiss composition assigned with moderate to least vulnerability index to contamination soil textures determine the potential of groundwater vulnerability in such a way that brindha and elango 2015 the grain size of soil controls the mobility of pollutants from the surface to the water table hydrogeologically the study area consists of four distinct layers the topsoil highly weathered rocks moderately weathered rocks and massive rock there are mainly four types of soil textures visible in the study area which are sandy loam to sandy clay loam type i loam to clay type ii sandy loam to clay loam type iii and gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay type iv as shown in fig 6 type i consists of sandy loam to sandy clay loam texture having a thickness ranging from 150 to 175 cm sand content ranges from 80 and clay up to 15 even though these soils have a high water table the water holding capacity is weak due to the predominance of sand they are excessive drained with moderately rapid to rapid permeability on vulnerability index assessment medium to coarse textured soil assigned with the highest ranking according to its higher potential to contaminant transfer the dominant soil category of the study area is gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay textured soil it is a well drained type with moderate to moderately slow permeability therefore the assigned drastic l rating is moderate the gravel content of this type of soil is 15 40 pockets of sandy loam to clay loam textured soil types occurred in between gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay texture and formed in the riverine alluvium of gently sloping terrain with a thickness of 140 cm 160cm it is imperfectly drained with slow permeability gw table was found high in this soil and therefore the weightage is moderate to high another type of soil present in the area is excessively drained gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay textured soil with moderately to moderately slow permeability its gravel content was found to be 50 80 topography directs the surface runoff efficiency and the time for the infiltration more or less flat surface results in less runoff and more infiltration with the possibility of higher risk of groundwater pollution aller et al 1987 hence high weightage the slope value in derived after dem analysis fig 1 ranged from 0 to 55 with a mean value of 6 and the groundwater vulnerability potential consistent with slope factor ranged from highest to moderate based on the slope value an area of 277 6 km2 53 occurred under gentle slope terrain slope value of 5 and sloped down towards the western side of the study area the 5 slope terrain with sandy textures permits to retain water for a long time facilitating infiltration and rapid contaminant transfer into aquifers kaliraj et al 2015 therefore this region was assigned the highest ratings towards vulnerability remaining 5 15 area comes under moderate sloping category contributing moderate vulnerability to contamination only 10 of the area with 15 steep slope terrain consists of hillocks assigned to least rating the reason for least rating is that the steep terrain enhances surface runoff and permitting rapid movement of water and thus decreasing the percolation rate the unsaturated layer present above the water table is defined as the vadose zone it controls contaminant transfer along with soil permeability vadose zone characteristics were derived after the analysis of litholog data collected from the central ground water board hydrogeology of the area includes the weathered fissured and fractured crystalline rocks laterite and alluvium structures in which area covered by laterite and followed by coastal alluvium are the dominant structures the alluvium consists of unconsolidated materials such as sand silt and clay its thickness varying between 2 and 8 m and the groundwater occurring under phreatic condition alluvium formation of the study area consists of riverine and coastal formations coastal alluvium occurs in the western part of the study area and the riverine alluvium occurs along river courses influence of vadose zone on contaminant transfer is similar to that of soil cover and vadose media characteristics the soil permeability of this zone is high therefore the impact of the vadose zone in coastal alluvium attained high rating towards vulnerability porous laterite covered the remaining part of the fig 5 terrain and formed potential phreatic aquifers along topographic lows and valleys the permeability of the vadose zone is varying from moderate to low and therefore assigned as moderate to low vulnerability index the ability of the aquifer material to transmit water is termed as hydraulic conductivity which determines the rate at which groundwater can flow thereby the distance of transport of pollutants through the aquifer can be assessed fig 7 illustrates the hydraulic conductivity values in m d of the study area weightage for vulnerability gives as per lesser the hydraulic conductivity the aquifer is less prone to pollution and vice versa landuse pattern of the study area included with the drastic l parameters because the type of land use pattern of the study area have a remarkable influence on the urban hydrologic regime khosravi et al 2018 major landuse classes of the study area are divided into built up land vegetation water body and others fig 8 the intensity of pollution is varying with changing land use pattern such as urban commercial agricultural types majority of the study area is occupied with residential commercial built up areas that are causing changes on hydrological properties of the area through the addition of urban and domestic wastes leakages from septic tanks and waste dumping sites the impervious area increases with urbanisation and subsequently the rainfall recharge to ground reduces tam and nga 2018 in the meantime recharge may increase due to leakage from leach pits waste water drainage system etc both the situation adversely affects hydrogeology qualitatively and quantitatively respectively therefore built up land assigned as high vulnerability index towards contaminant attenuation followed by areas in the vicinity of water bodies vegetation land etc the overall vulnerability index was derived after estimation of sensitivity of all these parameters to contamination and summarised as gw vulnerability map fig 9 the site specific map was divided the urban and peri urban zone into several hydrogeological sub regions with different levels of severity from the contamination point of view the gw vulnerability index map had divided the study area fig 9 into four zones such as low moderate high and very high vulnerable zones areal distribution of groundwater vulnerability class occurred in the urban and peri urban zones given in table 2 of the urban cluster 70 8 occupied with a high to very high vulnerable category which is characterised with nearshore high density urban settlements and vicinity of water bodies the aquifers underlying these urban zones composed of coastal sand and alluvial sandy formations that are more sensitive to infiltrate contaminants these vulnerable zones are heavily confronted with contaminants due to sewage discharge landfill leachate solid waste dumping and seawater intrusion salaj et al 2018 part of peri urban zone laid in the coastal zone characterised with high to very high vulnerable zone covering 21 9 of the total peri urban area the area surrounded by this zone categorized as moderate vulnerable zone comprised 20 7 and 39 5 of the urban and peri urban zones of the study area respectively underlying lateritic formations weathered charnockite rocks and other vulnerability influencing parameters occurred in these zones are moderately permeable to runoff and contaminants to the aquifer however groundwater sources under moderately vulnerable zones are frequently influenced by diffusion of contaminants from the high and very high vulnerable zones low vulnerable zone covers 8 4 and 38 5 of urban and peri urban zone respectively sub surface hydrogeological structures and properties of the low vulnerable zones have protected the aquifer from the transmission of contaminants into the groundwater overall observation revealed that groundwater zones under highest vulnerable zone were more confronted with urban growth and related anthropogenic activities than low vulnerable zone therefore diffusion of contaminants was deteriorated the groundwater quality to a level where it becomes unsuitable for drinking domestic and developments purposes in future 3 2 sensitivity and validation analysis the impact of individual parameters to aquifer vulnerability was evaluated through the single parameter sensitivity analysis from the effective weight of each parameter it is clear that vadose zone classes have the lead role in determining the sensitivity of the overall performance table 3 this was followed by depth to water level and net recharge rate a slight fluctuation in these factors leads to variations in aquifer vulnerability of the study area groundwater samples 85nos were collected after a detailed field survey on the urban and peri urban cluster of the study area and hydrochemical analysis which determines the water quality status of the study area were carried out water quality factors including physical ph tds mg l and electrical conductivity μs cm chemical major cations and anions and biological parameters thus obtained integrated through gis based mcdm method jesiya and gopinath 2019 and derived the groundwater quality index gwqi values of the study area the index value gwqi thus obtained table 4 were addressed the overall water quality status of the study area and used for a validation analysis of groundwater vulnerability index gwvi data the validation analysis depicted that there is a strong correlation is existing between the gwqi data and groundwater vulnerability index gwvi data fig 10 sensitivity analysis explained that the vadose zone has significant impacts on determining the groundwater vulnerability status of the geographical area therefore statistical student s t test was conducted for gwvi values without vadose zone table 4 against wqi and it was found that there was a significant difference between the means p value 2 7 10 6 0 05 whereas for gwvi with drastic l p value 0 07 0 05 indicating that there was no significant difference between the means all water quality parameters in the poor water quality indexed zone laid beyond the permissible limits for drinking water the area with poor gwqi was seen along the coastal zone mainly in the urban clusters sewage discharge poor working condition of canals the closeness of septic tanks and shallow pit latrines due to land constraints were enhanced the occurrence of water pollutants in the area from the spatial and statistical analysis it is clear that the area with highest potential for groundwater contamination is having poor water quality status and vice versa 4 conclusion the study area selected for the work is with urban zone characteristics and peri urban zone which are migrated from rural to the urban continuum the study focused on to delineate the groundwater vulnerable zones of the phreatic aquifer through the analysis of inherent geological and hydrogeological factors which influence the vulnerability of the area due to the importance of the accuracy of weights and rating values of the drastic l parameters for the validity of this method the fuzzy ahp method was combined with a drastic l method to determine the weight and rating values of the parameters sensitivity analysis of fuzzy ahp derived weights depicted that vadose zone has the most important influence on protection from pollutants from the vulnerability analysis the study area is classified into very high to highly vulnerable moderate and poor vulnerable zones the highest vulnerable zones occurred in the alluvium formation with a shallow groundwater table constrained due to intense urban activities the resultant spatial data can be used as a connecting link between the changing urban and peri urban spatial structures and water quality parameters

provides employment to about 22 13 of the total workers in manipur census 2011 geologically mv is formed due to pull apart basin in the later phase of the indo myanmar orogeny soibam 1998 it is virtually a flat land filled with quaternary alluviums of fluvio lacustrine origin above the basement of disang shales narrow elongated belts of pediment primarily composed of sand gravels pebbles and boulders as well as fan deposits occupy the foothill areas which surrounds the valley a large area of this valley is occupied by marshy lands lakes ponds and rivers several significant thrust faults

statistical summary are presented in table 1 and 2 respectively the concentration variation of major ions in different geomorphic units is illustrated by box plots in fig 2 it is observed that pz has highly elevated concentrations of na cl and hco3 than ap and fp the order of abundance of major ions is found as hco3 cl na ca mg no3 k so4 and co3 are almost absent in all the samples mean hco3

where the maximum values are found in the piedmont region based on tds classification davis and dewiest 1966 samples belong to two categories which are fresh 1000 mg l and saline 10000 mg l the fresh catagory represents recent water recharge as it is characterized by elevated hco3 and low tds uliana and sharp 2001 the saline type 7032 mg l to 7353 mg l is encountered as salt springs within the piedmont near the foothills of disang hills 4 2 agricultural aspects salinity problem occurs when salt accumulates in the root zone which may significantly affect the quantity of crop production jain et al 2011 todd 1980 thus quantity of dissolved salts is important regarding the quality of groundwater for irrigation purpose water with tds less than 450 mg l is considered good and that with greater than 2000 mg l is unsuitable for agricultural purpose davis and dewiest 1966 the crop productivity is greatly affected by ec as the intake of water by plant reduces with increasing ec westcott and ayers 1984 the ec value higher than 3000 µs cm is considered as unsuitable while value less than 250 µs cm is considered as good for irrigation based on tds and ec values few piedmont groundwater samples 10000 mg l and 3000 µs cm respectively are found unsuitable for agriculture table 3 highlights the result of some of the widely used irrigation index parameters for determining the suitability of the water for irrigational use 4 2 1 total hardness th determination of water hardness is a useful test to measure quality of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses a high level of th does not cause health risk however both extreme degrees of very soft 75 mg l as caco3 and very hard 300 mg l as caco3 are considered as undesirable sappa et al 2014 based on sawyer and mccartly 1967 classification of th table 3 no 1 only 3 of the total groundwater samples are under soft category while 22 53 and 22 are in moderate hard and very hard categories respectively in hard type 16 and 6 belongs to pz and ap respectively the hardness of the water is due to the presence of alkaline earths such as calcium and magnesium hem 1985 freeze and cherry 1979 4 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reducing soil permeability kelly 1951 a high salt concentration and high sodium in water leads to formation of a saline soil and development of an alkali soil respectively for the suitability of water for irrigational use the na or alkali hazard is determined by the absolute and relative concentration of cations which is expressed as sar richards 1954 if water used for irrigation is high in na and low in ca the cation exchange complex may become saturated with na this may result in damaging the soil structure due to dispersion of the clay particles and reduces the plant growth todd 1980 if sar value is greater than 6 9 the irrigation water will cause permeability problems on shrinking and swelling types of clayey soils saleh et al 1999 sar values in the study area vary from 0 73 to 53 62 the average value of sar in pz is higher than those in ap and fp table 2 78 of the total samples belongs to the c1 s1 c2 s1 and c3 s1 categories in c s diagram fig 3a which is considered as good water category for irrigation use this implies that no alkali hazard is anticipated to the crops the groundwater that falls in c3 s2 is considered to be moderate quality to irrigate and c4 s4 is unsuitable for irrigation 22 of samples fall under this categories in which 19 of them belong to piedmont belt table 3 no 2 4 2 3 percent sodium na another method for determination of suitability for agricultural use in groundwater is by calculating na wilcox 1955 fig 3c because na concentration reacts with soil to reduce its permeability todd 1980 na shows excellent to permissible categories for irrigation use except few samples which are under doubtful category 72 of samples belongs to very good to good category 9 belongs to good to permissible category 6 belongs to permissible to doubtful 3 belong to doubtful to unsuitable and 9 belongs to highly unsuitable out of the unsuitable samples 12 of samples are from piedmont area table 3 no 3 4 2 4 permeability index pi the soil permeability is affected by long term use of water influenced by na ca mg and hco3 doneen 1964 proposes pi which has been widely used as an important parameter for determination of suitability for groundwater for irrigation use pi values of groundwater samples range from 17 93 to 93 42 table 1 ap has higher pi values as compared to pz and fp 59 of the groundwater samples fall in class ii and 41 of sample falls under class iii categories fig 3b the waters of classes i and ii in the doneen s diagram are generally good for irrigation purpose whereas class iii is considered as bad quality the samples of category iii contribute 25 of pz 10 of ap and 6 of fp table 3 no 4 4 2 5 kelly s index ki for calculation of ki parameter na measured against ca and mg is considered waters with ki less than 1 is suitable for irrigation while water with ki higher 1 indicates an excess level of na in waters and hence unsuitable for irrigation kelly 1940 sundaray et al 2009 ki is calculated by using the formula kelly s index k i na ca mg where all the ions are expressed in meq l ki in groundwater samples ranges from 0 21 to 14 19 table 1 based on ki values 66 of the samples are suitable and 34 are found unsuitable for irrigation the samples of unsuitable groundwater are from pz 22 ap 9 and fp 3 table 3 no 5 4 2 6 magnesium hazard mh generally ca and mg maintain a state of equilibrium in most groundwater hem 1985 presence of excess mg in groundwater enhances alkalinity of soil thus affecting its quality which in turn decreases crop yield kumar et al 2007 in soil system ca and mg do not function equally and mg degrades the soil structure especially when waters are na dominated and highly saline szabolcs and darab 1964 proposed the magnesium hazard for irrigation water which is expressed as mh mg ca mg 100 where all ions concentrations are in meq l range of mh in the samples is from 31 17 to 70 88 table 1 based on mh values szabolcs and darab 1964 paliwal 1972 50 of samples have more than 50 mh values which can cause detrimental effect on the agricultural yield these unsuitable samples belong to 34 of pz 10 of ap and 6 of fp table 3 no 6 4 2 7 residual sodium carbonate rsc rsc exists in irrigation water when co3 and hco3 concentrations exceed ca and mg contents use of rsc elevated water for irrigation will lead to an accumulation of na in the soil devi et al 2015 high concentration of bicarbonate in soil may increase the ph value rendering it to a condition known as black alkali soil rsc ranges from 15 52 meq l to 43 08 meq l table 1 based on rsc classification eaton 1950 65 of the sample are safe 6 are marginal quality and 28 are unsuitable the unsuitable samples share 19 of pz 6 of ap and 3 of fp table 3 no 7 4 2 8 index of base exchange ibe ibe can be presented by chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and 2 schoeller 1977 and they are determined by the following chloro alkaline index 1 cl na k cl chloro alkaline index 2 cl na k so4 hco3 co3 no3 if there is ion exchange of na and k from water with mg and ca then the exchange is known as direct and the indices are positive if the exchange is in the reverse order then the exchange is indirect and the indices are negative it is found that 66 of the samples 44 from pz 9 ap and 13 fp show negative ratio indicating presence of base exchange between na and k in water with ca and mg in the rocks 5 chemical evolution of groundwater in view of irrigation use chemical evolution of groundwater can be well explained using expanded durov burdon and mazloum 1958 lloyd 1965 concept the groundwater in mv can be grouped into two types of stages of chemical evolution i ion exchange and ii reverse ion exchange fig 4 majority of the samples belong to the former indicating initial stage of chemical evolution than the later which suggest late or matured stage of evolution the ion exchange process where most of the cation are in the process of replacing by anions takes place in all the geomorphic units while reverse ion exchange are mainly occurs in the ap this implies that the flow of chemical evolution of groundwater originates from pz in the disang foothill belt and becomes end member at ap this can be depicted by the hydraulic gradient of water table and head direction shown in the fig 5 and hydrogeologic section fig 6 the information of wells is provided in table 4 the hydraulic head map shows that groundwater flows from foothill areas to the west towards wetlands of ikop pat khoidum pat and pumlen pat the elevations of cl and na also increase along the flow path fig 5 this indicates that the chemical evolution of groundwater takes place along the flow path where water table follows the local topography fig 6 the hydrogeologic section fig 6 prepared using litholog depicts the topographic set up and relevant geomorphic units the mixing of ions starts in the pz which consists of sand mixed with alluvial fan deposits along with disang shales and chemically altered the composition to the end member like cl and na in the thoubal heirok and kakching plains the unsuitable samples for irrigational use are found in the piedmont belt due to saline mineralization as salt springs evaporates halite and gypsum encrustations in the disang shales hence the unsuitability of groundwater for irrigation encountered in piedmont belt is linked to natural salinization and not because of the late or matured stage of chemical evolution 6 conclusion agriculture is the main occupation of nearly 2 million people living in the manipur valley it contributes a major share to the total state domestic product and provides employment to about 22 13 of the total workers in manipur state the geology landscape and rainfall prevailed in this valley make favorable condition for agricultural activities the present paper elucidates the assessment of irrigation index parameters in shallow groundwater for its optimum utilization based on th classification 22 of the samples are not suitable for irrigation in which 16 and 6 belong to pz and ap respectively sar plot shows 19 of piedmont groundwater fall under c3 s2 and c4 s4 categories indicating its unsuitability for irrigation na in wilcox s diagram revealed that 3 and 9 of pz belong to doubtful to unsuitable and highly unsuitable categories respectively pi of samples shows 41 of samples indicates category iii in doneen s diagram representing bad quality for irrigation ki shows 34 of samples are unsuitable for irrigation in which 22 belongs to pz 9 to ap and 3 belongs to fp mh reveals that 50 of samples have more than 50 mh values which can cause detrimental effects on the agricultural yield these unsuitable samples belong to 34 of pz 10 of ap and 6 of fp rsc classification indicates that 65 of the samples are safe 6 are marginal quality and 28 are unsuitable in which 19 6 3 are from pz ap and fp respectively the chemical evolution of groundwater shows ca mg cl hco3 type of hydrochemical facies as the dominating type indicating initial and intermediate stages of chemical evolution under ion mixing process the hydrogeologic section reveals that this initial stage of ion exchange process takes place in pz while intermediate stage of ion mixing takes place around ap and fp most of the unsuitable samples are identified in the initial stage of ion mixing around piedmont belt due to presence of several saline springs in them thus the examination of irrigation parameters on groundwater is useful to delineate unsuitable areas for irrigation such studies will help in developing and managing groundwater resource in the study area acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the directors of national geophysical research

samples are from pz the expanded durov indicates that groundwater is dominated by ca mg cl hco3 facies suggesting initial and intermediate stages of chemical evolution under ion mixing process the hydrogeologic section implies that the initial stage of evolution takes place in pz while intermediate stage undergo in ap and fp the unsuitable groundwater in pz is due to encrustation of gypsum halite and evaporates in disang shales thus the evaluation of common irrigation indices is found useful in assessing the groundwater quality for irrigation in manipur valley graphical abstract fx1

for more than 70 of total water withdrawals and for more than 90 of total consumptive water use doll 2009 fao 2016 shiklomanov et al 2000 the prime sources of water for irrigation are surface water rainfall rivers lakes ponds canal etc and groundwater where groundwater contributes 20 of the global irrigation water withdrawals zektser and everett 2004 aquifer depletion due to agricultural

in many concentrations of intensive agriculture groundwater offers reliability and flexibility in access to water that irrigation canals can hardly match additionally groundwater is generally less prone to pollution than surface water therefore groundwater is the most reliable and easily available resource of freshwater for irrigation when surface water sources have been depleted siebert et al 2010 the suitability of this resource for agricultural activities depends on the hydrochemical and hydrogeological parameters prevailing in a region toth 1970 hesterberg 1998 sophocleous 2002 siebert

for construction of hydrogeologic section in mv 4 results and discussion 4 1 basic hydrochemical parameters the chemical constituents of the water samples along with the sampling sites and its statistical summary are presented in table 1 and 2 respectively the concentration variation of major ions in different geomorphic units is illustrated by box plots in fig 2 it is observed that pz has highly elevated concentrations of na cl and hco3 than ap and fp the order of abundance of major ions is found as hco3 cl na ca mg no3 k so4 and co3 are almost absent in all the samples mean hco3 content contributes 80 4 of total anions where 64 5 are in pz 16 5 in ap and 19 in fp cl on average makes up 18 6 of total anion in which pz ap and fp shares 51 8 38 6 and 9 6 respectively mean na content contributes 47 4 of total anions in which 56 5 25 5 and 18 belong to pz ap and fp respectively 30 5 of total cations are contributed by mean ca concentration it shares 68 7 in pz 16 2 in ap

where the maximum values are found in the piedmont region based on tds classification davis and dewiest 1966 samples belong to two categories which are fresh 1000 mg l and saline 10000 mg l the fresh catagory represents recent water recharge as it is characterized by elevated hco3 and low tds uliana and sharp 2001 the saline type 7032 mg l to 7353 mg l is encountered as salt springs within the piedmont near the foothills of disang hills 4 2 agricultural aspects salinity problem occurs when salt accumulates in the root zone which may significantly affect the quantity of crop production jain et al 2011 todd 1980 thus quantity of dissolved salts is important regarding the quality of groundwater for irrigation purpose water with tds less than 450 mg l is considered good and that with greater than 2000 mg l is unsuitable for agricultural purpose davis and dewiest 1966 the crop productivity is greatly affected by ec as the intake of water by plant reduces with increasing ec westcott and ayers 1984 the ec value higher than 3000 µs cm is considered as unsuitable while value less than 250 µs cm is considered as good for irrigation based on tds and ec values few piedmont groundwater samples 10000 mg l and 3000 µs cm respectively are found unsuitable for agriculture table 3 highlights the result of some of the widely used irrigation index parameters for determining the suitability of the water for irrigational use 4 2 1 total hardness th determination of water hardness is a useful test to measure quality of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses a high level of th does not cause health risk however both extreme degrees of very soft 75 mg l as caco3 and very hard 300 mg l as caco3 are considered as undesirable sappa et al 2014 based on sawyer and mccartly 1967 classification of th table 3 no 1 only 3 of the total groundwater samples are under soft category while 22 53 and 22 are in moderate hard and very hard categories respectively in hard type 16 and 6 belongs to pz and ap respectively the hardness of the water is due to the presence of alkaline earths such as calcium and magnesium hem 1985 freeze and cherry 1979 4 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reducing soil permeability kelly 1951 a high salt concentration and high sodium in water leads to formation of a saline soil and development of an alkali soil respectively for the suitability of water for irrigational use the na or alkali hazard is determined by the absolute and relative concentration of cations which is expressed as sar richards 1954 if water used for irrigation is high in na and low in ca the cation exchange complex may become saturated with na this may result in damaging the soil structure due to dispersion of the clay particles and reduces the plant growth todd 1980 if sar value is greater than 6 9 the irrigation water will cause permeability problems on shrinking and swelling types of clayey soils saleh et al 1999 sar values in the study area vary from 0 73 to 53 62 the average value of sar in pz is higher than those in ap and fp table 2 78 of the total samples belongs to the c1 s1 c2 s1 and c3 s1 categories in c s diagram fig 3a which is considered as good water category for irrigation use this implies that no alkali hazard is anticipated to the crops the groundwater that falls in c3 s2 is considered to be moderate quality to irrigate and c4 s4 is unsuitable for irrigation 22 of samples fall under this categories in which 19 of them belong to piedmont belt table 3 no 2 4 2 3 percent sodium na another method for determination of suitability for agricultural use in groundwater is by calculating na wilcox 1955 fig 3c because na concentration reacts with soil to reduce its permeability todd 1980 na shows excellent to permissible categories for irrigation use except few samples which are under doubtful category 72 of samples belongs to very good to good category 9

piedmont area table 3 no 3 4 2 4 permeability index pi the soil permeability is affected by long term use of water influenced by na ca mg and hco3 doneen 1964 proposes pi which has been widely used as an important parameter for determination of suitability for groundwater for irrigation use pi values of groundwater samples range from 17 93 to 93 42 table 1 ap has higher pi values as compared to pz and fp 59 of the groundwater samples fall in class ii and 41 of sample falls under class iii categories fig 3b the waters of classes i and ii in the doneen s diagram are generally good for irrigation

is in the reverse order then the exchange is indirect and the indices are negative it is found that 66 of the samples 44 from pz 9 ap and 13 fp show negative ratio indicating presence of base exchange between na and k in water with ca and mg in the rocks 5 chemical evolution of groundwater in view of irrigation use chemical evolution of groundwater can be well explained using expanded durov burdon and mazloum 1958 lloyd 1965 concept the groundwater in mv can be grouped into two types of stages of chemical evolution i ion exchange and ii reverse ion exchange fig 4 majority of the samples belong to the former indicating initial stage of chemical evolution than the later which suggest late or matured stage of evolution the ion exchange process where most of the cation are in the process of

groundwater shows ca mg cl hco3 type of hydrochemical facies as the dominating type indicating initial and intermediate stages of chemical evolution under ion mixing process the hydrogeologic section reveals that this initial stage of ion exchange process takes place in pz while intermediate stage of ion mixing takes place around ap and fp most of the unsuitable samples are identified in the initial stage of ion mixing around piedmont belt due to presence of several saline springs in them thus the examination of irrigation parameters on groundwater is useful to delineate unsuitable areas

12319,this special issue of the groundwater for sustainable development contaminant transport and fate in freshwater systems integrating the fields of geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology provides an update of the current knowledge on the sources pathways and movement of anthropogenic and geogenic contaminants in the environment the holistic interactions between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem and the avant garde technologies as innovative strategies for environmental management we aims to provide a future platform for interaction and collaborative efforts between different workers in the scientific field as this issue highlights the three keywords hydro geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology therefore it will facilitate a unique amalgamation of pure as well as applied scientific ideas therefore this combined effort will be much more beneficial and will lead to great developments in the near future this will result in a better understanding of the background processes and the factors controlling the contamination process and therefore contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies and management options this issue also has the broader purposes to influence the policymakers which in turn may lead to greater investments and research grants in the fields covered by the said volume which can ultimately lead to more quality research in these fields keywords contaminants anthropogenic and geogenic hydro geochemistry geomorphology nanotechnology sustainable technologies innovative strategies 1 introduction groundwater is one of the precious sources of natural freshwater which is extensively used by human beings for centuries in multiple sectors starting from domestic agricultural sources to industrial activities around 2 billion people across the globe solely depend on ground and surface water resources in direct or indirect ways for their day to day activities and crop production purposes hughes et al 2012 it is quite noteworthy that the present era of high population growth rapid urbanization and climate change rainfall intensity has become too unpredictable to adequately protect and manage freshwater systems groundwater geology subsurface drainage aquifer geology and other geographical features act as a driver in determining the quality of available water the groundwater chemistry is quite complex and governed by different hydrogeochemical processes like dissolution precipitation oxidation reduction ion exchange adsorption etc the diverse geomorphological characteristics like lithological variations and hydrogeochemical interactions govern the abundance of arsenic fluoride nitrate and salinity in the groundwater curtis et al 2009 it is indeed a grave concern that millions of inhabitants around the globe mostly in underdeveloped and developing countries live near the metal metal loid contaminated areas most commonly arsenic affected ones these contaminants are considered as carcinogens and causing potential threats to agricultural productivity ecological diversity and human health the situation is getting much worse with the appearances of contaminants of emerging concern cecs along with legacy pollutants a detailed study conducted by ashton et al 2004 and kolpin et al 2002 highlighted the rapid occurrences of cecs in the range from ppb to ppm level in another study hughes et al 2012 reported the hazardous prevalence of nearly 180 pharmaceutical products in rivers lakes and other aquatic bodies around the world with a maximum concentration examined for some special group of antibiotics in addition nowadays there are increasing appearances of illicit drugs antimicrobials and other preservatives in the surface water with the rapid usage of personal care products the long term effects of such cecs stemming mostly from their synergistic effects in the aquatic environment show a clear influence of geogenic sources which control the hydrogeochemistry of organic and inorganic pollutants it is therefore a dire necessity to insight into the occurrence fate and ecological impacts of such potentially toxic chemicals on the ecosystem in the era of anthropocene the fate and transport of contaminants is the vital hydrogeochemical process of great environmental significance as it results in greater understanding of the background processes and the factors controlling the contamination process and therefore contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies and management options organic compounds make their pathways in the groundwater regime as non miscible phrase liquid that consists of dissolved solutes or suspended chemical components it is considered to be a potential mass transfer process which changes with respect to time and is associated with concentration gradients and appears as soluble or volatile mass constituents of non miscible phrase to subsurface liquid or solid phases the actual concentrations of solutes in contaminant plumes are variable under different physicochemical parameters like diffusion sorption microbial degradation hydrodynamic dispersion advective flow etc chen et al 2018a 2018b sun et al 1999 although it has been found that advection dispersion theory and related hydrodynamic parameters have a great impact on the contaminants distribution and dispersion through different mediums like fractured porous and tortuous pathways in addition organic contaminants may have some influences from the subsurface microbial environment and many mathematical models have been proposed for determining the microbial growth rates and kinetics kantar et al 2009 the previous researchers have shown that migration and subsequent degradation of contaminants are controlled by multiphase flow processes which include dissolution and volatilization basically a movement through a porous medium is governed by multiple fluid phases which in turn depends on capillary forces along with macro and microscale capillary fringes therefore cleaning up of the aquifer with a facile and eco friendly approach is the need of the hour topic for research in current and past centuries there are many remediation approaches that have already been taken by the researchers to deal with intense contaminants plume depending on plume density surface heterogeneity and existence period of plumes curtis et al 2009 sun et al 1999 sleep et al 2000 have demonstrated the usefulness of in situ methods over ex situ methods of remediation in a series of hydrogeochemical experiments additionally a group of researchers fox et al 2012 stoliker et al 2013 has shown the usefulness of vapor extraction stream injection solubilization and microemulsions chemical oxidations and integral pumping methods for controlling downstream contaminant mass flux in their study they have calculated the involvement of geomorphological and other external factors like pore geometry flow instabilities permeability which are the driving forces for mass discharges across a downstream plane cui et al 2017 the geostatistical approaches including geospatial bayesian monte carlo simulation multilevel sampling fast fourier transformation functions are commonly employed for describing uncertainty in mass discharges and aerobic anaerobic transformation nitrate reduction and transformation processes prigiobbe and bryant 2014 singer et al 2013 chen et al 2018b 2018a have demonstrated the laboratory small scale bioreactor study for explaining the anoxic conditions and related microbial processes the role of terminal electron acceptors the occurrence of methanogenesis diverse biophysical chemical parameters contaminants plume and metabolite formations lead to the mass balance study of contaminants under different conceptual model this is vital for making the roadmap of natural attenuation of contaminants in the dissolved state the slow and fast release of contaminants has been well explained by different dispersion models fickian vs non fickian considering aqueous phase solubility as the active stage of remediation which contradicts high cost removal processes for contaminants resulting from long residence timings in aquifers bearup et al 2012 li and kaplan 2012 any pollution management plan requires an understanding of the source to sink journey of the contaminants this volume focuses on the transport and the ultimate fate of the pollutants in the freshwater system special emphasis will be given on understanding the underlying hydrogeochemistry of the contaminants emerging pollutants eps and surface water groundwater interaction including the impact of surface water pollution on groundwater under different environmental and geomorphological conditions novel techniques like nanotechnology for designing management and remediation options for tackling the problems of freshwater contamination will be another highlighted aspect of this special issue of the journal therefore it will also help to create a great awareness among the scientific community policy makers and common people as a whole 2 layout of the special issue sustainability is the core focus of the journal therefore the goal of this special issue is to highlight the problems of freshwater contamination as well as sustainable management options for this resource the scope of this issue will however be much greater as it aims to understand the dynamics of surface water groundwater contaminant interaction under different environmental conditions across the world this issue also has the potential to influence the policy makers which in turn may lead to greater investments and research grants in the fields which can ultimately lead to more quality research in those fields this special issue consisting of 18 articles which expresses cross disciplinary approaches to illustrate the state of the art methodologies for explaining the contaminants behaviour in freshwater ecosystem the submitted articles can be categorized into four different sections namely 1 leaching pathways and issues of emerging and anthropogenic contaminants 2 fate transport and removal of geogenic contaminants 3 modelling and removal of freshwater contaminants and 4 sustainable solutions for healthy and clean environment 2 1 leaching pathways and issues of emerging and anthropogenic contaminants this section consists of three articles dealing with the fundamental processes responsible for the contaminants movement in the natural geochemical environment and their consequences on environmental quality this section is also enriched in its contents in terms of inclusion of contaminants of emerging concerns stemming from industrial and anthropogenic activities medical sectors to pyro metallurgical treatments of minerals which are the representatives of different industrial regions across the globe starting from antwerp belgium to maharashtra india giri and golder 2018 this issue investigate the new methodologies for cost effective degradation of chloramphenicol chpl which is an important antibiotic drug for controlling different bacterial diseases although such a product is banned in india still some related antibacterial resistant genes are commonly found in many natural water bodies the author investigates the photodegradation of such emerging contaminants in the presence of tio2 nanoparticles though some previous authors have reported the excellent oxidation potential of such particles having excellent photocatalytic efficiency in the removal of different contaminants the authors propose the homolytic cleavage as the principle driving mechanism for the breakdown of the present pharmaceutical product and define the active role of free radicals in the bond cleavage though the pathways of amine chain cleavage and decarbonisation have been shown by the present authors through state of the art methodologies as principle steps of by products generation the authors record the complete inhibition effect of chpl at higher concentration 100 mgl 1 on e coli and also show the growth suppression after 45 min of photo catalytic treatment the proposed photocatalytic process is found to be effective in the removal of more than 90 of chpl with the production of recalcitrant lower molecular weight by products with rapid industrial growth progressive economic surge and population outburst the burden of solid wastes metal smelter slags or pyro metallurgical wastes stemming from ferrous and non ferrous industries have gained popularity due to their open disposal without any proper care this in turn results into migration of toxic leachates from such wastes which find their way into nearby waterbodies saikia et al 2018 this issue have addressed such vital issue and point out the importance of ph effect on metal leaching to determine their ultimate fate the authors have chosen antwerp belgium as a point source of contamination by pb smelter slag wastes consisting of metal and metalloids and put an emphasis on the study of ph dependent leaching behaviour of such slag wastes under different leaching conditions and interpret their geochemical behaviour by suitable numerical modelling this type of study will surely open the roadmap for risk assessment and environmental impact assessment in environmental management strategies the findings of their study are quite significant as the concentrations of metals and metalloids present in the leachates are in high order of magnitudes than their normal permissible limits pb and se which can be a potential threat for groundwater pollution study the leachates are found to have low conductivity with increased ph ranges which in turn also indicate the minimum leaching regions for most of the noxious metals the ph dependence of metal loid leaching curves form a major research hypothesis in their study where the heavy metals like pb cu zn as se and cd have interdependent dissolution characteristics in amphoteric aqueous mixture therefore elements which are ph independent in nature like na k do not have impact on metal leaching as it is proved from their study on the other hand their future messages for environmental safety lie on the warning for the non judicious disposal of basic slag in open environment and their subsequent usages in cement factories leading to environmental threat by alkaline dissolution of high amounts of toxic metal and metalloid species anthropogenic and industrial activities can be a potential constraint in achieving 3 main components of sustainable development goals water food energy among all these components availability of clean water is one of the challenging issues faced by the world today mukate et al 2018 this issue have applied this vital research topic in their paper and conducted a hydro geochemical study at three different industrial sites to find out the vertical and horizontal extension of pollution stemming from industrial effluents on aquatic ecosystem they have studied the influence of seasonal variations amounts of total dissolved solids and other essential water quality parameters to find a correlation between the risks of human health and the massive depletion of sustainable environmental resources the findings from their study reveal the fact that in post monsoon season the concentration of nitrate increases due to recharging of groundwater which are in line with the observations by pujari et al 2007 the present author finds the alkaline nature of groundwater and the acidic nature of surface water from their chemical and statistical evaluation of hydro geochemical parameters which they relate with the improper treatment of industrial effluents open defecation and agricultural activities as also justified by das et al 2004 the presence of chloride nitrate and other alkaline earth metals is found to be effective in diminishing of water quality as also shown by mahlknecht et al 2008 by their stable isotope study 2 2 fate transport and removal of geogenic contaminants the five manuscripts in this section reflect the potential source and transport of the contaminants based on geochemical geospatial and stable isotope characteristics of diverse groundwater locations starting from upper yamuna basin to the foothills of courtallam tamilnadu via u p odisha and western haryana this section is also important in terms of explaining the geomorphological and lithological factors responsible for changing of the groundwater composition and allows a detailed conceptual pathway for water recharge quantification which in turn makes a vital component of groundwater management the first article by panda et al 2018b this issue highlights the theory of geochemical processes along the foothills mf and in the riparian zone rz considering the fact that the quality of water in the subsurface aquifers is getting deteriorated with the progressive agricultural activities the climatic variability near the mf regions and the overall quality relies mostly on the chemical and physical properties of the surrounding rocks the qualitative and quantitative nature of flowing water bodies and the anthropogenic activities the integrated approach of statistics and geochemical evaluation finds the pivotal role of silicate and carbonate weathering in the maintenance of good quality of water the source variations of silica more in mf and carbonates more in rz also determine the dissolution state of individual minerals from the spatial distribution of the present results it is clear that weathering along with dissolution mechanism governs the leaching of many secondary salts which is also supported by the study of panda et al 2018a the present research also throws light on the higher ionic strength and thermodynamic stability of rz regions water and natural minerals in comparison to mf regions in conclusion the authors present a convincing argument of bedrock geology and related parameters governing hydrology and hydrochemistry of water resources under the influence of climate changes through ion relations thermodynamic calculations factor analysis and partial pressure theory of logpco2 to understand the influence of lithology and the variation of land use pattern in the geochemical signatures of groundwater of the above mentioned regions murasingh et al 2018 this issue have reported the combined approach of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis for the exploration of groundwater potential zones in the mining areas which has the potential to become a breakthrough in the field of aquifer research for successful evaluation of assessing monitoring and conserving groundwater resources these types of technological advances are focussing on diverse terrain features like geomorphology slope land use land cover and hydrologic variations which in turn determine the thematic maps of the various geographical locations by suitable satellite data as also shown by chowdhury et al 2008 murthy and mamo 2009 the present authors have applied numerical approaches weighted index overlay model for groundwater potential zones which in turn directly or indirectly vary by the varieties of landform satellite images toposheets and ground level data are useful in integration of different thematic layers based on groundwater potential indices as demonstrated by the present authors in their numerical evaluations for exploration and management of groundwater resources in mining and dense forest area however the authors conclude that before extrapolating the present result for application of surface geophysics to groundwater investigations in broader perspectives the present findings need to be validated with more ground truth data this will enable the users to have the geospatial variations for potential groundwater maps through remotely sensed data groundwater and surface water are acting as a potential source of freshwater the depletion of groundwater in the present era is causing a natural threat to human and environmental health developing countries like india china will face the challenges of water scarcity and availability of clean water by 2030 as suggested by ali et al 2016 to address this vital issue and to check the groundwater quality and recharge along with the availability of clean subsurface water the present authors kumar et al 2018 this issue have combined the holistic approaches by spatio temporal distribution of metals based on together with isotopic and geochemical evaluation of groundwater the present study also conducts a detailed description of water quality like panda et al 2018b this issue in the vicinity of industrial area in northern part of india where no systemic study till now is reported for natural sources of drinking water the authors also take into account the weathering parameters and solute chemistry based on bivariate plots and other hydro chemical tools for detailed characterization of groundwater recharge and weathering processes approximately more than 70 of the samples show a cation anion exchange on the other hand 24 of the collected samples show base exchange reactions the groundwater samples also show that nearly majority 52 of the groundwater samples falls into the ca hco3 water type while remaining 48 are distributed among alkaline earth carbonates bicarbonates category the presence of fluoride in water and the consequent poor quality indices restrict the further use of such tainted water for irrigation and household purposes the contamination of groundwater by fluoride ion is a big issue in north western india several cases of fluorosis and related health issues have been reported by sheikh et al 2017a it has been shown by previous researchers that high concentration of fluoride in groundwater is prevalent across the globe mostly in arid and semi arid climatic zones ali et al 2016 the present article by ali et al 2018 this issue deals with the fluoride contamination problems of siwani block western haryana with the objective to understand the spatial distribution and the possible origin of fluoride in the aquifer which will be helpful in future risk assessment study for the purpose of using water sources for agricultural purposes the result of their study is quite alarming because due to high evapotranspiration process the prevalence of na and mg2 ions in the water raises the ph leading to release of fluoride from secondary clay minerals and enrich groundwater with the concentration much higher ten fold than the permissible limits set by world health organization who after the detailed enumeration of sediment and hydrogeochemistry by bivariate plot piper plot and statistical analysis it has been concluded that occurrence of nitrate magnesium along with fluoride indicates the influence of anthropogenic activities in the affected areas and makes the water unfit for agricultural operations therefore this article invokes for immediate remedial measures in the study area and surroundings to maintain the goals of sustainable development in the framework of holistic groundwater management the similar kind of study by sarkar and shekhar 2018 this issue highlights the groundwater contamination by iron in the northern part of india nct delhi this research establishes a link between the spatial distribution of iron and other contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem the lithological influences and human induced activities are considered as prime factors for diminishing water quality which have direct or indirect effects on human health the heterogeneous nature of the geogenic sediments reveals the iron rich minerals in the aquifers and describe the chemical weathering limitations over geochemical controls the purpose of the study includes a critical evaluation of the possible sources of iron enrichment in water near the alluvial regions and put an emphasis on the obtained results rather than methodological approaches the downstream floodplain of nct is found to be a repository of iron contamination which can be a result of corrosive pipelines and untreated industrial effluents the authors recommend to adopt stringent regulations on metallurgical iron steel unit urgently so that proper replacement can be made with alternative non corrosive or corrosion resistant metal pipeline system for water supply and treatment this type of findings will also help policy decision makers to find sustainable solutions for the correction of anomalous iron contamination in both surface and groundwater which is directly indirectly linked with the land use land cover water quality nexus 2 3 modelling and removal of freshwater contaminants the widespread problems of water and environment pollution are jeopardizing our health and therefore all the concerned people around the globe would like to focus on the contaminants research the research focus has achieved a paradigm shift from conventional organic bio degradable pollutants to emerging or new generation inorganic persistent unregulated contaminants over the last 25 years duration this section is filled up with an impressive and comprehensive information on structurally diverse groups of chemical compounds that have adverse effects on the aquatic environment the research findings that are included in this section six research articles explore the global strength environmental status numerical modelling chemical risk assessment and management strategies of freshwater contaminants with relevant modern techniques and removal measures this section is very much informative and useful in terms of numerical and process based understanding of the qualitative and quantitative measurement of contaminants in the aqueous environment through advanced analytical techniques from ppm to ppb level arora and keshari 2018 this issue have highlighted the importance of re aeration co efficient in maintaining the water quality of the urban rivers yamuna basically re aeration is a global event causing the generation of oxygen through the air water interface advection dispersion and transient storage reactions interrupted flow and partially treated effluents coming from industrial activities are the major reasons behind the poor quality of river ecosystems re aeration process is quite helpful in maintaining the suitable ecology of the stream by maintaining proper oxygen levels although there are many biological chemical and hydrological approaches existing to find the suitable hydrodynamic parameters for numerical evaluation of water quality but most of them are unsuitable for practical application because of their large inputs data and deterministic approaches which are difficult to interpret keeping this in mind the present author has used such machine learning method employing multivariate linear regression mlr model therefore the present objective was designed to set up models using mlr to estimate the re aeration coefficiency k2 which has multipurpose applications on the basis of their output efficiency and to choose best models based on model efficiency parameters rmse r2 and r from the research data it is proved that there is a good correlation r 0 894 between the predictor and response variables therefore the mlr is found to be a suitable tool to depict water quality bod and hydraulic parameters velocity in a more meaningful way further development of the model can be expected with the addition of neural framework like fuzzy logic support vector machine etc this result can be further extrapolated for similar kind of riverine system after coupling with water quality models nitrate pollution is considered to be one of the most threatening pollutions by which water quality is diminishing with the progress of intensive agricultural practices and rapid boom of urbanization this is especially dangerous for the human and environmental health as the water becomes unfit for the uses in agricultural and drinking purposes ref the assessment and prediction of groundwater quality lies is the dire need for planning and management of water resources which can be validated through consistent precise and resilient predictive model there are many physical and mathematical based models which have tried to explain contaminants behaviour in the risk assessment model almasri and kaluarachchi 2005 nayak et al 2004 the present researcher wagh et al 2018 this issue adopt artificial neural network ann model for explaining the poor water quality issues in groundwater of kadava river basin of nasik maharashtra which is already characterized by semi arid climate zone along with intensive farming activities which in turn make the water bad for further uses the present research is based on the development of ann model using different algorithms and to find the suitable algorithms which will be useful for the construction of groundwater resource management plan in nitrate prone area of the catchment the authors have found the ann model quite suitable with the levenberg marquardt three layer traditional back propagation algorithm by the analysis of the model parameters it is coming out that more than 70 of the samples show nitrate concentration along with other water quality input variables tds ec alkali and alkaline earth metals content etc due to the better model efficiency the present model has the potential to predict the water contamination problems the local authorities can use this model along with other agricultural and climate parameters to have the broader concept of depth wise nitrate contamination in geological aquifers section 2 2 already discusses about the harmful consequences of fluoride in groundwater of north western india ali et al 2018 this issue discusses the lithology and potential geochemical features responsible for the prevalence of fluoride in surface and groundwater goswami and kumar 2018 this issue address the low cost and novel biobased remediation technique for the efficient removal of fluoride from aqueous solution their proposed hypothesis is that with the facile and advance modification of rice husk biochar to nanoscale particles will result in high surface to volume ratio which in turn will enhance the sorption efficiency of the nanosorbents the sorption kinetics are investigated with different reaction conditions of sorbates and sorbents this nanoscale adsorbent shows very high removal efficiency 90 removal even with a minimum adsorbent dose 1gl 1 and fast time period 60 min at neutral ph both sorption isotherm model shows better fittings to the data and second order kinetic model explains the removal efficiency of biochar in better mathematical expressions the uptake and removal efficiency depend largely on sorbent dosages and corresponding contact timings therefore the authors recommend to use this promising and cost effective sorbent for large scale after finding its suitability in the presence of other competing ions which will help in roadmaping of suitable and robust water filtration techniques ahamad et al 2018 this issue have pointed out the details about kinetics modelling on different ranges of sorbents starting from activated alumina aa brick powder bp to alum considering the occurrence and prevalence of fluorides in the natural water sources and their consequent human health effects reliable cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies are under development which have social adaptability for long run applications although there are many scalable technologies available in the market they fall short due to their individual advantages and disadvantages as mentioned by goswami and kumar 2018 this issue therefore the present study aims to find insights into fluoride interactions with aa bp and alum through isotherm and kinetic models the results are quite interesting as per given model efficiencies and can arrange the sorbents as per their efficiencies in the following order aa alum bp the multilayer sorption by freundlich model is found to be more effective than other described models elovich langmuir etc the main rate limiting steps are intra particle and film diffusion models govern the sorption kinetics pseudo second order for all studied sorbents the inclusion of error analysis in the present data invalidates the necessity of langmuir models the fifth article of this section by kumari et al 2018 this issue discusses the removal of cong red cr and cr vi in aqueous solution by sustainable ways through mn powder recovered from spent battery waste various adsorbents such as iron oxide van benschoten et al 1994 activated carbon lei et al 2002 and tio2 mahdavi et al 2013 have been investigated for adsorption of metallic and non metallic compounds from aqueous solution among all potential adsorbents manganese oxides mno2 facilitates various active sites for adsorption for heavy metal and also provides site for chemical reaction of contaminants with it kumpiene et al 2008 mno2 also includes oxyanions of heavy metals such as arsenic as and selenium se ergül et al 2014 szlachta and chubar 2013 carlson and knocke 1999 showed the applicability of mno2 in commercial applications also in water treatment however the use of mn powder alone in water treatment system performs well due to its nano size despite of having high surface area for increased adsorption of pollutants therefore the present study focuses on the emerging contaminants along with legacy contaminants for their removal by mn powder the study designs in a meticulous way to have the optimum removal conditions covering different ph dosage of manganese and various concentrations of congo red and hexavalent chromium the chemical characterization of sorbents gives a valuable picture about their surface morphologies the removal efficiencies can be explained by langmuir isotherm model and mn waste shows variable efficiencies in the removal of studied contaminants 45 for cr and 40 for cr though the removal process depends initially on concentrations of added contaminants the desorption rate was faster with acid and alkali treatments for cr and cr vi in solutions wijekoon and yapa 2018 this issue have dealt with the biodegradation of herbicide formulations glyphosate commonly applied for agricultural activities in developing and under developed countries bacteria are considered as one of the most efficient creatures in destroying organic compounds to fulfil their nutritional requirements under different environmental conditions among these plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr such as pseudomonas sp are considered as the most important drivers because of their isolation from rhizosphere containing glyphosate degrading bacteria vessey 2003 therefore the present study designs the application of different dosages of glyphosate on different microbial consortium present in soil mixed culture and checks their degradation potential towards glyphosates widely present in contaminated soil and aquifers under in vitro conditions the results reveal that pseudomonas sp bacillus sp which are isolated from native forest soil show significant growth mild to low concentrations 50 100 mg ml 1 and able to degrade glyphosate efficiently additionally it is noteworthy that the mixed culture 1 5 108 cfu ml 1 of pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp which are isolated gradually from glyphosate contaminated field can have the potential to degrade glyphosate even at high concentrations 150 mg ml 1 although the negative effects of glyphosate on individual soil bacteria at high dosages can be a matter of future research finally these findings will translate into biotechnological transgenic approaches which will help to clean up and restore herbicides contaminated soil aquifers by potential rhizosphere bacteria 2 4 sustainable solutions for healthy and clean environment this section comprises of four articles that focus on the low cost facile novel and scalable technologies employed for achieving the goals of a sustainable environment with a central focus on the supply of clean water in the anthropocene era there are a number of water related issues emerging from the non sustainable water management practices like decrease of the level of groundwater disappearances of wetlands and non availability of clean water and overexploitation of freshwater that is becoming a threat to meet the current societal need of freshwater a balance between a sustainable ecosystem and human requirements should be connected with new knowledge and technologies therefore the present section is a collective forum consists of 4 research articles for an appropriate planning and an integrated framework in harmony with the environment which has focused on the water security challenges with ecosystem services in the context of diverse ecological footprint to understand their complex properties that have changed the basic support systems of natural ecosystem leading to potential understanding of the local context and developing further course of sustainable actions and local solutions based on ground realities this will sum up into a biobased solution for a sustainable future the first article by kumari et al 2018 this issue focusses on the removal of hexavalent cr vi from the aqueous solution by nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi magnetite corn cob silica mccs as pointed out in section 2 3 that the quality of water is getting deteriorated by increasing industrial growth and rapid urbanization therefore the contamination by heavy metals is getting a major concern nowadays particularly for a developing country like india the authors propose a hypothesis that the nanoparticles impregnated over a solid matrix may accelerate the efficiency of iron nanoparticles at suitable doses and make faster clean up of toxic effluents considering the cost effectiveness of corn cobs and easy availability the authors conduct the present research with the objectives to synthesize a low cost nano adsorbent for the removal of the targeted metals which is facilitated by different physic chemical processes the results are convincing in the way that the hybridized nano composite is found very much effective in the removal 95 of cr vi depending on solution ph and temperature the embedded silica in the nano composite helps in increasing the surface area of the synthesized materials the chemical characterization reveals the presence of electrostatic bonding in the conjugate materials which promotes faster removal and easy separation of magnetic materials which follows the pseudo second order kinetics the authors suggest that the large scale application may be useful to draw any final conclusion for wastewater application gunathilakae et al 2018 this issue in their paper highlights the water pollution problems by toxic cadmium cd which is a growing concern for human health and the surroundings they have focused on the cheapest and effective method of removal based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf which has a host mutuality with eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth as suggested by miransari 2011 it is hypothesized that the impact of amf on the production of stress enzymes called phytochelatins pcs are composed of cysteine rich peptides and consequently get involved in metal detoxification therefore the present study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of amf on the phytoremediation efficiency of water hyacinth for the targeted metal compound and also to prove the metal hyper accumulation ability of water hyacinth on different concentration of cd the findings are quite interesting because it is proved from the present study that eichhornia crassipes has an immense potential to withstand cd concentrations in the hydrogeosphere amf has a great potential in the growth of water hyacinth through symbiosis nutrient transfer process and enhances the cd uptake in both roots and shoots with a level more than 0 20 ppm therefore a positive correlation has been established between amf colonization and relative growth rates of plants whereas immobilization potential of cd from soil and amf inoculation shows a negative correlation matrix the authors have proved the augmenting potential of amf inoculated water hyacinth for cleaning up of noxious cd from aquatic bodies arsalan et al 2018 this issue have addressed a vital topic of research considering the purification of electrolyte solution by polyvinyl chloride pvc based sn tungusto arsenate composite membrane tta which are prepared by sol gel methods the hybridization of inorganic and polymer materials can result into super active membranes that have huge potential in industrial applications than other conventional membranes chen 2004 khan and paquiza 2011 a lot of advantages and improvements can be accessed through such novel membrane electrical catalytic and optical which are quite vital for the optimum industrial performances combined with the transportation properties of the synthesized membranes the synthesized membrane has very good potential for attracting cations and has good surface charge density the membrane has a good potential and charge density for the following electrolytes which follows the order kcl nacl licl and kcl nacl licl respectively therefore it is hypothesized that pvc and tta based materials can go for long run in terms of mechanical thermal and chemical stabilities pavithra and yapa 2018 this issue have undergone an interesting study considering the symbiotic relationship of arbuscular fungi amf with plants and their subsequent uses for increasing plant water use efficiency during water stress this is regarded as a vital issue in sustainable groundwater management in the current scenario of climate change and climate smart agriculture conservation of water for the dry period of a year is utmost important for agricultural activities and to cope up with the associated climate change proline a hydrophobic nitrogen containing protectant gets highly accumulated in plants under the condition of disturbed physiological condition induced by biotic or abiotic stress conditions such as exposure of plants to drought salinity cold etc as explained by ábrahám et al 2003 verbruggen and hermans 2008 the objectives of this research rely on the study of the effect of amf inoculation on physiological plant traits and also on proline accumulation rate to increase the sustainable use of water during drought they have concluded that biofertilization with amf significantly increase growth yield and drought tolerance of the test plant soybean under stress condition such kind of biofertilization also helps in increasing soil moisture content with 50 ml of irrigation and colonization of amf surrounding the plant nodules therefore it is strongly advisable to use such inoculation strategies which will help in sustainable food production without having high input costs for irrigations and help farmers to mitigate the food security challenges for the developed and developing nations by decorous management of ground and surface water 3 conclusion this special volume articles highlight on some of the latest issues affecting the surface and groundwater systems including nutrients geogenic contaminants as well as the emerging pollutants eps which are new chemicals without regulatory status as there is no proper database concerning their environmental impact and at the same time their implications on human health is poorly understood we are expecting that discussions embedded in this special issue will be truly international in its coverage yet it could reveal or highlight some of the more localized new and obscure cases of contamination and their management which could be of greater relevance to the scientific world integrating the fields of geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology to study a contemporary issue like freshwater contamination in itself is a novelty as it will lead to a better understanding and progress in this important issue acknowledgements this special issue would not

12319,this special issue of the groundwater for sustainable development contaminant transport and fate in freshwater systems integrating the fields of geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology provides an update of the current knowledge on the sources pathways and movement of anthropogenic and geogenic contaminants in the environment the holistic interactions between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem and the avant garde technologies as innovative strategies for environmental management we aims to provide a future platform for interaction and collaborative efforts between different workers in the scientific field as this issue highlights the three keywords hydro geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology therefore it will facilitate a unique amalgamation of pure as well as applied scientific ideas therefore this combined effort will be much more beneficial and will lead to great developments in the near future this will result in a better understanding of the background processes and the factors controlling the contamination process and therefore contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies and management options this issue also has the broader purposes to influence the policymakers which in turn may lead to greater investments and research grants in the fields covered by the said volume which can ultimately lead to more quality research in these fields keywords contaminants anthropogenic and geogenic hydro geochemistry geomorphology nanotechnology sustainable technologies innovative strategies 1 introduction groundwater is one of the precious sources of natural freshwater which is extensively used by human beings for centuries in multiple sectors starting from domestic agricultural sources to industrial activities around 2 billion people across the globe solely depend on ground and surface water resources in direct or indirect ways for their day to day activities and crop production purposes hughes et al 2012 it is quite noteworthy that the present era of high population growth rapid urbanization and climate change rainfall intensity has become too unpredictable to adequately protect and manage freshwater systems groundwater geology subsurface drainage aquifer geology and other geographical features act as a driver in determining the quality of available water the groundwater chemistry is quite complex and governed by different hydrogeochemical processes like dissolution precipitation oxidation reduction ion exchange adsorption etc the diverse geomorphological characteristics like lithological variations and hydrogeochemical interactions govern the abundance of arsenic fluoride nitrate and salinity in the groundwater curtis et al 2009 it is indeed a grave concern that millions of inhabitants around the globe mostly in underdeveloped and developing countries live near the metal metal loid contaminated areas most commonly arsenic affected ones these contaminants are considered as carcinogens and causing potential threats to agricultural productivity ecological diversity and human health the situation is getting much worse with the appearances of contaminants of emerging concern cecs along with legacy pollutants a detailed study conducted by ashton et al 2004 and kolpin et al 2002 highlighted the rapid occurrences of cecs in the range from ppb to ppm level in another study hughes et al 2012 reported the hazardous prevalence of nearly 180 pharmaceutical products in rivers lakes and other aquatic bodies around the world with a maximum concentration examined for some special group of antibiotics in addition nowadays there are increasing appearances of illicit drugs antimicrobials and other preservatives in the surface water with the rapid usage of personal care products the long term effects of such cecs stemming mostly from their synergistic effects in the aquatic environment show a clear influence of geogenic sources which control the hydrogeochemistry of organic and inorganic pollutants it is therefore a dire necessity to insight into the occurrence fate and ecological impacts of such potentially toxic chemicals on the ecosystem in the era of anthropocene the fate and transport of contaminants is the vital hydrogeochemical process of great environmental significance as it results in greater understanding of the background processes and the factors controlling the contamination process and therefore contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies and management options organic compounds make their pathways in the groundwater regime as non miscible phrase liquid that consists of dissolved solutes or suspended chemical components it is considered to be a potential mass transfer process which changes with respect to time and is associated with concentration gradients and appears as soluble or volatile mass constituents of non miscible phrase to subsurface liquid or solid phases the actual concentrations of solutes in contaminant plumes are variable under different physicochemical parameters like diffusion sorption microbial degradation hydrodynamic dispersion advective flow etc chen et al 2018a 2018b sun et al 1999 although it has been found that advection dispersion theory and related hydrodynamic parameters have a great impact on the contaminants distribution and dispersion through different mediums like fractured porous and tortuous pathways in addition organic contaminants may have some influences from the subsurface microbial environment and many mathematical models have been proposed for determining the microbial growth rates and kinetics kantar et al 2009 the previous researchers have shown that migration and subsequent degradation of contaminants are controlled by multiphase flow processes which include dissolution and volatilization basically a movement through a porous medium is governed by multiple fluid phases which in turn depends on capillary forces along with macro and microscale capillary fringes therefore cleaning up of the aquifer with a facile and eco friendly approach is the need of the hour topic for research in current and past centuries there are many remediation approaches that have already been taken by the researchers to deal with intense contaminants plume depending on plume density surface heterogeneity and existence period of plumes curtis et al 2009 sun et al 1999 sleep et al 2000 have demonstrated the usefulness of in situ methods over ex situ methods of remediation in a series of hydrogeochemical experiments additionally a group of researchers fox et al 2012 stoliker et al 2013 has shown the usefulness of vapor extraction stream injection solubilization and microemulsions chemical oxidations and integral pumping methods for controlling downstream contaminant mass flux in their study they have calculated the involvement of geomorphological and other external factors like pore geometry flow instabilities permeability which are the driving forces for mass discharges across a downstream plane cui et al 2017 the geostatistical approaches including geospatial bayesian monte carlo simulation multilevel sampling fast fourier transformation functions are commonly employed for describing uncertainty in mass discharges and aerobic anaerobic transformation nitrate reduction and transformation processes prigiobbe and bryant 2014 singer et al 2013 chen et al 2018b 2018a have demonstrated the laboratory small scale bioreactor study for explaining the anoxic conditions and related microbial processes the role of terminal electron acceptors the occurrence of methanogenesis diverse biophysical chemical parameters contaminants plume and metabolite formations lead to the mass balance study of contaminants under different conceptual model this is vital for making the roadmap of natural attenuation of contaminants in the dissolved state the slow and fast release of contaminants has been well explained by different dispersion models fickian vs non fickian considering aqueous phase solubility as the active stage of remediation which contradicts high cost removal processes for contaminants resulting from long residence timings in aquifers bearup et al 2012 li and kaplan 2012 any pollution management plan requires an understanding of the source to sink journey of the contaminants this volume focuses on the transport and the ultimate fate of the pollutants in the freshwater system special emphasis will be given on understanding the underlying hydrogeochemistry of the contaminants emerging pollutants eps and surface water groundwater interaction including the impact of surface water pollution on groundwater under different environmental and geomorphological conditions novel techniques like nanotechnology for designing management and remediation options for tackling the problems of freshwater contamination will be another highlighted aspect of this special issue of the journal therefore it will also help to create a great awareness among the scientific community policy makers and common people as a whole 2 layout of the special issue sustainability is the core focus of the journal therefore the goal of this special issue is to highlight the problems of freshwater contamination as well as sustainable management options for this resource the scope of this issue will however be much greater as it aims to understand the dynamics of surface water groundwater contaminant interaction under different environmental conditions across the world this issue also has the potential to influence the policy makers which in turn may lead to greater investments and research grants in the fields which can ultimately lead to more quality research in those fields this special issue consisting of 18 articles which expresses cross disciplinary approaches to illustrate the state of the art methodologies for explaining the contaminants behaviour in freshwater ecosystem the submitted articles can be categorized into four different sections namely 1 leaching pathways and issues of emerging and anthropogenic contaminants 2 fate transport and removal of geogenic contaminants 3 modelling and removal of freshwater contaminants and 4 sustainable solutions for healthy and clean environment 2 1 leaching pathways and issues of emerging and anthropogenic contaminants this section consists of three articles dealing with the fundamental processes responsible for the contaminants movement in the natural geochemical environment and their consequences on environmental quality this section is also enriched in its contents in terms of inclusion of contaminants of emerging concerns stemming from industrial and anthropogenic activities medical sectors to pyro metallurgical treatments of minerals which are the representatives of different industrial regions across the globe starting from antwerp belgium to maharashtra india giri and golder 2018 this issue investigate the new methodologies for cost effective degradation of chloramphenicol chpl which is an important antibiotic drug for controlling different bacterial diseases although such a product is banned in india still some related antibacterial resistant genes are commonly found in many natural water bodies the author investigates the photodegradation of such emerging contaminants in the presence of tio2 nanoparticles though some previous authors have reported the excellent oxidation potential of such particles having excellent photocatalytic efficiency in the removal of different contaminants the authors propose the homolytic cleavage as the principle driving mechanism for the breakdown of the present pharmaceutical product and define the active role of free radicals in the bond cleavage though the pathways of amine chain cleavage and decarbonisation have been shown by the present authors through state of the art methodologies as principle steps of by products generation the authors record the complete inhibition effect of chpl at higher concentration 100 mgl 1 on e coli and also show the growth suppression after 45 min of photo catalytic treatment the proposed photocatalytic process is found to be effective in the removal of more than 90 of chpl with the production of recalcitrant lower molecular weight by products with rapid industrial growth progressive economic surge and population outburst the burden of solid wastes metal smelter slags or pyro metallurgical wastes stemming from ferrous and non ferrous industries have gained popularity due to their open disposal without any proper care this in turn results into migration of toxic leachates from such wastes which find their way into nearby waterbodies saikia et al 2018 this issue have addressed such vital issue and point out the importance of ph effect on metal leaching to determine their ultimate fate the authors have chosen antwerp belgium as a point source of contamination by pb smelter slag wastes consisting of metal and metalloids and put an emphasis on the study of ph dependent leaching behaviour of such slag wastes under different leaching conditions and interpret their geochemical behaviour by suitable numerical modelling this type of study will surely open the roadmap for risk assessment and environmental impact assessment in environmental management strategies the findings of their study are quite significant as the concentrations of metals and metalloids present in the leachates are in high order of magnitudes than their normal permissible limits pb and se which can be a potential threat for groundwater pollution study the leachates are found to have low conductivity with increased ph ranges which in turn also indicate the minimum leaching regions for most of the noxious metals the ph dependence of metal loid leaching curves form a major research hypothesis in their study where the heavy metals like pb cu zn as se and cd have interdependent dissolution characteristics in amphoteric aqueous mixture therefore elements which are ph independent in nature like na k do not have impact on metal leaching as it is proved from their study on the other hand their future messages for environmental safety lie on the warning for the non judicious disposal of basic slag in open environment and their subsequent usages in cement factories leading to environmental threat by alkaline dissolution of high amounts of toxic metal and metalloid species anthropogenic and industrial activities can be a potential constraint in achieving 3 main components of sustainable development goals water food energy among all these components availability of clean water is one of the challenging issues faced by the world today mukate et al 2018 this issue have applied this vital research topic in their paper and conducted a hydro geochemical study at three different industrial sites to find out the vertical and horizontal extension of pollution stemming from industrial effluents on aquatic ecosystem they have studied the influence of seasonal variations amounts of total dissolved solids and other essential water quality parameters to find a correlation between the risks of human health and the massive depletion of sustainable environmental resources the findings from their study reveal the fact that in post monsoon season the concentration of nitrate increases due to recharging of groundwater which are in line with the observations by pujari et al 2007 the present author finds the alkaline nature of groundwater and the acidic nature of surface water from their chemical and statistical evaluation of hydro geochemical parameters which they relate with the improper treatment of industrial effluents open defecation and agricultural activities as also justified by das et al 2004 the presence of chloride nitrate and other alkaline earth metals is found to be effective in diminishing of water quality as also shown by mahlknecht et al 2008 by their stable isotope study 2 2 fate transport and removal of geogenic contaminants the five manuscripts in this section reflect the potential source and transport of the contaminants based on geochemical geospatial and stable isotope characteristics of diverse groundwater locations starting from upper yamuna basin to the foothills of courtallam tamilnadu via u p odisha and western haryana this section is also important in terms of explaining the geomorphological and lithological factors responsible for changing of the groundwater composition and allows a detailed conceptual pathway for water recharge quantification which in turn makes a vital component of groundwater management the first article by panda et al 2018b this issue highlights the theory of geochemical processes along the foothills mf and in the riparian zone rz considering the fact that the quality of water in the subsurface aquifers is getting deteriorated with the progressive agricultural activities the climatic variability near the mf regions and the overall quality relies mostly on the chemical and physical properties of the surrounding rocks the qualitative and quantitative nature of flowing water bodies and the anthropogenic activities the integrated approach of statistics and geochemical evaluation finds the pivotal role of silicate and carbonate weathering in the maintenance of good quality of water the source variations of silica more in mf and carbonates more in rz also determine the dissolution state of individual minerals from the spatial distribution of the present results it is clear that weathering along with dissolution mechanism governs the leaching of many secondary salts which is also supported by the study of panda et al 2018a the present research also throws light on the higher ionic strength and thermodynamic stability of rz regions water and natural minerals in comparison to mf regions in conclusion the authors present a convincing argument of bedrock geology and related parameters governing hydrology and hydrochemistry of water resources under the influence of climate changes through ion relations thermodynamic calculations factor analysis and partial pressure theory of logpco2 to understand the influence of lithology and the variation of land use pattern in the geochemical signatures of groundwater of the above mentioned regions murasingh et al 2018 this issue have reported the combined approach of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis for the exploration of groundwater potential zones in the mining areas which has the potential to become a breakthrough in the field of aquifer research for successful evaluation of assessing monitoring and conserving groundwater resources these types of technological advances are focussing on diverse terrain features like geomorphology slope land use land cover and hydrologic variations which in turn determine the thematic maps of the various geographical locations by suitable satellite data as also shown by chowdhury et al 2008 murthy and mamo 2009 the present authors have applied numerical approaches weighted index overlay model for groundwater potential zones which in turn directly or indirectly vary by the varieties of landform satellite images toposheets and ground level data are useful in integration of different thematic layers based on groundwater potential indices as demonstrated by the present authors in their numerical evaluations for exploration and management of groundwater resources in mining and dense forest area however the authors conclude that before extrapolating the present result for application of surface geophysics to groundwater investigations in broader perspectives the present findings need to be validated with more ground truth data this will enable the users to have the geospatial variations for potential groundwater maps through remotely sensed data groundwater and surface water are acting as a potential source of freshwater the depletion of groundwater in the present era is causing a natural threat to human and environmental health developing countries like india china will face the challenges of water scarcity and availability of clean water by 2030 as suggested by ali et al 2016 to address this vital issue and to check the groundwater quality and recharge along with the availability of clean subsurface water the present authors kumar et al 2018 this issue have combined the holistic approaches by spatio temporal distribution of metals based on together with isotopic and geochemical evaluation of groundwater the present study also conducts a detailed description of water quality like panda et al 2018b this issue in the vicinity of industrial area in northern part of india where no systemic study till now is reported for natural sources of drinking water the authors also take into account the weathering parameters and solute chemistry based on bivariate plots and other hydro chemical tools for detailed characterization of groundwater recharge and weathering processes approximately more than 70 of the samples show a cation anion exchange on the other hand 24 of the collected samples show base exchange reactions the groundwater samples also show that nearly majority 52 of the groundwater samples falls into the ca hco3 water type while remaining 48 are distributed among alkaline earth carbonates bicarbonates category the presence of fluoride in water and the consequent poor quality indices restrict the further use of such tainted water for irrigation and household purposes the contamination of groundwater by fluoride ion is a big issue in north western india several cases of fluorosis and related health issues have been reported by sheikh et al 2017a it has been shown by previous researchers that high concentration of fluoride in groundwater is prevalent across the globe mostly in arid and semi arid climatic zones ali et al 2016 the present article by ali et al 2018 this issue deals with the fluoride contamination problems of siwani block western haryana with the objective to understand the spatial distribution and the possible origin of fluoride in the aquifer which will be helpful in future risk assessment study for the purpose of using water sources for agricultural purposes the result of their study is quite alarming because due to high evapotranspiration process the prevalence of na and mg2 ions in the water raises the ph leading to release of fluoride from secondary clay minerals and enrich groundwater with the concentration much higher ten fold than the permissible limits set by world health organization who after the detailed enumeration of sediment and hydrogeochemistry by bivariate plot piper plot and statistical analysis it has been concluded that occurrence of nitrate magnesium along with fluoride indicates the influence of anthropogenic activities in the affected areas and makes the water unfit for agricultural operations therefore this article invokes for immediate remedial measures in the study area and surroundings to maintain the goals of sustainable development in the framework of holistic groundwater management the similar kind of study by sarkar and shekhar 2018 this issue highlights the groundwater contamination by iron in the northern part of india nct delhi this research establishes a link between the spatial distribution of iron and other contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem the lithological influences and human induced activities are considered as prime factors for diminishing water quality which have direct or indirect effects on human health the heterogeneous nature of the geogenic sediments reveals the iron rich minerals in the aquifers and describe the chemical weathering limitations over geochemical controls the purpose of the study includes a critical evaluation of the possible sources of iron enrichment in water near the alluvial regions and put an emphasis on the obtained results rather than methodological approaches the downstream floodplain of nct is found to be a repository of iron contamination which can be a result of corrosive pipelines and untreated industrial effluents the authors recommend to adopt stringent regulations on metallurgical iron steel unit urgently so that proper replacement can be made with alternative non corrosive or corrosion resistant metal pipeline system for water supply and treatment this type of findings will also help policy decision makers to find sustainable solutions for the correction of anomalous iron contamination in both surface and groundwater which is directly indirectly linked with the land use land cover water quality nexus 2 3 modelling and removal of freshwater contaminants the widespread problems of water and environment pollution are jeopardizing our health and therefore all the concerned people around the globe would like to focus on the contaminants research the research focus has achieved a paradigm shift from conventional organic bio degradable pollutants to emerging or new generation inorganic persistent unregulated contaminants over the last 25 years duration this section is filled up with an impressive and comprehensive information on structurally diverse groups of chemical compounds that have adverse effects on the aquatic environment the research findings that are included in this section six research articles explore the global strength environmental status numerical modelling chemical risk assessment and management strategies of freshwater contaminants with relevant modern techniques and removal measures this section is very much informative and useful in terms of numerical and process based understanding of the qualitative and quantitative measurement of contaminants in the aqueous environment through advanced analytical techniques from ppm to ppb level arora and keshari 2018 this issue have highlighted the importance of re aeration co efficient in maintaining the water quality of the urban rivers yamuna basically re aeration is a global event causing the generation of oxygen through the air water interface advection dispersion and transient storage reactions interrupted flow and partially treated effluents coming from industrial activities are the major reasons behind the poor quality of river ecosystems re aeration process is quite helpful in maintaining the suitable ecology of the stream by maintaining proper oxygen levels although there are many biological chemical and hydrological approaches existing to find the suitable hydrodynamic parameters for numerical evaluation of water quality but most of them are unsuitable for practical application because of their large inputs data and deterministic approaches which are difficult to interpret keeping this in mind the present author has used such machine learning method employing multivariate linear regression mlr model therefore the present objective was designed to set up models using mlr to estimate the re aeration coefficiency k2 which has multipurpose applications on the basis of their output efficiency and to choose best models based on model efficiency parameters rmse r2 and r from the research data it is proved that there is a good correlation r 0 894 between the predictor and response variables therefore the mlr is found to be a suitable tool to depict water quality bod and hydraulic parameters velocity in a more meaningful way further development of the model can be expected with the addition of neural framework like fuzzy logic support vector machine etc this result can be further extrapolated for similar kind of riverine system after coupling with water quality models nitrate pollution is considered to be one of the most threatening pollutions by which water quality is diminishing with the progress of intensive agricultural practices and rapid boom of urbanization this is especially dangerous for the human and environmental health as the water becomes unfit for the uses in agricultural and drinking purposes ref the assessment and prediction of groundwater quality lies is the dire need for planning and management of water resources which can be validated through consistent precise and resilient predictive model there are many physical and mathematical based models which have tried to explain contaminants behaviour in the risk assessment model almasri and kaluarachchi 2005 nayak et al 2004 the present researcher wagh et al 2018 this issue adopt artificial neural network ann model for explaining the poor water quality issues in groundwater of kadava river basin of nasik maharashtra which is already characterized by semi arid climate zone along with intensive farming activities which in turn make the water bad for further uses the present research is based on the development of ann model using different algorithms and to find the suitable algorithms which will be useful for the construction of groundwater resource management plan in nitrate prone area of the catchment the authors have found the ann model quite suitable with the levenberg marquardt three layer traditional back propagation algorithm by the analysis of the model parameters it is coming out that more than 70 of the samples show nitrate concentration along with other water quality input variables tds ec alkali and alkaline earth metals content etc due to the better model efficiency the present model has the potential to predict the water contamination problems the local authorities can use this model along with other agricultural and climate parameters to have the broader concept of depth wise nitrate contamination in geological aquifers section 2 2 already discusses about the harmful consequences of fluoride in groundwater of north western india ali et al 2018 this issue discusses the lithology and potential geochemical features responsible for the prevalence of fluoride in surface and groundwater goswami and kumar 2018 this issue address the low cost and novel biobased remediation technique for the efficient removal of fluoride from aqueous solution their proposed hypothesis is that with the facile and advance modification of rice husk biochar to nanoscale particles will result in high surface to volume ratio which in turn will enhance the sorption efficiency of the nanosorbents the sorption kinetics are investigated with different reaction conditions of sorbates and sorbents this nanoscale adsorbent shows very high removal efficiency 90 removal even with a minimum adsorbent dose 1gl 1 and fast time period 60 min at neutral ph both sorption isotherm model shows better fittings to the data and second order kinetic model explains the removal efficiency of biochar in better mathematical expressions the uptake and removal efficiency depend largely on sorbent dosages and corresponding contact timings therefore the authors recommend to use this promising and cost effective sorbent for large scale after finding its suitability in the presence of other competing ions which will help in roadmaping of suitable and robust water filtration techniques ahamad et al 2018 this issue have pointed out the details about kinetics modelling on different ranges of sorbents starting from activated alumina aa brick powder bp to alum considering the occurrence and prevalence of fluorides in the natural water sources and their consequent human health effects reliable cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies are under development which have social adaptability for long run applications although there are many scalable technologies available in the market they fall short due to their individual advantages and disadvantages as mentioned by goswami and kumar 2018 this issue therefore the present study aims to find insights into fluoride interactions with aa bp and alum through isotherm and kinetic models the results are quite interesting as per given model efficiencies and can arrange the sorbents as per their efficiencies in the following order aa alum bp the multilayer sorption by freundlich model is found to be more effective than other described models elovich langmuir etc the main rate limiting steps are intra particle and film diffusion models govern the sorption kinetics pseudo second order for all studied sorbents the inclusion of error analysis in the present data invalidates the necessity of langmuir models the fifth article of this section by kumari et al 2018 this issue discusses the removal of cong red cr and cr vi in aqueous solution by sustainable ways through mn powder recovered from spent battery waste various adsorbents such as iron oxide van benschoten et al 1994 activated carbon lei et al 2002 and tio2 mahdavi et al 2013 have been investigated for adsorption of metallic and non metallic compounds from aqueous solution among all potential adsorbents manganese oxides mno2 facilitates various active sites for adsorption for heavy metal and also provides site for chemical reaction of contaminants with it kumpiene et al 2008 mno2 also includes oxyanions of heavy metals such as arsenic as and selenium se ergül et al 2014 szlachta and chubar 2013 carlson and knocke 1999 showed the applicability of mno2 in commercial applications also in water treatment however the use of mn powder alone in water treatment system performs well due to its nano size despite of having high surface area for increased adsorption of pollutants therefore the present study focuses on the emerging contaminants along with legacy contaminants for their removal by mn powder the study designs in a meticulous way to have the optimum removal conditions covering different ph dosage of manganese and various concentrations of congo red and hexavalent chromium the chemical characterization of sorbents gives a valuable picture about their surface morphologies the removal efficiencies can be explained by langmuir isotherm model and mn waste shows variable efficiencies in the removal of studied contaminants 45 for cr and 40 for cr though the removal process depends initially on concentrations of added contaminants the desorption rate was faster with acid and alkali treatments for cr and cr vi in solutions wijekoon and yapa 2018 this issue have dealt with the biodegradation of herbicide formulations glyphosate commonly applied for agricultural activities in developing and under developed countries bacteria are considered as one of the most efficient creatures in destroying organic compounds to fulfil their nutritional requirements under different environmental conditions among these plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr such as pseudomonas sp are considered as the most important drivers because of their isolation from rhizosphere containing glyphosate degrading bacteria vessey 2003 therefore the present study designs the application of different dosages of glyphosate on different microbial consortium present in soil mixed culture and checks their degradation potential towards glyphosates widely present in contaminated soil and aquifers under in vitro conditions the results reveal that pseudomonas sp bacillus sp which are isolated from native forest soil show significant growth mild to low concentrations 50 100 mg ml 1 and able to degrade glyphosate efficiently additionally it is noteworthy that the mixed culture 1 5 108 cfu ml 1 of pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp which are isolated gradually from glyphosate contaminated field can have the potential to degrade glyphosate even at high concentrations 150 mg ml 1 although the negative effects of glyphosate on individual soil bacteria at high dosages can be a matter of future research finally these findings will translate into biotechnological transgenic approaches which will help to clean up and restore herbicides contaminated soil aquifers by potential rhizosphere bacteria 2 4 sustainable solutions for healthy and clean environment this section comprises of four articles that focus on the low cost facile novel and scalable technologies employed for achieving the goals of a sustainable environment with a central focus on the supply of clean water in the anthropocene era there are a number of water related issues emerging from the non sustainable water management practices like decrease of the level of groundwater disappearances of wetlands and non availability of clean water and overexploitation of freshwater that is becoming a threat to meet the current societal need of freshwater a balance between a sustainable ecosystem and human requirements should be connected with new knowledge and technologies therefore the present section is a collective forum consists of 4 research articles for an appropriate planning and an integrated framework in harmony with the environment which has focused on the water security challenges with ecosystem services in the context of diverse ecological footprint to understand their complex properties that have changed the basic support systems of natural ecosystem leading to potential understanding of the local context and developing further course of sustainable actions and local solutions based on ground realities this will sum up into a biobased solution for a sustainable future the first article by kumari et al 2018 this issue focusses on the removal of hexavalent cr vi from the aqueous solution by nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi magnetite corn cob silica mccs as pointed out in section 2 3 that the quality of water is getting deteriorated by increasing industrial growth and rapid urbanization therefore the contamination by heavy metals is getting a major concern nowadays particularly for a developing country like india the authors propose a hypothesis that the nanoparticles impregnated over a solid matrix may accelerate the efficiency of iron nanoparticles at suitable doses and make faster clean up of toxic effluents considering the cost effectiveness of corn cobs and easy availability the authors conduct the present research with the objectives to synthesize a low cost nano adsorbent for the removal of the targeted metals which is facilitated by different physic chemical processes the results are convincing in the way that the hybridized nano composite is found very much effective in the removal 95 of cr vi depending on solution ph and temperature the embedded silica in the nano composite helps in increasing the surface area of the synthesized materials the chemical characterization reveals the presence of electrostatic bonding in the conjugate materials which promotes faster removal and easy separation of magnetic materials which follows the pseudo second order kinetics the authors suggest that the large scale application may be useful to draw any final conclusion for wastewater application gunathilakae et al 2018 this issue in their paper highlights the water pollution problems by toxic cadmium cd which is a growing concern for human health and the surroundings they have focused on the cheapest and effective method of removal based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf which has a host mutuality with eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth as suggested by miransari 2011 it is hypothesized that the impact of amf on the production of stress enzymes called phytochelatins pcs are composed of cysteine rich peptides and consequently get involved in metal detoxification therefore the present study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of amf on the phytoremediation efficiency of water hyacinth for the targeted metal compound and also to prove the metal hyper accumulation ability of water hyacinth on different concentration of cd the findings are quite interesting because it is proved from the present study that eichhornia crassipes has an immense potential to withstand cd concentrations in the hydrogeosphere amf has a great potential in the growth of water hyacinth through symbiosis nutrient transfer process and enhances the cd uptake in both roots and shoots with a level more than 0 20 ppm therefore a positive correlation has been established between amf colonization and relative growth rates of plants whereas immobilization potential of cd from soil and amf inoculation shows a negative correlation matrix the authors have proved the augmenting potential of amf inoculated water hyacinth for cleaning up of noxious cd from aquatic bodies arsalan et al 2018 this issue have addressed a vital topic of research considering the purification of electrolyte solution by polyvinyl chloride pvc based sn tungusto arsenate composite membrane tta which are prepared by sol gel methods the hybridization of inorganic and polymer materials can result into super active membranes that have huge potential in industrial applications than other conventional membranes chen 2004 khan and paquiza 2011 a lot of advantages and improvements can be accessed through such novel membrane electrical catalytic and optical which are quite vital for the optimum industrial performances combined with the transportation properties of the synthesized membranes the synthesized membrane has very good potential for attracting cations and has good surface charge density the membrane has a good potential and charge density for the following electrolytes which follows the order kcl nacl licl and kcl nacl licl respectively therefore it is hypothesized that pvc and tta based materials can go for long run in terms of mechanical thermal and chemical stabilities pavithra and yapa 2018 this issue have undergone an interesting study considering the symbiotic relationship of arbuscular fungi amf with plants and their subsequent uses for increasing plant water use efficiency during water stress this is regarded as a vital issue in sustainable groundwater management in the current scenario of climate change and climate smart agriculture conservation of water for the dry period of a year is utmost important for agricultural activities and to cope up with the associated climate change proline a hydrophobic nitrogen containing protectant gets highly accumulated in plants under the condition of disturbed physiological condition induced by biotic or abiotic stress conditions such as exposure of plants to drought salinity cold etc as explained by ábrahám et al 2003 verbruggen and hermans 2008 the objectives of this research rely on the study of the effect of amf inoculation on physiological plant traits and also on proline accumulation rate to increase the sustainable use of water during drought they have concluded that biofertilization with amf significantly increase growth yield and drought tolerance of the test plant soybean under stress condition such kind of biofertilization also helps in increasing soil moisture content with 50 ml of irrigation and colonization of amf surrounding the plant nodules therefore it is strongly advisable to use such inoculation strategies which will help in sustainable food production without having high input costs for irrigations and help farmers to mitigate the food security challenges for the developed and developing nations by decorous management of ground and surface water 3 conclusion this special volume articles highlight on some of the latest issues affecting the surface and groundwater systems including nutrients geogenic contaminants as well as the emerging pollutants eps which are new chemicals without regulatory status as there is no proper database concerning their environmental impact and at the same time their implications on human health is poorly understood we are expecting that discussions embedded in this special issue will be truly international in its coverage yet it could reveal or highlight some of the more localized new and obscure cases of contamination and their management which could be of greater relevance to the scientific world integrating the fields of geochemistry geomorphology and nanotechnology to study a contemporary issue like freshwater contamination in itself is a novelty as it will lead to a better understanding and progress in this important issue acknowledgements this special issue would not
