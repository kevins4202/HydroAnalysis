10235,on farm reservoirs ofrs artificial water impoundments that retain water from rainfall and run off enable farmers to store water during the wet season to be used for crop irrigation during the dry season however monitoring the inter and intra annual change of these water bodies remains a challenging task because they are typically small 10 ha and occur in high numbers therefore we used two existing landsat inundation datasets the u s geological survey dynamic surface water extent dswe and the european commission s joint research centre jrc global monthly water history to assess surface water area change of ofrs located in eastern arkansas the third most irrigated state in the u s that has seen a rapid increase of ofrs occurrence we used an existent ofrs dataset as ground truth we aimed i to compare the performance of the dswe and the jrc when characterizing ofrs of varied sizes and ii to assess the impact of climate variables i e precipitation and temperature on surface water area of ofrs we found the highest mean percent errors mpe in size 20 for ofrs between 0 and 5 ha the smallest size class in our study the dswe had a smaller mpe and higher agreement with our ground truth dataset when compared to the jrc for ofrs smaller than 5 ha p value 0 05 both inundation datasets enabled us to estimate the seasonality in surface area change of ofrs with the highest surface water extent between march may the months when the region receives most of the annual precipitation our results showed that both dswe and jrc can be used to enhance hydrological assessments in poorly monitored basins that have a concentration of ofrs and the methods can be applied to other study regions if the inundation datasets are available keywords landsat irrigation water management on farm reservoir 1 introduction on farm reservoirs enable farmers to store water during the wet season and support water use during the dry season on farm reservoirs are particularly important for crop irrigation estimates show that these water bodies span 6 of farmlands worldwide downing 2010 and their numbers are projected to increase 1 2 annually in the agricultural parts of the u s downing et al 2006 on farm reservoirs can impact the ecosystems where they are built while the impact of an individual ofr is bound to the local environment the cumulative impact of a network of ofrs extends to larger spatial scales berg et al 2016 habets et al 2018 mime and young 1989 smith 1998 previous studies reported that a set of ofrs can decrease annual stream discharge between 0 2 hughes and mantel 2010 and 36 habets et al 2018 meigh 1995 on farm reservoirs are usually small 10 ha and occur in higher numbers than large 1000 ha water impoundments downing 2010 however most studies are focused on understanding the hydrological impact of large water bodies adams and hughes 1986 barrow 1987 dudgeon 2000 fearnside 2006 2001 maingi and marsh 2002 martins and meurer 2009 and end up overlooking the collective effect of ofrs arvor et al 2018 habets et al 2014 on farm reservoirs are poorly monitored or not monitored in many countries mostly because they have a changing nature they occur in high numbers and the vast majority of them are located on private properties berg et al 2016 the use of incorrect information on ofrs size spatial distribution and inter and intra annual area change for water allocation plans can have detrimental consequences to food production and to the farmers relying on these ofrs for their livelihood earth observation data allow us to amend the monitoring of ofrs which can then further our understanding of their impacts on the local environment where they occur water inundation datasets provide insights on surface water distribution and capture the anthropogenic impacts on freshwater resources pekel et al 2016 currently two products leverage the extended 30 years landsat mission archive the dswe provided by the united states geological survey usgs jones 2019 2015 and the global surface water extent provided by the european joint research centre jrc pekel et al 2016 studies have used both datasets for applications in water management ahmad et al 2020 avisse et al 2017 ogilvie et al 2018 soulard et al 2020 and a recent study compared their performance on integrating satellite data and streamflow volume measurements to fill gaps in monthly surface water chronologies walker et al 2020 moreover several studies harnessed the capability of the jrc to derive water management insights for ofrs in water basins of india vanthof and kelly 2019 brazil zhang et al 2016 and the volta basin in africa which intersects several countries including benin burkina faso c√¥te d ivoire mali togo and ghana jones et al 2017 nonetheless both datasets remain untested in large scale assessment of ofrs in the u s in addition although the dswe is potentially more accurate than jrc when applied to study regions in the u s since the dataset is country specific there has been no comparison of both datasets for assessing changes in ofrs therefore measuring the level of uncertainty of these water inundation products when compared to ground truth an independently derived dataset of ofrs helps to ensure their effective use for water planning policies precipitation and air temperature play a key role in controlling the evaporation losses from ofrs especially in dry critical periods of the year fowe et al 2015 liebe et al 2005 when there is less water available from precipitation and higher net solar radiation resulting in more energy for evaporation losses wang et al 2018 a recent study in semi arid brazil showed that future scenarios of climate change will likely have negative impact on ofrs water availability the study highlighted that an increase of 7 18 in evaporated water volumes by the end of the next century would decrease ofrs water availability by 4 10 althoff et al 2020 given the relevance of climate variables i e precipitation and air temperature on governing the ofrs dynamics there is a need to unravel their impact on ofrs water availability when aiming to develop strategic policies for water management the mississippi alluvial aquifer located in eastern arkansas is one of the most exploited aquifers in the u s for irrigation purposes lovelace et al 2015 marston et al 2015 in addition this is the third most irrigated region in the country and common cultivated crops are rice soybeans corn and cotton nass usda 2017 the rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture coincides with substantial declines in groundwater resources tacker et al 2010 marston et al 2015 a proposed solution to alleviate the aquifer depletion was the construction of ofrs for this reason eastern arkansas has seen a significant increase in the number of these water bodies during the last 40 years shults et al 2020 yaeger et al 2018 a remote sensing inventory derived from digitized orthoimages manually mapped more than 750 ofrs constructed in critical regions of the aquifer yaeger et al 2017 2018 the inventory was important for mapping the spatial distribution and multi year changes of these water bodies the authors found that more than 400 ofrs were constructed between 1995 and 2005 in critical regions of the mississippi alluvial aquifer in addition these ofrs covered 11 300 ha of agricultural land in 2015 yaeger et al 2017 2018 the inventory was the first step towards a necessary surface water assessment in the region however further exploration on inter and intra annual area change and seasonality of ofrs as well as the impact of climate variables on ofr is needed to improve existing models used to calculate the mississippi alluvial aquifer water budget clark et al 2011 we created time series of ofrs inundation areas based on the dswe and jrc datasets to provide information on the ofrs surface area temporal variability and to assess their inter and intra annual surface area change and seasonality we aimed to i compare the performance of both datasets when characterizing ofrs of varied sizes using the remote sensing inventory as ground truth yaeger et al 2017 and ii to assess the impact of climate variables i e precipitation and temperature on ofrs surface water change 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the study region is located in eastern arkansas u s a region with high water demand due to crop irrigation future projections estimate that irrigated crop water demand will increase from 33 4 mm3 d 1 to 37 8 mm3 d 1 in 2050 arkansas drought planning summary report 2016 annual usgs reports in monitored wells showed a steady decline in water levels varying between 0 64 m year 1 to 0 m year 1 from 1998 to 2012 for counties located in the study region schrader 2015 the spatial extent of this study comprises the major 8 digit hydrologic unit codes hucs table 1 that intersect critical ground water regions in eastern arkansas fig 1 the 30 year annual average precipitation is 1300 mm yr 1 annual precipitation is moderately seasonal and distributed mostly between march and may adding up to a total 400 mm during this period the average

inventory carried out by yaeger et al 2017 as ground truth this inventory estimated the number surface area and spatial distribution of the ofrs in the critical groundwater areas in eastern arkansas the authors utilized county level images provided by the national agricultural imagery program the image mosaics were compressed and geo referenced and provided by the usda nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov the authors used images acquired at 1 m spatial resolution with accuracy of 6 m of ground control points they manually digitized the ofrs by combining 2015 google earth satellite imagery with the national agricultural imagery program archive the google earth explorer tool allowed them to sharpen the image details when zooming in and provided a validation for features appearing indistinct or pixelated in the 1 m mosaic imagery the google earth imagery archive was collected using different sensors e g landsat 8 and digitalglobe satellites with a spatial resolution varying from 15 cm to 15 m depending on the satellite source to further identify ofrs used for irrigation the authors identified key surrounding elements of a surface water irrigation system such as tailwater recovery and irrigation regulating ditches supply drainage pipes and or pumping houses and one or more adjacent crop fields sullivan and delp 2012 yaeger et al 2017 table 1 shows the number of ofrs in each huc more than 500 ofrs are located in two of the eight hucs that cover our study area yaeger et al 2018 expanded the work carried out by yaeger et al 2017 by analyzing the trends in reservoir construction over time the authors superimposed the 2015 reservoir contours with the high spatial resolution 1 m orthoimagery and systematically checked whether the ofrs were present during specific years 1996 2000 2006 2009 2010 2013 and 2015 the temporal analysis resulted in seven reservoir shapefiles one for each year checked the intervals between the ofr shapefiles are not evenly distributed due to the historical catalog of the orthoimagery fig 2 shows the cumulative distribution of ofr surface water area ha and their construction period we used the ofrs shapefile as ground truth data for our analyses see section 2 5 2 3 processing satellite imagery time series we processed the two independent surface inundation datasets derived from the landsat imagery catalog dswe v2 0 jones 2015 2019 and jrc global monthly water history v1 1 pekel et al 2016 we assembled the monthly image time series starting in january 1995 one year prior to the first year of the assessment made by yaeger et al 2018 until december 2018 last jrc image available on google earth engine gee we chose this time series period 1995 2018 to coincide with the ofr mapping period of the ground truth dataset aiming to capture the monthly variability of the vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs we combined the landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images available on gee to calculate mean and monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi using a 1 km buffer of each ofr in our ground truth dataset we assumed that this buffer distance includes the area in which the water from the ofr is potentially being used for irrigation this assumption is based on the idea that the water from the ofr is being used to irrigate closely located cropland and it was not validated with a field study personal conversation with geospatial specialist dr john nowlin in eastern arkansas the ndvi from the possible irrigated land surrounding the ofrs can helps us understand the annual monthly change in crop phenology seo et al 2019 yang et al 2013 and therefore the ndvi may be useful to further understand the ofrs surface water dynamics by representing anthropogenic factors 2 3 1 dynamic surface water extent v 1 0 the level 3 product dswe v 1 0 jones 2015 2019 is available online for the contiguous united states through the usgs earth explorer platform https earthexplorer usgs gov and it is the newest product from the landsat analysis ready data series the dswe product is generated using the landsat surface reflectance the most geometrically accurate and consistently processed imagery from landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli we recreated analysis ready data equal sized tiles by downloading the dswe images projected to albers equal area conic we used the dswe interpreted layer to retrieve only the highest confidence water pixel value i e 1 water high confidence the interpreted layer has seven diagnostic pixel values including 0 not water 1 water high confidence 2 water moderate confidence 3 potential wetland 4 water or wetland low confidence 9 cloud shadow and snow and 255 not available fill to match the jrc monthly water inundation time series we composited multiple overlapping dswe scenes we used a pixel based approach to retain the 1 high confidence water classification for co located pixels for example the final class of a pixel is water high confidence class 1 if this pixel was classified as potential wetland class 3 in one image and classified as water high confidence class 1 in another one the final dataset consists of 288 dswe monthly composites time series from january 1995 until december 2018 2 3 2 joint research centre monthly water history v 1 1 the jrc global monthly water history v 1 1 pekel et al 2016 has a global coverage and it is available online for public download through the cloud computing platform gee https code earthengine google com the monthly water history is part of a global collection of water inundation layers from march 1984 until december 2018 the authors created the collection using the entire landsat archive three million satellite images combining images from the landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the monthly history provides information on the intra annual distribution of water bodies and characterizes their seasonality the purpose of creating a monthly time series was to show the water distribution over time and space this dataset can also be used to flag when an ofr was constructed at a particular location the monthly water history is available in gee as an image collection of 380 images each band contains a water layer that has three diagnostic pixel values 0 no observations 1 not water and 2 water detected for a complete description of the water classification methods refer to pekel et al 2016 we downloaded the monthly water history from gee for our study region from 1995 until 2018 and we extracted the surface water area for each reservoir using r v 3 5 1 r core team 2020 2 4 climate information we downloaded monthly precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd from january 1995 to december 2018 from the interpolated grid maps available from oregon state university s prism climate group prism climate group 2011 using each ofr centroid i e latitude and longitude 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 on farm reservoir size missing information and reservoir geometry we used the single time step surface area ha i e ofr size from the ground truth dataset as the ofr capacity to compare this single surface area with the dswe and the jrc we looped through all time steps i e 1995 2018 for each ofr to extract the highest surface area recorded from both inundation datasets the highest surface area was chosen because it reflects the ofr capacity according with the inundation datasets we divided the ofrs into four different size classes 0 5 ha 5 10 ha 10 25 ha and 25 ha according with the surface area mapped in the ground truth dataset which helped us understand how the discrepancies between the inundation datasets and the ground truth occur for different ofr sizes then we performed a simple linear regression analysis to calculate the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mpe eq 1 between each inundation dataset and the ground truth hence we had two linear regressions models one for each dataset for each class size in addition we compared the differences in mpe between dswe and jrc using one way analysis of variance anova 1 mean percent error y i x i x i 100 where x i is the ground truth and y i is the highest surface area mapped by each inundation dataset including all time steps for each ofr for each ofr and both inundation datasets we created an index to measure the monthly percentage of missing information na index this index was calculated by dividing the number of absent surface area information to the total possible number of observations including all time steps the total possible number of observations depends on the ofr construction year for instance if an ofr was constructed in 2000 the total number of observations will be 216 12 months per year and 18 years then we calculated na index for each class size by averaging the na index of all ofrs included in each class we calculated a dimensionless shape index si to describe the complexity of the ofrs surface water extent karran et al 2017 vanthof and kelly 2019 si is the ratio of the reservoir perimeter to the circumference of a circle with the same area we obtained perimeter and reservoir area from ground truth dataset on farm reservoirs with si 1 are perfectly circular while ofrs with si 1 are increasingly complex the si is an important metric because ofrs with complex shapes are more difficult to map therefore leading to higher surface area mapping errors karran et al 2017 2 5 2 generalized additive mixed model approach to explain the reservoirs area change similar to other studies linking climate variables to satellite mapped surface water extent e g heimhuber et al 2019 tulbure and broich 2019 we explored the impact of precipitation air temperature and ndvi on the dynamics of ofrs surface area by employing a generalized additive mixed model approach using the gamm4 r package wood and scheipl 2014 generalized additive mixed models are multivariate regression models that additively combine parametric linear and non parametric non linear model terms and allow both fixed and random effects the wiggliness of splines is penalized when the models are fitted and the fitting algorithm aims to maximize the fit of the spline to the data while minimizing its wiggliness wood 2017 fixed effects are the factors we expect will have an impact on the dependent variable these effects are referred to as explanatory variables random effects are categorical variables and often grouping factors these are the effects that we know may influence the patterns in our response variable we used the ofr monthly surface area ratio sa ratio as the dependent variable sa ratio was calculated by dividing the monthly ofr surface area extracted from the dswe and jrc by the ofr ground truth area the sa ratio allows us to infer the ofr capacity level in a given month in terms of area for instance a sa ratio of 0 7 means that the ofr is at 70 of the maximum capacity we aggregated sa ratio per huc boundaries by averaging the sa ratio of all ofrs in each huc for each time step i e month in our period of analysis and separately for the dswe and jrc inundation datasets this level of aggregation resulted in a total of 16 monthly sa ratio time series i e eight hucs and two inundation datasets from 1995 to 2018 totaling 276 monthly observations per huc per inundation dataset we examined multicollinearity between the explanatory variables precipitation minimum maximum and mean air temperature vpd and ndvi and we computed the pearson correlation coefficient for each two variables following this procedure we removed minimum and mean air temperature and minimum maximum and mean vpd these variables were highly correlated with maximum temperature correlation coefficient 0 9 this is a common practice as collinearity among predictors can lead to interpretation problems see figs s1 and s2 for more details in addition we matched the temporal resolution of the explanatory variables with the ofr sa ratio time series due to the inherent characteristics of the remote sensing inundation datasets i e cloud obscuration the sa ratio time series can contain abrupt changes that may lead to erroneous interpretation of the sa ratio these sudden changes are normally attributed to the presence of clouds and sensor related issues that disrupt the ofr surface area information to account for these issues we applied a simple centered moving average filter with an average smoother of magnitude 2 this filter allowed us to preserve the sa ratio time series information and seasonality while reducing the impact of sa ratio outliers fig s4 we modeled the sa ratio with the moving average using two modeling approaches 1 a global model accounting for all hucs together i e using huc as a random effect for the dswe and jrc and 2 per huc models the later approach aimed to measure the model performance within each huc and to capture the spatial variability of the fixed effects between different hucs more specifically to account for the per huc models variability in slopes of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi and the model performance across the study region to minimize the complexity of both modeling approaches we fitted multiple models adding each explanatory variable one at a time we added precipitation maximum air temperature and ndvi as fixed effects and month and year as random effects we measured the contribution of each variable accounting for the akaike information criterion aic and adjusted r2 tables s1 and s2 we selected model 3 as the best performing model based on the lowest aic and highest adjusted r2 and the least number of parameters model 3 includes precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi as fixed effects tables s1 and s2 3 results and discussion fig 3 depicts the distribution of minimum maximum and mean air temperature ndvi and precipitation for two hucs a and b in our study region see fig s3 for all other hucs considering the entire time series in general most of the precipitation arrives between march and may with a decrease during the months of june to august fig 3 violin plots contrastingly air temperature has a different behavior and the highest records occur during summer between may and august and the lowest records between november to february fig 3 black solid line and red dashed lines the mean ndvi from the vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs starts to increase around april and may which are the months when the main crops are being planted in the study region the peak of ndvi occurs between august and september and the ndvi decreases during october and november which typically represent the final crop phenological stages before harvest we divided the ofrs into different class sizes and compared the highest surface area recorded during the entire time series from both inundation datasets the highest ofr surface area represents the reservoir size with the surface area from the ground truth dataset fig 4 both datasets underestimate the ofrs size for all classes and the smallest ofrs 0 5 ha and 5 10 ha had the highest mpe the jrc 20 4 and 12 5 had higher mpe than the dswe 12 4 and 7 44 for both classes fig 4 inset boxplots in addition these two classes had the highest variability in mpe which decreased as the size of the ofrs increased in general the mpe for both datasets is below 10 for ofrs larger than 10 ha and the jrc had higher values when compared to the dswe for all classes however the datasets were statistically different only for the first two classes p value 0 05 i e ofrs smaller than 10 ha fig 4 inset boxplots we found the highest agreement in size for ofrs with surface area higher than 25 ha r 2 0 99 and 0 98 for dswe and jrc although the smallest classes 0 5 ha and 5 10 ha presented the highest mpe these classes also had good agreement r 2 0 8 for both datasets overall the jrc had smaller r 2 values than the dswe for all classes the magnitude of mpe fig 4 inset boxplots corroborate with previous studies ogilvie et al 2018 jones et al 2017 that used landsat imagery to describe small water bodies ogilvie et al 2018 found that the commission error i e producer error of the jrc increased up to 50 for ofrs with area 5 ha jones et al 2017 used the jrc to assess 272 ofrs surface area ranging from 0 09 to 72 ha and reported that the dataset was unsuitable for monitoring ofrs with surface area smaller than 5 1 ha 56 of ofrs in the volta basin since the magnitude of mean absolute percent error reached up to 71 there are multiple challenges when using landsat imagery to classify small water bodies these challenges help explain the discrepancies found in the ofr size analysis fig 4 mueller et al 2016 developed a methodology to map water bodies at a continental scale i e australia using 25 years of landsat imagery they concluded that their product was underestimating the extent of surface water where there was a mix between water and vegetation pixels highlighting a limitation of using landsat inundation products to assess small wetland and small water bodies similarly ogilvie et al 2018 found that the accuracy of the jrc reduces with the presence of vegetation and algae and for shallow water bodies the authors also highlighted that the geometry of the ofrs influenced how these water bodies are represented in optical remote sensing in this study ofrs with regular shapes tended to present lower mpe and higher agreement with ground truthing datasets and ofrs with asymmetric shapes were more inclined to have higher discrepancies jones et al 2017 reported analogous findings and demonstrated that the accuracy of the jrc area estimates improved with increasing the ofr size and decreasing the geometric shape complexity we assessed the ofrs geometric shape accounting for their area and perimeter fig 5 shows the distribution of si for all ofrs in each class size on farm reservoirs with si 1 have increasingly complex geometric shape the smallest ofrs surface area 15 ha presented higher si values average si 2 when compared to the larger the ofrs surface area 15 ha on farm reservoirs with surface area 25 ha presented the smallest si median si 0 77 with upper and lower limits of 5 12 and 0 17 although the smallest ofrs had a more complex geometric shape and higher mpe figs 4 and 5 we did not find a close relationship r2 0 2 and r 2 0 1 between the reservoirs si and the mpe for any of the classes fig 6 shows that all classes have high na index between january through april and november through december na index 0 30 the jrc has no information for any of the ofrs during december and january for the entire time series the size of the bars i e sa ratio helps us understand the behavior of each ofr class during the year enabling us to infer seasonal trends in surface water change both datasets show that the ofrs were closer to maximum area during march april and may sa ratio 0 75 0 90 and at the lowest capacity i e smaller bars in june july and august sa ratio 0 60 0 70 there are multiple factors impacting the ofrs surface area change these factors include climate variables e g precipitation air temperature as well as anthropogenic variables e g reservoir usage and other environmental factors e g soil type on which the ofrs are built distance and topographical distance to major water streams arvor et al 2018 habets et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in this study we focused on exploring how much of the variance in ofrs surface area change can be explained by combining precipitation air temperature and the ndvi from vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs the ofrs filling process occurs mostly during the wet season of the year when the study region receives most of the annual precipitation we analyzed precipitation time series for all ofrs and we found that most of the precipitation events occur in march april and may figs 3 and s1 which coincides with the months when the ofrs are closer to maximum extent i e highest sa ratio values fig 6 moreover the driest months occur during the summer i e june july and august figs 3 and s1 which is the period when the highest temperature values are recorded and the ofrs are found to be at the lowest capacities range this can be an indication of irrigation activities as the vegetated surfaces surrounding the ofrs starts to green up i e increase in ndvi values when the study region receives most of its precipitation before and early summer and the highest ndvi values occur during late and end of summer the lowest sa ratio values during the summer months can be explained by two main factors 1 the dry critical months are when the farmers are irrigating their crops the last u s department of agriculture census showed that 100 of rice was irrigated and 84 of soybean and 92 of cotton were irrigated at least once during the 2018 growing season in eastern arkansas nass usda 2020 and 2 the high records of air temperature can contribute to increase the ofrs outflow through evaporation which can be 25 of the ofrs outflow during dry critical months friedrich et al 2018 guerra et al 1990 zhao and gao 2019 previous studies showed that shallow ofrs are more prone to evaporation losses than large water bodies and evaporation was identified as a major factor contributing to reduce water storage especially in dry critical periods of the year fowe et al 2015 liebe et al 2005 we did not account for evaporation losses in our modeling scenarios because it is beyond the scope of this study as illustrated by zhao and gao 2019 estimating evaporation losses from reservoirs is not a trivial task the authors stressed that detailed information about the ofrs surface water area and evaporation rate is required to accurately estimate evaporation losses in addition besides climate variables i e air temperature and precipitation the ofrs hydrological dynamic can be influenced by the watershed discharge reduced discharge results in less water supply during the ofr filling process ibrahim et al 2015 tinoco et al 2016 nonetheless the ofrs used in this study are not located on the main water streams and therefore the ofrs surface area changes are independent of the discharge seasonality which is why we did not include discharge in our analysis the ofrs filling process during the wet season is directly related to the volume of water from precipitation and runoff events and the filling process depends on the ofrs surface area our results indicate that the dswe and jrc could be used to describe a set of ofrs behavior in terms of area change along the months and years fig 6 this relevant to poorly monitored basins around the world that have a high concentration of ofrs given that the jrc data is available globally the methods implemented in this study could be used in other regions of the world if the jrc is available for instance the jaguaribe basin area of 70 000 km2 in the state of cear√° brazil is known for having a conglomerate of ofrs dubreuil and girard 1973 formiga johnsson and kemper 2007 gondim et al 2012 although efforts to monitor these water bodies date back to the 1950 s dubreuil and girard 1973 most of the reservoirs are poorly or not monitored at all the use of inundation datasets could then enhance the knowledge of water authorities to create and or improve current water planning in the region nevertheless we should also highlight that the uncertainties carried by the dswe and jrc datasets fig 4 will contribute to under or over estimation respectively of the ofrs volume capacity if the datasets are used to develop a sustainable water plan fowe et al 2015 we further explored how climate variables and ndvi contribute to the variation of the ofrs sa ratio using a generalized additive mixed model approach the results from the global models i e including huc as a random effect for both the dswe and jrc datasets are shown on table 2 both models explained less than 15 of the variability in sa ratio r 2 0 15 and there were small differences for the fixed effects between the inundation datasets the r 2 values from the generalized additive models at huc level are shown on fig 7 in general the jrc presented higher r 2 values 0 04 0 29 when compared to dswe 0 03 0 27 the r 2 values varied between different hucs and the huc with the lowest marginal r 2 0 1 huc h has only two ofrs for hucs that have a considerable number of reservoirs 50 and still presented a low r 2 0 20 e g hucs c and e the variability in size of ofrs within each huc may influence the performance of the model when explaining the variance in sa ratio with different processes governing reservoirs of different size classes for instance huc e has a total of 79 reservoirs and the reservoirs size range varies between 2 4 and 150 ha the higher jrc r 2 values when compared to the dswe was unexpected as the jrc has generally higher na index and no information for january and december for any of the ofrs a possible explanation is that the lower amount of information is contributing to less variability in the sa ratio and therefore higher r 2 values the performance of our models table 2 fig 7 can be attributed to several factors ranging from the uncertainties contained in the explanatory variables e g climate variables from interpolated grids to the fact that we have not included anthropological factors e g reservoir usage in our modeling scenarios ndvi was the only variable relating to crop phenology and thus potentially related to irrigation water use although the prism dataset is widely used in studies that assess the long term impact 20 years of climate variables e g precipitation air temperature this dataset is created through the interpolation of ground data and therefore the time series extracted from the dataset carries the uncertainty from interpolation and modeling techniques gao et al 2017 spangler et al 2019 we believe that our modeling scenarios could be improved by using time series of climate variables from in situ data collection however it is very unlikely that every farmer will have an in situ meteorological station to keep records of climate variables our models are also influenced by the uncertainty in the ndvi time series which are subject to the same challenges of using landsat based inundation datasets e g data gaps cloud obscuration mixed pixels due to pixel size in addition we assumed that the water stored by the ofrs was being used in a radius of 1 km this assumption was based on the idea that ofrs supply water to cropland that is closely located in spite of being a fair assumption we do not know exactly where the water is being used for instance farmers can have different irrigation schedules for fields adjacent to the ofrs and it is common to mix the water resources obtained from the ofr and from irrigation wells furthermore there are several reservoirs that are located close to green areas e g forest patches and that may contribute to less variation in ndvi along the year there are other anthropogenic factors that may contribute to the sa ratio dynamics and we are not accounting for them in our models these variables could be i intensity of irrigation activities we are able to identify the general trends of sa ratio however depending on the period of the year farmers are using the ofrs more or less extensively and this has s direct impact on the ofrs sa ratio ii the ofr filling process the ofrs are mainly filled with precipitation and runoff events therefore the ofrs receive most of their water volume during the wet season nonetheless farmers may opt to fill the ofrs by pumping water from the inlet streams if they have the infrastructure in place this filling process impacts sa ratio and it is very challenging to predict as it varies among different farmers and periods of the year the monthly time scale of the inundation datasets can also help explain the performance of our modeling results the ofrs sa ratio may have events surface area changes occurring at a sub monthly scale that are not being captured by the inundation datasets and the explanatory variables we believe that better modeling results could be obtained by employing satellite datasets with higher temporal resolution for example the sentinel 1 and 2 10 day revisit period and planetscope cubesats daily revisit period lastly potential modeling improvements could be achieved employing satellite based evapotranspiration products allen et al 2015 mhawej and faour 2020 nonetheless these products require exhaustive calibration and validation which is site specific and extensive ground knowledge on which and where the crops are planted unfortunately this information it is not available and therefore these products were not included on this study the spatial variability of the fixed effects at the huc level are shown on fig 8 precipitation resulted in positive slopes for all hucs and both inundation datasets and the slopes varied among hucs dswe 0 08 0 5 10 2 and jrc 0 01 0 3 10 2 maximum temperature also varied across different hucs however all slopes were negative dswe 0 02 to 1 4 10 2 and jrc 0 02 to 0 9 10 2 similarly the ndvi varied across different hucs with positive and negative slopes dswe 0 22 0 47 10 2 and jrc 0 02 to 1 4 10 2 the results of the generalized additive mixed models approach figs 7 and 8 can be combined with crop water requirements to plan the irrigation schedule for example crop water needs vary in space and time and are influenced by climate factors like precipitation and air temperature perin et al 2019 therefore the number and intensity of irrigation events also varies in space and time the slope of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi can be combined and used as a simple index when farmers are planning their irrigation schedule this index can be used to increase or decrease the amount of water applied in each irrigation event depending on the region s slope values this kind of index is commonly used in crop modeling and climate zoning battisti and sentelhas 2019 boote et al 1998 in which the simulated crop yield is penalized or not based on the region s climate e g crop yield is penalized under drought conditions the slope of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi could then enhance tools which support irrigation management decisions helping farmers plan for regions and periods of the year that will require more or less water the dswe and jrc inundation data sets enable us to describe the general trends of the ofrs surface water area change and to depict the effects of climate variables on surface area change nonetheless we should bear in mind that hydrological monitoring of small water bodies using landsat inundation products has several constraints that need to be assessed when applying the methods to other study regions the restrictions of using the long term landsat archive to monitor small water bodies range from data gaps i e cloud obscuration which have direct impact on the accuracy of the seasonal information to spatial resolution issues that prevent the accurate classification of water bodies to the 16 day repeat cycle that may miss rapid flood events that occur on a shorter timescale our analysis points out several challenges of using landsat inundation products for water planning purposes for example these datasets may be unsuitable for monitoring reservoirs with area between 0 and 5 ha as both datasets can have errors higher than 20 for reservoir extent fig 4 furthermore for certain months of the year e g december and january there is a higher occurrence of missing information which is an important limitation when aiming to use the datasets for continuous monitoring fig 6 the jrc has no information for the months of december and january and this could be partially explained by the algorithms used to create this inundation dataset the jrc was primarily designed to represent the occurrence of open surface water and not to detect surface water when there is spectral reflectance mixing of the water and vegetation devries et al 2017 jones 2019 which is a common characteristic of the ofrs that are relatively shallow and small water bodies therefore possibly leading to inadequately classifying ofrs in addition the absence of information is related to the well known landsat 7 etm slc scan line correctors failure after 31 may 2003 hossain et al 2015 these limitations are overcome by combining multiple satellite sources to monitor surface water dynamics vanthof and kelly 2019 used the jrc in conjunction with higher spatial and temporal satellite imagery and were able to increase the number of observations of ofrs and reduce the mapping error to 3 of the reservoir size and therefore enable the use of different satellite imagery for water planning regardless of the limitations of the landsat surface water datasets addressed above the dswe and jrc can be used as a first step to monitor water bodies at a large scale which is important in regions where there is a conglomerate of these water bodies the national inventory of dams nids dataset http nid usace army mil provides the location i e longitude and latitude of more than 80 000 dams located in the u s although this dataset does not have information about ofrs this dataset brings relevant information of the major dams in the u s including the construction year size in area and relevant hydrological information i e depth storage capacity also the nid dataset can be coupled with surface water extent information to enhance knowledge on the water budget in regions with a concentration of dams briefly if the depth of the reservoir and its topographic information e g digital elevation model are available it is possible to calculate the storage area depth for these reservoirs yigzaw et al 2018 which can be combined with surface area to estimate volume storage change from two different time steps yao et al 2018 and create a time series of water volume change vanthof and kelly 2019 in addition the same approach detailed above and the methods used in our study could be expanded to other countries by employing global water impoundments datasets for instance the global georeferenced database of dams mulligan et al 2020 and the geo referenced database on dams lehner et al 2011 our study furthers the use of landsat inundation datasets where there is insufficient ofr monitoring the biggest hurdle of replicating our study to other countries or regions is the lack of an ofr ground truth dataset however nowadays there is daily high spatial resolution 3 m satellite imagery for the entire globe planet team 2017 which enable future investigators to create a similar ofr dataset used in our study a ground truth dataset can be created by combining multiple platforms and satellite imagery sources our results showed that the dswe or jrc can be used to understand the temporal variability of ofrs and although there are mapping errors due to the spatial resolution of the landsat imagery fig 4 a proxy of the ofr shape can be obtained by calculating the ofr frequency of inundation using the entire landsat catalog this process is widely used in the scientific community pekel et al 2016 soulard et al 2020 walker et al 2020 the ofr shape proxy can be converted to a vector and be used to retrieve high resolution satellite imagery from planetscope cubesats imagery 3 m spatial resolution planet labs has an international education and research program that allows scientists around the globe to use planetscope cubesats imagery free of costs this study is the first effort to apply long term surface water extent datasets to large scale ofrs monitoring in the u s therefore we highlight that future investigations should weight on several factors before deciding which dataset to use i e dswe or jrc the first of these factors i is imagery processing we downloaded the level 3 analysis ready data dswe scenes though the dataset is already pre processed several steps are required to obtain the monthly water history which can be a demanding task especially when downloading and processing the dataset for a large area the jrc monthly water history was obtained through gee using a straight forward downloading approach the gee platform can be used to recreate the dswe monthly water layer ahmad et al 2020 walker et al 2020 and therefore attenuate some of the demanding tasks e g downloading recreating tiles etc related to the dswe the second factor ii is missing information although both datasets are based on the landsat archive the dswe has less missing information than the jrc which is essential to continuous large scale monitoring the jrc is a global dataset and does not specifically target the classification of water bodies that have a frequent spectral reflectance mixing i e ofrs therefore the algorithms used to classify surface water tend to be more stringent when classifying water pixels resulting in higher occurrences of absent information pekel et al 2016 the third factor iii is maximum area percent error both datasets levy the same challenges related to spatial resolution when classifying small water bodies using landsat products jones et al 2017 ogilvie et al 2018 solander et al 2016 however the dswe captured the maximum extent of ofrs with less errors and higher agreement when compared to the jrc lastly we should have in mind that our study is limited to maximum reservoir extent analysis and a complete assessment of these datasets requires field validation and or measurement of the surface water area using higher spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery vanthof and kelly 2019 4 conclusion landsat surface inundation datasets can be used to map ofrs maximum extent and surface water area seasonality the dswe had smaller mean percent errors p value 0 05 and higher agreement compared to the jrc when mapping reservoirs smaller than 10 ha both datasets enable us to characterize the seasonality of the ofrs area change in eastern arkansas the ofrs are mostly filled in march april and may which can be partially explained by the precipitation regimen of the region we applied a generalized additive mixed model approach to quantify the impact of precipitation maximum temperature and the ndvi from the land surrounding the ofrs on the ofrs surface area change and we found that the impact of these variables varies in space i e for different hucs our results showed that these datasets can be used to enhance hydrological assessments in poorly monitored basins that have a concentration of artificial small water bodies and the methods employed on this study could be used to enhance knowledge about the ofrs surface water dynamics in other regions and different countries if the inundation datasets i e dswe or jrc are available our findings are a unique contribution on which inundation dataset to employ when aiming to monitor small water bodies at a large scale in the us lastly the two main drawbacks imposed by these datasets when implementing them for water planning purposes and policymaking are i inconsistent surface water area time series due to clouds and sensor related issues and the 16 day repeat cycle of the landsat imagery and ii spatial resolution of 30 m that may be unsuitable to monitor ofrs with surface area between 0 and 5 ha declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10235,on farm reservoirs ofrs artificial water impoundments that retain water from rainfall and run off enable farmers to store water during the wet season to be used for crop irrigation during the dry season however monitoring the inter and intra annual change of these water bodies remains a challenging task because they are typically small 10 ha and occur in high numbers therefore we used two existing landsat inundation datasets the u s geological survey dynamic surface water extent dswe and the european commission s joint research centre jrc global monthly water history to assess surface water area change of ofrs located in eastern arkansas the third most irrigated state in the u s that has seen a rapid increase of ofrs occurrence we used an existent ofrs dataset as ground truth we aimed i to compare the performance of the dswe and the jrc when characterizing ofrs of varied sizes and ii to assess the impact of climate variables i e precipitation and temperature on surface water area of ofrs we found the highest mean percent errors mpe in size 20 for ofrs between 0 and 5 ha the smallest size class in our study the dswe had a smaller mpe and higher agreement with our ground truth dataset when compared to the jrc for ofrs smaller than 5 ha p value 0 05 both inundation datasets enabled us to estimate the seasonality in surface area change of ofrs with the highest surface water extent between march may the months when the region receives most of the annual precipitation our results showed that both dswe and jrc can be used to enhance hydrological assessments in poorly monitored basins that have a concentration of ofrs and the methods can be applied to other study regions if the inundation datasets are available keywords landsat irrigation water management on farm reservoir 1 introduction on farm reservoirs enable farmers to store water during the wet season and support water use during the dry season on farm reservoirs are particularly important for crop irrigation estimates show that these water bodies span 6 of farmlands worldwide downing 2010 and their numbers are projected to increase 1 2 annually in the agricultural parts of the u s downing et al 2006 on farm reservoirs can impact the ecosystems where they are built while the impact of an individual ofr is bound to the local environment the cumulative impact of a network of ofrs extends to larger spatial scales berg et al 2016 habets et al 2018 mime and young 1989 smith 1998 previous studies reported that a set of ofrs can decrease annual stream discharge between 0 2 hughes and mantel 2010 and 36 habets et al 2018 meigh 1995 on farm reservoirs are usually small 10 ha and occur in higher numbers than large 1000 ha water impoundments downing 2010 however most studies are focused on understanding the hydrological impact of large water bodies adams and hughes 1986 barrow 1987 dudgeon 2000 fearnside 2006 2001 maingi and marsh 2002 martins and meurer 2009 and end up overlooking the collective effect of ofrs arvor et al 2018 habets et al 2014 on farm reservoirs are poorly monitored or not monitored in many countries mostly because they have a changing nature they occur in high numbers and the vast majority of them are located on private properties berg et al 2016 the use of incorrect information on ofrs size spatial distribution and inter and intra annual area change for water allocation plans can have detrimental consequences to food production and to the farmers relying on these ofrs for their livelihood earth observation data allow us to amend the monitoring of ofrs which can then further our understanding of their impacts on the local environment where they occur water inundation datasets provide insights on surface water distribution and capture the anthropogenic impacts on freshwater resources pekel et al 2016 currently two products leverage the extended 30 years landsat mission archive the dswe provided by the united states geological survey usgs jones 2019 2015 and the global surface water extent provided by the european joint research centre jrc pekel et al 2016 studies have used both datasets for applications in water management ahmad et al 2020 avisse et al 2017 ogilvie et al 2018 soulard et al 2020 and a recent study compared their performance on integrating satellite data and streamflow volume measurements to fill gaps in monthly surface water chronologies walker et al 2020 moreover several studies harnessed the capability of the jrc to derive water management insights for ofrs in water basins of india vanthof and kelly 2019 brazil zhang et al 2016 and the volta basin in africa which intersects several countries including benin burkina faso c√¥te d ivoire mali togo and ghana jones et al 2017 nonetheless both datasets remain untested in large scale assessment of ofrs in the u s in addition although the dswe is potentially more accurate than jrc when applied to study regions in the u s since the dataset is country specific there has been no comparison of both datasets for assessing changes in ofrs therefore measuring the level of uncertainty of these water inundation products when compared to ground truth an independently derived dataset of ofrs helps to ensure their effective use for water planning policies precipitation and air temperature play a key role in controlling the evaporation losses from ofrs especially in dry critical periods of the year fowe et al 2015 liebe et al 2005 when there is less water available from precipitation and higher net solar radiation resulting in more energy for evaporation losses wang et al 2018 a recent study in semi arid brazil showed that future scenarios of climate change will likely have negative impact on ofrs water availability the study highlighted that an increase of 7 18 in evaporated water volumes by the end of the next century would decrease ofrs water availability by 4 10 althoff et al 2020 given the relevance of climate variables i e precipitation and air temperature on governing the ofrs dynamics there is a need to unravel their impact on ofrs water availability when aiming to develop strategic policies for water management the mississippi alluvial aquifer located in eastern arkansas is one of the most exploited aquifers in the u s for irrigation purposes lovelace et al 2015 marston et al 2015 in addition this is the third most irrigated region in the country and common cultivated crops are rice soybeans corn and cotton nass usda 2017 the rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture coincides with substantial declines in groundwater resources tacker et al 2010 marston et al 2015 a proposed solution to alleviate the aquifer depletion was the construction of ofrs for this reason eastern arkansas has seen a significant increase in the number of these water bodies during the last 40 years shults et al 2020 yaeger et al 2018 a remote sensing inventory derived from digitized orthoimages manually mapped more than 750 ofrs constructed in critical regions of the aquifer yaeger et al 2017 2018 the inventory was important for mapping the spatial distribution and multi year changes of these water bodies the authors found that more than 400 ofrs were constructed between 1995 and 2005 in critical regions of the mississippi alluvial aquifer in addition these ofrs covered 11 300 ha of agricultural land in 2015 yaeger et al 2017 2018 the inventory was the first step towards a necessary surface water assessment in the region however further exploration on inter and intra annual area change and seasonality of ofrs as well as the impact of climate variables on ofr is needed to improve existing models used to calculate the mississippi alluvial aquifer water budget clark et al 2011 we created time series of ofrs inundation areas based on the dswe and jrc datasets to provide information on the ofrs surface area temporal variability and to assess their inter and intra annual surface area change and seasonality we aimed to i compare the performance of both datasets when characterizing ofrs of varied sizes using the remote sensing inventory as ground truth yaeger et al 2017 and ii to assess the impact of climate variables i e precipitation and temperature on ofrs surface water change 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the study region is located in eastern arkansas u s a

inventory carried out by yaeger et al 2017 as ground truth this inventory estimated the number surface area and spatial distribution of the ofrs in the critical groundwater areas in eastern arkansas the authors utilized county level images provided by the national agricultural imagery program the image mosaics were compressed and geo referenced and provided by the usda nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov the authors used images acquired at 1 m spatial resolution with accuracy of 6 m of ground control points they manually digitized the ofrs by combining 2015 google earth satellite imagery with the national agricultural imagery program archive the google earth explorer tool allowed them to sharpen the image details when zooming in and provided a validation for features appearing indistinct or pixelated in the 1 m mosaic imagery the google earth imagery archive was collected using different sensors e g landsat 8 and digitalglobe satellites with a spatial resolution varying from 15 cm to 15 m depending on the satellite source to further identify ofrs used for irrigation the authors identified key surrounding elements of a surface water irrigation system such as tailwater recovery and irrigation regulating ditches supply drainage pipes and or pumping houses and one or more adjacent crop fields sullivan and delp 2012 yaeger et al 2017 table 1 shows the number of ofrs in each huc more than 500 ofrs are located in two of the eight hucs that cover our study area yaeger et al 2018 expanded the work carried out by yaeger et al 2017 by analyzing the trends in reservoir construction over time the authors superimposed the 2015 reservoir contours with the high spatial resolution 1 m orthoimagery and systematically checked whether the ofrs were present during specific years 1996 2000 2006 2009 2010 2013 and 2015 the temporal analysis resulted in seven reservoir shapefiles one for each year checked the intervals between the ofr shapefiles are not evenly distributed due to the historical catalog of the orthoimagery fig 2 shows the cumulative distribution of ofr surface water area ha and their construction period we used the ofrs shapefile as ground truth data for our analyses see section 2 5 2 3 processing satellite imagery time series we processed the two independent surface inundation datasets derived from the landsat imagery catalog dswe v2 0 jones 2015 2019 and jrc global monthly water history v1 1 pekel et al 2016 we assembled the monthly image time series starting in january 1995 one year prior to the first year of the assessment made by yaeger et al 2018 until december 2018 last jrc image available on google earth engine gee we chose this time series period 1995 2018 to coincide with the ofr mapping period of the ground truth dataset aiming to capture the monthly variability of the vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs we combined the landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images available on gee to calculate mean and monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi using a 1 km buffer of each ofr in our ground truth dataset we assumed that this buffer distance includes the area in which the water from the ofr is potentially being used for irrigation this assumption is based on the idea that the water from the ofr is being used to irrigate closely located cropland and it was not validated with a field study personal conversation with geospatial specialist dr john nowlin in eastern arkansas the ndvi from the possible irrigated land surrounding the ofrs can helps us understand the annual monthly change in crop phenology seo et al 2019 yang et al 2013 and therefore the ndvi may be useful to further understand the ofrs surface water dynamics by representing anthropogenic factors 2 3 1 dynamic surface water extent v 1 0 the level 3 product dswe v 1 0 jones 2015 2019 is available online for the contiguous united states through the usgs earth explorer platform https earthexplorer usgs gov and it is the newest product from the landsat analysis ready data series the dswe product is generated using the landsat surface reflectance the most geometrically accurate and consistently processed imagery from landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli we recreated analysis ready data equal sized tiles by downloading the dswe images projected to albers equal area conic we used the dswe interpreted layer to retrieve only the highest confidence water pixel value i e 1 water high confidence the interpreted layer has seven diagnostic pixel values including 0 not water 1 water high confidence 2 water moderate confidence 3 potential wetland 4 water or wetland low confidence 9 cloud shadow and snow and 255 not available fill to match the jrc monthly water inundation time series we composited multiple overlapping dswe scenes we used a pixel based approach to retain the 1 high confidence water classification for co located pixels for example the final class of a pixel is water high confidence class 1 if this pixel was classified as potential wetland class 3 in one image and classified as water high confidence class 1 in another one the final dataset consists of 288 dswe monthly composites time series from january 1995 until december 2018 2 3 2 joint research centre monthly water history v 1 1 the jrc global monthly water history v 1 1 pekel et al 2016 has a global coverage and it is available online for public download through the cloud computing platform gee https code earthengine google com the monthly water history is part of a global collection of water inundation layers from march 1984 until december 2018 the authors created the collection using the entire landsat archive three million satellite images combining images from the landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the monthly history provides information on the intra annual distribution of water bodies and characterizes their seasonality the purpose of creating a monthly time series was to show the water distribution over time and space this dataset can also be used to flag when an ofr was constructed at a particular location the monthly water history is available in gee as an image collection of 380 images each band contains a water layer that has three diagnostic pixel values 0 no observations 1 not water and 2 water detected for a complete description of the water classification methods refer to pekel et al 2016 we downloaded the monthly water history from gee for our study region from 1995 until 2018 and we extracted the surface water area for each reservoir using r v 3 5 1 r core team 2020 2 4 climate information we downloaded monthly precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd from january 1995 to december 2018 from the interpolated grid maps available from oregon state university s prism climate group prism climate group 2011 using each ofr centroid i e latitude and longitude 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 on farm reservoir size missing information and reservoir geometry we used the single time step surface area ha i e ofr size from the ground truth dataset as the ofr capacity to compare this single surface area with the dswe and the jrc we looped through all time steps i e 1995 2018 for each ofr to extract the highest surface area recorded from both inundation datasets the highest surface area was chosen because it reflects the ofr capacity according with the inundation datasets we divided the ofrs into four different size classes 0 5 ha 5 10 ha 10 25 ha and 25 ha according with the surface area mapped in the ground truth dataset which helped us understand how the discrepancies between the inundation datasets and the ground truth occur for different ofr sizes then we performed a simple linear regression analysis to calculate the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mpe eq 1 between each inundation dataset and the ground truth hence we had two linear regressions models one for each dataset for each class size in addition we compared the differences in mpe between dswe and jrc using one way analysis of variance anova 1 mean percent error y i x i x i 100 where x i is the ground truth and y i is the highest surface area mapped by each inundation dataset including all time steps for each ofr for each ofr and both inundation datasets we created an index to measure the monthly percentage of missing information na index this index was calculated by dividing the number of absent surface area information to the total possible number of observations including all time steps the total possible number of observations depends on the ofr construction year for instance if an ofr was constructed in 2000 the total number of observations will be 216 12 months per year and 18 years then we calculated na index for each class size by averaging the na index of all ofrs included in each class we calculated a dimensionless shape index si to describe the complexity of the ofrs surface water extent karran et al 2017 vanthof and kelly 2019 si is the ratio of the reservoir perimeter to the circumference of a circle with the same area we obtained perimeter and reservoir area from ground truth dataset on farm reservoirs with si 1 are perfectly circular while ofrs with si 1 are increasingly complex the si is an important metric because ofrs with complex shapes are more difficult to map therefore leading to higher surface area mapping errors karran et al 2017 2 5 2 generalized additive mixed model approach to explain the reservoirs area change similar to other studies linking climate variables to satellite mapped surface water extent e g heimhuber et al 2019 tulbure and broich 2019 we explored the impact of precipitation air temperature and ndvi on the dynamics of ofrs surface area by employing a generalized additive mixed model approach using the gamm4 r package wood and scheipl 2014 generalized additive mixed models are multivariate regression models that additively combine parametric linear and non parametric non linear model terms and allow both fixed and random effects the wiggliness of splines is penalized when the models are fitted and the fitting algorithm aims to maximize the fit of the spline to the data while minimizing its wiggliness wood 2017 fixed effects are the factors we expect will have an impact on the dependent variable these effects are referred to as explanatory variables random effects are categorical variables and often grouping factors these are the effects that we know may influence the patterns in our response variable we used the ofr monthly surface area ratio sa ratio as the dependent variable sa ratio was calculated by dividing the monthly ofr surface area extracted from the dswe and jrc by the ofr ground truth area the sa ratio allows us to infer the ofr capacity level in a given month in terms of area for instance a sa ratio of 0 7 means that the ofr is at 70 of the maximum capacity we aggregated sa ratio per huc boundaries by averaging the sa ratio of all ofrs in each huc for each time step i e month in our period of analysis and separately for the dswe and jrc inundation datasets this level of aggregation resulted in a total of 16 monthly sa ratio time series i e eight hucs and two inundation datasets from 1995 to 2018 totaling 276 monthly observations per huc per inundation dataset we examined multicollinearity between the explanatory variables precipitation minimum maximum and mean air temperature vpd and ndvi and we computed the pearson correlation coefficient for each two variables following this procedure we removed minimum and mean air temperature and minimum maximum and mean vpd these variables were highly correlated with maximum temperature correlation coefficient 0 9 this is a common practice as collinearity among predictors can lead to interpretation problems see figs s1 and s2 for more details in addition we matched the temporal resolution of the explanatory variables with the ofr sa ratio time series due to the inherent characteristics of the remote sensing inundation datasets i e cloud obscuration the sa ratio time series can contain abrupt changes that may lead to erroneous interpretation of the sa ratio these sudden changes are normally attributed to the presence of clouds and sensor related issues that disrupt the ofr surface area information to account for these issues we applied a simple centered moving average filter with an average smoother of magnitude 2 this filter allowed us to preserve the sa ratio time series information and seasonality while reducing the impact of sa ratio outliers fig s4 we modeled the sa ratio with the moving average using two modeling approaches 1 a global model accounting for all hucs together i e using huc as a random effect for the dswe and jrc and 2 per huc models the later approach aimed to measure the model performance within each huc and to capture the spatial variability of the fixed effects between different hucs more specifically to account for the per huc models variability in slopes of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi and the model performance across the study region to minimize the complexity of both modeling approaches we fitted multiple models adding each explanatory variable one at a time we added precipitation maximum air temperature and ndvi as fixed effects and month and year as random effects we measured the contribution of each variable accounting for the akaike information criterion aic and adjusted r2 tables s1 and s2 we selected model 3 as the best performing model based on the lowest aic and highest adjusted r2 and the least number of parameters model 3 includes precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi as fixed effects tables s1 and s2 3 results and discussion fig 3 depicts the distribution of minimum maximum and mean air temperature ndvi and precipitation for two hucs a and b in our study region see fig s3 for all other hucs considering the entire time series in general most of the precipitation arrives between march and may with a decrease during the months of june to august fig 3 violin plots contrastingly air temperature has a different behavior and the highest records occur during summer between may and august and the lowest records between november to february fig 3 black solid line and red dashed lines the mean ndvi from the vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs starts to increase around april and may which are the months when the main crops are being planted in the study region the peak of ndvi occurs between august and september and the ndvi decreases during october and november which typically represent the final crop phenological stages before harvest we divided the ofrs into different class sizes and compared the highest surface area recorded during the entire time series from both inundation datasets the highest ofr surface area represents the reservoir size with the surface area from the ground truth dataset fig 4 both datasets underestimate the ofrs size for all classes and the smallest ofrs 0 5 ha and 5 10 ha had the highest mpe the jrc 20 4 and 12 5 had higher mpe than the dswe 12 4 and 7 44 for both classes fig 4 inset boxplots in addition these two classes had the highest variability in mpe which decreased as the size of the ofrs increased in general the mpe for both datasets is below 10 for ofrs larger than 10 ha and the jrc had higher values when compared to the dswe for all classes however the datasets were statistically different only for the first two classes p value 0 05 i e ofrs smaller than 10 ha fig 4 inset boxplots we found the highest agreement in size for ofrs with surface area higher than 25 ha r 2 0 99 and 0 98 for dswe and jrc although the smallest classes 0 5 ha and 5 10 ha presented the highest mpe these classes also had good agreement r 2 0 8 for both datasets overall the jrc had smaller r 2 values than the dswe for all classes the magnitude of mpe fig 4 inset boxplots corroborate with previous studies ogilvie et al 2018 jones et al 2017 that used landsat imagery to describe small water bodies ogilvie et al 2018 found that the commission error i e producer error of the jrc increased up to 50 for ofrs with area 5 ha jones et al 2017 used the jrc to assess 272 ofrs surface area ranging from 0 09 to 72 ha and reported that the dataset was unsuitable for monitoring ofrs with surface area smaller than 5 1 ha 56 of ofrs in the volta basin since the magnitude of mean absolute percent error reached up to 71 there are multiple challenges when using landsat imagery to classify small water bodies these challenges help explain the discrepancies found in the ofr size analysis fig 4 mueller et al 2016 developed a methodology to map water bodies at a continental scale i e australia using 25 years of landsat imagery they concluded that their product was underestimating the extent of surface water where there was a mix between water and vegetation pixels highlighting a limitation of using landsat inundation products to assess small wetland and small water bodies similarly ogilvie et al 2018 found that the accuracy of the jrc reduces with the presence of vegetation and algae and for shallow water bodies the authors also highlighted that the geometry of the ofrs influenced how these water bodies are represented in optical remote sensing in this study ofrs with regular shapes tended to present lower mpe and higher agreement with ground truthing datasets and ofrs with asymmetric shapes were more inclined to have higher discrepancies jones et al 2017 reported analogous findings and demonstrated that the accuracy of the jrc area estimates improved with increasing the ofr size and decreasing the geometric shape complexity we assessed the ofrs geometric shape accounting for their area and perimeter fig 5 shows the distribution of si for all ofrs in each class size on farm reservoirs with si 1 have increasingly complex geometric shape the smallest ofrs surface area 15 ha presented higher si values average si 2 when compared to the larger the ofrs surface area 15 ha on farm reservoirs with surface area 25 ha presented the smallest si median si 0 77 with upper and lower limits of 5 12 and 0 17 although the smallest ofrs had a more complex geometric shape and higher mpe figs 4 and 5 we did not find a close relationship r2 0 2 and r 2 0 1 between the reservoirs si and the mpe for any of the classes fig 6 shows that all classes have high na index between january through april and november through december na index 0 30 the jrc has no information for any of the ofrs during december and january for the entire time series the size of the bars i e sa ratio helps us understand the behavior of each ofr class during the year enabling us to infer seasonal trends in surface water change both datasets show that the ofrs were closer to maximum area during march april and may sa ratio 0 75 0 90 and at the lowest capacity i e smaller bars in june july and august sa ratio 0 60 0 70 there are multiple factors impacting the ofrs surface area change these factors include climate variables e g precipitation air temperature as well as anthropogenic variables e g reservoir usage and other environmental factors e g soil type on which the ofrs are built distance and topographical distance to major water streams arvor et al 2018 habets et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in this study we focused on exploring how much of the variance in ofrs surface area change can be explained by combining precipitation air temperature and the ndvi from vegetated surface surrounding the ofrs the ofrs filling process occurs mostly during the wet season of the year when the study region receives most of the annual precipitation we analyzed precipitation time series for all ofrs and we found that most of the precipitation events occur in march april and may figs 3 and s1 which coincides with the months when the ofrs are closer to maximum extent i e highest sa ratio values fig 6 moreover the driest months occur during the summer i e june july and august figs 3 and s1 which is the period when the highest temperature values are recorded and the ofrs are found to be at the lowest capacities range this can be an indication of irrigation activities as the vegetated surfaces surrounding the ofrs starts to green up i e increase in ndvi values when the study region receives most of its precipitation before and early summer and the highest ndvi values occur during late and end of summer the lowest sa ratio values during the summer months can be explained by two main factors 1 the dry critical months are when the farmers are irrigating their crops the last u s department of agriculture census showed that 100 of rice was irrigated and 84 of soybean and 92 of cotton were irrigated at least once during the 2018 growing season in eastern arkansas nass usda 2020 and 2 the high records of air temperature can contribute to increase the ofrs outflow through evaporation which can be 25 of the ofrs outflow during dry critical months friedrich et al 2018 guerra et al 1990 zhao and gao 2019 previous studies showed that shallow ofrs are more prone to evaporation losses than large water bodies and evaporation was identified as a major factor contributing to reduce water storage especially in dry critical periods of the year fowe et al 2015 liebe et al 2005 we did not account for evaporation losses in our modeling scenarios because it is beyond the scope of this study as illustrated by zhao and gao 2019 estimating evaporation losses from reservoirs is not a trivial task the authors stressed that detailed information about the ofrs surface water area and evaporation rate is required to accurately estimate evaporation losses in addition besides climate variables i e air temperature and precipitation the ofrs hydrological dynamic can be influenced by the watershed discharge reduced discharge results in less water supply during the ofr filling process ibrahim et al 2015 tinoco et al 2016 nonetheless the ofrs used in this study are not located on the main water streams and therefore the ofrs surface area changes are independent of the discharge seasonality which is why we did not include discharge in our analysis the ofrs filling process during the wet season is directly related to the volume of water from precipitation and runoff events and the filling process depends on the ofrs surface area our results indicate that the dswe and jrc could be used to describe a set of ofrs behavior in terms of area change along the months and years fig 6 this relevant to poorly monitored basins around the world that have a high concentration of ofrs given that the jrc data is available globally the methods implemented in this study could be used in other regions of the world if the jrc is available for instance the jaguaribe basin area of 70 000 km2 in the state of cear√° brazil is known for having a conglomerate of ofrs dubreuil and girard 1973 formiga johnsson and kemper 2007 gondim et al 2012 although efforts to monitor these water bodies date back to the 1950 s dubreuil and girard 1973 most of the reservoirs are poorly or not monitored at all the use of inundation datasets could then enhance the knowledge of water authorities to create and or improve current water planning in the region nevertheless we should also highlight that the uncertainties carried by the dswe and jrc datasets fig 4 will contribute to under or over estimation respectively of the ofrs volume capacity if the datasets are used to develop a sustainable water plan fowe et al 2015 we further explored how climate variables and ndvi contribute to the variation of the ofrs sa ratio using a generalized additive mixed model approach the results from the global models i e including huc as a random effect for both the dswe and jrc datasets are shown on table 2 both models explained less than 15 of the variability in sa ratio r 2 0 15 and there were small differences for the fixed effects between the inundation datasets the r 2 values from the generalized additive models at huc level are shown on fig 7 in general the jrc presented higher r 2 values 0 04 0 29 when compared to dswe 0 03 0 27 the r 2 values varied between different hucs and the huc with the lowest marginal r 2 0 1 huc h has only two ofrs for hucs that have a considerable number of reservoirs 50 and still presented a low r 2 0 20 e g hucs c and e the variability in size of ofrs within each huc may influence the performance of the model when explaining the variance in sa ratio with different processes governing reservoirs of different size classes for instance huc e has a total of 79 reservoirs and the reservoirs size range varies between 2 4 and 150 ha the higher jrc r 2 values when compared to the dswe was unexpected as the jrc has generally higher na index and no information for january and december for any of the ofrs a possible explanation is that the lower amount of information is contributing to less variability in the sa ratio and therefore higher r 2 values the performance of our models table 2 fig 7 can be attributed to several factors ranging from the uncertainties contained in the explanatory variables e g climate variables from interpolated grids to the fact that we have not included anthropological factors e g reservoir usage in our modeling scenarios ndvi was the only variable relating to crop phenology and thus potentially related to irrigation water use although the prism dataset is widely used in studies that assess the long term impact 20 years of climate variables e g precipitation air temperature this dataset is created through the interpolation of ground data and therefore the time series extracted from the dataset carries the uncertainty from interpolation and modeling techniques gao et al 2017 spangler et al 2019 we believe that our modeling scenarios could be improved by using time series of climate variables from in situ data collection however it is very unlikely that every farmer will have an in situ meteorological station to keep records of climate variables our models are also influenced by the uncertainty in the ndvi time series which are subject to the same challenges of using landsat based inundation datasets e g data gaps cloud obscuration mixed pixels due to pixel size in addition we assumed that the water stored by the ofrs was being used in a radius of 1 km this assumption was based on the idea that ofrs supply water to cropland that is closely located in spite of being a fair assumption we do not know exactly where the water is being used for instance farmers can have different irrigation schedules for fields adjacent to the ofrs and it is common to mix the water resources obtained from the ofr and from irrigation wells furthermore there are several reservoirs that are located close to green areas e g forest patches and that may contribute to less variation in ndvi along the year there are other anthropogenic factors that may contribute to the sa ratio dynamics and we are not accounting for them in our models these variables could be i intensity of irrigation activities we are able to identify the general trends of sa ratio however depending on the period of the year farmers are using the ofrs more or less extensively and this has s direct impact on the ofrs sa ratio ii the ofr filling process the ofrs are mainly filled with precipitation and runoff events therefore the ofrs receive most of their water volume during the wet season nonetheless farmers may opt to fill the ofrs by pumping water from the inlet streams if they have the infrastructure in place this filling process impacts sa ratio and it is very challenging to predict as it varies among different farmers and periods of the year the monthly time scale of the inundation datasets can also help explain the performance of our modeling results the ofrs sa ratio may have events surface area changes occurring at a sub monthly scale that are not being captured by the inundation datasets and the explanatory variables we believe that better modeling results could be obtained by employing satellite datasets with higher temporal resolution for example the sentinel 1 and 2 10 day revisit period and planetscope cubesats daily revisit period lastly potential modeling improvements could be achieved employing satellite based evapotranspiration products allen et al 2015 mhawej and faour 2020 nonetheless these products require exhaustive calibration and validation which is site specific and extensive ground knowledge on which and where the crops are planted unfortunately this information it is not available and therefore these products were not included on this study the spatial variability of the fixed effects at the huc level are shown on fig 8 precipitation resulted in positive slopes for all hucs and both inundation datasets and the slopes varied among hucs dswe 0 08 0 5 10 2 and jrc 0 01 0 3 10 2 maximum temperature also varied across different hucs however all slopes were negative dswe 0 02 to 1 4 10 2 and jrc 0 02 to 0 9 10 2 similarly the ndvi varied across different hucs with positive and negative slopes dswe 0 22 0 47 10 2 and jrc 0 02 to 1 4 10 2 the results of the generalized additive mixed models approach figs 7 and 8 can be combined with crop water requirements to plan the irrigation schedule for example crop water needs vary in space and time and are influenced by climate factors like precipitation and air temperature perin et al 2019 therefore the number and intensity of irrigation events also varies in space and time the slope of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi can be combined and used as a simple index when farmers are planning their irrigation schedule this index can be used to increase or decrease the amount of water applied in each irrigation event depending on the region s slope values this kind of index is commonly used in crop modeling and climate zoning battisti and sentelhas 2019 boote et al 1998 in which the simulated crop yield is penalized or not based on the region s climate e g crop yield is penalized under drought conditions the slope of precipitation maximum temperature and ndvi could then enhance tools which support irrigation management decisions helping farmers plan for regions and periods of the year that will require more or less water the dswe and jrc inundation data sets enable us to describe the general trends of the ofrs surface water area change and to depict the effects of climate variables on surface area change nonetheless we should bear in mind that hydrological monitoring of small water bodies using landsat inundation products has several constraints that need to be assessed when applying the methods to other study regions the restrictions of using the long term landsat archive to monitor small water bodies range from data gaps i e cloud obscuration which have direct impact on the accuracy of the seasonal information to spatial resolution issues that prevent the accurate classification of water bodies to the 16 day repeat cycle that may miss rapid flood events that occur on a shorter timescale our analysis points out several challenges of using landsat inundation products for water planning purposes for example these datasets may be unsuitable for monitoring reservoirs with area between 0 and 5 ha as both datasets can have errors higher than 20 for reservoir extent fig 4 furthermore for certain months of the year e g december and january there is a higher occurrence of missing information which is an important limitation when aiming to use the datasets for continuous monitoring fig 6 the jrc has no information for the months of december and january and this could be partially explained by the algorithms used to create this inundation dataset the jrc was primarily designed to represent the occurrence of open surface water and not to detect surface water when there is spectral reflectance mixing of the water and vegetation devries et al 2017 jones 2019 which is a common characteristic of the ofrs that are relatively shallow and small water bodies therefore possibly leading to inadequately classifying ofrs in addition the absence of information is related to the well known landsat 7 etm slc scan line correctors failure after 31 may 2003 hossain et al 2015 these limitations are overcome by combining multiple satellite sources to monitor surface water dynamics vanthof and kelly 2019 used the jrc in conjunction with higher spatial and temporal satellite imagery and were able to increase the number of observations of ofrs and reduce the mapping error to 3 of the reservoir size and therefore enable the use of different satellite imagery for water planning regardless of the limitations of the landsat surface water datasets addressed above the dswe and jrc can be used as a first step to monitor water bodies at a large scale which is important in regions where there is a conglomerate of these water bodies the national inventory of dams nids dataset http nid usace army mil provides the location i e longitude and latitude of more than 80 000 dams located in the u s although this dataset does not have information about ofrs this dataset brings relevant information of the major dams in the u s including the construction year size in area and relevant hydrological information i e depth storage capacity also the nid dataset can be coupled with surface water extent information to enhance knowledge on the water budget in regions with a concentration of dams briefly if the depth of the reservoir and its topographic information e g digital elevation model are available it is possible to calculate the storage area depth for these reservoirs yigzaw et al 2018 which can be combined with surface area to estimate volume storage change from two different time steps yao et al 2018 and create a time series of water volume change vanthof and kelly 2019 in addition the same approach detailed above and the methods used in our study could be expanded to other countries by employing global water impoundments datasets for instance the global georeferenced database of dams mulligan et al 2020 and the geo referenced database on dams lehner et al 2011 our study furthers the use of landsat inundation datasets where there is insufficient ofr monitoring the biggest hurdle of replicating our study to other countries or regions is the lack of an ofr ground truth dataset however nowadays there is daily high spatial resolution 3 m satellite imagery for the entire globe planet team 2017 which enable future investigators to create a similar ofr dataset used in our study a ground truth dataset can be created by combining multiple platforms and satellite imagery sources our results showed that the dswe or jrc can be used to understand the temporal variability of ofrs and although there are mapping errors due to the spatial resolution of the landsat imagery fig 4 a proxy of the ofr shape can be obtained by calculating the ofr frequency of inundation using the entire landsat catalog this process is widely used in the scientific community pekel et al 2016 soulard et al 2020 walker et al 2020 the ofr shape proxy can be converted to a vector and be used to retrieve high resolution satellite imagery from planetscope cubesats imagery 3 m spatial resolution planet labs has an international education and research program that allows scientists around the globe to use planetscope cubesats imagery free of costs this study is the first effort to apply long term surface water extent datasets to large scale ofrs monitoring in the u s therefore we highlight that future investigations should weight on several factors before deciding which dataset to use i e dswe or jrc the first of these factors i is imagery processing we downloaded the level 3 analysis ready data dswe scenes though the dataset is already pre processed several steps are required to obtain the monthly water history which can be a demanding task especially when downloading and processing the dataset for a large area the jrc monthly water history was obtained through gee using a straight forward downloading approach the gee platform can be used to recreate the dswe monthly water layer ahmad et al 2020 walker et al 2020 and therefore attenuate some of the demanding tasks e g downloading recreating tiles etc related to the dswe the second factor ii is missing information although both datasets are based on the landsat archive the dswe has less missing information than the jrc which is essential to continuous large scale monitoring the jrc is a global dataset and does not specifically target the classification of water bodies that have a frequent spectral reflectance mixing i e ofrs therefore the algorithms used to classify surface water tend to be more stringent when classifying water pixels resulting in higher occurrences of absent information pekel et al 2016 the third factor iii is maximum area percent error both datasets levy the same challenges related to spatial resolution when classifying small water bodies using landsat products jones et al 2017 ogilvie et al 2018 solander et al 2016 however the dswe captured the maximum extent of ofrs with less errors and higher agreement when compared to the jrc lastly we should have in mind that our study is limited to maximum reservoir extent analysis and a complete assessment of these datasets requires field validation and or measurement of the surface water area using higher spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery vanthof and kelly 2019 4 conclusion landsat surface inundation datasets can be used to map ofrs maximum extent and surface water area seasonality the dswe had smaller mean percent errors p value 0 05 and higher agreement compared to the jrc when mapping reservoirs smaller than 10 ha both datasets enable us to characterize the seasonality of the ofrs area change in eastern arkansas the ofrs are mostly filled in march april and may which can be partially explained by the precipitation regimen of the region we applied a generalized additive mixed model approach to quantify the impact of precipitation maximum temperature and the ndvi from the land surrounding the ofrs on the ofrs surface area change and we found that the impact of these variables varies in space i e for different hucs our results showed that these datasets can be used to enhance hydrological assessments in poorly monitored basins that have a concentration of artificial small water bodies and the methods employed on this study could be used to enhance knowledge about the ofrs surface water dynamics in other regions and different countries if the inundation datasets i e dswe or jrc are available our findings are a unique contribution on which inundation dataset to employ when aiming to monitor small water bodies at a large scale in the us lastly the two main drawbacks imposed by these datasets when implementing them for water planning purposes and policymaking are i inconsistent surface water area time series due to clouds and sensor related issues and the 16 day repeat cycle of the landsat imagery and ii spatial resolution of 30 m that may be unsuitable to monitor ofrs with surface area between 0 and 5 ha declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10236,improved subsurface drainage has been verified as a more efficient drainage technique for solving problems of farmland shortage and frequent floods in south china however the environmental effects of improved subsurface drainage with different parameters have rarely been studied in this study nitrogen loss in outflow and soil nitrogen content under improved subsurface drainage for one time drainage is evaluated based on a calibrated hydrus model considering the precipitation process initial groundwater table depth initial soil nitrogen content submerged pipe height drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height during a 3 day individual drainage the results indicate that hydrus performed well for the simulation under conditions of homogeneous soil and nitrogen content distribution when rainfall occurred on the first second and third days the total ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n losses under a rainfall of 141 mm are approximately 1 26 1 31 1 39 and 1 2 1 25 1 36 times that under a rainfall of 44 mm respectively the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage increased significantly 0 5 days after the rain began compared with the 10 cm initial groundwater table depth case the nitrogen loss under a 30 cm initial groundwater table depth reduced by approximately 23 the nh4 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage with 20 and 40 cm submerged heights of the pipe reduced by 23 and 48 respectively whereas the no3 n losses reduced by 24 and 51 respectively compared with those under a free outflow the initial soil nitrogen content contributed primarily to the nitrogen loss of the outflow the relationship between nitrogen loss per pipe and drain spacing drain depth can be described as second degree parabolic linear the effects of filter width and height are similar to that of drain spacing in the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease percentage of soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile at all times whereas the nh4 n mass increased at the 0 20 cm soil layer and the soil no3 n mass increased slightly at the 60 80 cm soil layer with increasing drainage time the results of this study provide a scientific basis for nitrogen management keywords hydrus improved subsurface drainage nitrogen loss soil nitrogen mass 1 introduction nitrogen loss from farmland is the main source of nitrogen pollution in the water environment liu et al 2014 nitrogen is an essential nutrient for crop growth whereas unused nitrogen entering the waterbody will cause water eutrophication mrdjen et al 2018 agricultural drainage is the main transport pathway for farmland nitrogen to enter the water environment skaggs et al 1994 it is important to understand the nitrogen contents in drainage outflow influencing factors and corresponding regularity as these factors are indispensable in agricultural nitrogen management many researchers have previously reported nitrogen loss under subsurface drainage where monthly seasonal or yearly nitrogen loss has been emphasized ale et al 2013 liang et al 2018 phogat et al 2014 saadat et al 2018 however for paddy fields or paddy upland rotation areas the subsurface drainage is always controlled and the pipe is not always open for dry farming areas controlled subsurface drainage is applied to reduce non point source pollution saadat et al 2018 subsurface drainage typically operates only when the groundwater table is high when heavy rainfall occurs or during special periods such as when drying a paddy field by controlling comes ritzema 1994 in practice drainage water management mainly focuses on one time drainage which is a one time process from pipe opening for drainage to pipe closing for controlling hence the nitrogen losses during one time drainage are more targeted and have more practical significance many factors can affect nitrogen loss during drainage xiao et al 2015 demonstrated that nitrogen loads in the early period of paddy flooding were at a relatively high level but decreased gradually as flooding continued sunohara et al 2015 indicated the effectiveness of controlled tile drainage for reducing watershed scale fluxes of stream water and nitrogen during the growing season based on experimental data from 2005 to 2011 matinzadeh et al 2017 simulated the effects of drain depth and spacing on nitrate and ammonium nitrogen losses and obtained an optimal drainage system density at a depth of 1 1 m and a spacing of 80 m he et al 2019 analyzed nitrogen loss by controlling different water tables in diÔ¨Äerent rice growth periods and demonstrated clear differences in nitrogen loss under subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage has been proposed aiming at solving the problems of farmland shortage and frequent floods the improved technique involves laying high permeability materials as filters around a pipe to achieve a more efficient drainage the drainage capacity has been verified in laboratory experiments field tests and simulations tao et al 2016 2017 the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage was approximately 1 9 times that under conventional subsurface drainage with the same ponding depth additionally the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the drain outflow under the improved subsurface drainage with different filter materials gravel layered sand gravel mixed sand gravel and straw were investigated based on only field tests from 2016 to 2018 tao et al 2019a the results showed that the improved subsurface drainage with gravel layered sand gravel or mixed sand gravel filter reduced the amount of ammonia nitrogen however an analysis for the comprehensive evaluation of factors affecting nitrogen loss under the improved subsurface drainage was not provided nangia et al 2010 and kladivko et al 2004 reported that the nitrate nitrogen loss per unit area was greater for narrower drain spacings and deeper drain depths under the conventional subsurface drainage guo et al 2006 verified that increased submerged height by controlled drainage can reduce nitrogen loss furthermore it was reported that groundwater depth affected drainage discharge tao et al 2017 whereas rainfall intensity affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in soil wang et al 2019 simulations are effective for evaluating drain performances using different parameters drainmod and swap soil water atmosphere plant and hydrus have been widely used to simulate subsurface drainage discharge and nitrogen performance it is difficult to simulate soil with horizontal heterogeneity using drainmod and swap hydrus can handle flow domains delineated by irregular boundaries and has been verified to satisfy water balance simulations under an improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 additionally hydrus can simulate solute movements mekala and nambi 2016 evaluated the reactive transport of ammonium nitrogen under continuous and alternate wetting as well as drying modes of irrigation in soil columns using hydrus 2d salehi et al 2017 assessed the ability of the hydrus 2d model in simulating the effect of subsurface controlled drainage on nitrate loss in paddy fields it was demonstrated that hydrus 2d successfully simulated nitrate concentrations with coefficients of determination of 0 95 and 0 89 in calibration and validation periods respectively the main objective of this study is to further evaluate the performance of nitrogen loss in one time improved subsurface drainage using the hydrus 2d model additional analysis will be conducted to consider factors affecting the nitrogen loss of improved subsurface drainage including the rainfall process initial groundwater table depth initial soil nitrogen content submerged depth drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height additionally the change in soil nitrogen content in different layers is discussed herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment and measurements field experiments were conducted at the xinmaqiao experiment station in huaibei plain china 117 22 e 33 09 n the huaibei plain is a typical farmland in south china that is prone to surface and subsurface waterlogging to mitigate waterlogging and farmland shortage in the huaibei plain the performance of an improved subsurface drainage was preliminarily tested five plots of conventional and improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter layered sand gravel filter mixed sand gravel filter and straw filter have been set since 2015 tao et al 2019a each plot contained three 75 mm diameter pipe drains the drains were installed at a depth of 0 7625 m and a spacing of 6 m the filter width and height of the improved subsurface drainage were 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively figure 1 in 2017 field experiments were performed twice i e one on september 6 and another on september 12 for the one time drainage test the pipe was set to open when the test began and closed when the test was completed the nitrogen concentrations of the drain outflow were measured when the drainage lasted for 60 220 380 min on september 6 and 70 260 440 min on september 12 the pipe was opened at approximately 8 30 and closed at approximately 15 00 for the first drainage test whereas it was opened at approximately 7 30 and closed at approximately 15 00 for the second drainage test the amounts of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were measured before and after the first drainage test and after the second drainage test the soil water contents in different soil layers were further measured via soil sampling and tdr time domain reflectometry the residual water content in the soil was 0 05 cm3 cm 3 additionally the average soil hydraulic conductivities in each plot were measured the measured average soil hydraulic conductivities of the conventional and improved subsurface drainage with mixed sand gravel filter and gravel filter plots were 0 805 0 805 and 0 916 m d respectively the initial soil nitrogen content and measured soil parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 numerical modeling theory the governing flow equation for the two dimensional isothermal darcian flow of water in a variable saturated rigid porous medium and the van genuchten model were adopted both of which have been verified as suitable for the discharge simulation of improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 the nitrogen transformation processes considered were as follows ammonia volatilization nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n adsorption of nh4 n

gravel filters are shown in table 2 comparisons of observed and simulated cumulative discharge and soil water contents at each plot are shown in figs 3 5 to evaluate the model performance of the water simulation comprehensively three statistical parameters were used coefficient of determination r 2 relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 saleh et al 2000 tao et al 2017 as shown in table 3 in general the parameters and model performed well the relative errors of the cumulative outflow of the improved subsurface with gravel and mixed sand gravel between the observed and simulated values were large owing to the large errors incurred during the initial stage 2 3 2 nitrogen loss and soil nitrogen content the parameters for solute transport that passed the calibration and verification were considered using the following values the molecular diffusion coefficients d w for nitrogen was 1 52 cm2 d 1 li et al 2015 the rate constant of mineralization and bio fixation of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm heights were 8 6 e 7d 1 and 5 8 e 7d 1 respectively the ammonia volatilization decay coefficient of the 0 20 cm height was 0 015 d 1 the d l of the soil and filter were 12 and 30 cm respectively li et al 2015 plumb and whitaker 1988 and d t was one fifth of d l other calibrated parameters used are shown in table 4 with relevant studies used as a reference tan et al 2015 comparisons of observed and simulated nitrogen concentrations and soil nitrogen contents for all plots are shown in figs 6 8 considering the small amount of observed data we only used r 2 and re as the statistical parameters for a preliminary assessment as shown in table 5 based on the correlation between the simulated and observed data of nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the outflow the soil nh 4 n and no3 n contents indicated favorable r 2 values of 0 54 1 most re between the simulated and observed data were within 15 whereas the others were within 30 this is attributable to four reasons first the water sample conditions in the field did not completely match the conditions in the simulation second the discharge in the test differed from that in the simulation condition because of the time required for the water in the pipe to flow to the outlet third the heterogeneity of the soil nitrogen contents might cause errors and fourth the nitrogen for one time drainage varied within a smaller range which might result in larger errors nonetheless the model satisfied the simulation and the parameters were reasonable 2 4 local sensitivity analysis of parameters to investigate the uncertainty in model simulations a sensitivity analysis of the parameters used in the model was performed the cumulative nh4 n and no3 n loss of the outflow under the conventional and improved subsurface drainage with a gravel filter was used as the objective function value the simulation conducted from september 6 12 was used as the basic background as shown in fig 9 the effects ranging from large to small were k d d l k n and d t for the nh4 n loss and d l k dn k n d t and k d for the no3 n loss the parameters that caused the absolute value of the variation amplitude to vary from 1 to 20 were k d and d l for the nh4 n loss and d l for the no3 n loss for the improved subsurface drainage the top five most significant effect factors were the k d of soil k d of gravel d l of gravel d l of soil and k n of gravel with the rangeability exceeding 1 for the nh4 n loss when the amplitude of k n of the soil varied from 20 20 the amplitude of the nh4 n loss varied by only 0 9 to 0 5 for the no3 n loss the amplitudes were less than 1 for all parameters with a 20 change and the top three sensitive factors were the k dn k n and d l of soil for the one time subsurface drainage the nitrogen transfer rates of k dn and k n did significantly affect the total nitrogen loss in the outflow this might be because the one time subsurface drainage duration was short resulting in less soil ammonia nitrogen nitrified to nitrate nitrogen and the less denitrification of nitrate nitrogen compared with monthly and seasonal drainage 2 5 simulated scenarios in practice drainage water management focuses on individual drainage the total nitrogen in the drain outflow during each drainage process is emphasized more the factors affecting nitrogen loss in the outflow under the improved subsurface drainage can be categorized into external factors and self factors the external factors include precipitation and its process initial groundwater table depth or water content soil nitrogen content and submerged pipe height the self factors include drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height using the improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter as an example the nitrogen loss per unit pipe length 1 m under different scenarios was analyzed based on the sensitivity analysis we assumed that the factors would not affect the model parameters additionally homogeneous soil and nitrogen distributions were assumed the hydraulic parameters of the soil are shown in table 6 the initial soil nh4 n and no3 n contents were 5 6 and 8 4 mg kg respectively drainage was assumed to persist for three days the basic geometric parameters were as follows rainfall that occurred on the first day 44 mm initial groundwater table depth 10 cm drain spacing 40 m drain depth 0 7625 m filter width 0 4 m and filter height 0 5 m furthermore for the rainfall of 44 and 141 mm per day the water contents in the unsaturated zone were approximately 0 38 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 respectively with the initial water table depths of 10 and 30 cm respectively tao et al 2017 the parameters used for different scenarios are shown in table 7 3 results 3 1 nitrogen loss in outflow 3 1 1 effect of rainfall as shown in fig 10 the heavier rainfall caused a greater nitrogen loss when rainfall occurred on the first second and third days the total nh4 n losses under a rainfall of 141 mm were approximately 1 26 1 31 and 1 39 times respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 1 2 1 25 and 1 36 times respectively of that under a rainfall of 44 mm it was evident that the larger the quantity of rainfall the greater was the nitrogen loss in the drain outflow furthermore the later the rainfall the more significant was the abovementioned effect when rainfall occurred on the first and second days the total losses of nh4 n and no3 n were similar i e much higher than that of the rainfall that occurred on the third day additionally we discovered that nitrogen loss occurred primarily during one to two days after rainfall fig 11 shows the total nh4 n and no3 n losses under different rainfall processes 44 mm when rainfall occurred the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased significantly however the turning point for the increase was not at the beginning of rainfall but 0 5 days thereafter this is attributable to the following reasons first the rainfall directly affected the distribution of soil nitrogen content but not the nitrogen loss in the outflow second the nitrogen transfer from the soil to the drain pipe required some time third the rainfall increased the soil water from the soil surface layer by layer and then the groundwater table increased slowly thereby increasing the outflow discharge 3 1 2 effect of initial groundwater table depth by simulation the total nh4 n losses with 10 and 30 cm initial groundwater table depths were approximately 1 57 and 1 19 g respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 31 82 and 24 39 g respectively it was evident that the nh4 n and no3 n losses decreased with increasing initial groundwater table depth the reason might be as follows a lower initial groundwater table depth would produce a smaller pressure head resulting in a smaller discharge tao et al 2017 meanwhile a smaller discharge would decrease the nitrogen loss when the nitrogen concentration changed slightly compared with the nitrogen loss at an initial groundwater table depth of 10 cm the values under the 30 cm initial groundwater table depth reduced by 23 3 1 3 effects of initial soil nitrogen content and submerged pipe height when the initial soil nitrogen contents were 0 5 1 and 2 times that of the basic values the nh4 n losses were approximately 0 78 1 57 and 3 12 g respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 15 81 31 82 and 63 18 g respectively fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and initial soil nitrogen contents satisfied a linear positive correlation which means that the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased linearly with the initial soil nitrogen content hence it was evident that a reasonable fertilization was crucial for maintaining the soil nitrogen at a reasonable level otherwise the nitrogen loss would be greater which would be detrimental to the water environment conversely the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow would decrease with increasing submerged pipe height the relationship can be described as a linear negative correlation fig 13 compared with the condition of the free outflow the nh4 n losses with 20 and 40 cm of submerged pipe heights reduced by 23 and 48 respectively whereas the no3 n losses reduced by 24 and 51 respectively the reasons might be as follows first a higher submerged height would yield a smaller pressure head resulting in a smaller discharge tao et al 2017 meanwhile a smaller discharge would reduce the nitrogen loss of the outflow second a smaller pressure head would reduce the convection and dispersion of nitrogen in many studies control drainage has been applied to reduce drainage discharge by setting different submerged heights using gates in ditches or standpipes at pipe orifices in subsurface drainage moreover this method and has been considered effective for reducing pollution in the farmland the results reflected the same rules and agricultural water management should be to reduce the nitrogen loss and improve the water management 3 1 4 effects of drain spacing and depth with a fixed filter size and drain depth the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow increased with the drain spacing whereas the increase percentage decreased gradually however unlike the rules of discharge under the improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 an effective control distance did not exist this might be because the larger the drain spacing the larger was the soil nitrogen mass in the control area of the subsurface drainage based on the equations of nitrogen transport and transformation even though the discharge increased slowly out of the effective control distance a high soil nitrogen content would increase the nitrogen concentration the nitrogen losses under the improved subsurface drainage with drain spacings of 20 40 and 60 m were 1 6 2 0 and 2 1 times that with 10 m drain spacing respectively the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses and drain spacing can be described as second degree parabolic fig 14 the nh4 n and no3 n losses with drain depths of 90 100 110 and 120 cm increased by 10 31 41 and 66 respectively compared with that of 80 cm drain depth the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and drain depths satisfied a linear positive correlation fig 15 the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased with the drain depth based on the formula for the improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2019b the relationship between discharge and drain depth satisfied a linear positive correlation in other words the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage were directly affected by the outflow discharge 3 1 5 effects of filter width and height fig 16 shows the effects of filter width and height on the nh4 n and no3 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage outflow as shown the nh4 n and no3 n losses the in outflow increased with the wider and higher filter whereas the increase percentage decreased gradually when the filter height was constant the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and filter width can be estimated as a second degree parabola the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased by approximately 40 and 36 respectively when filter width increased from 0 to 0 2 m subsequently the loss only increased by 2 based on the current value of every 0 1 m increase in width when the filter width increased from 0 2 to 0 6 m similarly when filter width remained constant the increase tendency of nitrogen loss owing to the filter height was the same as that owing to the filter width the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased by approximately 30 when the filter height increased from 0 to 0 2 m and only by 1 6 at every 0 1 m increase in height when the filter height increased from 0 2 to 0 7 m 3 2 nitrogen in the soils the nitrogen loss in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage was primarily from the soil the change in nitrogen mass in different soil layers was a concern fig 17 shows the percentage change of nh4 n and no3 n masses in different soil layers based on basic parameters at the 0 20 cm soil layer the nh4 n mass increased with the drain time this was because the zero order n transformation of mineralization and bio fixation primarily affected the soil nh4 n mass at 0 20 cm which was much larger than the consumed nh4 n mass caused downward migration and nitrification in other soil layers the nh4 n mass generally decreased with increasing drain time because of the downward migration and nitrification of nh4 n furthermore the percentage change in the soil nh4 n mass decreased gradually with increasing soil depth meanwhile the percentage change of no3 n in soil varied differently from that of nh4 n at the 60 80 cm soil layer the soil no3 n mass increased slightly the no3 n mass of in migration was larger than the total no3 n mass of out migration and denitrification in other soil layers the percentage change tendency of no3 n was the same as that of nh4 n compared with nh4 n the no3 n mass in the soil changed more easily this was because the adsorption of nh4 n by soil limited the transport of nh4 n and the transport of no3 n was much faster than that of nh4 n table 8 shows the ratio of soil nitrogen at the end and start of drainage under different rainfall processes the following rules can be inferred from table 8 first compared with the improved subsurface drainage cases the nh4 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil increased the most in all soil layers and the soil no3 n mass of all soil layers decreased under conventional subsurface drainage the no3 n mass of the 60 80 cm soil layer reduced the minimum percentage in all soil layers the discharge of the conventional subsurface drainage was less than that of the improved subsurface drainage the larger the discharge of outflow the larger was the hydrodynamic force which increased the transport of nitrogen to the pipe located at 80 cm soil depth hence the no3 n mass of the 60 80 cm soil layer under the conventional subsurface drainage was less than that under the improved subsurface drainage second for the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease of soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile whereas the maximum decrease occurred at the 20 40 cm soil layer for the nh4 n mass and at 0 20 cm for the no3 n mass in the conventional subsurface drainage third the amount of rainfall affected the soil nitrogen mass distribution the nh4 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil at days 0 5 and 1 and the no3 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil layer at days 1 and 2 decreased in the case of 141 mm 1 d but increased in the case of 44 mm 1 d generally the mineralization and bio fixation of nh4 n at the 0 20 cm soil layer was the main phenomenon when heavy rainfall occurred at days 1 and 2 the migration of nh4 n downward increased and exceeded the effect of mineralization and bio fixation when heavy rainfall occurred at day 3 the effect of migration was less than the accumulated effect of mineralization and bio fixation finally with the same nh4 n amount by mineralization and bio fixation the nh4 n mass increase in the 0 20 cm soil of cases 44 mm 2 d and 44 mm 3 d were higher than that of case 44 mm 1 d one day after drainage meanwhile the mass increase in the 0 20 cm soil of case 44 mm 3 d was higher than that of case 44 mm 2 d two days after drainage 4 discussion in this paper the parameters were calibrated artificially considering the complex parameters and many kinds of observed values such as soil water content nitrogen concentration of drainage outflow nitrogen content of the soil in different layer while in some studies the parameters can be gained by global optimization algorithm wang et al 2020 the global parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis are needed firstly to deeply discuss the shortcomings in the simulation process and the uncertainty that these shortcomings may have on the results global parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis have been done by sobol method using simlab software besides the measured parameters of soil hydraulic conductivity and saturated soil water content 22 kinds of parameters have been considered including the a n Œ∏ r k d d l k n d t k dn ammonia volatilization decay coefficient of the soil ks a n Œ∏ r Œ∏ s k d d l k n k dn d t of the filter d w and rate constant of mineralization and bio fixation of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm the ranges of these parameters were within 50 less or more than the calibrated ones 736 data sets have been simulated under the condition of simulated scenarios with 44 mm rainfall on the first day the sensitive parameters with the index more than 0 01 have been given in fig 18 among these parameters a and n of the soil have obvious effect on the pipe discharge the sobol total order indexes of these two parameters were 1 11 and 0 19 and thenŒ∏ s of the filter and Œ∏ r of the soil also have a little effect with corresponding indexes of 0 02 and 0 01 other than the above parameters other parameters have little effects the sobol first order index of hydraulic conductivity of the filter was only 0 002 that is to say the change in the medium of filter will change the hydraulic conductivity but may not affect the pipe discharge in the literature tao et al 2017 it also said that when the filter hydraulic conductivity was larger than 30 40 times of the soil s the subsequent increase of filter hydraulic conductivity would have small impact on the increase of discharge while for ammonia nitrogen loss of the outflow the top three effect factors in order are k d of soil a of soil k d of the filter with sobol total order indexes of 1 00 0 44 0 13 the adsorption plays an important role in ammonia nitrogen transport from fig 18 it could be seen that the main parameters are also primary factors on discharge except k d which means that the movement of the water flow also plays an important role of the ammonia nitrogen in the test the simulation time is only 3 days hence the k n was only the sixth influential factor additionally the parameters affecting discharge mostly have more effects on nitrate nitrogen loss the top five effect factors in order are a of soil k dn of the soil n of the soil Œ∏ s of the filter andŒ∏ r of the soil with sobol total order indexes of 1 02 0 19 0 19 0 02 and 0 01 by uncertainty analysis we found that the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of discharge ammonia nitrogen loss and the nitrate nitrogen loss were respective 17 854 cm2 2 03 g and 33 69 g the corresponding lower limit were 14 357 cm2 0 85 g and 27 01 g the simulated value based on calibrated parameters were between the lower and upper limit and close to the median generally speaking the sensitive parameters should be given more attention and the unsensitive parameters may choose by experience or literatures in this paper the sensitive parameters have been considered reasonably of course the automatically optimized parameters and long period effect may be considered in the future 5 conclusions numerical experiments were performed to investigate the nitrogen loss of an improved subsurface drainage for a one time drainage based on calibration and validation by field data considering external and self factors the main conclusions are as follows first the quantity of rainfall imposed a significant effect on the nitrogen loss of the drain outflow and the later the rainfall occurred the more significant was the effect the nh4 n and no3 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage increased at half days after the beginning of the rainfall second the nitrogen losses of the improved subsurface drainage outflow decreased with increasing initial groundwater table depth the nitrogen losses increased linearly and decreased linearly respectively when the initial soil nitrogen content and submerged height of pipe increased the relationship between nitrogen loss and drain spacing drain depth can be described as second degree parabolic linear the effects of filter width and height were similar to those of drain spacing third based on analyzing changes in the soil nitrogen mass we discovered that the nh4 n mass increased with the drain time in the 0 20 cm soil layer under both the conventional and improved subsurface drainage meanwhile the soil no3 n mass increased slightly in the 60 80 cm soil layer only under the improved subsurface drainage in other soil layers the nh4 n and no3 n masses decreased with increasing drain time and soil depth finally in the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease of the soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile whereas the maximum decrease occurred at 20 40 and 0 20 cm for the nh4 n and no3 n masses respectively in the conventional subsurface drainage in the future more tests and data will be measured continually and the parameters will be further verified furthermore n loss under the improved subsurface drainage in a heterogeneous distribution of n content in soil will be analyzed additionally the assessment of uncertainty prediction can be

10236,improved subsurface drainage has been verified as a more efficient drainage technique for solving problems of farmland shortage and frequent floods in south china however the environmental effects of improved subsurface drainage with different parameters have rarely been studied in this study nitrogen loss in outflow and soil nitrogen content under improved subsurface drainage for one time drainage is evaluated based on a calibrated hydrus model considering the precipitation process initial groundwater table depth initial soil nitrogen content submerged pipe height drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height during a 3 day individual drainage the results indicate that hydrus performed well for the simulation under conditions of homogeneous soil and nitrogen content distribution when rainfall occurred on the first second and third days the total ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n losses under a rainfall of 141 mm are approximately 1 26 1 31 1 39 and 1 2 1 25 1 36 times that under a rainfall of 44 mm respectively the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage increased significantly 0 5 days after the rain began compared with the 10 cm initial groundwater table depth case the nitrogen loss under a 30 cm initial groundwater table depth reduced by approximately 23 the nh4 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage with 20 and 40 cm submerged heights of the pipe reduced by 23 and 48 respectively whereas the no3 n losses reduced by 24 and 51 respectively compared with those under a free outflow the initial soil nitrogen content contributed primarily to the nitrogen loss of the outflow the relationship between nitrogen loss per pipe and drain spacing drain depth can be described as second degree parabolic linear the effects of filter width and height are similar to that of drain spacing in the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease percentage of soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile at all times whereas the nh4 n mass increased at the 0 20 cm soil layer and the soil no3 n mass increased slightly at the 60 80 cm soil layer with increasing drainage time the results of this study provide a scientific basis for nitrogen management keywords hydrus improved subsurface drainage nitrogen loss soil nitrogen mass 1 introduction nitrogen loss from farmland is the main source of nitrogen pollution in the water environment liu et al 2014 nitrogen is an essential nutrient for crop growth whereas unused nitrogen entering the waterbody will cause water eutrophication mrdjen et al 2018 agricultural drainage is the main transport pathway for farmland nitrogen to enter the water environment skaggs et al 1994 it is important to understand the nitrogen contents in drainage outflow influencing factors and corresponding regularity as these factors are indispensable in agricultural nitrogen management many researchers have previously reported nitrogen loss under subsurface drainage where monthly seasonal or yearly nitrogen loss has been emphasized ale et al 2013 liang et al 2018 phogat et al 2014 saadat et al 2018 however for paddy fields or paddy upland rotation areas the subsurface drainage is always controlled and the pipe is not always open for dry farming areas controlled subsurface drainage is applied to reduce non point source pollution saadat et al 2018 subsurface drainage typically operates only when the groundwater table is high when heavy rainfall occurs or during special periods such as when drying a paddy field by controlling comes ritzema 1994 in practice drainage water management mainly focuses on one time drainage which is a one time process from pipe opening for drainage to pipe closing for controlling hence the nitrogen losses during one time drainage are more targeted and have more practical significance many factors can affect nitrogen loss during drainage xiao et al 2015 demonstrated that nitrogen loads in the early period of paddy flooding were at a relatively high level but decreased gradually as flooding continued sunohara et al 2015 indicated the effectiveness of controlled tile drainage for reducing watershed scale fluxes of stream water and nitrogen during the growing season based on experimental data from 2005 to 2011 matinzadeh et al 2017 simulated the effects of drain depth and spacing on nitrate and ammonium nitrogen losses and obtained an optimal drainage system density at a depth of 1 1 m and a spacing of 80 m he et al 2019 analyzed nitrogen loss by controlling different water tables in diÔ¨Äerent rice growth periods and demonstrated clear differences in nitrogen loss under subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage has been proposed aiming at solving the problems of farmland shortage and frequent floods the improved technique involves laying high permeability materials as filters around a pipe to achieve a more efficient drainage the drainage capacity has been verified in laboratory experiments field tests and simulations tao et al 2016 2017 the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage was approximately 1 9 times that under conventional subsurface drainage with the same ponding depth additionally the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the drain outflow under the improved subsurface drainage with different filter materials gravel layered sand gravel mixed sand gravel and straw were investigated based on only field tests from 2016 to 2018 tao et al 2019a the results showed that the improved subsurface drainage with gravel layered sand gravel or mixed sand gravel filter reduced the amount of ammonia nitrogen however an analysis for the comprehensive evaluation of factors affecting nitrogen loss under the improved subsurface drainage was not provided nangia et al 2010 and kladivko et al 2004 reported that the nitrate nitrogen loss per unit area was greater for narrower drain spacings and deeper drain depths under the conventional subsurface drainage guo et al 2006 verified that increased submerged height by controlled drainage can reduce nitrogen loss furthermore it was reported that groundwater depth affected drainage discharge tao et al 2017 whereas rainfall intensity affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in soil wang et al 2019 simulations are effective for evaluating drain performances using different parameters drainmod and swap soil water atmosphere plant and hydrus have been widely used to simulate subsurface drainage discharge and nitrogen performance it is difficult to simulate soil with horizontal heterogeneity using drainmod and swap hydrus can handle flow domains delineated by irregular boundaries and has been verified to satisfy water balance simulations under an improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 additionally hydrus can simulate solute movements mekala and nambi 2016 evaluated the reactive transport of ammonium nitrogen under continuous and alternate wetting as well as drying modes of irrigation in soil columns using hydrus 2d salehi et al 2017 assessed the ability of the hydrus 2d model in simulating the effect of subsurface controlled drainage on nitrate loss in paddy fields it was demonstrated that hydrus 2d successfully simulated nitrate concentrations with coefficients of determination of 0 95 and 0 89 in calibration and validation periods respectively the main objective of this study is to further evaluate the performance of nitrogen loss in one time improved subsurface drainage using the hydrus 2d model additional analysis will be conducted to consider factors affecting the nitrogen loss of improved subsurface drainage including the rainfall process initial groundwater table depth initial soil nitrogen content submerged depth drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height additionally the change in soil nitrogen content in different layers is discussed herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment and measurements field experiments were conducted at the xinmaqiao experiment station in huaibei plain china 117 22 e 33 09 n the huaibei plain is a typical farmland in south china that is prone to surface and subsurface waterlogging to mitigate waterlogging and farmland shortage in the huaibei plain the performance of an improved subsurface drainage was preliminarily tested five plots of conventional and improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter layered sand gravel filter mixed sand gravel filter and straw filter have been set since 2015 tao et al 2019a each plot contained three 75 mm diameter pipe drains the drains were installed at a depth of 0 7625 m and a spacing of 6 m the filter width and height of the improved subsurface drainage were 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively figure 1 in 2017 field experiments were performed twice i e one on september 6 and another on september 12 for the one time drainage test the pipe was set to open when the test began and closed when the test was completed the nitrogen concentrations of the drain outflow were measured when the drainage lasted for 60 220 380 min on september 6 and 70 260 440 min on september 12 the pipe was opened at approximately 8 30 and closed at approximately 15 00 for the first drainage test whereas it was opened at approximately 7 30 and closed at approximately 15 00 for the second drainage test the amounts of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were measured before and after the first drainage test and after the second drainage test the soil water contents in different soil layers were further measured via soil sampling and tdr time domain reflectometry the residual water content in the soil was 0 05 cm3 cm 3 additionally the average soil hydraulic conductivities in each plot were measured the measured average soil hydraulic conductivities of the conventional and improved subsurface drainage with mixed sand gravel filter and gravel filter plots were 0 805 0 805 and 0 916 m d respectively the initial soil nitrogen content and measured soil parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 numerical modeling theory the governing flow equation for the two dimensional isothermal darcian flow of water in a variable saturated rigid porous medium and the van genuchten model were adopted both of which have been verified as suitable for the discharge simulation of improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 the nitrogen transformation processes considered were as follows ammonia volatilization nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n adsorption of nh4 n mineralization and bio fixation to nh4 n and denitrification of no3 n the partial differential equations governing nitrogen transport and transformation in the variable saturated state are expressed

the same as that presented by tao et al 2017 the discretization of the 0 200 cm soil system in hydrus is shown in fig 2 the surface boundary was set as the atmospheric boundary and the other boundary around the soil was a no flux boundary the pipe drain was assigned as a variable head boundary because of the pipe control water heads of 0 and 1 106 cm were set when the pipe was opened and closed respectively the drainage processes on september 6 and september 12 were used for calibration and validation respectively 2 3 1 discharge and soil water content the hydraulic property parameters of the gravel and sand gravel filters were set to the values adopted by filipoviƒá et al 2014 tao et al 2017 as a reference the final estimations of soil hydraulic parameters of the soil gravel and sand

tao et al 2017 as shown in table 3 in general the parameters and model performed well the relative errors of the cumulative outflow of the improved subsurface with gravel and mixed sand gravel between the observed and simulated values were large owing to the large errors incurred during the initial stage 2 3 2 nitrogen loss and soil nitrogen content the parameters for solute transport that passed the calibration and verification were considered using the following values the molecular diffusion coefficients d w for nitrogen was 1 52 cm2 d 1 li et al 2015 the rate constant of mineralization and bio fixation of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm heights were 8 6 e 7d 1 and 5 8 e 7d 1 respectively the ammonia volatilization decay coefficient of the 0 20 cm height was 0 015 d 1 the d l of the soil and filter were 12 and 30 cm respectively li et al 2015 plumb and whitaker 1988 and d t was one fifth of d l other calibrated parameters used are shown in table 4 with relevant studies used as a reference tan et al 2015 comparisons of observed and simulated nitrogen concentrations and soil nitrogen contents for all plots are shown in figs 6 8 considering the small amount of observed data we only used r 2 and re as the statistical parameters for a preliminary assessment as shown in table 5 based on the correlation between the simulated and observed data of nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the outflow the soil nh 4 n and no3 n contents indicated favorable r 2 values of 0 54 1 most re between the simulated and observed data were within 15 whereas the others were within 30 this is attributable to four reasons first the water sample conditions in the field did not completely match the conditions in the simulation second the discharge in the test differed from that in the simulation condition because of the time required for the water in the pipe to flow to the outlet third the heterogeneity of the soil nitrogen contents might cause errors and fourth the nitrogen for one time drainage varied within a smaller range which might result in larger errors nonetheless the model satisfied the simulation and the parameters were reasonable 2 4 local sensitivity analysis of parameters to investigate the uncertainty in model simulations a sensitivity analysis of the parameters used in the model was performed the cumulative nh4 n and no3 n loss of the outflow under the conventional and improved subsurface drainage with a gravel filter was used as the objective function value the simulation conducted from september 6 12 was used as the basic background as shown in fig 9 the effects ranging from large to small were k d d l k n and d t for the nh4 n loss and d l k dn k n d t and k d for the no3 n loss the parameters that caused the absolute value of the variation amplitude to vary from 1 to 20 were k d and d l for the nh4 n loss and d l for the no3 n loss for the improved subsurface drainage the top five most significant effect factors were the k d of soil k d of gravel d l of gravel d l of soil and k n of gravel with the rangeability exceeding 1 for the nh4 n loss when the amplitude of k n of the soil varied from 20 20 the amplitude of the nh4 n loss varied by only 0 9 to 0 5 for the no3 n loss the amplitudes were less than 1 for all parameters with a 20 change and the top three sensitive factors were the k dn k n and d l of soil for the one time subsurface drainage the nitrogen transfer rates of k dn and k n did significantly affect the total nitrogen loss in the outflow this might be because the one time subsurface drainage duration was short resulting in less soil ammonia nitrogen nitrified to nitrate nitrogen and the less denitrification of nitrate nitrogen compared with monthly and seasonal drainage 2 5 simulated scenarios in practice drainage water management focuses on individual drainage the total nitrogen in the drain outflow during each drainage process is emphasized more the factors affecting nitrogen loss in the outflow under the improved subsurface drainage can be categorized into external factors and self factors the external factors include precipitation and its process initial groundwater table depth or water content soil nitrogen content and submerged pipe height the self factors include drain spacing drain depth filter width and filter height using the improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter as an example the nitrogen loss per unit pipe length 1 m under different scenarios was analyzed based on the sensitivity analysis we assumed that the factors would not affect the model parameters additionally homogeneous soil and nitrogen distributions were assumed the hydraulic parameters of the soil are shown in table 6 the initial soil nh4 n and no3 n contents were 5 6 and 8 4 mg kg respectively drainage was assumed to persist for three days the basic geometric parameters were as follows rainfall that occurred on the first day 44 mm initial groundwater table depth 10 cm drain spacing 40 m drain depth 0 7625 m filter width 0 4 m and filter height 0 5 m furthermore for the rainfall of 44 and 141 mm per day the water contents in the unsaturated zone were approximately 0 38 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 respectively with the initial water table depths of 10 and 30 cm respectively tao et al 2017 the parameters used for different scenarios are shown in table 7 3 results 3 1 nitrogen loss in outflow 3 1 1 effect of rainfall as shown in fig 10 the heavier rainfall caused a greater nitrogen loss when rainfall occurred on the first second and third days the total nh4 n losses under a rainfall of 141 mm were approximately 1 26 1 31 and 1 39 times respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 1 2 1 25 and 1 36 times respectively of that under a rainfall of 44 mm it was evident that the larger the quantity of rainfall the greater was the nitrogen loss in the drain outflow furthermore the later the rainfall the more significant was the abovementioned effect when rainfall occurred on the first and second days the total losses of nh4 n and no3 n were similar i e much higher than that of the rainfall that occurred on the third day additionally we discovered that nitrogen loss occurred primarily during one to two days after rainfall fig 11 shows the total nh4 n and no3 n losses under different rainfall processes 44 mm when rainfall occurred the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased significantly however the turning point for the increase was not at the beginning of rainfall but 0 5 days thereafter this is attributable to the following reasons first the rainfall directly affected the distribution of soil nitrogen content but not the nitrogen loss in the outflow second the nitrogen transfer from the soil to the drain pipe required some time third the rainfall increased the soil water from the soil surface layer by layer and then the groundwater table increased slowly thereby increasing the outflow discharge 3 1 2 effect of initial groundwater table depth by simulation the total nh4 n losses with 10 and 30 cm initial groundwater table depths were approximately 1 57 and 1 19 g respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 31 82 and 24 39 g respectively it was evident that the nh4 n and no3 n losses decreased with increasing initial groundwater table depth the reason might be as follows a lower initial groundwater table depth would produce a smaller pressure head resulting in a smaller discharge tao et al 2017 meanwhile a smaller discharge would decrease the nitrogen loss when the nitrogen concentration changed slightly compared with the nitrogen loss at an initial groundwater table depth of 10 cm the values under the 30 cm initial groundwater table depth reduced by 23 3 1 3 effects of initial soil nitrogen content and submerged pipe height when the initial soil nitrogen contents were 0 5 1 and 2 times that of the basic values the nh4 n losses were approximately 0 78 1 57 and 3 12 g respectively whereas the no3 n losses were 15 81 31 82 and 63 18 g respectively fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and initial soil nitrogen contents satisfied a linear positive correlation which means that the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased linearly with the initial soil nitrogen content hence it was evident that a reasonable fertilization was crucial for maintaining the soil nitrogen at a reasonable level otherwise the nitrogen loss would be greater which would be detrimental to the water environment conversely the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow would decrease with increasing submerged pipe height the relationship can be described as a linear negative correlation fig 13 compared with the condition of the free outflow the nh4 n losses with 20 and 40 cm of submerged pipe heights reduced by 23 and 48 respectively whereas the no3 n losses reduced by 24 and 51 respectively the reasons might be as follows first a higher submerged height would yield a smaller pressure head resulting in a smaller discharge tao et al 2017 meanwhile a smaller discharge would reduce the nitrogen loss of the outflow second a smaller pressure head would reduce the convection and dispersion of nitrogen in many studies control drainage has been applied to reduce drainage discharge by setting different submerged heights using gates in ditches or standpipes at pipe orifices in subsurface drainage moreover this method and has been considered effective for reducing pollution in the farmland the results reflected the same rules and agricultural water management should be to reduce the nitrogen loss and improve the water management 3 1 4 effects of drain spacing and depth with a fixed filter size and drain depth the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow increased with the drain spacing whereas the increase percentage decreased gradually however unlike the rules of discharge under the improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2017 an effective control distance did not exist this might be because the larger the drain spacing the larger was the soil nitrogen mass in the control area of the subsurface drainage based on the equations of nitrogen transport and transformation even though the discharge increased slowly out of the effective control distance a high soil nitrogen content would increase the nitrogen concentration the nitrogen losses under the improved subsurface drainage with drain spacings of 20 40 and 60 m were 1 6 2 0 and 2 1 times that with 10 m drain spacing respectively the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses and drain spacing can be described as second degree parabolic fig 14 the nh4 n and no3 n losses with drain depths of 90 100 110 and 120 cm increased by 10 31 41 and 66 respectively compared with that of 80 cm drain depth the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and drain depths satisfied a linear positive correlation fig 15 the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased with the drain depth based on the formula for the improved subsurface drainage tao et al 2019b the relationship between discharge and drain depth satisfied a linear positive correlation in other words the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage were directly affected by the outflow discharge 3 1 5 effects of filter width and height fig 16 shows the effects of filter width and height on the nh4 n and no3 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage outflow as shown the nh4 n and no3 n losses the in outflow increased with the wider and higher filter whereas the increase percentage decreased gradually when the filter height was constant the relationship between the nh4 n and no3 n losses in the outflow and filter width can be estimated as a second degree parabola the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased by approximately 40 and 36 respectively when filter width increased from 0 to 0 2 m subsequently the loss only increased by 2 based on the current value of every 0 1 m increase in width when the filter width increased from 0 2 to 0 6 m similarly when filter width remained constant the increase tendency of nitrogen loss owing to the filter height was the same as that owing to the filter width the nh4 n and no3 n losses increased by approximately 30 when the filter height increased from 0 to 0 2 m and only by 1 6 at every 0 1 m increase in height when the filter height increased from 0 2 to 0 7 m 3 2 nitrogen in the soils the nitrogen loss in the outflow of the improved subsurface drainage was primarily from the soil the change in nitrogen mass in different soil layers was a concern fig 17 shows the percentage change of nh4 n and no3 n masses in different soil layers based on basic parameters at the 0 20 cm soil layer the nh4 n mass increased with the drain time this was because the zero order n transformation of mineralization and bio fixation primarily affected the soil nh4 n mass at 0 20 cm which was much larger than the consumed nh4 n mass caused downward migration and nitrification in other soil layers the nh4 n mass generally decreased with increasing drain time because of the downward migration and nitrification of nh4 n furthermore the percentage change in the soil nh4 n mass decreased gradually with increasing soil depth meanwhile the percentage change of no3 n in soil varied differently from that of nh4 n at the 60 80 cm soil layer the soil no3 n mass increased slightly the no3 n mass of in migration was larger than the total no3 n mass of out migration and denitrification in other soil layers the percentage change tendency of no3 n was the same as that of nh4 n compared with nh4 n the no3 n mass in the soil changed more easily this was because the adsorption of nh4 n by soil limited the transport of nh4 n and the transport of no3 n was much faster than that of nh4 n table 8 shows the ratio of soil nitrogen at the end and start of drainage under different rainfall processes the following rules can be inferred from table 8 first compared with the improved subsurface drainage cases the nh4 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil increased the most in all soil layers and the soil no3 n mass of all soil layers decreased under conventional subsurface drainage the no3 n mass of the 60 80 cm soil layer reduced the minimum percentage in all soil layers the discharge of the conventional subsurface drainage was less than that of the improved subsurface drainage the larger the discharge of outflow the larger was the hydrodynamic force which increased the transport of nitrogen to the pipe located at 80 cm soil depth hence the no3 n mass of the 60 80 cm soil layer under the conventional subsurface drainage was less than that under the improved subsurface drainage second for the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease of soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile whereas the maximum decrease occurred at the 20 40 cm soil layer for the nh4 n mass and at 0 20 cm for the no3 n mass in the conventional subsurface drainage third the amount of rainfall affected the soil nitrogen mass distribution the nh4 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil at days 0 5 and 1 and the no3 n mass of the 0 20 cm soil layer at days 1 and 2 decreased in the case of 141 mm 1 d but increased in the case of 44 mm 1 d generally the mineralization and bio fixation of nh4 n at the 0 20 cm soil layer was the main phenomenon when heavy rainfall occurred at days 1 and 2 the migration of nh4 n downward increased and exceeded the effect of mineralization and bio fixation when heavy rainfall occurred at day 3 the effect of migration was less than the accumulated effect of mineralization and bio fixation finally with the same nh4 n amount by mineralization and bio fixation the nh4 n mass increase in the 0 20 cm soil of cases 44 mm 2 d and 44 mm 3 d were higher than that of case 44 mm 1 d one day after drainage meanwhile the mass increase in the 0 20 cm soil of case 44 mm 3 d was higher than that of case 44 mm 2 d two days after drainage 4 discussion in this paper the parameters were calibrated artificially considering the complex parameters and many kinds of observed values such as soil water content nitrogen concentration of drainage outflow nitrogen content of the soil in different layer while in some studies the parameters can be gained by global optimization algorithm wang et al 2020 the global parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis are needed firstly to deeply discuss the shortcomings in the simulation process and the uncertainty that these shortcomings may have on the results global parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis have been done by sobol method using simlab software besides the measured parameters of soil hydraulic conductivity and saturated soil water content 22 kinds of parameters have been considered including the a n Œ∏ r k d d l k n d t k dn ammonia volatilization decay coefficient of the soil ks a n Œ∏ r Œ∏ s k d d l k n k dn d t of the filter d w and rate constant of mineralization and bio fixation of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm the ranges of these parameters were within 50 less or more than the calibrated ones 736 data sets have been simulated under the condition of simulated scenarios with 44 mm rainfall on the first day the sensitive parameters with the index more than 0 01 have been given in fig 18 among these parameters a and n of the soil have obvious effect on the pipe discharge the sobol total order indexes of these two parameters were 1 11 and 0 19 and thenŒ∏ s of the filter and Œ∏ r of the soil also have a little effect with corresponding indexes of 0 02 and 0 01 other than the above parameters other parameters have little effects the sobol first order index of hydraulic conductivity of the filter was only 0 002 that is to say the change in the medium of filter will change the hydraulic conductivity but may not affect the pipe discharge in the literature tao et al 2017 it also said that when the filter hydraulic conductivity was larger than 30 40 times of the soil s the subsequent increase of filter hydraulic conductivity would have small impact on the increase of discharge while for ammonia nitrogen loss of the outflow the top three effect factors in order are k d of soil a of soil k d of the filter with sobol total order indexes of 1 00 0 44 0 13 the adsorption plays an important role in ammonia nitrogen transport from fig 18 it could be seen that the main parameters are also primary factors on discharge except k d which means that the movement of the water flow also plays an important role of the ammonia nitrogen in the test the simulation time is only 3 days hence the k n was only the sixth influential factor additionally the parameters affecting discharge mostly have more effects on nitrate nitrogen loss the top five effect factors in order are a of soil k dn of the soil n of the soil Œ∏ s of the filter andŒ∏ r of the soil with sobol total order indexes of 1 02 0 19 0 19 0 02 and 0 01 by uncertainty analysis we found that the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of discharge ammonia nitrogen loss and the nitrate nitrogen loss were respective 17 854 cm2 2 03 g and 33 69 g the corresponding lower limit were 14 357 cm2 0 85 g and 27 01 g the simulated value based on calibrated parameters were between the lower and upper limit and close to the median generally speaking the sensitive parameters should be given more attention and the unsensitive parameters may choose by experience or literatures in this paper the sensitive parameters have been considered reasonably of course the automatically optimized parameters and long period effect may be considered in the future 5 conclusions numerical experiments were performed to investigate the nitrogen loss of an improved subsurface drainage for a one time drainage based on calibration and validation by field data considering external and self factors the main conclusions are as follows first the quantity of rainfall imposed a significant effect on the nitrogen loss of the drain outflow and the later the rainfall occurred the more significant was the effect the nh4 n and no3 n losses of the improved subsurface drainage increased at half days after the beginning of the rainfall second the nitrogen losses of the improved subsurface drainage outflow decreased with increasing initial groundwater table depth the nitrogen losses increased linearly and decreased linearly respectively when the initial soil nitrogen content and submerged height of pipe increased the relationship between nitrogen loss and drain spacing drain depth can be described as second degree parabolic linear the effects of filter width and height were similar to those of drain spacing third based on analyzing changes in the soil nitrogen mass we discovered that the nh4 n mass increased with the drain time in the 0 20 cm soil layer under both the conventional and improved subsurface drainage meanwhile the soil no3 n mass increased slightly in the 60 80 cm soil layer only under the improved subsurface drainage in other soil layers the nh4 n and no3 n masses decreased with increasing drain time and soil depth finally in the improved subsurface drainage the maximum decrease of the soil nitrogen mass occurred in the filter profile whereas the maximum decrease occurred at 20 40 and 0 20 cm for the nh4 n and no3 n masses respectively in the conventional subsurface drainage in the future more tests and data will be measured continually and the parameters will be further verified furthermore n loss under the improved subsurface drainage in a heterogeneous distribution of n content in soil will be analyzed additionally the assessment of uncertainty prediction can be

10237,infrared thermal imaging cameras are effective tools to monitor the spatial distribution of canopy temperature t c which is the basis of the crop water stress index cwsi calculation this paper presents a new method to improve the cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis based on t c measured by thermal imaging cumulative frequency curves of pixel t c extracted from each thermal image

stress diagnosis is the basis of scientific irrigation management monitoring crop water status based on soil indicators such as soil moisture content and soil water potential has the disadvantages of requiring a large number of sensors for continuous and precise monitoring water deficit is also reflected in the decline in photosynthetic capacity kaiser 1987 jones 1999 maes et al 2011 however photosynthetic monitoring of leaves is time consuming and requires expensive equipment canopy temperature t c is determined by the heat and water vapor flux in the soil plant atmosphere continuum when the soil water supply decreases induce stomatal closure and reduce the evaporative cooling effect leads to an increase in crop t c gates 1968 since the 1970s infrared thermometers have been used as a powerful tool to detect t c since they are nondestructive fast and practical for continuous measurements wiegand and namken 1966 jackson et al 1981 recently infrared thermal imaging cameras are being used to quantify t c and plant water stress gontia and tiwari 2008 xu et al 2016 deploying thermal infrared systems for high spatial and temporal monitoring t c was a visible water stress indicator

ratio of soil moisture to saturated moisture as a water deficit indicator is widely used in china xu et al 2012 peng et al 2013 when implementing ci it is important to take growth stages into account so as to deliver adequate water during more critical growth stages gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 rice is cultivated under ci irrigation which makes it necessary to detect crop water stress by infrared imaging at different growth stages different studies have reported that the cwsi based on infrared thermal imaging is a good indicator of rice water stress under ci gao et al 2013 xu et al 2016 as a t c based index there are two important features of canopy temperatures average values and spatial variability t c is mostly averaged from data measured at areas or points and may be more useful for detecting crop stress than the temperatures of individual leaves grant et al 2006 canopy temperatures show great spatial variability that must be taken into account to obtain the most representative t c values to date some studies have attempted to analyse the impact of t c spatial variability on water stress monitoring water stress widened the range of temperature variation within the canopy fuchs 1990 jones 1999 found that the t c variability was a better stress indicator than the average temperature the t c standard deviation had a linear relation with field scale cwsi and had potential application for irrigation since it was most sensitive to water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2006 sunlit and shaded leaves interlace with each other within a canopy which have an important effect on t c variability jones 2002 found that sunlit canopies had a wider range and a greater temperature variability than shaded canopies and were better for estimating stomatal conductance leaves directly exposed to solar radiation were more appropriate than frontal images for detecting persimmon trees water stress ballester et al 2013 moreover factors such as radiation wind speed air temperature and air humidity also had important effects on t c variability leinonen and jones 2004 thus it is essential to improve the understanding of the relationships between t c spatial variability and water stress indicators as well as to improve cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis this study investigated how the t c spatial variability affects cwsi performance the objectives of this research were i to reveal the spatial t c information of rice thermal imaging ii to improve the performance of cwsi application considering t c spatial distribution information and iii to propose the critical values of the cwsi that triggered irrigation at different growth stages of rice under ci 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the experiment was conducted from may to september 2017 at qing an national irrigation experiment station in heilongjiang province 46 58 12 n 127 40 4 e this area had a cold temperate continental monsoon

the diameter of 50 cm and the height of 70 cm these pots were wrapped with rock wool thermal insulation material to reduce heating on the sidewall the pots were surrounded by rice plants and the soils used in the experiment were taken from paddy fields after air drying and crushing the coarse fragments in the soil were removed with a 4 mm sieve then soils were packed into pots at bulk density of 1

the relative values of stomatal conductance g sr transpiration rate t rr and net photosynthetic rate p nr were calculated by dividing the measured g s t r or p n by their maximum values on the same day from the same treatment the relationships between g sr t rr p nr and cwsi p were investigated for crop water deficit diagnosis 3 results and discussion 3 1 canopy temperature range r and standard deviation std statistics were used as indicators of spatial variability in t c table 3 the larger the r was the wider the temperature range the larger the std was the larger the temperature dispersion in general r and std increased as the soil moisture decreased in addition under similar soil moisture conditions higher vpd also led to larger r and std on different dates for example d2w2 on jun 26 vs d2w1 on jul 12 d1w1 on jul 25 vs d3w2 on aug 1 d2w1 on aug 19 vs d3w1 on aug 21 in summary t c variability was influenced by soil moisture and the vpd the heavier the water stress was the lower soil moisture or the higher the vpd the greater the variability in t c we identified cumulative frequency curves based on temperatures derived from thermal images fig 2 generally the curves had similar trends among treatments the t c ranges were different under different soil moisture conditions the t c distribution information could reflect the crop water status for example for rice with sufficient water supply d3w1 on jul 12 d3w2 on aug 10 and d3w1 on aug 12 in table 3 canopy temperatures were generally low otherwise on days with low soil moisture d1w1 on aug 21 in table 3 canopy temperatures were high the variability in t c values had a negative impact on water stress prediction kendall et al 2015 using t c averaged from the higher marginal values or including the very low marginal values may result in unreasonable cwsi therefore the choice of t c statistics for cwsi calculation should be further discussed 3 2 variability in cwsi p as seen in eq 2 the cwsi has a positive correlation with t cp where temperatures of the wet and dry references remain constant cwsi p calculated based on different t cp were shown in fig 3 generally past studies have used the average t c for all measured values to calculate the cwsi agam et al 2013 which was the same as cwsi 100 in current research the maximum ratios of cwsi 20 to cwsi 100 were 3 54 2 73 3 20 1 70 4 78 2 00 1 45 1 57 2 78 4 35 3 98 and 1 82 on 12 different dates and the minimum ratios of cwsi 20 to cwsi 100 were 1 92 1 58 1 49 1 34 1 79 1 26 1 25 1 18 1 39 1 57 2 11 and 1 17 there were large gaps or variability among cwsi p based on different t cp values thus it was essential to determine the most sensitive stress indicator of cwsi p 3 3 the most sensitive cwsi p to relative leaf photosynthetic activity regressions between relative leaf physiological indexes including t rr g sr and p nr and cwsi p were conducted by assuming the relationships followed the quadratic equation y a x 2 bx c with cwsi p as the independent variable xu et al 2016 the r2 of the quadratic equations varied with cwsi p fig 4 cwsi p based on t c values that were too high or too low was less sensitive to leaf photosynthetic activities indicating a lack of confidence in water stress diagnosis the most sensitive cwsi p to t rr g sr and p nr were cwsi 60 cwsi 70 and cwsi 60 at tillering cwsi 50 cwsi 40 and cwsi 50 at panicle initiation to booting cwsi 70 cwsi 50 and cwsi 70 at heading to anthesis and cwsi 50 cwsi 50 and cwsi 40 at milk to soft dough stage generally cwsi 50 and cwsi 60 were more sensitive water stress indexes than others for rice under ci irrigation however at heading to anthesis cwsi 70 was the most sensitive index of water stress the reasons for this phenomenon were that rice plants were more sensitive to water stress at heading to anthesis with high values of lower limits for soil moisture for irrigation in table 1 and the crop water consumption was larger soil moisture content reduced more rapidly in table 3 rice crops were more sensitive to soil water deficit at this growth stage the general sensitive cwsi p was selected as the most or second most sensitive cwsi p in order to simplify the crop water deficit diagnosis and overcome variability in the optimal cwsi p among stages or among relative photosynthetic indexes as a result cwsi 60 cwsi 50 cwsi 70 and cwsi 50 were selected as the general sensitive indexes at tillering panicle initiation to booting heading to anthesis and milk to dough soft stage 3 4 correlation between cwsi p and soil moisture the general sensitive cwsi was negatively correlated with the relative soil moisture contents Œ∏ Œ∏ s at different growth stages fig 5 compared with cwsi 100 the general sensitive cwsi correlated with Œ∏ Œ∏ s in a more significant way this proofed that removing the low temperature values helped to improve the cwsi performance kendall et al 2015 pointed out that individual replicates with lower temperatures than the mean might predict no stress and even resulted in unreasonable indexes to avoid such issues the average temperature of maize was categorized into three t c ranges tcmean 27 c 27 c tcmean 29 c and tcmean 29 c which were non stressed marginally stressed and highly stressed temperatures respectively as based on the center temperature 28 c of the thermal kinetic window for optimum growth for corn burke 1996 there was essentially no relationship with the stress index and soil water deficit for the lower and middle temperature ranges and was more responsive at high t c in this study t c statistics were in descending order the average values of the top 60 50 70 and 50 of t c statistics showed better correlations with leaf photosynthetic activities the statistical average corresponding to low t c values could be considered as non stressed indicator the cwsi based on non stressed t c was less sensitive to relative leaf photosynthetic activities this may result in incorrect irrigation decisions when diagnosing rice water deficit using low canopy temperatures according to the t c distribution curves the general sensitive cwsi based on t c over at least the 50 high temperature quantile had a better response to relative leaf photosynthetic activities and it may be a better tool to quantify the water stress of rice under ci irrigation 3 5 the critical values of the general sensitive cwsi the turning points of quadratic curves were not the points where photosynthetic activities showed downward trends to determine the critical cwsi values at which t rr g sr or p nr started to decline linear regression equations based on least squares methods were shown in fig 6 the corresponding critical cwsi values were shown in table 4 at different growth stages the corresponding critical cwsi was highest when p nr showed downward trends and lowest when g sr showed downward trends the r2 values of g sr and the general sensitive cwsi regressions were the highest at different growth stages this indicated that the effect of water stress on stomatal conductance was greater than that on photosynthesis and leaf transpiration lincoln and eduardo 2002 ranges between critical cwsi corresponding to declines in t rr and p nr were ideal for higher leaf water use efficiency thus the optimal ranges of the critical cwsi were 0 556 0 569 0 481 0 486 0 571 0 641 and 0 511 0 606 at different growth stages according to fig 5 the corresponding Œ∏ Œ∏s were between w1 and w2 the critical Œ∏ Œ∏ s points for cwsic1 were slightly higher than w1 at milk to soft dough stage table 4 these were on par with the lower thresholds of rice under ci tested in local rice fields nie et al 2019 taking t c variability into consideration was crucial for crop water deficit diagnosis this paper presented a method based on thermal imaging to measure spatial temperature distribution as the basis for making irrigation decision thermal infrared imaging cameras that measure t c distribution can be a powerful tool to monitor crop water deficit for agricultural production given the developments in handheld thermal cameras xu et al 2016 airborne thermal cameras berni et al 2009 on site fixed infrared temperature sensors wang and gartung 2010 and smartphone equipped with infrared cameras andales et al 2014 the t c distribution can be measured at different scales moreover high canopy temperatures were better correlated with crop water stress it would be better to focus on the sunlit areas during image capturing and extract the high temperatures approximately 50 high temperature quantile in data aggregation for diagnosis in brief t c distribution information was easy to read and interpret from frequency curves based on canopy temperatures captured by thermal images fig 2 according to the t c distribution curves the quantile t c of high statistics as sensitive stress indicators were stage specific the general sensitive cwsi based on the optimal t c quantile values was recommended at different growth stages this study promoted the understanding of the effect of t c variability on stress indicators cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis was improved by removing the low t c values the general sensitive cwsi considering spatial temperature distribution information had practical prospects we drew our conclusions from the limited amount of temperature manually extracted from rice canopy thermal images to make better use of the abundant t c information a new automated algorithm for extracting canopy temperatures from thermal images should be established data processing techniques should be based on eliminating soil and other non transpiring surfaces one method to distinguish canopy temperatures from the ground is to combine thermal and visible images thermal and visible images must be taken at the same time over a given area each pixel corresponds to a t c value images can be exported as csv files for subsequent processing according to the above results the average temperature was calculated based on t c statistics over a certain quantile the correlations between the cwsi based on different quantiles of t c and leaf photosynthetic activities should be used to identify the cwsi of interest in summary removing the low temperature values improved cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis future research can be based on an automated approach to further verify this idea and expand the application 4 conclusion in this study a new method based on t c distribution curves was proposed to improve the cwsi performance in crop water deficit diagnosis canopy temperature variability was captured in thermal images the heavier the water stress was the lower the soil moisture or the higher the vpd the greater the t c variability according to the t c distribution curves there were temperatures out of the desired range which may result in unreasonable water stress diagnosis the average values of the top 60 50 70 and 50 of the t c statistics were selected for calculating the general sensitive cwsi at different growth stages the general sensitive cwsi showed better relationships with leaf photosynthetic activities and soil water contents removing the low temperature values for cwsi calculation was proposed to improve the water deficit diagnosis of rice under ci irrigation the general sensitive cwsi based on the average t c over the 50 high temperature quantile was the optimal indicator further studies are recommended to expand the application by extracting

10237,infrared thermal imaging cameras are effective tools to monitor the spatial distribution of canopy temperature t c which is the basis of the crop water stress index cwsi calculation this paper presents a new method to improve the cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis based on t c measured by thermal imaging cumulative frequency curves of pixel t c extracted from each thermal image were analysed different statistical quantiles of t c were determined and the average t c over different statistics quantiles were used to calculate the cwsi separately there were large gaps among the cwsi based on t c over different statistical quantiles we compared the coefficient of determination r2 of relationships among the cwsi based on t c over different statistical quantiles and relative leaf photosynthetic activities the general sensitive cwsi showed the best correlations with leaf photosynthetic activities which were calculated based on average values of the top 60 50 70 50 of t c

stress diagnosis is the basis of scientific irrigation management monitoring crop water status based on soil indicators such as soil moisture content and soil water potential has the disadvantages of requiring a large number of sensors for continuous and precise monitoring water deficit is also reflected in the decline in photosynthetic capacity kaiser 1987 jones 1999 maes et al 2011 however photosynthetic monitoring of leaves is time consuming and requires expensive equipment canopy temperature t c is determined by the heat and water vapor flux in the soil plant atmosphere continuum when the soil water supply decreases induce stomatal closure and reduce the evaporative cooling effect leads to an increase in crop t c gates 1968 since the 1970s infrared thermometers have been used as a powerful tool to detect t c since they are nondestructive fast and practical for continuous measurements wiegand and namken 1966 jackson et al 1981 recently infrared thermal imaging cameras are being used to quantify t c and plant water stress gontia and tiwari 2008 xu et al 2016 deploying thermal infrared systems for high spatial and temporal monitoring t c was a visible water stress indicator throughout corn growth stages mangus et al 2016 studies on sugar beet mart√≠nez et al 2016 sesame khorsandi et al 2018 and avocado trees salgadoe et al 2019 also reported similar results moreover t c

generally the cwsi is calculated based on temperatures measured around noon when the crops are most likely to suffer from water stress lebourgeois et al 2010 prueger et al 2018 rice is one of the most important staple foods in asia providing on average 32 of the total calorie uptake seck et al 2012 water saving irrigation techniques are widely used in rice paddies to deal with challenges of uncertain water supply and the likelihood of less water availability for rice production belder et al 2004 tuong et al 2005 non flooded controlled irrigation ci which triggers irrigation with the ratio of soil moisture to saturated moisture as a water deficit indicator is widely used in china xu et al 2012 peng et al 2013 when implementing ci it is important to take growth stages into account so as to deliver adequate water during more critical growth stages gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 rice is cultivated under ci irrigation which makes it necessary to detect crop water stress by infrared imaging at different growth stages different studies have reported that the cwsi based on infrared thermal imaging is a good indicator of rice water stress under ci gao et al 2013 xu et al 2016 as a t c based index there are two important features of canopy temperatures average values and spatial variability t c is mostly averaged from data measured at areas or points and may be more useful for detecting crop stress than the temperatures of individual leaves grant et al 2006 canopy temperatures show great spatial variability that must be taken into account to obtain the most representative t c values to date some studies have attempted to analyse the impact of t c spatial variability on water stress monitoring water stress widened the range of temperature variation within the canopy fuchs 1990 jones 1999 found that the t c variability was a better stress indicator than the average temperature the t c standard deviation had a linear relation with field scale cwsi and had potential application for irrigation since it was most sensitive to water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2006 sunlit and shaded leaves interlace with each other within a canopy which have an important effect on t c variability jones 2002 found that sunlit canopies had a wider range and a greater temperature variability than shaded canopies and were better for estimating stomatal conductance leaves directly exposed to solar radiation were more appropriate than frontal images for detecting persimmon trees water stress ballester et al 2013 moreover factors such as radiation wind speed air temperature and air humidity also had important effects on t c variability leinonen and jones 2004 thus it is essential to improve the understanding of the relationships between t c spatial variability and water stress indicators as well as to improve cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis this study investigated how the t c spatial variability affects cwsi performance the objectives of this research were i to reveal the spatial t c information of rice thermal imaging ii to improve the performance of cwsi application considering t c spatial distribution information and iii to propose the critical values of the cwsi that triggered irrigation at different growth stages of rice under ci 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the

2002 ranges between critical cwsi corresponding to declines in t rr and p nr were ideal for higher leaf water use efficiency thus the optimal ranges of the critical cwsi were 0 556 0 569 0 481 0 486 0 571 0 641 and 0 511 0 606 at different growth stages according to fig 5 the corresponding Œ∏ Œ∏s were between w1 and w2 the critical Œ∏ Œ∏ s points for cwsic1 were slightly higher than w1 at milk to soft dough stage table 4 these were on par with the lower thresholds of rice under ci tested in local rice fields nie et al 2019 taking t c variability into consideration was crucial for crop water deficit diagnosis this paper presented a method based on thermal imaging to measure spatial temperature distribution as the basis for making irrigation decision thermal infrared imaging cameras that measure t c distribution can be a powerful tool to monitor crop water deficit for agricultural production given the developments in handheld thermal cameras xu et al 2016 airborne thermal cameras berni et al 2009 on site fixed infrared temperature sensors wang and gartung 2010 and smartphone equipped with infrared cameras andales et al 2014 the t c distribution can be measured at different scales moreover high canopy temperatures were better correlated with crop water stress it would be better to focus on the sunlit areas during image capturing and extract the high temperatures approximately 50 high temperature quantile in data aggregation for diagnosis in brief t c distribution information was easy to read and interpret from frequency curves based on canopy temperatures captured by thermal images fig 2 according to the t c distribution curves the quantile t c of high statistics as sensitive stress indicators were stage specific the general sensitive cwsi based on the optimal t c quantile values was recommended at different growth stages this study promoted the understanding of the effect of t c variability on stress indicators cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis was improved by removing the low t c values the general sensitive cwsi considering spatial temperature distribution information had practical prospects we drew our conclusions from the limited amount of temperature manually extracted from rice canopy thermal images to make better use of the abundant t c information a new automated algorithm for extracting canopy temperatures from thermal images should be established data processing techniques should be based on eliminating soil and other non transpiring surfaces one method to distinguish canopy temperatures from the ground is to combine thermal and visible images thermal and visible images must be taken at the same time over a given area each pixel corresponds to a t c value images can be exported as csv files for subsequent processing according to the above results the average temperature was calculated based on t c statistics over a certain quantile the correlations between the cwsi based on different quantiles of t c and leaf photosynthetic activities should be used to identify the cwsi of interest in summary removing the low temperature values improved cwsi performance in crop water stress diagnosis future research can be based on an automated approach to further verify this idea and expand the application 4 conclusion in this study a new method based on t c distribution curves was proposed to improve the cwsi performance in crop water deficit diagnosis canopy temperature variability was captured in thermal images the heavier the water stress was the lower the soil moisture or the higher the vpd the greater the t c variability according to the t c distribution curves there were temperatures out of the desired range which may result in unreasonable water stress diagnosis the average values of the top 60 50 70 and 50 of the t c statistics were selected for calculating the general sensitive cwsi at different growth stages the general sensitive cwsi showed better relationships with leaf photosynthetic activities and soil water contents removing the low temperature values for cwsi calculation was proposed to improve the water deficit diagnosis of rice under ci irrigation the general sensitive cwsi based on the average t c over the 50 high temperature quantile was the optimal indicator further studies are recommended to expand the application by extracting pixel temperatures from the images automatically declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10238,the widely adopted practice of clean cultivation in rainfed orchards in the loess plateau has led to serious soil erosion and degradation problems agroforestry is a promising management practice for solving these problems but may reduce available soil water thus reasonable soil and water management strategies should be developed for agroforestry systems in this region the objective of this study was to determine whether adopting proper mowing management of the understory intercrop limited soil drying in a rainfed jujube ziziphus jujuba mill orchard in this region various mowing intensities 3 6 9 cm stubble height and unmowed treatments were imposed on three intercrop species bluegrass poa pratensis l white clover trifolium repens l and hairy vetch vicia villosa roth to investigate and compare their root characteristics and soil moisture responses to mowing under greenhouse and field conditions based on the results the most promising intercrop species and mowing intensity to be used in a jujube orchard were selected for field validation the results showed that mowing effectively regulated intercrop root amount and distribution as well as associated soil moisture conditions however the sensitivities of root characteristics and soil moisture to mowing and growth environment were species specific bluegrass mowed to a 3 cm stubble height produced the minimum root amount the shallowest root depth and the greatest soil water content when this treatment was applied to a rainfed jujube orchard during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons average soil moisture in the 0 300 cm soil layer was essentially unaffected while fruit yield was increased consequently bluegrass mowed to a stubble height of 3 cm when intercropped with jujube trees in the loess plateau is a feasible practice to increase jujube yield and avoid extra soil drying keywords mowing defoliation root growth soil moisture agroforestry system rainfed jujube loess plateau 1 introduction china s loess plateau encompasses the world s largest loess deposits and is subject to serious soil erosion and the effects of dry climate and water scarcity gao et al 2018 consequently many ecological restoration projects e g afforestation have been initiated to protect and improve the fragile environment unfortunately afforestation has been found to increase the occurrence of dried soil layers in some plantations because of long term excessive soil water depletion by plants deep groundwater insufficient rainfall large amount of water losses due to runoff and other unique natural and human factors in the region wang et al 2010 the occurrence of dried soil layers is widely regarded as an indicator of severe soil desiccation that can result in many other problems such as preventing soil water exchange intensifying effects of regional drought and negatively impacting vegetation growth or even resulting in vegetation death etc chen et al 2008 li et al 2008 wang et al 2010 in order to avoid or relieve excessive soil drying in the loess plateau region a large variety of techniques have been proposed to effectively use rainfall since rainfall is the only source of water for the widely distributed rainfed plantations in the region ling et al 2017 for example constructing land engineering measures e g fish scale pits terracing etc and using mulches e g branch straw gravel plastic film etc have been widely accepted as useful strategies for harvesting rainfall reducing runoff and decreasing evaporation bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 additionally adjusting plant density choosing proper tree species and adopting reasonable tree pruning management have also been suggested to control plant water consumption and therefore improve soil moisture conditions cao et al 2010 chen et al 2016 feng et al 2004 planting bare soils to crops or grasses on plantations has long been suggested as a soil water conservation measure because these measures have been broadly reported as beneficial for reducing soil evaporation decreasing runoff enhancing water infiltration promoting nutrient cycling regulating microclimate and improving soil structure fruit yield and quality atucha et al 2013 baptista et al 2015 celette et al 2005 li and pan 2018 however it remains controversial as to whether or not agroforestry systems are suitable in the arid and semiarid loess plateau region because vegetative covers used as intercrops will consume a certain amount of water to support transpiration and because soil water competition between different plants has been observed in agroforestry systems in this region particularly in dry years hui ke et al 2007 zhao and li 2006 since soil water availability is the major production concern in the loess plateau region some scholars have concluded that adopting agroforestry systems in zones with average annual rainfall less than 550 mm poses an extremely high probability for detrimental water competition and increased soil water desiccation in the loess plateau region li et al 2005 li 2002 jujube is a native and typical drought tolerant plant with considerable economic potential and was widely planted on the loess plateau during the grain for green project to date large areas of jujube orchards are grown under rainfed conditions in districts with average annual precipitation less than 550 mm clean cultivation between trees is the common soil management regime in this region therefore all weeds are regularly removed to guard against extra water consumption alternatively efforts have been made in a few studies to implement agroforestry systems i e trees intercropped with vegetative cover in jujube orchards to reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses caused by clean cultivation gao et al 2018 huang et al 2014 2016 ling et al 2017 j wang et al 2016 simulation studies have shown that three out of four vegetative cover species dactylis glomerata l coronillavaria l lotus corniculatus l and trifolium repens l were found to be inappropriate for application after comprehensively comparing their capacities to control runoff and sediment alter soil water availability and regulate jujube tree growth huang et al 2014 2016 field experiments have examined soil water utilization by a jujube orchard after employing another two vegetative cover species brassica napus and hemerocallis fulva the results demonstrated that water competition mainly appeared in jujube orchard intercropped with hemerocallis fulva and that the degree of competition depended on climate conditions both of these agroforestry systems reduced the soil water content in deep soil layers under inter row areas in both dry and normal years gao et al 2018 ling et al 2017 additionally all of the above studies confirmed the positive effects of agroforestry systems on jujube growth or fruit yield research dealing with the use of intercrops in jujube orchards on the loess plateau has been largely limited to the above mentioned studies to the best of our knowledge and the applicability of a large variety of vegetative cover species in jujube orchards has not been assessed since the major shortcoming of agroforestry jujube orchards is the additional soil water uptake from deep soil layers that cannot be easily replenished by rainfall we hypothesized that mowing understory intercrops to a certain height might be a practical management measure to suppress both transpiration and the root system and thus limit the amount of soil water consumed in transpiration to shallower soil depths that can more easily be replenished by rainfall while simultaneously maintaining some functions of understory vegetation on erosion control and jujube production if validated implementation of correct mowing of intercrops as a new management practice may be advantageous to jujube orchard production in the loess plateau region while limiting some of the disadvantages of agroforestry systems our hypothesis was based on the reported close links between plant canopy and roots cardinael et al 2015 i e significant positive correlations between root production and aboveground biomass bai et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the plant canopy and the root system together influence evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics lu et al 2011 the plant canopy provides the vegetative structure for transpiration water loss while roots are the main plant organ for extracting water from the soil ma et al 2013 vigorous canopies normally promote large dense root systems and generally are associated with large water consumption both of which lead to lower soil moisture medina roldan et al 2007 as a consequence water use studies should be concerned with both root functioning and canopy processes schenk and jackson 2002 previous research has shown that defoliation alters plant canopy architecture and is therefore directly linked to variations in water consumption transpiration and other physiological activities such as photosynthesis that further influence microclimate the water cycle and root growth these changes can in turn affect the soil water cycle with such complex interactions in the soil plant atmosphere system differing conclusions regarding the effects of defoliation on water use have been reported for example evapotranspiration can be reduced biran et al 1981 bremer et al 2001 l wang et al 2016 increased pereyra et al 2017 or remain unchanged chen et al 2007 stewart and verma 1992 depending on defoliation methods species and environments consequently there are research results that both support and refute the conclusion that defoliation facilitates soil water conservation gan et al 2012 pereyra et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 currently relevant studies regarding the effects of defoliation on the water cycle have been focused on grasslands single species or mixed species however studies dealing with the complex interactions between trees and understory vegetations have not been widely conducted in order to develop reasonable management strategies for the soil drying problem which is often observed in the loess plateau comprehensive mowing effects on root characteristics and associated soil moisture conditions were analyzed in monoculture systems for three intercrop species bluegrass poa pratensis l white clover trifolium repens l and hairy vetch vicia villosa roth subsequently the understory mowing effects on soil moisture conditions in the rainfed jujube agroforestry system were also investigated the primary objectives of this study were to 1 select correct vegetative cover species and identify proper mowing intensity for use as intercrops in a jujube orchard 2 verify the effectiveness of the selected intercrop species and mowing treatment for improving soil water conditions and fruit yield in a rainfed jujube agroforestry orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three separate experiments greenhouse mowing experiment field mowing experiment and field validation experiment were conducted over three years 2014 2016 to test the proposed hypotheses fig 1 during the three years air temperature and precipitation were monitored every 30 min using an automated weather station rr 9100 located in the experimental fields 2 1 1 greenhouse mowing experiment the greenhouse experiment was conducted on the campus of northwest agriculture and forestry university 34 17 n 108 04 e elevation 521 m in yangling shaanxi province china four mowing treatments achieved by a clipper were imposed on three intercrop species bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch the four mowing treatments were stubble height of 3 cm severe mowing 6 cm moderate mowing and 9 cm slight mowing treatments and an unmowed control treatment seeds were initially sown in constant temperature incubators on 20 december 2013 then seedlings were transplanted on 1 january 2014 to pvc tubes diameter 35 cm depth 150 cm one plant per tube in a greenhouse the treatments were replicated five times resulting in 60 individual plants 20 individual plants per species the plants were randomly arranged in the greenhouse quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 mm was used as the solid substrate in the pvc tubes because it is easily separated from roots without damaging roots during the root washing process to prevent water and nutrient stress all tubes were watered once every two days using a nutrient solution holes on the bottom of the tubes permitted drainage the first mowing was performed after plants reached 9 cm height 30 january 2014 for bluegrass and white clover 15 january 2014 for hairy vetch following the initial mowing additional mowing operations were performed every three days to maintain the plant heights at the treatment heights plants were harvested for roots six months after transplanting 30 june 2014 the entire root system of each plant was obtained by inverting the pvc tube into a sink and washing away the quartz sand the washed root system was then placed in a transparent tray filled with water allowing the roots to disperse naturally the transparent tray was then placed on a scanner epson scan 700 750 regent instruments inc to obtain a picture of the root system which was then used to determine the total root length the total root surface area and root volume by utilizing winrhizo pro 2007d regent instruments inc software the maximum root depth defined as the vertical length from the top to the bottom of the root system in its naturally dispersed status while in the transparent tray was determined using a tape measure afterwards the root system was cut into two halves horizontally from the median line of the maximum root depth the upper half was scanned again to obtain the root length above the point of 1 2 the maximum root depth 2 1 2 field mowing experiment in order to further explore the effects of mowing in the loess plateau region a second experiment was carried out under field conditions to compare with the greenhouse experiment results the experiment consisted of two parts both conducted over a six month period from may to october 2014 at the mizhi field experimental station of northwest agriculture and forestry university in the loess plateau region see detailed description below in the first part of the experiment pvc tubes same size as used in the greenhouse experiment were cut in half lengthways and then reassembled with cable ties in order to conveniently sample roots the pvc tubes were filled with local soil layer by layer and all tubes were buried vertically in the field treatments and replications were the same as for the greenhouse experiment above the 60 plant seedlings 20 per species were transplanted in the pvc tubes on 25 april 2014 with one plant per tube and random assignments of treatments to tubes tubes were watered every three days to ensure normal growth of plants until they reached 9 cm height 30 may 2014 for bluegrass and white clover 15 may 2014 for hairy vetch after reaching that height mowing treatments were imposed every five days to maintain planned treatment stubble heights in order to detect mowing effects under local climate conditions irrigation was stopped and plants grew under rainfed conditions after mowing treatments commenced all plants were harvested for root systems on 31 october 2014 this was done by removing the tubes from the ground and opening them for washing all root parameters of every plant namely total root length total root surface area root volume maximum root depth and root length above the 1 2 maximum root depth were obtained using the same methods as described above for the greenhouse experiment at the same time that this part of the field mowing experiment was conducted the other part of the experiment was carried out at the same location this part of experiment was designed to determine the effects of mowing on soil moisture in relation to roots specifically 36 vertical pits 12 treatments three intercrop species four stubble heights three replicates with diameter of 150 cm and depth of 200 cm were excavated manually next plastic film 0 2 mm thickness was used to cover the wall and bottom of the pits the excavated soil from each 30 cm depth interval was mixed then backfilled to the corresponding depth intervals in the pits on 15 april 2014 seeds of each plant species were sown in the 36 vertical pits for the four mowing treatments specified above the same amount of water was provided to each pit to maintain soil moisture until all plants grew to a height of 9 cm 20 may 2014 irrigation was stopped following this date in order to create a rainfed condition and mowing treatments were applied every five days to maintain the plant at the treatment heights at the end of growing season 31 october 2014 root dry weight density and soil water content samples were taken one sampling location was randomly chosen in each pit at every sampling location soil samples in the 0 200 cm soil profile were collected at 10 cm depth intervals using a soil core sampler diameter 9 cm a subsample of soil without roots was obtained from each sample and used to quantify soil water content by oven drying the remainder of the soil sample was washed on a sieve with 1 mm openings to obtain the root sample 2 1 3 field validation experiment from the root characteristics and soil water results of the two experiments described above shown below in the results section bluegrass with a stubble height of 3 cm was selected for an additional experiment in order to validate the applicability of this species and this mowing height one treatment was bluegrass planted in the inter row space of a jujube orchard and maintained at a 3 cm mowing height hereafter referred to as the agroforestry treatment and the other treatment was a clean cultivated jujube orchard no bluegrass in the inter row space hereafter referred to as the monoculture treatment this experiment was conducted at the same field experimental station as mentioned above in a traditional clean cultivated jujube orchard on a hillslope six plots 20 m along the contour 14 m perpendicular to the contour were established leaving a spacing of 5 m between the two adjacent plots three rows of jujube trees 10 trees per row planted on the slope terrace 15 2 m in width in 2003 were included in each plot with inter row spacing of 4 m and with in row spacing of 2 m bluegrass seeds were sown on 1 april 2015 in the inter row space slope surface between two terraces see supplemental fig s1 of three replicate plots in order to guarantee bluegrass establishment surface soil moisture was maintained at an adequate level maintained the water content in 0 60 cm soil layer between 75 and 85 of field capacity by using drip irrigation flow rate of 3 l h 1 distance between emitters of 30 cm in the inter row spaces of the plots the same irrigation regime was used in the three monoculture plots to create a similar environment in both plots after the bluegrass reached a height of 9 cm on 30 april 2015 mowing was performed weekly to maintain a stubble height of 3 cm subsequent to this first mowing date irrigation was stopped and all plants grew under rainfed conditions this experiment lasted for two growing seasons april 2015 to october 2016 during this time soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile was periodically measured about once every two weeks at 20 cm depth intervals in both the agroforestry plots and the monoculture plots using a neutron moisture gauge cnc503b china one access tube was installed in each row between two trees with randomized distances to tree trunks in each plot resulting in nine replicate soil water content measurements three replicates in every plot likewise nine access tubes were installed at random locations in the inter row spaces of both the agroforestry plots and the monocrop plots thus a total of 36 access tube locations were used for soil water content measurements the neutron moisture gauge was calibrated against gravimetric soil water content samples at the end of the experiment each year all fresh fruits on every jujube trees were picked and weighed separately for the agroforestry and monoculture plots 2 2 study site the mizhi station 38 11 n 109 28 e elevation 1049 m was located at yulin city shaanxi province china in the north of the loess plateau with typical terrain of loess hills and gullies the semiarid temperate climate is characterized by an annual mean temperature of 8 5 c and annual mean precipitation of 451 mm with more than half of the precipitation occurring from july to september the soil is a sandy loam with a mean soil bulk density of 1 29 g cm 3 field capacity of 23 by mass and wilting point of 5 16 by mass on average the water table is at 50 m below the soil surface our experiments were conducted over a three year period during which the annual precipitation was 460 mm 381 mm and 487 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 according to long term precipitation records 2014 and 2016 can be classified as normal years whereas 2015 can be considered as a dry year 2 3 statistical analysis considering each intercrop species separately two way anova was used to examine the effects of mowing intensity and growth environment greenhouse or field as well as their interactions on root characteristics using a linear model after checking for normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneous variance levene s test of the raw data fisher s lsd test was performed to determine significant differences in the maximum root depths among species and between growth environments whereas non parametric tests fisher s lsd test with ranks were conducted for other observed variables including total root length total root surface area root volume and root dry weight density significant differences among length proportions in different parts of the root system the upper and the lower halves were tested using the œá2 test by means of the chisq post hoc function in r for each considered soil layer an independent samples t test was done to test whether time averaged soil water content in the inter row or within row positions differed significantly between the monoculture and agroforestry systems all statistical analyses were carried out using r software version 3 5 1 https www r project org and significance was assessed at an alpha level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 responses of root characteristics to mowing for different intercrop species grown in the greenhouse and the field a significant mowing effect was observed for total root length of all three intercrop species fig 3 total root length decreased with decreasing stubble height the rate of decrease varied among species and between growth environments specifically as mowing height decreased for bluegrass and white clover grown in the field the total root length was significantly reduced fig 3 however 9 cm stubble height treatments did not lead to significant reductions in total root length for hairy vetch in the field fig 3 for the greenhouse environment the 3 cm stubble height treatment always significantly decreased the total root length whereas the 9 cm stubble height treatment never had a significant effect on the total root length of any of the three species a significant growth environment effect was only observed for bluegrass it produced considerably greater total root length for every mowing treatment in greenhouse than in field conditions fig 3 bluegrass produced much greater total root length 788 64 1334 78 1739 31 and 1931 72 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively than white clover 228 77 787 12 983 44 and 978 19 cm and hairy vetch 638 35 710 38 921 18 and 917 23 cm in the greenhouse under field conditions bluegrass also produced greater total root length 1045 40 cm than white clover 996 67 cm and hairy vetch 791 67 cm for control treatment however when mowing was applied to the intercrops in the field bluegrass produced significantly less total root length 132 56 450 01 and 600 82 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments respectively than the other two species 293 35 588 04 and 816 04 cm for white clover 558 26 730 81 and 810 10 cm for hairy vetch similarly both total root surface area and root volume consistently decreased as mowing height decreased for all three species and both growth environments table 1 however the degree to which they were reduced by different intensities of mowing varied among species and between growth environments also similar to the results found for total root length total root surface area differed significantly among plant species with bluegrass generally exhibiting the greatest values in the greenhouse 94 20 162 15 226 91 and 262 26 cm2 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively but the lowest values in the field 11 88 40 74 67 31 and 112 36 cm2 greenhouse conditions also contributed to greater total root surface area than field conditions for white clover 30 35 104 74 142 40 and 145 27 cm2 vs 32 29 77 14 105 91 and 119 30 cm2 and hairy vetch 118 40 128 08 184 69 and 191 55 cm2 vs 79 68 108 10 127 63 and 130 64 cm2 but the differences were less than observed for bluegrass root volumes were less under field conditions than under greenhouse conditions for all species but root volume sensitivities to environment were species specific compared with the other two species hairy vetch developed the largest root volume in both the greenhouse 1 76 1 84 3 04 and 3 72 cm3 for 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively and in the field 0 95 1 28 1 71 and 1 72 cm3 bluegrass was visibly more sensitive to growth environment than white clover it produced greater root volume 0 93 1 63 2 48 and 2 90 cm3 than white clover 0 32 1 22 1 75 and 1 74 cm3 in the greenhouse but produced less root volume 0 19 0 30 0 61 and 1 02 cm3 than white clover 0 29 0 81 1 12 and 1 16 cm3 in the field all three intercrop species exhibited a significant mowing effect on maximum root depth fig 4 maximum root depth of bluegrass was significantly inhibited by 6 and 3 cm stubble height mowing treatments in both growth environments in addition the 3 cm stubble height treatment induced significantly shallower maximum root depth of bluegrass than the 6 cm stubble height treatment under field conditions but resulted in a similar maximum root depth as the 6 cm stubble height treatment under greenhouse conditions fig 4 similarly maximum root depth of white clover grown in the field was significantly shallower under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments than with the 9 cm stubble height and control treatments however only the 3 cm stubble height treatment significantly suppressed maximum root length of white clover in the greenhouse moreover the field environment stimulated white clover root development to a significantly deeper depth than seen for plants grown in the greenhouse under the 9 cm stubble height treatment and the unmowed control however the field environment resulted in significantly shallower maximum root depth of white clover than the greenhouse environment under 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments fig 4 the maximum root depth of hairy vetch showed clear and consistent response patterns to mowing in the two growth environments with significantly shallower maximum root depth with every increase of mowing intensity beyond the slight mowing treatment the maximum root depth of hairy vetch in the field reached 51 35 56 27 64 33 and 62 13 cm under the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control respectively these values were dramatically greater than those of bluegrass 21 04 34 32 54 75 and 56 42 cm and white clover 22 49 29 34 54 67 and 57 95 cm in the field in the greenhouse environment the three species showed similar maximum root depths for each of the four mowing treatments averaging 33 61 38 62 44 37 and 45 39 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble heights and the control respectively overall mowing promoted a greater proportion of root length distributed in the shallower soil layer upper half of rooting depth for all grass species in the greenhouse although the degree to which root distribution was affected by mowing varied among species table 1 figs 5 and 6 the proportion of root length found in the upper half of the maximum root depth rlu for bluegrass grown in the greenhouse was significantly greater for the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments 72 04 and 59 23 than observed for the control 50 4 only the 3 cm stubble height treatment produced significantly greater rlu for white clover grown in the greenhouse from 50 24 to 62 94 none of the mowing treatments increased rlu of hairy vetch grown in the greenhouse in contrast rlu showed different responses to mowing under field conditions depending on the species table 1 figs 5 and 6 rlu of bluegrass increased with increasing mowing intensity but the increases were not statistically significant in contrast mowing treatments reduced rlu of white clover and hairy vetch under field conditions and the effects for the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments were significant furthermore bluegrass tended to generate higher rlu values under field conditions than under greenhouse conditions regardless of mowing treatments white clover and hairy vetch exhibited essentially the same rlu values for the control and 9 cm stubble height treatments under field conditions but under these same field conditions white clover displayed a stronger reduction in rlu with increasing mowing intensity than hairy vetch in addition bluegrass showed the highest rlu levels of the three species under field conditions particularly under the 3 cm stubble height treatment 73 42 bluegrass vs 28 61 white clover and 53 70 hairy vetch under greenhouse conditions higher rlu values were observed for hairy vetch than for bluegrass and white clover for most mowing treatments 3 2 responses of vertical root and soil moisture distribution to mowing for different intercrop species grown in the field root dry weight density rd decreased with increasing mowing intensity for all intercrop species mowing effect p 0 001 for all species fig 7 the overall rd of bluegrass was 0 056 0 095 0 173 and 0 226 mg m 3 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height and unmowed treatments respectively the respective rd values were 0 098 0 109 0 201 and 0 238 mg m 3 for white clover and 0 229 0 259 0 380 and 0 434 mg m 3 for hairy vetch compared with the unmowed control both the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments caused significant reductions in rd for all three species whereas the 9 cm stubble height treatment only showed a significant reduction in rd for hairy vetch for bluegrass rd declined relatively sharply between the soil surface and the 30 cm soil depth and then continued to decrease more gradually with depth until being undetectable in contrast white clover and hairy vetch showed increases in rd from the 0 10 cm layer to the 10 20 cm soil layer and then rd decreased with increasing soil depth roots of bluegrass were more abundant in the top 20 cm soil layer and the rd seen in this soil layer accounted for 91 29 69 30 71 40 and 64 37 of the total rd for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control treatment respectively the maximum rd ratio for white clover was located in the 10 30 cm soil layer with values of 75 90 61 44 59 28 and 53 78 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed treatment respectively compared with bluegrass and white clover roots of hairy vetch extended to a greater depth and were more concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer within this layer rd values were 77 55 77 73 67 19 and 70 39 of the total rd for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control treatment respectively mowing strongly affected the overall vertical distribution of soil water content by depth mowing effect p 0 001 for all species fig 7 in general soil water content was greater throughout the entire 0 200 cm soil profile with increased mowing intensity except in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm within which an inverse pattern was observed in general soil water content declined sharply within the top soil layers and then fluctuated by small amounts in upper middle part of the soil profile about 40 100 cm soil water content generally increased from 100 to 140 cm and then remained relatively constant at lower soil depths the soil depths at which low soil water contents began and the depth at which soil water content began to increase differed somewhat among species and mowing treatments increased mowing intensity led to a shallower beginning depth for the dry layer for example this threshold dry depth for bluegrass changed from 70 cm in the control and 9 cm stubble height treatments to 50 cm in 6 cm stubble height treatment and 40 cm in 3 cm stubble height furthermore increased mowing intensity resulted in a smaller depth interval of dry soil and greater mean soil water content in this low soil water zone for all three species averaged over the entire soil profile the greatest soil water contents were found for the 3 cm stubble height treatment with mean values of 13 62 12 83 and 11 82 for bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch respectively the lowest soil moisture contents were observed in the unmowed control treatment with mean values of 11 67 11 64 and 10 87 for bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch respectively 3 3 jujube orchard soil moisture dynamics and yield in monoculture and agroforestry systems seasonal variations in soil water content of the jujube orchard under both monoculture and agroforestry systems were evident due to replenishment by precipitation and depletions due to plant water use and soil evaporation in both 2015 and 2016 compared with shallower soils soil water content below 120 cm showed little fluctuation over time fig 8 in the dry year 2015 a prolonged drought occurred from may to august during which total precipitation was just 54 13 of that in the normal year 2016 182 mm in 2015 vs 336 mm in 2016 fig 2 the four month long drought caused a continuous decline in soil water content at all four soil layers and the profile averaged soil water content 0 300 cm soil layer reached minimum values of 8 17 and 7 54 on 13 july doy 194 for the inter row and within row positions respectively in the monoculture treatment which were slightly higher than the average minimum values in the agroforestry treatment 7 83 and 7 25 after rain resumed in september soil water was replenished gradually but had still not recovered to the same level as at the start of the growing season in the normal precipitation year 2016 soil water content continuously increased from the beginning of the growing season and reached maximum values of 12 28 and 11 94 on 15 july doy 197 for the inter row and within row positions respectively for the monoculture treatment values which were slightly lower than those observed for the agroforestry treatment 12 69 and 12 22 soil water contents began to decline thereafter but were always wetter than at the start of the growing season soil water content differences between the monoculture and agroforestry treatments were mainly seen in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers the agroforestry treatment exhibited higher soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer throughout the two study periods the time averaged soil water content difference in the 0 20 cm soil layer was significant for both the inter row position 10 96 and 13 13 for the monoculture and agroforestry systems respectively and the within row position 11 51 and 12 33 two contrasting situations were noticed in the 20 60 cm soil layer for the agroforestry system relatively higher soil water content was observed than was observed for the monoculture system particularly for rainy periods whereas the opposite trend was seen in dry periods on average the soil water contents of the agroforestry system 9 55 and 9 37 for the inter row and within row positions respectively in this 20 60 cm soil layer were slightly higher than those in the monoculture system 9 10 and 8 79 but the differences were not significant additionally no significant difference was detected between the time averaged soil water content in the 60 120 cm soil layer of the monoculture system 9 44 and 9 08 for inter row and within row positions respectively and the agroforestry system 9 07 and 9 01 the same pattern was also seen for the 120 300 cm soil layer 10 11 and 9 76 for the monoculture system vs 9 83 and 9 60 for the agroforestry system on the whole the average soil water contents for the 0 300 cm soil profile during the entire study period were 10 01 and 9 61 at the inter row and within row positions of the monoculture system which were not significantly different from the values observed for the agroforestry system 9 89 and 9 63 on the other hand with bluegrass covering between row areas of soil fresh fruit yields of jujube trees increased from 7 98 to 9 01 kg per tree in 2015 and from 8 74 to 10 03 kg per tree in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 different intercrop species responses to mowing severe and moderate mowing 3 and 6 cm stubble height in the present study generally reduced root productivity total root length total root surface area root volume and dry root weight density of bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch by significant amounts root growth appeared to be unaffected when stubble height was higher than 6 cm this result is consistent with the findings of guitian and bardgett 2000 who reported that root biomass reduction by repeated defoliation varied with defoliation intensity their study found that two grazing tolerant grass species namely festuca rubra and cynosurus cristatus exhibited the greatest root biomass decrease by 63 and 59 respectively for plants cut weekly to a height of 4 cm above the soil surface compared with plants cut every two weeks and an uncut control a similar study conducted by medina roldan and bardgett 2011 used the same clipping regimes on a broad range of grass species they concluded that all species responded strongly and negatively to clipping in terms of root biomass and root length and that differences existed in the extent of the responses to different clipping intensities numerous other studies have also reported negative effects of defoliation on root amount dawson et al 2004 jarvis and macduff 1989 johnson and matchett 2001 the negative effects were widely attributed to the priority translocation of more assimilate and reserves to aboveground plant organs to promote rapid regrowth following tissue removal flemmer et al 2002 guitian and bardgett 2000 liu et al 2018 nippert et al 2012 additionally suppression of aboveground photosynthesis caused by heavy defoliation may result in root mortality due to insufficient photo assimilates supplied to roots bai et al 2015 chen et al 2006 additional studies have shown that root growth was unaffected by defoliation for some grasses a possible explanation for these differing results may be related to differences in plant tolerance resistance sensitivities to defoliation various growth environments and diversities in defoliation intensity alber et al 2014 bai et al 2015 boschma et al 2003 guitian and bardgett 2000 kitchen et al 2009 medina roldan and bardgett 2011 for example in some of the studies that did not show root growth reduction after defoliation plants had been defoliated only once or twice during the entire growing season becker et al 1997 flemmer et al 2002 much lighter defoliation than the repeated defoliation used in studies that presented opposite results the current study also indicated that mowing to produce 3 and 6 cm stubble heights reduced the maximum root depth of all three species particularly under field conditions fig 4 this fits well with the results of some other studies such as madison and hagan 1962 and liu and huang 2002 where bluegrass and creeping bentgrass argostis stolonifera were found to produce shallower maximum root depth under lower stubble height mowing treatments similarly in upland topographic positions of a native tallgrass prairie in kansas usa nippert et al 2012 grass roots were observed as deep as 46 cm in a grazed area only 41 of the depth of roots 112 cm in an ungrazed control area however there are also other studies showing different results for different species for example cutting mowing was reported to have no effect on the maximum root depth of st augustine grass stenotaphrum secundatum walt kuntze bahiagrass paspalum notatum flugge and zoysiagrass zoysia japonica steud during turf establishment hargey et al 2016 wherley et al 2011 this discrepancy may result from different water demands and growth regulation of different species in certain environments according to previous studies generating deeper root systems is usually assumed to be a mechanism for surviving drought stress by allowing plants to capture more available water from deep soil depths craine et al 2003 nippert et al 2012 reduced maximum root depth in our study due to mowing might be because mowing decreased canopy water consumption to an amount that could be supported by the water resource available in shallower soils biran et al 1981 elansary and yessoufou 2015 madison and hagan 1962 this potential mechanism can be supported by dramatically greater soil moisture in the 0 200 cm soil profile under field conditions for all the three species in our study fig 7 similar results demonstrating increased soil moisture following defoliation have also been documented in some other publications dealing with a typical patagonian steppe in an arid ecosystem where high grazing intensity increased soil water storage by 24 and reduced the water amount absorbed by roots from deep soil layers compared with low grazing intensity pereyra et al 2017 similarly in inner mongolia higher soil moisture was found for a continuous grazing site compared with an ungrazed site with stipa grandis vegetation gan et al 2012 in addition the observation that dry soil conditions tend to stimulate deeper root systems mentioned above is in good agreement with our result that the maximum root depth of hairy vetch was substantially deeper under field conditions than in the greenhouse across all mowing intensities fig 4 however this result was only seen for bluegrass and white clover under the slight mowing and unmowed treatments fig 4 under increasing mowing intensity maximum root depths under field condition for two of the species apparently decreased to a shallower level than observed under greenhouse conditions under the same mowing intensities this was particularly true for the severe mowing treatment this result indicated that drought can intensify the response of vegetative cover species to defoliation as also noted in previous studies chen et al 2013 elansary and yessoufou 2015 zhang et al 2018 additionally a higher proportion of root length appeared in the upper half of the maximum root depth after severe and moderate mowing under greenhouse conditions in our current study table 1 figs 5 and 6 this result suggests that mowing is likely to shift more roots to shallower depths in agreement with many other studies bai et al 2015 hargey et al 2016 kitchen et al 2009 pereyra et al 2017 however this trend was only observed for bluegrass under field conditions in contrast to the mowing effect on root distribution with depth that was observed for white clover and hairy vetch the above patterns suggest that under intensified mowing conditions bluegrass has a consistent reliance on surface soil moisture irrespective of growing conditions while white clover and hairy vetch displayed greater flexibility to switch water sources from various soil depths in response to a dry environment pereyra et al 2017 4 2 selection of suitable intercrop species and mowing intensity for a jujube orchard in the loess plateau region water uptake by roots is an essential mechanism for maintaining plant growth many previous studies have shown that root biomass and root depth indicate the ability and spatial extent of plant roots to acquire water from the soil ma et al 2013 one of the important factors causing widespread occurrence of persistent dry soil layers in the loess plateau region is excessive plant water consumption from deep soil layers over long time periods wang et al 2010 thus in order to mitigate the negative effects of soil water use from deep soil layers that can be difficult to replenish by rainfall in the loess plateau region intercrop species with shallower root systems and less root amount may be preferred for sustainable jujube orchard production in this region according to our results on root characteristics hairy vetch was not recommended to be introduced into jujube orchards because it developed a substantially deeper root system than the other two species fig 4 and had the largest root dry weight density in almost every soil layer when grown under field conditions fig 7 accordingly this root distribution pattern gave rise to the lowest soil moisture condition in the 0 200 cm soil profile of the vertical pits the profile averaged soil water content with the 3 cm stubble height mowing was 11 82 compared with 13 62 and 12 83 for bluegrass and white clover respectively fig 7 in contrast intensified mowing successfully inhibited the maximum root depth and root amount of bluegrass and white clover to a significantly lower level under field conditions even lower than that observed under greenhouse conditions fig 5 under intensified mowing similar values were observed for many root parameters maximum root depth total root length total root surface area and root volume for both bluegrass and white clover under field conditions however the two species showed quite different root architectures bluegrass tended to concentrate more roots in the upper soil layer e g 73 42 of the total root length in the profile was found within the upper half of the maximum root depth with the 3 cm stubble height mowing while white clover was likely to distribute relatively more roots in the lower soil layer e g just 28 61 of the total root length was found within the upper half of the maximum root depth under the 3 cm stubble height mowing fig 5e and m because of this difference in root distribution white clover has the potential to extract more water from deeper soil layers this finding was confirmed by the shallower depth in the soil profile at which soil moisture began to continuously increase with depth that was observed for bluegrass compared with white clover fig 7 this observation was consistent with the findings of pereyra et al 2017 who reported that more roots appeared in shallower soil layers and fewer roots were found in deeper soil layers resulting in a lower contribution of deep soil water to total evapotranspiration at a site with high grazing intensity compared with a site with low grazing intensity similarly other studies have shown that greater root length distributed to shallower soil layers was considered to allow this species to quickly respond to rainfall events and utilize available soil moisture preferentially in shallower soil layers nippert et al 2012 yu et al 2007 since water use from deeper soil layers can be detrimental for dry soil layer restoration in the semiarid loess plateau region bluegrass rather than white clover seems more suitable for intercropping with jujube trees another reason why we chose bluegrass managed to maintain a 3 cm stubble height for intercropping with jujube is that the profile averaged soil water content was highest in our bluegrass experimental pits coinciding with another study conducted in a similar region huang et al 2014 the results of our study also implied that water consumption by the poaceae species bluegrass was less than that of the leguminosae species white clover and hairy vetch additionally previous studies have indicated the important function of roots in reducing surface water movement and soil loss may be even more important than vegetation cover in reducing erosion processes gyssels et al 2005 that are typical and common in our study area li et al 2017 wu et al 2019 plant species with shallow and dense lateral spreading root networks are acknowledged to be more effective than deep rooted species in controlling water erosion created by concentrated flows de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 consequently bluegrass mowed to a 3 cm stubble height was also more suitable than white clover from this point of view based on the above considerations bluegrass with a stubble height of 3 cm became our first choice for intercropping with jujube trees 4 3 applicability validation of selected intercrop species and mowing intensity in a jujube orchard we accepted our hypothesis that jujube orchard soil moisture in an agroforestry system can be adjusted by intercrop mowing treatment to a level not significantly lower than soil moisture of jujube grown in a monoculture system in our field trail soil moisture in the top 0 20 cm soil layer at both inter row and within row positions was dramatically increased with the presence of bluegrass in jujube rows particularly after rainfall events fig 8 this was mainly attributable to the function of the intercrop in reducing soil evaporation and runoff as well as increasing rainfall interception and facilitating infiltration atucha et al 2012 huang et al 2014 malezieux et al 2009 however these functions were largely offset by intercrop transpiration from water use in the 20 60 cm soil layer despite rainy periods in this soil depth interval soil water content in the agroforestry system dropped more quickly than in the monoculture system fig 8 in the 60 120 cm soil layer intercropping moderately decreased the soil water content fig 8 this could be partly due to the enhancement of interspecies interactions in the agroforestry system to avoid water competition between trees and the understory crop as found in previous studies gao et al 2018 he et al 2013 malezieux et al 2009 schwendenmann et al 2010 in the pvc tube and vertical pit experiment 3 cm stubble height mowing resulted in bluegrass roots concentrated in 0 30 cm soil layer even though growth duration climate and intercropping may alter root depth the maximum root depth of bluegrass grown in jujube rows might not reach the 60 120 cm layer perhaps the lower soil water content in the 60 120 cm layer in the agroforestry system might be due to bluegrass preferentially using water from shallower soil layers which may have stimulated jujube trees to shift root development to deeper soil layers for water exploration since we lack data on root distribution and soil water absorption for monoculture and agroforestry systems this explanation will require verification based on further research in terms of quantifying soil water uptake from different soil layers for each plant in monocultural ecosystems taking soil samples and separating different plant roots for root distribution patterns assessment would provide useful information gao et al 2018 moreover the stable isotope Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h composition of water is also a powerful tool to trace the soil moisture movement in soil and plant system barbeta et al 2015 as a consequence the above two techniques could be combined to try in future research on determining the vegetation water sources lower soil water contents in the agroforestry system were also evident in the 120 300 cm soil layer in the dry year 2015 but not in the normal precipitation year 2016 a possible interpretation is that the degree of enhancement to interspecies interactions in the agroforestry system depends on climate conditions gao et al 2018 with those interactions having more serious consequences in dry years e g jujube trees may extract water from much deeper soil layers while negative effects are mitigated under wet conditions our observations of the 120 300 cm soil water dynamics also suggest that planting bluegrass between jujube tree rows may increase the risk of increasing soil moisture consumption in soil layers that cannot be easily recharged by rainfall in dry years even when the intercrop species is managed with 3 cm stubble height mowing however the consumed water may be replenished by rainfall in a normal precipitation year therefore the soil drying caused by planting bluegrass in a jujube orchard may be a temporary rather than a permanent condition a study by ling et al 2017 focused on soil water effects of intercropping with two other species hemerocallis fulva and fodder brassica napus managed without mowing in jujube orchards in a nearby county in the loess plateau region they reported that planting the two species between jujube tree rows apparently reduced the inter row soil water in the 60 180 cm soil layer in both dry and normal precipitation years a plausible explanation is the deep root systems of these two intercrop species according to their subsequent study both of their selected species allocated roots to as deep as 120 cm in the agroforestry jujube system gao et al 2018 this root depth might be much deeper than the root depth of the bluegrass used in our study because the 3 cm stubble height mowing largely limited bluegrass s roots to the 0 30 cm soil layer when planted alone however the exact root depth when planted with jujube trees should be further determined some studies have noted that growing crop covers in orchards is not always detrimental to soil moisture conservation huang et al 2014 for example cover crops have been shown to increase water storage in an olive olea europaea l plantation in the mediterranean region gucci et al 2012 sastre et al 2018 similarly soil moisture conditions of a rubber hevea brasiliensis plantation were reported to benefit from intercropping cultivation in the tropical xishuangbanna region wu et al 2016 also in an olive orchard with a clover trifolium subterraneum l intercrop water competition was observed to be negligible in normal and high rainfall years hernandez et al 2005 however more research studies have agreed with the conclusion that the agroforestry system aggravated soil aridity problems especially in dry periods celette et al 2005 huang et al 2014 2016 as a result live ground covers have been suggested to be killed at appropriate times to avoid undesirable water competition alcantara et al 2011 g√≥mez et al 2009 taking the entire 0 300 cm soil profile into consideration the agroforestry orchard in our study showed essentially the same soil moisture level as seen in the monoculture orchard compared with the considerably reduced soil water content in the 60 180 cm soil layer in the inter row position of the jujube agroforestry system mentioned above ling et al 2017 our results illustrated the effectiveness of mowing on soil water conservation in agroforestry systems on the other hand the fresh fruit yields of jujube trees increased by adopting the agroforestry system in our study this pattern compares favorably with the results of gao et al 2018 who conducted an experiment in the same region and also concluded that agroforestry was good for improving jujube production hence the results of our study support another possible method for preventing or limiting soil drying as well as ensuring economic income for jujube production in the semiarid loess plateau region 5 conclusions the main findings of our study were 1 total root length total root surface area root volume and maximum root depth of three potential intercrop spices tended to decrease with decreasing stubble height after mowing nevertheless this decrease varied among intercrop species and between growth environments 2 intercrop root amounts were less when grown under field conditions than when grown under greenhouse conditions for all species across all mowing intensities the same pattern was found for maximum root depth for bluegrass and white clover under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height mowing treatments however the opposite pattern was observed for the 9 cm stubble height mowing treatment and the unmowed treatment and also for hairy vetch across all mowing intensities 3 bluegrass developed the greatest amount of roots in the greenhouse but the least amount of roots in the field regardless of mowing intensity hairy vetch produced the deepest roots under field conditions regardless of mowing intensity and was therefore not considered as a viable intercrop species to be used with jujube all species achieved the minimum root amount and root depth under the 3 cm stubble height mowing white clover produced essentially the same amount of roots and maximum root depth as bluegrass under the 3 cm stubble height mowing in the field but allocated a much larger proportion of root length below the 1 2 maximum root depth 4 the significantly decreased maximum root depth combined with the substantially reduced root dry weight density under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height mowing treatments was clearly associated with dramatic improvement in soil moisture in the 0 200 cm soil profile under field conditions for all three species the best soil moisture condition was observed for the bluegrass monocrop under the 3 cm stubble height mowing 5 by adopting the 3 cm stubble height mowing intercropping bluegrass with jujube trees greatly increased soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer throughout the 2015 and 2016 jujube growing seasons slight increases in soil water content were also observed in the 20 60 cm soil layer contrasting results were detected in the 60 120 and 120 300 cm soil layers the average soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile during the entire study period was quite similar between the jujube monoculture orchard and jujube agroforestry system intercropped with bluegrass moreover the agroforestry system produced greater jujube yield than the monoculture system thus bluegrass managed with mowing to a stubble height of 3 cm intercropped with jujube trees is a proper management practice in the loess plateau that will achieve greater jujube yield while simultaneously avoiding extra soil drying declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10238,the widely adopted practice of clean cultivation in rainfed orchards in the loess plateau has led to serious soil erosion and degradation problems agroforestry is a promising management practice for solving these problems but may reduce available soil water thus reasonable soil and water management strategies should be developed for agroforestry systems in this region the objective of this study was to determine whether adopting proper mowing management of the understory intercrop limited soil drying in a rainfed jujube ziziphus jujuba mill orchard in this region various mowing intensities 3 6 9 cm stubble height and unmowed treatments were imposed on three intercrop species bluegrass poa pratensis l white clover trifolium repens l and hairy vetch vicia villosa roth to investigate and compare their root characteristics and soil moisture responses to mowing under greenhouse and field conditions based on the results the most promising intercrop species and mowing intensity to be used in a jujube orchard were selected for field validation the results showed that mowing effectively regulated intercrop root amount and distribution as well as associated soil moisture conditions however the sensitivities of root characteristics and soil moisture to mowing and growth environment were species specific bluegrass mowed to a 3 cm stubble height produced the minimum root amount the shallowest root depth and the greatest soil water content when this treatment was applied to a rainfed jujube orchard during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons average soil moisture in the 0 300 cm soil layer was essentially unaffected while fruit yield was increased consequently bluegrass mowed to a stubble height of 3 cm when intercropped with jujube trees in the loess plateau is a feasible practice to increase jujube yield and avoid extra soil drying keywords mowing defoliation root growth soil moisture agroforestry system rainfed jujube loess plateau 1 introduction china s loess plateau encompasses the world s largest loess deposits and is subject to serious soil erosion and the effects of dry climate and water scarcity gao et al 2018 consequently many ecological restoration projects e g afforestation have been initiated to protect and improve the fragile environment unfortunately afforestation has been found to increase the occurrence of dried soil layers in some plantations because of long term excessive soil water depletion by plants deep groundwater insufficient rainfall large amount of water losses due to runoff and other unique natural and human factors in the region wang et al 2010 the occurrence of dried soil layers is widely regarded as an indicator of severe soil desiccation that can result in many other problems such as preventing soil water exchange intensifying effects of regional drought and negatively impacting vegetation growth or even resulting in vegetation death etc chen et al 2008 li et al 2008 wang et al 2010 in order to avoid or relieve excessive soil drying in the loess plateau region a large variety of techniques have been proposed to effectively use rainfall since rainfall is the only source of water for the widely distributed rainfed plantations in the region ling et al 2017 for example constructing land engineering measures e g fish scale pits terracing etc and using mulches e g branch straw gravel plastic film etc have been widely accepted as useful strategies for harvesting rainfall reducing runoff and decreasing evaporation bu et al 2013 li et al 2018 additionally adjusting plant density choosing proper tree species and adopting reasonable tree pruning management have also been suggested to control plant water consumption and therefore improve soil moisture conditions cao et al 2010 chen et al 2016 feng et al 2004 planting bare soils to crops or grasses on plantations has long been suggested as a soil water conservation measure because these measures have been broadly reported as beneficial for reducing soil evaporation decreasing runoff enhancing water infiltration promoting nutrient cycling regulating microclimate and improving soil structure fruit yield and quality atucha et al 2013 baptista et al 2015 celette et al 2005 li and pan 2018 however it remains controversial as to whether or not agroforestry systems are suitable in the arid and semiarid loess plateau region because vegetative covers used as intercrops will consume a certain amount of water to support transpiration and because soil water competition between different plants has been observed in agroforestry systems in this region particularly in dry years hui ke et al 2007 zhao and li 2006 since soil water availability is the major production concern in the loess plateau region some scholars have concluded that adopting agroforestry systems in zones with average annual rainfall less than 550 mm poses an extremely high probability for detrimental water competition and increased soil water desiccation in the loess plateau region li et al 2005 li 2002 jujube is a native and typical drought tolerant plant with considerable economic potential and was widely planted on the loess plateau during the grain for green project to date large areas of jujube orchards are grown under rainfed conditions in districts with average annual precipitation less than 550 mm clean cultivation between trees is the common soil management regime in this region therefore all weeds are regularly removed to guard against extra water consumption alternatively efforts have been made in a few studies to implement agroforestry systems i e trees intercropped with vegetative cover in jujube orchards to reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses caused by clean cultivation gao et al 2018 huang et al 2014 2016 ling et al 2017 j wang et al 2016 simulation studies have shown that three out of four vegetative cover species dactylis glomerata l coronillavaria l lotus corniculatus l and trifolium repens l were found to be inappropriate for application after comprehensively comparing their capacities to control runoff and sediment alter soil water availability and regulate jujube tree growth huang et al 2014 2016 field experiments have examined soil water utilization by a jujube orchard after employing another two vegetative cover species brassica napus and hemerocallis fulva the results demonstrated that water competition mainly appeared in jujube orchard intercropped with hemerocallis fulva and that the degree of competition depended on climate conditions both of these agroforestry systems reduced the soil water content in deep soil layers under inter row areas in both dry and normal years gao et al 2018 ling et al 2017 additionally all of the above studies confirmed the positive effects of agroforestry systems on jujube growth or fruit yield research dealing with the use of intercrops in jujube orchards on the loess plateau has been largely limited to the above mentioned studies to the best of our knowledge and the applicability of a large variety of vegetative cover species in jujube orchards has not been assessed since the major shortcoming of agroforestry jujube orchards is the additional soil water uptake from deep soil layers that cannot be easily replenished by rainfall we hypothesized that mowing understory intercrops to a certain height might be a practical management measure to suppress both transpiration and the root system and thus limit the amount of soil water consumed in transpiration to shallower soil depths that can more easily be replenished by rainfall while simultaneously maintaining some functions of understory vegetation on erosion control and jujube production if validated implementation of correct mowing of intercrops as a new management practice may be advantageous to jujube orchard production in the loess plateau region while limiting some of the disadvantages of agroforestry systems our hypothesis was based on the reported close links between plant canopy and roots cardinael et al 2015 i e significant positive correlations between root production and aboveground biomass bai et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the plant canopy and the root system together influence evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics lu et al 2011 the plant canopy provides the vegetative structure for transpiration water loss while roots are the main plant organ for extracting water from the soil ma et al 2013 vigorous canopies normally promote large dense root systems and generally are associated with large water consumption both of which lead to lower soil moisture medina roldan et al 2007 as a consequence water use studies should be concerned with both root functioning and canopy processes schenk and jackson 2002 previous research has shown that defoliation alters plant canopy architecture and is therefore directly linked to variations in water consumption transpiration and other physiological activities such as photosynthesis that further influence microclimate the water cycle and root growth these changes can in turn affect the soil water cycle with such complex interactions in the soil plant atmosphere system differing conclusions regarding the effects of defoliation on water use have been reported for example evapotranspiration can be reduced biran et al 1981 bremer et al 2001 l wang et al 2016 increased pereyra et al 2017 or remain unchanged chen et al 2007 stewart and verma 1992 depending on defoliation methods species and environments consequently there are research results that both support and refute the conclusion that defoliation facilitates soil water conservation gan et al 2012 pereyra et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 currently relevant studies regarding the effects of defoliation on the water cycle have been focused on grasslands single species or mixed species however studies dealing with the complex interactions between trees and understory vegetations have not been widely conducted in order to develop reasonable management strategies for the soil drying problem which is often observed in the loess plateau comprehensive mowing effects on root characteristics and associated soil moisture conditions were analyzed in monoculture systems for three intercrop species bluegrass poa pratensis l white clover trifolium repens l and hairy vetch vicia villosa roth subsequently the understory mowing effects on soil moisture conditions in the rainfed jujube agroforestry system were also investigated the primary objectives of this study were to 1 select correct vegetative cover species and identify proper mowing intensity for use as intercrops in a jujube orchard 2 verify the effectiveness of the selected intercrop species and mowing treatment for improving soil water conditions and fruit yield in a rainfed jujube agroforestry orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three separate experiments greenhouse mowing experiment field mowing experiment and field validation experiment were conducted over three years 2014 2016 to test the proposed hypotheses fig 1 during the three years air temperature and precipitation were monitored every 30 min using an automated weather station rr 9100 located in the experimental fields 2 1 1 greenhouse mowing experiment the greenhouse experiment was conducted on the campus of northwest agriculture and forestry university 34 17 n 108 04 e elevation 521 m in yangling shaanxi province china four mowing treatments achieved by a clipper were imposed on three intercrop species bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch the four mowing treatments were stubble height of 3 cm severe mowing 6 cm moderate mowing and 9 cm slight mowing treatments and an unmowed control treatment seeds were initially sown in constant temperature incubators on 20 december 2013 then seedlings were transplanted on 1 january 2014 to pvc tubes diameter 35 cm depth 150 cm one plant per tube in a greenhouse the treatments were replicated five times resulting in 60 individual plants 20 individual plants per species the plants were randomly arranged in the greenhouse quartz sand with particle size of 0 2 mm was used as the solid substrate in the pvc tubes because it is easily separated from roots without damaging roots during the root washing process to prevent water and nutrient stress all tubes were watered once every two days using a nutrient solution holes on the bottom of the tubes permitted drainage the first mowing was performed after plants reached 9 cm height 30 january 2014 for bluegrass and white clover 15 january 2014 for hairy vetch following the initial mowing additional mowing operations were performed every three days to maintain the plant heights at the treatment heights plants were harvested for roots six months after transplanting 30 june 2014 the entire root system of each plant was obtained by inverting the pvc tube into a sink and washing away the quartz sand the washed root system was then placed in a transparent tray filled with water allowing the roots to disperse naturally the transparent tray was then placed on a scanner epson scan 700 750 regent instruments inc to obtain a picture of the root system which was then used to determine the total root length the total root surface area and root volume by utilizing winrhizo pro 2007d regent instruments inc software the maximum root depth defined as the vertical length from the top to the bottom of the root system in its naturally dispersed status while in the transparent tray was determined using a tape measure afterwards the root system was cut into two halves horizontally from the median line of the maximum root depth the upper half was scanned again to obtain the root length above the point of 1 2 the maximum root depth 2 1 2 field mowing experiment in order to further explore the effects of mowing in the loess plateau region a second experiment was carried out under field conditions to compare with the greenhouse experiment results the experiment consisted of two parts both conducted over a six month period from may to october 2014 at the mizhi field experimental station of northwest agriculture and forestry university in the loess plateau region see detailed description below in the first part of the experiment pvc tubes same size as used in the greenhouse experiment were cut in half lengthways and then reassembled with cable ties in order to conveniently sample roots the pvc tubes were filled with local soil layer by layer and all tubes were buried vertically in the field treatments and replications were the same as for the greenhouse experiment above the 60 plant seedlings 20 per species were transplanted in the pvc tubes on 25 april 2014 with one plant per tube and random assignments of treatments to tubes tubes were watered every three days to ensure normal growth of plants until they reached 9 cm height 30 may 2014 for bluegrass and white clover 15 may 2014 for hairy vetch after reaching that height mowing treatments were imposed every five days to maintain planned treatment stubble heights in order to detect mowing effects under local climate conditions irrigation was stopped and plants grew under rainfed conditions after mowing treatments commenced all plants were harvested for root systems on 31 october 2014 this was done by removing the tubes from the ground and opening them for washing all root parameters of every plant namely total root length total root surface area root volume maximum root depth and root length above the 1 2 maximum root depth were obtained using the same methods as described above for the greenhouse experiment at the same time that this part of the field mowing experiment was conducted the other part of the experiment was carried out at the same location this part of experiment was designed to determine the effects of mowing on soil moisture in relation to roots specifically 36 vertical pits 12 treatments three intercrop species four stubble heights three replicates with diameter of 150 cm and depth of 200 cm were excavated manually next plastic film 0 2 mm thickness was used to cover the wall and bottom of the pits the excavated soil from each 30 cm depth interval was mixed then backfilled to the corresponding depth intervals in the pits on 15 april 2014 seeds of each plant species were sown in the 36 vertical pits for the four mowing treatments specified above the same amount of water was provided to each pit to maintain soil moisture until all plants grew to a height of 9 cm 20 may 2014 irrigation was stopped following this date in order to create a rainfed condition and mowing treatments were applied every five days to maintain the plant at the treatment heights at the end of growing season 31 october 2014 root dry weight density and soil water content samples were taken one sampling location was randomly chosen in each pit at every sampling location soil samples in the 0 200 cm soil profile were collected at 10 cm depth intervals using a soil core sampler diameter 9 cm a subsample of soil without roots was obtained from each sample and used to quantify soil water content by oven drying the remainder of the soil sample was washed on a sieve with 1 mm openings to obtain the root sample 2 1 3 field validation experiment from the root characteristics and soil water results of the two experiments described above shown below in the results section bluegrass with a stubble height of 3 cm was selected for an additional experiment in order to validate the applicability of this species and this mowing height one treatment was bluegrass planted in the inter row space of a jujube orchard and maintained at a 3 cm mowing height hereafter referred to as the agroforestry treatment and the other treatment was a clean cultivated jujube orchard no bluegrass in the inter row space hereafter referred to as the monoculture treatment this experiment was conducted at the same field experimental station as mentioned above in a traditional clean cultivated jujube orchard on a hillslope six plots 20 m along the contour 14 m perpendicular to the contour were established leaving a spacing of 5 m between the two adjacent plots three rows of jujube trees 10 trees per row planted on the slope terrace 15 2 m in width in 2003 were included in each plot with inter row spacing of 4 m and with in row spacing of 2 m bluegrass seeds were sown on 1 april 2015 in the inter row space slope surface between two terraces see supplemental fig s1 of three replicate plots in order to guarantee bluegrass establishment surface soil moisture was maintained at an adequate level maintained the water content in 0 60 cm soil layer between 75 and 85 of field capacity by using drip irrigation flow rate of 3 l h 1 distance between emitters of 30 cm in the inter row spaces of the plots the same irrigation regime was used in the three monoculture plots to create a similar environment in both plots after the bluegrass reached a height of 9 cm on 30 april 2015 mowing was performed weekly to maintain a stubble height of 3 cm subsequent to this first mowing date irrigation was stopped and all plants grew under rainfed conditions this experiment lasted for two growing seasons april 2015 to october 2016 during this time soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile was periodically measured about once every two weeks at 20 cm depth intervals in both the agroforestry plots and the monoculture plots using a neutron moisture gauge cnc503b china one access tube was installed in each row between two trees with randomized distances to tree trunks in each plot resulting in nine replicate soil water content measurements three replicates in every plot likewise nine access tubes were installed at random locations in the inter row spaces of both the agroforestry plots and the monocrop plots thus a total of 36 access tube locations were used for soil water content measurements the neutron moisture gauge was calibrated against gravimetric soil water content samples at the end of the experiment each year all fresh fruits on every jujube trees were picked and weighed separately for the agroforestry and monoculture plots 2 2 study site the mizhi station 38 11 n 109 28 e elevation 1049 m was located at yulin city shaanxi province china in the north of the loess plateau with typical terrain of loess hills and gullies the semiarid temperate climate is characterized by an annual mean temperature of 8 5 c and annual mean precipitation of 451 mm with more than half of the precipitation occurring from july to september the soil is a sandy loam with a mean soil bulk density of 1 29 g cm 3 field capacity of 23 by mass and wilting point of 5 16 by mass on average the water table is at 50 m below the soil surface our experiments were conducted over a three year period during which the annual precipitation was 460 mm 381 mm and 487 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 according to long term precipitation records 2014 and 2016 can be classified as normal years whereas 2015 can be considered as a dry year 2 3 statistical analysis considering each intercrop species separately two way anova was used to examine the effects of mowing intensity and growth environment greenhouse or field as well as their interactions on root characteristics using a linear model after checking for normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneous variance levene s test of the raw data fisher s lsd test was performed to determine significant differences in the maximum root depths among species and between growth environments whereas non parametric tests fisher s lsd test with ranks were conducted for other observed variables including total root length total root surface area root volume and root dry weight density significant differences among length proportions in different parts of the root system the upper and the lower halves were tested using the œá2 test by means of the chisq post hoc function in r for each considered soil layer an independent samples t test was done to test whether time averaged soil water content in the inter row or within row positions differed significantly between the monoculture and agroforestry systems all statistical analyses were carried out using r software version 3 5 1 https www r project org and significance was assessed at an alpha level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 responses of root characteristics to mowing for different intercrop species grown in the greenhouse and the field a significant mowing effect was observed for total root length of all three intercrop species fig 3 total root length decreased with decreasing stubble height the rate of decrease varied among species and between growth environments specifically as mowing height decreased for bluegrass and white clover grown in the field the total root length was significantly reduced fig 3 however 9 cm stubble height treatments did not lead to significant reductions in total root length for hairy vetch in the field fig 3 for the greenhouse environment the 3 cm stubble height treatment always significantly decreased the total root length whereas the 9 cm stubble height treatment never had a significant effect on the total root length of any of the three species a significant growth environment effect was only observed for bluegrass it produced considerably greater total root length for every mowing treatment in greenhouse than in field conditions fig 3 bluegrass produced much greater total root length 788 64 1334 78 1739 31 and 1931 72 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively than white clover 228 77 787 12 983 44 and 978 19 cm and hairy vetch 638 35 710 38 921 18 and 917 23 cm in the greenhouse under field conditions bluegrass also produced greater total root length 1045 40 cm than white clover 996 67 cm and hairy vetch 791 67 cm for control treatment however when mowing was applied to the intercrops in the field bluegrass produced significantly less total root length 132 56 450 01 and 600 82 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments respectively than the other two species 293 35 588 04 and 816 04 cm for white clover 558 26 730 81 and 810 10 cm for hairy vetch similarly both total root surface area and root volume consistently decreased as mowing height decreased for all three species and both growth environments table 1 however the degree to which they were reduced by different intensities of mowing varied among species and between growth environments also similar to the results found for total root length total root surface area differed significantly among plant species with bluegrass generally exhibiting the greatest values in the greenhouse 94 20 162 15 226 91 and 262 26 cm2 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively but the lowest values in the field 11 88 40 74 67 31 and 112 36 cm2 greenhouse conditions also contributed to greater total root surface area than field conditions for white clover 30 35 104 74 142 40 and 145 27 cm2 vs 32 29 77 14 105 91 and 119 30 cm2 and hairy vetch 118 40 128 08 184 69 and 191 55 cm2 vs 79 68 108 10 127 63 and 130 64 cm2 but the differences were less than observed for bluegrass root volumes were less under field conditions than under greenhouse conditions for all species but root volume sensitivities to environment were species specific compared with the other two species hairy vetch developed the largest root volume in both the greenhouse 1 76 1 84 3 04 and 3 72 cm3 for 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the control treatment respectively and in the field 0 95 1 28 1 71 and 1 72 cm3 bluegrass was visibly more sensitive to growth environment than white clover it produced greater root volume 0 93 1 63 2 48 and 2 90 cm3 than white clover 0 32 1 22 1 75 and 1 74 cm3 in the greenhouse but produced less root volume 0 19 0 30 0 61 and 1 02 cm3 than white clover 0 29 0 81 1 12 and 1 16 cm3 in the field all three intercrop species exhibited a significant mowing effect on maximum root depth fig 4 maximum root depth of bluegrass was significantly inhibited by 6 and 3 cm stubble height mowing treatments in both growth environments in addition the 3 cm stubble height treatment induced significantly shallower maximum root depth of bluegrass than the 6 cm stubble height treatment under field conditions but resulted in a similar maximum root depth as the 6 cm stubble height treatment under greenhouse conditions fig 4 similarly maximum root depth of white clover grown in the field was significantly shallower under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments than with the 9 cm stubble height and control treatments however only the 3 cm stubble height treatment significantly suppressed maximum root length of white clover in the greenhouse moreover the field environment stimulated white clover root development to a significantly deeper depth than seen for plants grown in the greenhouse under the 9 cm stubble height treatment and the unmowed control however the field environment resulted in significantly shallower maximum root depth of white clover than the greenhouse environment under 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments fig 4 the maximum root depth of hairy vetch showed clear and consistent response patterns to mowing in the two growth environments with significantly shallower maximum root depth with every increase of mowing intensity beyond the slight mowing treatment the maximum root depth of hairy vetch in the field reached 51 35 56 27 64 33 and 62 13 cm under the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control respectively these values were dramatically greater than those of bluegrass 21 04 34 32 54 75 and 56 42 cm and white clover 22 49 29 34 54 67 and 57 95 cm in the field in the greenhouse environment the three species showed similar maximum root depths for each of the four mowing treatments averaging 33 61 38 62 44 37 and 45 39 cm for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble heights and the control respectively overall mowing promoted a greater proportion of root length distributed in the shallower soil layer upper half of rooting depth for all grass species in the greenhouse although the degree to which root distribution was affected by mowing varied among species table 1 figs 5 and 6 the proportion of root length found in the upper half of the maximum root depth rlu for bluegrass grown in the greenhouse was significantly greater for the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments 72 04 and 59 23 than observed for the control 50 4 only the 3 cm stubble height treatment produced significantly greater rlu for white clover grown in the greenhouse from 50 24 to 62 94 none of the mowing treatments increased rlu of hairy vetch grown in the greenhouse in contrast rlu showed different responses to mowing under field conditions depending on the species table 1 figs 5 and 6 rlu of bluegrass increased with increasing mowing intensity but the increases were not statistically significant in contrast mowing treatments reduced rlu of white clover and hairy vetch under field conditions and the effects for the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments were significant furthermore bluegrass tended to generate higher rlu values under field conditions than under greenhouse conditions regardless of mowing treatments white clover and hairy vetch exhibited essentially the same rlu values for the control and 9 cm stubble height treatments under field conditions but under these same field conditions white clover displayed a stronger reduction in rlu with increasing mowing intensity than hairy vetch in addition bluegrass showed the highest rlu levels of the three species under field conditions particularly under the 3 cm stubble height treatment 73 42 bluegrass vs 28 61 white clover and 53 70 hairy vetch under greenhouse conditions higher rlu values were observed for hairy vetch than for bluegrass and white clover for most mowing treatments 3 2 responses of vertical root and soil moisture distribution to mowing for different intercrop species grown in the field root dry weight density rd decreased with increasing mowing intensity for all intercrop species mowing effect p 0 001 for all species fig 7 the overall rd of bluegrass was 0 056 0 095 0 173 and 0 226 mg m 3 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height and unmowed treatments respectively the respective rd values were 0 098 0 109 0 201 and 0 238 mg m 3 for white clover and 0 229 0 259 0 380 and 0 434 mg m 3 for hairy vetch compared with the unmowed control both the 3 and 6 cm stubble height treatments caused significant reductions in rd for all three species whereas the 9 cm stubble height treatment only showed a significant reduction in rd for hairy vetch for bluegrass rd declined relatively sharply between the soil surface and the 30 cm soil depth and then continued to decrease more gradually with depth until being undetectable in contrast white clover and hairy vetch showed increases in rd from the 0 10 cm layer to the 10 20 cm soil layer and then rd decreased with increasing soil depth roots of bluegrass were more abundant in the top 20 cm soil layer and the rd seen in this soil layer accounted for 91 29 69 30 71 40 and 64 37 of the total rd for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control treatment respectively the maximum rd ratio for white clover was located in the 10 30 cm soil layer with values of 75 90 61 44 59 28 and 53 78 for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed treatment respectively compared with bluegrass and white clover roots of hairy vetch extended to a greater depth and were more concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer within this layer rd values were 77 55 77 73 67 19 and 70 39 of the total rd for the 3 6 and 9 cm stubble height treatments and the unmowed control treatment respectively mowing strongly affected the overall vertical distribution of soil water content by depth mowing effect p 0 001 for all species fig 7 in general soil water content was greater throughout the entire 0 200 cm soil profile with increased mowing intensity except in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm within which an inverse pattern was observed in general soil water content declined sharply within the top soil layers and then fluctuated by small amounts in upper middle part of the soil profile about 40 100 cm soil water content generally increased from 100 to 140 cm and then remained relatively constant at lower soil depths the soil depths at which low soil water contents began and the depth at which soil water content began to increase differed somewhat among species and mowing treatments increased mowing intensity led to a shallower beginning depth for the dry layer for example this threshold dry depth for bluegrass changed from 70 cm in the control and 9 cm stubble height treatments to 50 cm in 6 cm stubble height treatment and 40 cm in 3 cm stubble height furthermore increased mowing intensity resulted in a smaller depth interval of dry soil and greater mean soil water content in this low soil water zone for all three species averaged over the entire soil profile the greatest soil water contents were found for the 3 cm stubble height treatment with mean values of 13 62 12 83 and 11 82 for bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch respectively the lowest soil moisture contents were observed in the unmowed control treatment with mean values of 11 67 11 64 and 10 87 for bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch respectively 3 3 jujube orchard soil moisture dynamics and yield in monoculture and agroforestry systems seasonal variations in soil water content of the jujube orchard under both monoculture and agroforestry systems were evident due to replenishment by precipitation and depletions due to plant water use and soil evaporation in both 2015 and 2016 compared with shallower soils soil water content below 120 cm showed little fluctuation over time fig 8 in the dry year 2015 a prolonged drought occurred from may to august during which total precipitation was just 54 13 of that in the normal year 2016 182 mm in 2015 vs 336 mm in 2016 fig 2 the four month long drought caused a continuous decline in soil water content at all four soil layers and the profile averaged soil water content 0 300 cm soil layer reached minimum values of 8 17 and 7 54 on 13 july doy 194 for the inter row and within row positions respectively in the monoculture treatment which were slightly higher than the average minimum values in the agroforestry treatment 7 83 and 7 25 after rain resumed in september soil water was replenished gradually but had still not recovered to the same level as at the start of the growing season in the normal precipitation year 2016 soil water content continuously increased from the beginning of the growing season and reached maximum values of 12 28 and 11 94 on 15 july doy 197 for the inter row and within row positions respectively for the monoculture treatment values which were slightly lower than those observed for the agroforestry treatment 12 69 and 12 22 soil water contents began to decline thereafter but were always wetter than at the start of the growing season soil water content differences between the monoculture and agroforestry treatments were mainly seen in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers the agroforestry treatment exhibited higher soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer throughout the two study periods the time averaged soil water content difference in the 0 20 cm soil layer was significant for both the inter row position 10 96 and 13 13 for the monoculture and agroforestry systems respectively and the within row position 11 51 and 12 33 two contrasting situations were noticed in the 20 60 cm soil layer for the agroforestry system relatively higher soil water content was observed than was observed for the monoculture system particularly for rainy periods whereas the opposite trend was seen in dry periods on average the soil water contents of the agroforestry system 9 55 and 9 37 for the inter row and within row positions respectively in this 20 60 cm soil layer were slightly higher than those in the monoculture system 9 10 and 8 79 but the differences were not significant additionally no significant difference was detected between the time averaged soil water content in the 60 120 cm soil layer of the monoculture system 9 44 and 9 08 for inter row and within row positions respectively and the agroforestry system 9 07 and 9 01 the same pattern was also seen for the 120 300 cm soil layer 10 11 and 9 76 for the monoculture system vs 9 83 and 9 60 for the agroforestry system on the whole the average soil water contents for the 0 300 cm soil profile during the entire study period were 10 01 and 9 61 at the inter row and within row positions of the monoculture system which were not significantly different from the values observed for the agroforestry system 9 89 and 9 63 on the other hand with bluegrass covering between row areas of soil fresh fruit yields of jujube trees increased from 7 98 to 9 01 kg per tree in 2015 and from 8 74 to 10 03 kg per tree in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 different intercrop species responses to mowing severe and moderate mowing 3 and 6 cm stubble height in the present study generally reduced root productivity total root length total root surface area root volume and dry root weight density of bluegrass white clover and hairy vetch by significant amounts root growth appeared to be unaffected when stubble height was higher than 6 cm this result is consistent with the findings of guitian and bardgett 2000 who reported that root biomass reduction by repeated defoliation varied with defoliation intensity their study found that two grazing tolerant grass species namely festuca rubra and cynosurus cristatus exhibited the greatest root biomass decrease by 63 and 59 respectively for plants cut weekly to a height of 4 cm above the soil surface compared with plants cut every two weeks and an uncut control a similar study conducted by medina roldan and bardgett 2011 used the same clipping regimes on a broad range of grass species they concluded that all species responded strongly and negatively to clipping in terms of root biomass and root length and that differences existed in the extent of the responses to different clipping intensities numerous other studies have also reported negative effects of defoliation on root amount dawson et al 2004 jarvis and macduff 1989 johnson and matchett 2001 the negative effects were widely attributed to the priority translocation of more assimilate and reserves to aboveground plant organs to promote rapid regrowth following tissue removal flemmer et al 2002 guitian and bardgett 2000 liu et al 2018 nippert et al 2012 additionally suppression of aboveground photosynthesis caused by heavy defoliation may result in root mortality due to insufficient photo assimilates supplied to roots bai et al 2015 chen et al 2006 additional studies have shown that root growth was unaffected by defoliation for some grasses a possible explanation for these differing results may be related to differences in plant tolerance resistance sensitivities to defoliation various growth environments and diversities in defoliation intensity alber et al 2014 bai et al 2015 boschma et al 2003 guitian and bardgett 2000 kitchen et al 2009 medina roldan and bardgett 2011 for example in some of the studies that did not show root growth reduction after defoliation plants had been defoliated only once or twice during the entire growing season becker et al 1997 flemmer et al 2002 much lighter defoliation than the repeated defoliation used in studies that presented opposite results the current study also indicated that mowing to produce 3 and 6 cm stubble heights reduced the maximum root depth of all three species particularly under field conditions fig 4 this fits well with the results of some other studies such as madison and hagan 1962 and liu and huang 2002 where bluegrass and creeping bentgrass argostis stolonifera were found to produce shallower maximum root depth under lower stubble height mowing treatments similarly in upland topographic positions of a native tallgrass prairie in kansas usa nippert et al 2012 grass roots were observed as deep as 46 cm in a grazed area only 41 of the depth of roots 112 cm in an ungrazed control area however there are also other studies showing different results for different species for example cutting mowing was reported to have no effect on the maximum root depth of st augustine grass stenotaphrum secundatum walt kuntze bahiagrass paspalum notatum flugge and zoysiagrass zoysia japonica steud during turf establishment hargey et al 2016 wherley et al 2011 this discrepancy may result from different water demands and growth regulation of different species in certain environments according to previous studies generating deeper root systems is usually assumed to be a mechanism for surviving drought stress by allowing plants to capture more available water from deep soil depths craine et al 2003 nippert et al 2012 reduced maximum root depth in our study due to mowing might be because mowing decreased canopy water consumption to an amount that could be supported by the water resource available in shallower soils biran et al 1981 elansary and yessoufou 2015 madison and hagan 1962 this potential mechanism can be supported by dramatically greater soil moisture in the 0 200 cm soil profile under field conditions for all the three species in our study fig 7 similar results demonstrating increased soil moisture following defoliation have also been documented in some other publications dealing with a typical patagonian steppe in an arid ecosystem where high grazing intensity increased soil water storage by 24 and reduced the water amount absorbed by roots from deep soil layers compared with low grazing intensity pereyra et al 2017 similarly in inner mongolia higher soil moisture was found for a continuous grazing site compared with an ungrazed site with stipa grandis vegetation gan et al 2012 in addition the observation that dry soil conditions tend to stimulate deeper root systems mentioned above is in good agreement with our result that the maximum root depth of hairy vetch was substantially deeper under field conditions than in the greenhouse across all mowing intensities fig 4 however this result was only seen for bluegrass and white clover under the slight mowing and unmowed treatments fig 4 under increasing mowing intensity maximum root depths under field condition for two of the species apparently decreased to a shallower level than observed under greenhouse conditions under the same mowing intensities this was particularly true for the severe mowing treatment this result indicated that drought can intensify the response of vegetative cover species to defoliation as also noted in previous studies chen et al 2013 elansary and yessoufou 2015 zhang et al 2018 additionally a higher proportion of root length appeared in the upper half of the maximum root depth after severe and moderate mowing under greenhouse conditions in our current study table 1 figs 5 and 6 this result suggests that mowing is likely to shift more roots to shallower depths in agreement with many other studies bai et al 2015 hargey et al 2016 kitchen et al 2009 pereyra et al 2017 however this trend was only observed for bluegrass under field conditions in contrast to the mowing effect on root distribution with depth that was observed for white clover and hairy vetch the above patterns suggest that under intensified mowing conditions bluegrass has a consistent reliance on surface soil moisture irrespective of growing conditions while white clover and hairy vetch displayed greater flexibility to switch water sources from various soil depths in response to a dry environment pereyra et al 2017 4 2 selection of suitable intercrop species and mowing intensity for a jujube orchard in the loess plateau region water uptake by roots is an essential mechanism for maintaining plant growth many previous studies have shown that root biomass and root depth indicate the ability and spatial extent of plant roots to acquire water from the soil ma et al 2013 one of the important factors causing widespread occurrence of persistent dry soil layers in the loess plateau region is excessive plant water consumption from deep soil layers over long time periods wang et al 2010 thus in order to mitigate the negative effects of soil water use from deep soil layers that can be difficult to replenish by rainfall in the loess plateau region intercrop species with shallower root systems and less root amount may be preferred for sustainable jujube orchard production in this region according to our results on root characteristics hairy vetch was not recommended to be introduced into jujube orchards because it developed a substantially deeper root system than the other two species fig 4 and had the largest root dry weight density in almost every soil layer when grown under field conditions fig 7 accordingly this root distribution pattern gave rise to the lowest soil moisture condition in the 0 200 cm soil profile of the vertical pits the profile averaged soil water content with the 3 cm stubble height mowing was 11 82 compared with 13 62 and 12 83 for bluegrass and white clover respectively fig 7 in contrast intensified mowing successfully inhibited the maximum root depth and root amount of bluegrass and white clover to a significantly lower level under field conditions even lower than that observed under greenhouse conditions fig 5 under intensified mowing similar values were observed for many root parameters maximum root depth total root length total root surface area and root volume for both bluegrass and white clover under field conditions however the two species showed quite different root architectures bluegrass tended to concentrate more roots in the upper soil layer e g 73 42 of the total root length in the profile was found within the upper half of the maximum root depth with the 3 cm stubble height mowing while white clover was likely to distribute relatively more roots in the lower soil layer e g just 28 61 of the total root length was found within the upper half of the maximum root depth under the 3 cm stubble height mowing fig 5e and m because of this difference in root distribution white clover has the potential to extract more water from deeper soil layers this finding was confirmed by the shallower depth in the soil profile at which soil moisture began to continuously increase with depth that was observed for bluegrass compared with white clover fig 7 this observation was consistent with the findings of pereyra et al 2017 who reported that more roots appeared in shallower soil layers and fewer roots were found in deeper soil layers resulting in a lower contribution of deep soil water to total evapotranspiration at a site with high grazing intensity compared with a site with low grazing intensity similarly other studies have shown that greater root length distributed to shallower soil layers was considered to allow this species to quickly respond to rainfall events and utilize available soil moisture preferentially in shallower soil layers nippert et al 2012 yu et al 2007 since water use from deeper soil layers can be detrimental for dry soil layer restoration in the semiarid loess plateau region bluegrass rather than white clover seems more suitable for intercropping with jujube trees another reason why we chose bluegrass managed to maintain a 3 cm stubble height for intercropping with jujube is that the profile averaged soil water content was highest in our bluegrass experimental pits coinciding with another study conducted in a similar region huang et al 2014 the results of our study also implied that water consumption by the poaceae species bluegrass was less than that of the leguminosae species white clover and hairy vetch additionally previous studies have indicated the important function of roots in reducing surface water movement and soil loss may be even more important than vegetation cover in reducing erosion processes gyssels et al 2005 that are typical and common in our study area li et al 2017 wu et al 2019 plant species with shallow and dense lateral spreading root networks are acknowledged to be more effective than deep rooted species in controlling water erosion created by concentrated flows de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 consequently bluegrass mowed to a 3 cm stubble height was also more suitable than white clover from this point of view based on the above considerations bluegrass with a stubble height of 3 cm became our first choice for intercropping with jujube trees 4 3 applicability validation of selected intercrop species and mowing intensity in a jujube orchard we accepted our hypothesis that jujube orchard soil moisture in an agroforestry system can be adjusted by intercrop mowing treatment to a level not significantly lower than soil moisture of jujube grown in a monoculture system in our field trail soil moisture in the top 0 20 cm soil layer at both inter row and within row positions was dramatically increased with the presence of bluegrass in jujube rows particularly after rainfall events fig 8 this was mainly attributable to the function of the intercrop in reducing soil evaporation and runoff as well as increasing rainfall interception and facilitating infiltration atucha et al 2012 huang et al 2014 malezieux et al 2009 however these functions were largely offset by intercrop transpiration from water use in the 20 60 cm soil layer despite rainy periods in this soil depth interval soil water content in the agroforestry system dropped more quickly than in the monoculture system fig 8 in the 60 120 cm soil layer intercropping moderately decreased the soil water content fig 8 this could be partly due to the enhancement of interspecies interactions in the agroforestry system to avoid water competition between trees and the understory crop as found in previous studies gao et al 2018 he et al 2013 malezieux et al 2009 schwendenmann et al 2010 in the pvc tube and vertical pit experiment 3 cm stubble height mowing resulted in bluegrass roots concentrated in 0 30 cm soil layer even though growth duration climate and intercropping may alter root depth the maximum root depth of bluegrass grown in jujube rows might not reach the 60 120 cm layer perhaps the lower soil water content in the 60 120 cm layer in the agroforestry system might be due to bluegrass preferentially using water from shallower soil layers which may have stimulated jujube trees to shift root development to deeper soil layers for water exploration since we lack data on root distribution and soil water absorption for monoculture and agroforestry systems this explanation will require verification based on further research in terms of quantifying soil water uptake from different soil layers for each plant in monocultural ecosystems taking soil samples and separating different plant roots for root distribution patterns assessment would provide useful information gao et al 2018 moreover the stable isotope Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h composition of water is also a powerful tool to trace the soil moisture movement in soil and plant system barbeta et al 2015 as a consequence the above two techniques could be combined to try in future research on determining the vegetation water sources lower soil water contents in the agroforestry system were also evident in the 120 300 cm soil layer in the dry year 2015 but not in the normal precipitation year 2016 a possible interpretation is that the degree of enhancement to interspecies interactions in the agroforestry system depends on climate conditions gao et al 2018 with those interactions having more serious consequences in dry years e g jujube trees may extract water from much deeper soil layers while negative effects are mitigated under wet conditions our observations of the 120 300 cm soil water dynamics also suggest that planting bluegrass between jujube tree rows may increase the risk of increasing soil moisture consumption in soil layers that cannot be easily recharged by rainfall in dry years even when the intercrop species is managed with 3 cm stubble height mowing however the consumed water may be replenished by rainfall in a normal precipitation year therefore the soil drying caused by planting bluegrass in a jujube orchard may be a temporary rather than a permanent condition a study by ling et al 2017 focused on soil water effects of intercropping with two other species hemerocallis fulva and fodder brassica napus managed without mowing in jujube orchards in a nearby county in the loess plateau region they reported that planting the two species between jujube tree rows apparently reduced the inter row soil water in the 60 180 cm soil layer in both dry and normal precipitation years a plausible explanation is the deep root systems of these two intercrop species according to their subsequent study both of their selected species allocated roots to as deep as 120 cm in the agroforestry jujube system gao et al 2018 this root depth might be much deeper than the root depth of the bluegrass used in our study because the 3 cm stubble height mowing largely limited bluegrass s roots to the 0 30 cm soil layer when planted alone however the exact root depth when planted with jujube trees should be further determined some studies have noted that growing crop covers in orchards is not always detrimental to soil moisture conservation huang et al 2014 for example cover crops have been shown to increase water storage in an olive olea europaea l plantation in the mediterranean region gucci et al 2012 sastre et al 2018 similarly soil moisture conditions of a rubber hevea brasiliensis plantation were reported to benefit from intercropping cultivation in the tropical xishuangbanna region wu et al 2016 also in an olive orchard with a clover trifolium subterraneum l intercrop water competition was observed to be negligible in normal and high rainfall years hernandez et al 2005 however more research studies have agreed with the conclusion that the agroforestry system aggravated soil aridity problems especially in dry periods celette et al 2005 huang et al 2014 2016 as a result live ground covers have been suggested to be killed at appropriate times to avoid undesirable water competition alcantara et al 2011 g√≥mez et al 2009 taking the entire 0 300 cm soil profile into consideration the agroforestry orchard in our study showed essentially the same soil moisture level as seen in the monoculture orchard compared with the considerably reduced soil water content in the 60 180 cm soil layer in the inter row position of the jujube agroforestry system mentioned above ling et al 2017 our results illustrated the effectiveness of mowing on soil water conservation in agroforestry systems on the other hand the fresh fruit yields of jujube trees increased by adopting the agroforestry system in our study this pattern compares favorably with the results of gao et al 2018 who conducted an experiment in the same region and also concluded that agroforestry was good for improving jujube production hence the results of our study support another possible method for preventing or limiting soil drying as well as ensuring economic income for jujube production in the semiarid loess plateau region 5 conclusions the main findings of our study were 1 total root length total root surface area root volume and maximum root depth of three potential intercrop spices tended to decrease with decreasing stubble height after mowing nevertheless this decrease varied among intercrop species and between growth environments 2 intercrop root amounts were less when grown under field conditions than when grown under greenhouse conditions for all species across all mowing intensities the same pattern was found for maximum root depth for bluegrass and white clover under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height mowing treatments however the opposite pattern was observed for the 9 cm stubble height mowing treatment and the unmowed treatment and also for hairy vetch across all mowing intensities 3 bluegrass developed the greatest amount of roots in the greenhouse but the least amount of roots in the field regardless of mowing intensity hairy vetch produced the deepest roots under field conditions regardless of mowing intensity and was therefore not considered as a viable intercrop species to be used with jujube all species achieved the minimum root amount and root depth under the 3 cm stubble height mowing white clover produced essentially the same amount of roots and maximum root depth as bluegrass under the 3 cm stubble height mowing in the field but allocated a much larger proportion of root length below the 1 2 maximum root depth 4 the significantly decreased maximum root depth combined with the substantially reduced root dry weight density under the 3 and 6 cm stubble height mowing treatments was clearly associated with dramatic improvement in soil moisture in the 0 200 cm soil profile under field conditions for all three species the best soil moisture condition was observed for the bluegrass monocrop under the 3 cm stubble height mowing 5 by adopting the 3 cm stubble height mowing intercropping bluegrass with jujube trees greatly increased soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer throughout the 2015 and 2016 jujube growing seasons slight increases in soil water content were also observed in the 20 60 cm soil layer contrasting results were detected in the 60 120 and 120 300 cm soil layers the average soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile during the entire study period was quite similar between the jujube monoculture orchard and jujube agroforestry system intercropped with bluegrass moreover the agroforestry system produced greater jujube yield than the monoculture system thus bluegrass managed with mowing to a stubble height of 3 cm intercropped with jujube trees is a proper management practice in the loess plateau that will achieve greater jujube yield while simultaneously avoiding extra soil drying declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

morpho biochemical traits in response to tannery wastewater irrigation the application of tannery wastewater significantly decreased the root and shoot growth attributes of cotton plants table 2 reduction in root length was evident among cotton plants at all harvests h1 h2 and h3 in response to all effluent concentrations p 0 01 the maximum decrease in cotton root length was evident due to 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 and 30 effluent concentrations respectively table 2 we also recorded a prominent decrease in shoot growth attributes in response to different effluents

protein concentration substantially reduced p 0 001 3 3 cotton ion attributes in response to tannery wastewater irrigation upon 60 d exposure to tannery wastewater the concentration of na increased considerably among cotton plants p 0 001 this increase was progressive with an increase in effluent percentages concentrations fig 2 while a prominent reduction in k and ca2 was also recorded due to wastewater application at all concentrations after all harvests nonetheless irrigation with wastewater increased chromium bioaccumulation with maximum cr concentration in 60 d old plants after 50 effluent concentration application p 0 001 table 4 3 4 brinjal morpho biochemical traits in response to tannery wastewater irrigation significant decrease in brinjal root length was evident in response to different tannery wastewater concentrations table 2 maximum reduction in root length was recorded in response to 50 concentrations at all harvests p 0 001 the application of wastewater at

tannery effluents also increased tissue na ion accumulation in brinjal progressively after effluent application at 30 40 and 50 concentrations p 0 001 by contrast irrigation with increasing tannery effluent concentrations considerably decreased k and ca2 ionic concentrations as well fig 3 maximum reduction in the k and ca2 concentrations were evident at the final harvest 60 d old plants apart from this the effluent application substantially increased cr bioaccumulation in brinjal with maximum values recorded at the final harvest p 0 001 table 3 maximum values of cr were recorded due to irrigation with 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 30 20 and 10 effluent percentages respectively fig 3 table 5 4 discussion farmers tend to use effluents to meet water scarcity but it may lead to increased heavy metal contamination of the ecosystem to study the effects of tannery wastewater two separate experiments were conducted and we exposed cotton and brinjal plants to leather tannery effluents exposure to different effluent concentrations progressively decreased the growth of cotton as well as brinjal maximum inhibition in the growth traits of both crops was recorded after 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 and 30 respectively reduction in root growth attributes in the presence of hm contamination has been linked with ultra structural changes such as lignification to stop toxic metal permeation inside the root dalcorso 2012 barros et al 2015 researchers also linked decrease root growth with impaired root cellular metabolism enhanced membrane permeability and oxidative stress induced cell death eleftheriou et al 2015 here we also recorded a reduction in shoot growth and associated biochemical attributes in agreement with our results exposure of plants to tannery effluents or cr stress inhibited root and shoot growth in lycopersicon esculentum brasili et al 2020 arabidopsis thaliana eleftheriou et al 2015 triticum aestivum l dotaniya et al 2014b and sorghum bicolor bruno et al 2020 these disturbances are often linked with impaired cellular metabolism shahid et al 2017 liu et al 2020 an important aspect of the results to be discussed here is the significant inhibition in the nitrate reductase activity plant nitrogen metabolism is directly linked with growth via synthesis of amino acids nucleotide bases and as a part of various important biomolecules including vitamins hormones and other primary and secondary metabolites therefore plant assimilation of this macronutrient is a key to optimum growth and production and is dependent on no3 reduction by nitrate reductase activity nra during both experiments prominent inhibition in the nra among cotton and brinjal plants was recorded after the third harvest brinjal plants in particular had 38 1 and 53 5 inhibition in nra activities at 40 and 50 effluent concentrations in contrast cotton plants exhibited 61 2 and 55 reduction in nra activities due to irrigation with 40 and 50 concentrations of effluents likewise the total soluble proteins among both the plant species substantially reduced upon prolonged exposure as mentioned earlier chromium is extremely toxic to plants with no known biological function shanker et al 2005 the untreated effluents released from leather tanning industries are extremely rich in cr lofrano et al 2013 and is a serious environmental concern when such effluents are used for irrigation of fields therefore we attribute reduction in growth traits of both plants to phytotoxic effects of chromium that primarily inhibited nitrogen metabolism another prominent factor in the growth retardation in the presence of dissolved salts and irrigation with tannery effluents could also reduce soil matric potential ultimately affecting plant water relations a concentration dependant increase in na and cr concentrations consistent with a reduction in k and ca2 ions among both plant species were recorded in this study this indicated disturbances in cellular ion homeostasis which can be another reason for growth inhibition above all more cr bioaccumulation was recorded in brinjal compared with cotton whereas irrigation with leather tannery effluents at all concentrations was found toxic for both crops 5 conclusions inhibition in cotton and brinjal growth and biomass production ability was evident when irrigated with tannery wastewater based on the results the brinjal plants exhibited less inhibition in nra activity and had higher total soluble proteins compared with cotton plants also the brinjal plants uptake more cr and its subsequent bioaccumulation whereas cotton plants showed greater sensitivity to tannery effluent application evident from disturbed morpho biochemical traits it is further suggested that brinjal plants could be use to remediate cr contaminated sites as evident from its relative tolerance than cotton however such plants harvested brinjal crop should not be used for edible purposes which will pose a greater health risk and should be dispose off properly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

harvests was performed by wet acid digestion using h2so4 and h2o2 dried plant part 100 mg was incubated overnight in test tubes containing 3 ml h2so4 and then digested using 50 h2o2 at 300 c on a heating plate for 6 h until it became colourless after a periodic addition of h2o2 each time the h2o2 1 ml was added slowly with the walls of the test tube and after digestion the final volume was made 25 ml with de ionized water and filtered using whatman no 42 ashless filter paper the determination of na k and ca ions from the filtrate was performed using flame photometer jenway pfp 7 while the cr concentrations were determined with the help of aas perkin elmer instruments analyst 300 2 2 5 statistical analyses two way anova analyses were performed to study the effects of leather tannery effluent dilutions factor 1 at different harvest stages factor 2 for both crops separately statistical analyses were performed with costat software using crd layout with three replications per treatment version 6 303 cohort software ca usa the differences among means values from different treatments were computed using duncan s multiple range dmr test at 95 confidence index using the same statistical software 3 results 3 1 experimental soil and effluent analyses tannery effluent had substantially higher concentrations of inorganic ions na k ca2 and cr than recommended limits by who and usepa table 1 the ph of effluent was acidic 4 2 compared with the permissible limits as well also the electrical conductivity of effluent was way more than international standards table 1 3 2 cotton morpho biochemical traits in response to tannery wastewater irrigation the application of tannery wastewater significantly decreased the root and shoot growth attributes of cotton plants table 2 reduction in root length was evident among cotton plants at all harvests h1 h2 and h3 in response to all effluent concentrations p 0 01 the maximum decrease in cotton root length was evident due to 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 and 30 effluent concentrations respectively table 2 we also recorded a prominent decrease in shoot growth attributes in response to different effluents concentrations at all harvests substantial reduction in shoot length fresh biomass and leaf area were evident at all harvests p 0 01 table 4 apart from growth traits nra activity and total soluble protein concentration substantially reduced p 0 001 3 3 cotton ion attributes in response to tannery wastewater irrigation upon 60 d exposure to tannery wastewater the concentration of na increased considerably among cotton plants p 0 001 this increase was progressive with an increase in effluent percentages concentrations fig 2 while a prominent reduction in k and ca2 was also recorded due to wastewater application at all concentrations after all harvests nonetheless irrigation with wastewater increased chromium bioaccumulation with maximum cr concentration in 60 d old plants after 50 effluent concentration application p 0 001 table 4 3 4 brinjal morpho biochemical traits in response to tannery wastewater irrigation significant decrease in brinjal root length was evident in response to different tannery wastewater concentrations table 2 maximum reduction in root length was recorded in response to 50 concentrations at all harvests p 0 001 the application of wastewater at all concentrations reduced shoot growth attributes like shoot length fresh biomass and leaf area table 2 irrigation with different effluent concentrations also inhibited nra activity with maximum reduction at 50 effluent concentration and also decreased total soluble proteins p 0 01 table 3 3 5 brinjal ion attributes in response to tannery wastewater irrigation the prolonged exposure to tannery effluents also increased tissue na ion accumulation in brinjal progressively after effluent application at 30 40 and 50 concentrations p 0 001 by contrast irrigation with increasing tannery effluent concentrations considerably decreased k and ca2 ionic concentrations as well fig 3 maximum reduction in the k and ca2 concentrations were evident at the final harvest 60 d old plants apart from this the effluent application substantially increased cr bioaccumulation in brinjal with maximum values recorded at the final harvest p 0 001 table 3 maximum values of cr were recorded due to irrigation with 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 30 20 and 10 effluent percentages respectively fig 3 table 5 4 discussion farmers tend to use effluents to meet water scarcity but it may lead to increased heavy metal contamination of the ecosystem to study the effects of tannery wastewater two separate experiments were conducted and we exposed cotton and brinjal plants to leather tannery effluents exposure to different effluent concentrations progressively decreased the growth of cotton as well as brinjal maximum inhibition in the growth traits of both crops was recorded after 50 effluent concentration followed by 40 and 30 respectively reduction in root growth attributes in the presence of hm contamination has been linked with ultra structural changes such as lignification to stop toxic metal permeation inside the root dalcorso 2012 barros et al 2015 researchers also linked decrease root growth with impaired root cellular metabolism enhanced membrane permeability and oxidative stress induced cell death eleftheriou et al 2015 here we also recorded a reduction in shoot growth and associated biochemical attributes in agreement with our results exposure of plants to tannery effluents or cr stress inhibited root and shoot growth in lycopersicon esculentum brasili et al 2020 arabidopsis thaliana eleftheriou et al 2015 triticum aestivum l dotaniya et al 2014b and sorghum bicolor bruno et al 2020 these disturbances are often linked with impaired cellular metabolism shahid et al 2017 liu et al 2020 an important aspect of the results to be discussed here is the significant inhibition in the nitrate reductase activity plant nitrogen metabolism is directly linked with growth via synthesis of amino acids nucleotide bases and as a part of various important biomolecules including vitamins hormones and other primary and secondary metabolites therefore plant assimilation of this macronutrient is a key to optimum growth and production and is dependent on no3 reduction by nitrate reductase activity nra during both experiments prominent inhibition in the nra among cotton and brinjal plants was recorded after the third harvest brinjal plants in particular had 38 1 and 53 5 inhibition in nra activities at 40 and 50 effluent concentrations in contrast cotton plants exhibited 61 2 and 55 reduction in nra activities due to irrigation with 40 and 50 concentrations of effluents likewise the total soluble proteins among both the plant species substantially reduced upon prolonged exposure as mentioned earlier chromium is extremely toxic to plants with no known biological function shanker et al 2005 the untreated effluents released from leather tanning industries are extremely rich in cr lofrano et al 2013 and is a serious environmental concern when such effluents are used for irrigation of fields therefore we attribute reduction in growth traits of both plants to phytotoxic effects of chromium that primarily inhibited nitrogen metabolism another prominent factor in the growth retardation in the presence of dissolved salts and irrigation with tannery effluents could also reduce soil matric potential ultimately affecting plant water relations a concentration dependant increase in na and cr concentrations consistent with a reduction in k and ca2 ions among both plant species were recorded in this study this indicated disturbances in cellular ion homeostasis which can be another reason for growth inhibition above all more cr bioaccumulation was recorded in brinjal compared with cotton whereas irrigation with leather tannery effluents at all concentrations was found toxic for both crops 5 conclusions inhibition in cotton and brinjal growth and biomass production ability was evident when irrigated with tannery wastewater based on the results the brinjal plants exhibited less inhibition in nra activity and had higher total soluble proteins compared with cotton plants also the brinjal plants uptake more cr and its subsequent bioaccumulation whereas cotton plants showed greater sensitivity to tannery effluent application evident from disturbed morpho biochemical traits it is further suggested that brinjal plants could be use to remediate cr contaminated sites as evident from its relative tolerance than cotton however such plants harvested brinjal crop should not be used for edible purposes which will pose a greater health risk and should be dispose off properly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
