20365,the air wake generated behind a frigate superstructure is a very complex and unsteady three dimensional flow characterized by highly turbulent flow structures with great velocity gradients that result in flow separation over the flight deck where helicopter operations take a significant role naturally this turbulent flow should be removed or at least reduced as maximum as possible to avoid accidents during the interaction between frigates and helicopters this paper involves experimental and numerical analysis on a simple frigate model sfs2 to understand and simulate the adverse effect of the turbulent flow of the air wake over the deck and tries to minimize it as with active flow control the experimental study has been performed in the low speed wind tunnel nº1 of instituto nacional de técnica aeroespacial esteban terradas inta with particle image velocimetry piv to obtain the velocity field over the flight deck the frigate has been tested for the headwind condition of 0 wind aligned with the flight deck with a velocity of 10 m s the active flow control consists on generating suction on the flight deck by a mesh of holes several configurations of this suction mesh

the frigate a typical air wake is composed of turbulent complex and unsteady 3d flow with high velocity gradients although these turbulent recirculation flows do not envelop the entire flight deck depending on the wind direction they can occupy a large region of the flight deck having a significant effect on the helicopter s rotor in both take off and landing operations thus endangering them this aerodynamic interaction between frigates and helicopters is the most crucial moment for pilots and must be studied and analyzed in detail in order to try to improve it and thus make this type of maneuvers safer avoiding any possible human accident yuan et al 2016 in particular the final approach landing operation is one of the riskiest and hard helicopter frigate interaction since the pilot

carried out in order to increase the pilot safety operating on frigates lumsden 2003 over last years control flow has played a significant role in multiple disciplines a wide variety of investigations based on active and passive control flow have been published in particular shafer developed his phd thesis based on active and passive flow control over the flight deck of small naval deck shafer and published technical papers associated in 2005 shafer and ghee 2005 one of the most common passive flow controls are vortex generators vgs which generate vortices that provide kinetic energy to the flow to keep it turbulent when desired smith 1994 betterton et al 2000 aider et al 2010 in this case the authors of lin 2002 duriez et al 2006 2008 have developed studied based on maintaining turbulent boundary layers for a long period of time to delay the flow detachment related to active flow control there is a wide variety of active flow control devices in aircraft aerodynamics field oktay and kanat 2017 these devices consist of blowing s baljit et al 2017 or suctioning kianoosh and reza 2015 flow to improve the aerodynamics performances of aircrafts 2 model the model under study is a simple frigate which has a scale of 1 86 66 the total length of this model is 1 6 m and the rest of the dimensions are detailed in fig 1 although this model is based on a simple frigate shape sfs2 that was created originally by a ship airwake modelling working group within the technical co operation program ttcp presents the most significant geometrical shapes related to a frigate the superstructure helicopter hangar and flight deck where helicopters land and take off under different conditions as the main objective of this paper is to analyze the suction effect over the flight deck to control the flow thus improving the aerodynamic performance for helicopter operations the hangar and flight deck play the most relevant role in them to control the flow over the flight deck a suction mesh configuration over it of 35 holes 5 holes in y axis and 7 in x axis has been designed and equispaced 1 cm between all of them in both directions this configuration has been selected according to the specific requirements of dimensions of the frigate flight deck and hangar apart from a previous study conducted by bardera last year lumsden 2003 the parameters for the characterization of this suction effect have been the diameter of holes 2 5 mm 4 mm and 6 mm location or number of holes first study with 35 holes and a second study with a lower number 15 and 20 holes and suction power depending on the suction power several flow ratios will be therefore multiple suction configurations have been simulated with the purpose of selecting which of them will present the greatest improvement in terms of aerodynamic performance for helicopter operations the simple frigate model was designed by using catia v5 software and manufactured with wood for the wind tunnel testing a final surface finish has been required to reduce the roughness of the frigate for both studies numerical and experimental the tested model is the only which is placed above the waterline of the frigate moreover the simulations have been performed with a free stream velocity of 10 m s which corresponds to a reynolds number based on the beam of the ship of 1 1 10 5 that is above the critical value for sharp edges bodies 3 computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis 3 1 cfd analysis description computational fluid dynamics cfd has been used as a preliminary study before experimental data to simulate the frigate under different conditions to verify the proper performance of this model through this numerical analysis the experimental testing in the wind tunnel could be reached with high accuracy cfd solvers were implemented in computers to simulate the aerodynamic flow around models for this purpose the control volume of the model is discretized into smaller ones where the fluid mechanic s equations have to be solved in all of them to perform these numerical computations the commercial software ansys fluent 2020 has been selected the steps to follow in this numerical study will be detailed below in the first place the geometry of the frigate designed with catia v5 software see section 2 model is imported from a simple 3d frigate sfs2 two frigate configurations have been tested frigate base model without suction effect and frigate with active flow control for the suction condition defined as q5 d6 see table 2 which corresponds to the maximum value of flow ratio of 1 03 10 3 m 3 s and diameter of 6 mm it has been decided to simulate this suction condition since it is the highest suction power that will be reached by wind tunnel testing and it will simulate the suction effect over the flight deck of the frigate accurately in the second place the control volume has been designed according to the dimensions of the simple frigate see fig 1 the dimensions of the control volume according to the length of the frigate l are presented in fig 2 surfaces of the control volume have been located far away from the frigate to simulate the aerodynamic flow of the wind tunnel the lower surface of the control volume has been placed in the same position as the lower surface of the frigate because the part over the waterline is the only one that will be studied the surfaces of the control volume inlet outlet and wall presented in fig 2 have been defined according to the position of the frigate inside of it consequently the face in front of the bow of the frigate corresponds to the inlet and the other one behind the stern parallel to the inlet corresponds to the outlet 1 the rest of the surfaces of the control volume corresponds to walls the last one is the outlet 2 which is encompassed by the flight deck in the base configuration and configuration of holes in suction configurations once the control volume has been designed and defined it needs to be meshed so that the flow equations are solved at each cell of the mesh flow equations need to be solved in a proper number of cells such that the flow is able to simulate the actual flow behavior precisely therefore the number of cells in the mesh will depend on the region of interest in this context the region over the flight deck and hangar as they are the most relevant regions of study they will require a higher number of cells and smoother meshes to have the greatest possible resolution the detailed schematics of grid are presented in fig 3 the features of this generated mesh can be observed in table 1 once the mesh has been generated and surfaces of the control volume named the simulation is able to be performed by using the fluent module solver related to the solver the option of pressure based approach is the most accurate since the study of this frigate will be performed at 10 m s so in this case the airflow is subsonic steady and incompressible in terms of turbulence there are several turbulence models such as les rans and dns although les and dns could achieve more accurate results the calculation time is great and simulation process complicated so they are used for ideal flow purposes because of this rans is the lowest computational cost method that is used in a wide variety of flow calculations presenting acceptable accuracy in the industry from the three rans models standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε models in this study the standard k ε model has been selected since the flow is turbulent and the molecular viscosity terms are negligible the boundary conditions have been defined according to the surfaces of the control volume therefore in the inlet the boundary condition is the velocity inlet with a value of 10 m s which is the free stream velocity in the outlet 1 the boundary condition has been defined as gauge pressure with a value of 0 δp 0 since this surface is located far away from the stern of the frigate and presents atmospheric pressure however in the outlet 2 since it corresponds to the holes over the flight deck to generate the suction this boundary condition will depend on the suction configurations of the frigate therefore the most appropriate boundary condition for these numerical simulations has been the option of flow ratio so that this value will depend on the different configurations according to the diameter of holes and flow rates in all of them once all conditions have been defined the simulation requires to be initialized from the inlet boundary condition 10 m s the maximal number of iterations to solve the fluid mechanics equations were set to 1000 3 2 cfd results in fig 4 the non dimensional velocity obtained by cfd simulation for the base configuration of the frigate with no suction effect and the more powerful suction case of 35 holes is presented fig 4 a shows the lateral view of the frigate as it was obtained by wind tunnel testing for experimental results but in this case for the entire frigate fig 4 b shows the platform view to visualize the recirculation of the flow with the presence of the superstructure of the frigate there is a big difference between the base frigate and the one with active flow control it can be seen how the dimension of the recirculation bubble blue region is smaller when the suction is applied in addition the suction causes that the vortices of the air wake behind the hangar to occupy a smaller region on the flight deck while their dimension narrows and their intensity is lower compared to the model without suction 4 experimental study 4 1 wind tunnel and particle image velocimetry the experimental study has been performed in the low speed wind tunnel nº1 fig 5 b at inta instituto nacional de técnica aeroespacial located in madrid spain the main features of the wind tunnel are their closed circuit with an elliptical open test section 2 3 m 2 dc 450 kw electric motor at 420 v that allows us reaching velocities up to 60 m s and low turbulence intensity which presents a value up to 0 5 the wind tunnel is composed of a streamlined platform that is streamlined leading and trailing edges to reduce the possible flow perturbations to analyze the flow pattern around the frigate experimentally an advanced technique fig 5 c has been used particle image velocimetry piv this technique is based on measuring the flow velocity from local measurements of small tracer particles which have been seeded previously in the airflow to be subsequently illuminated by a laser plane the generation of these tracer particles with a diameter of 1 μm has been done by using laskin atomizers connected to compressors in addition olive oil has been used as the material for these tracer particles the laser plane is generated with two 190 mj pulsed neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet nd yag lasers both lasers are pulsed with a time interval of 25 μs the capture of these pairs of flow images is done by using a high resolution camera ccd of 2048 2048 pixels nikon nikkor 50 mm 1 1 4d a synchronized system is used to capture the flow images at the same time the laser is pulsed once the pairs of flow images have been taken the commercial software needs to process them to obtain the average displacement between tracer particles of a pair of flow images a total of 100 pairs of flow images have been required for each experimental test the process of flow images is based on a cross correlation function which is implemented by a fast fourier transform fft all flow images are divided into small interrogation windows 32 32 pixels that are overlapped 50 by the nyquist sampling criteria due to the time interval between flow images δt is fixed and average displacement δ x between tracer particles of these flow images is calculated the velocity vector can be easily obtained u all flow images have been taken with a data frequency acquisition of 10 hz moreover a post processing task based on a local mean filtering has been performed to eliminate spurious velocity vectors and consequently fill them with new data the experimental testing in the low speed wind tunnel has consisted in three steps in the first place the base frigate with no suction effect is tested as a reference model for the following configurations with the modified flight deck in the second place the frigate with the different suction configurations over the flight deck has been tested to compare them with the previous model in the last step an optimization of the better configurations obtained in the previous step has been performed according to specific requirements therefore the final goal is to obtain velocity maps over the flight deck of multiple configurations to visualize and analyze the recirculation bubble over it which is the critical factor in helicopter operations and try to reduce their effect as maximum as possible the tested simple frigate sfs2 is presented in fig 5 a suction configurations tested defined in section 2 model are based on modifications over the flight deck mesh of holes with different diameters number of holes location of holes and suction power flow ratios by holes in particular three diameters have been studied 2 5 mm 4 0 mm and 6 0 mm five suction powers q1 q2 q3 q4 and q5 and three configurations of holes 35 holes 25 holes and 20 holes a total of 15 velocity maps have been tested the different cases of suction power tested have been adjusted by the suction system presented in fig 6 it has a venturi tube with a digital manometer thommen hm28 to control the velocity and flow ratio suctioned by the system during the tests the system has an adjustable ball valve that opens the system to the atmosphere to increase or decrease the suction flow ratio producing a by pass effect the suction is achieved by means of vacuum system connected through the lower duct in fig 6 4 2 analysis of experimental results figs 7 and 8 show the piv maps of non dimensional velocity magnitude over the flight deck defined by v v u where v u 2 w 2 and u is the free stream velocity in fig 7 it can be seen the simple frigate model in its base configuration no suction effect associated in fig 8 the suction configurations to remove or try to minimize the recirculation bubble are shown in this study the active flow control over the flight deck of the frigate is a mesh of 35 suction holes defined as in section 2 model fig 1 therefore the characterization of the flow has been conducted by modifying the diameter of these holes and the suction intensity from the flight deck to simplify the nomenclature of results the smallest suction intensity is named q1 obviously corresponds with the lowest flow rate in each of the holes and the largest suction intensity is q5 which is the largest in each of the diameter configurations table 2 shows the values of flow ratios in each of the diameter configurations dimensioned by the maximum suction intensity configuration q5 d6 a total of 15 suction mesh configurations from of the deck have been tested all non dimensional velocity maps in fig 8 show the free stream velocity of 10 m s orange region a region of lower velocity than the free stream velocity green area that corresponds to the frigate air wake and the recirculation bubble of low velocities of near zero velocities blue region the streamlines show the flow pattern of the free stream parallel to the frigate and the flow detachment that is generated due to the superstructure and flight deck in fig 7 the typical flow pattern over the flight deck is shown the nomenclature refers to fs free stream velocity without any perturbation from the frigate lsr low velocity area generated by the aerodynamic interference of the frigate sl 1 and sl 2 first and second shear layer respectively rb 1 recirculation bubble which is placed underneath sl 2 and generated due to the flow detachment on the superstructure and sl 3 and rb 2 third shear layer and recirculation bubble underneath sl 3 due to the end of flight deck in table 3 the centers of each recirculation bubble along with the dimension are presented the center of the recirculation bubble is measured from the center of the flight deck x 0 mm y 0 mm and the bubble dimension by the height and width therefore the selected recirculation bubble parameters have been x center y center height and width the center of the recirculation bubble is obtained with x center and y center defined as the distance from the center of the bubble to x 0 mm and to y 0 mm respectively the height and width have been defined according to the first curving streamline separated from the tangent streamline to the flight deck the height is measured in vertical direction and the width in line with the flight deck all recirculation bubble parameters are identified in fig 8 it can be seen that the dimension of this recirculation bubble both in height and width is notably reduced when the active flow control takes place in comparison with the frigate without suction moreover the center of the recirculation bubble is moved from the center of the flight deck while the suction is applied for all cases a really interesting point is that the dimension of the recirculation bubble is even more reduced as the suction intensity increases for each of the diameter configurations in addition to this in each of these configurations the center of the recirculation bubble is placed farther away from the center of the flight deck in x axis and at the same time this center is moving to the upper part of the superstructure in y axis taking into account these data the active flow control configuration that has proven to be most optimal is the one with the largest diameter d 6 mm and the highest suction intensity q5 in table 3 the non dimensional recirculation bubble parameters are presented for the most critical configurations as a last step it has been decided to study the most optimal suction configuration diameter of 6 mm and highest suction intensity q5 see the values of flow rates of each suction configuration in table 4 by modifying the number and position of holes the nomenclature and design of each resulting suction configuration is shown in fig 9 as the initial suction mesh has 35 holes over the flight deck of the frigate some of holes need to be plugged in order to perform this last experimental test therefore two or three rows of holes are covered in the nomenclature 2 and 3 refers to plugging 2 rows or 3 rows respectively if the covered holes are near the hangar the nomenclature is at otherwise it will be bt see fig 9 the simple frigate with suction configurations based on different number of holes but with same location of them for instance at 2 and at 3 show a similar behavior both configurations present analogous flow patterns the dimension of the recirculation bubble has hardly any variation in both height and width it could therefore be concluded that active flow control by changing the number of holes from 20 to 25 in the same position would not produce an appreciable beneficial effect this conclusion also applies to the other suction configuration bt 2 and bt 3 however comparing the positions of the covered holes it can be seen that when the holes are covered from the part nearest the center of the flight deck bt 2 and bt 3 the suction effect and therefore the improvement is greater in these cases the height and width of the recirculation bubble have been reduced and furthermore the center of the recirculation bubble has moved towards the hangar corner finally the size of the low speed area lsa above the flight deck in each case is measured as a ratio between the low velocity area points with lower non dimensional velocities than 0 3 and the total area above the flight deck the dimension of the low speed area above the flight deck lsa in percentage is obtained for all configurations tested see fig 10 these results validate the previous conclusions obtained from piv visualizations the size of the recirculation bubble in the base configuration is lsa 36 however by applying suction for the most unfavorable case 2 5 mm and q1 it is reduced by 33 lsa 27 it can be seen that in each flow rate condition separately the worst scenario that is the lower decrease of the recirculation bubble is for the smaller diameter 2 5 mm however the diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm in all flow rate conditions present a highly reduction of the recirculation bubble area that although there is a hardly any difference between them the reduction with the previous diameter is much relevant and the analysis must be focused on the largest diameters regarding to the flow rate as it increases the area of the recirculation bubble becomes smaller for the three diameters 2 5 4 and 6 mm taking into account these conclusions better results are presented for the suction configuration with a diameter of 4 mm and q5 where the final area reduction is from 36 to 6 a similar result is obtained for the configuration with a diameter of 6 mm and q5 where the lsa is 7 finally from fig 9 it can be obtained that the better results are obtained for the suction configuration with holes near to the hangar in this case the most optimal suction configuration is bt 3 with a minimum lsa of 3 5 conclusions in this study experimental and numerical simulations over the flight deck of a simple frigate model with active flow control have been performed the experimental study has been conducted in a low speed wind tunnel at inta by using particle image velocimetry piv for measuring the velocity field firstly the velocity field has been obtained for the base configuration of the frigate to analyze the aerodynamic problems due to its bluff geometry that is critical factor for helicopter operations regions of low velocity shear layers and recirculation bubbles appears behind the hangar generating oscillations and low frequency movements that are very dangerous for helicopter maneuvers consequently multiple suction configurations based on a mesh of holes on the flight deck have been tested in order to obtain the most optimal configuration for improving the aerodynamics in helicopter frigate interactions the results have shown that the active flow control by suction from the deck could be an easy way to reduce the low velocity bubble that appears behind the frigate superstructure the cases with 35 holes suctioning from the flight deck reduces the low velocity area from 36 to 6 increasing the effect with the suction intensity the most beneficial suction configuration has resulted to be the mesh with 20 holes placed near the hangar with the maximum diameter of 6 mm and maximum suction intensity q5 in this suction configuration the recirculation bubble size is the smallest lsa 3 and the incident velocities to the rotor of the helicopter could have the lowest gradients in comparison with other configurations credit authorship contribution statement r bardera conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original

characterization of this suction effect have been the diameter of holes 2 5 mm 4 mm and 6 mm location or number of holes first study with 35 holes and a second study with a lower number 15 and 20 holes and suction power depending on the suction power several flow ratios will be therefore multiple suction configurations have been simulated with the purpose of selecting which of them will present the greatest improvement in terms of aerodynamic performance for helicopter operations the simple frigate model was designed by using catia v5 software and manufactured with wood for the wind tunnel testing a final surface finish has been required to reduce the roughness of the frigate for both studies numerical and experimental the tested model is the only which is placed above the waterline of the frigate moreover the simulations have been performed with a free stream velocity of 10 m s which corresponds to a reynolds number based on the beam of the ship of 1 1 10 5 that is above the critical value for sharp edges bodies 3 computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis 3 1 cfd analysis description computational fluid dynamics cfd has been used as a preliminary study before experimental data to simulate the frigate under different conditions to verify the proper performance of this model through this numerical analysis the experimental testing in the wind tunnel could be reached with high accuracy cfd solvers were implemented in computers to simulate the aerodynamic flow around models for this purpose the control volume of the model is discretized into smaller ones where the fluid mechanic s equations have to be solved in all of them to perform these numerical computations the commercial software ansys fluent 2020 has been selected the steps to follow in this numerical study will be detailed below in the first place the geometry of the frigate designed with catia v5 software see section 2 model is imported from a simple 3d frigate sfs2 two frigate configurations have been tested frigate base model without suction effect and frigate with active flow control for the suction condition defined as q5 d6 see table 2 which corresponds to the maximum value of flow ratio of 1 03 10 3 m 3 s and diameter of 6 mm it has been decided to simulate this suction condition since it is the highest suction power that will be reached by wind tunnel testing and it will simulate the suction effect over the flight deck of the frigate accurately in the second place the control volume has been designed according to the dimensions of the simple frigate see fig 1 the dimensions of the control volume according to the length of the frigate l are presented in fig 2 surfaces of the control volume have been located far away from the frigate to simulate the aerodynamic flow of the wind tunnel the lower surface of the control volume has been placed in the same position as the lower surface of the frigate because the part over the waterline is the only one that will be studied the surfaces of the control volume inlet outlet and wall presented in fig 2 have been defined according to the position of the frigate inside of it consequently the face in front of the bow of the frigate corresponds to the inlet and the other one behind the stern parallel to the inlet corresponds to the outlet 1 the rest of the surfaces of the control volume corresponds to walls the last one is the outlet 2 which is encompassed by the flight deck in the base configuration and configuration of holes in suction configurations once the control volume has been designed and defined it needs to be meshed so that the flow equations are solved at each cell of the mesh flow equations need to be solved in a proper number of cells such that the flow is able to simulate the actual flow behavior precisely therefore the number of cells in the mesh will depend on the region of interest in this context the region over the flight deck and hangar as they are the most relevant regions of study they will require a higher number of cells and smoother meshes to have the greatest possible resolution the detailed schematics of grid are presented in fig 3 the features of this generated mesh can be observed in table 1 once the mesh has been generated and surfaces of the control volume named the simulation is able to be performed by using the fluent module solver related to the solver the option of pressure based approach is the most accurate since the study of this frigate will be performed at 10 m s so in this case the airflow is subsonic steady and incompressible in terms of turbulence there are several turbulence models such as les rans and dns although les and dns could achieve more accurate results the calculation time is great and simulation process complicated so they are used for ideal flow purposes because of this rans is the lowest computational cost method that is used in a wide variety of flow calculations presenting acceptable accuracy in the industry from the three rans models standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε models in this study the standard k ε model has been selected since the flow is turbulent and the molecular viscosity terms are negligible the boundary conditions have been defined according to the surfaces of the control volume therefore in the inlet the boundary condition is the velocity inlet with a value of 10 m s which is the free stream velocity in the outlet 1 the boundary condition has been defined as gauge pressure with a value of 0 δp 0 since this surface is located far away from the stern of the frigate and presents atmospheric pressure however in the outlet 2 since it corresponds to the holes over the flight deck to generate the suction this boundary condition will depend on the suction configurations of the frigate therefore the most appropriate boundary condition for these numerical simulations has been the option of flow ratio so that this value will depend on the different configurations according to the diameter of holes and flow rates in all of them once all conditions have been defined the simulation requires to be initialized from the inlet boundary condition 10 m s the maximal number of iterations to solve the fluid mechanics equations were set to 1000 3 2 cfd results in fig 4 the non dimensional velocity obtained by cfd simulation for the base configuration of the frigate with no suction effect and the more powerful suction case of 35 holes is presented fig 4 a shows the lateral view of the frigate as it was obtained by wind tunnel testing for experimental results but in this case for the entire frigate fig 4 b shows the platform view to visualize the recirculation of the flow with the presence of the superstructure of the frigate there is a big difference between the base frigate and the one with active flow control it can be seen how the dimension of the recirculation bubble blue region is smaller when the suction is applied in addition the suction causes that the vortices of the air wake behind the hangar to occupy a smaller region on the flight deck while their dimension narrows and their intensity is lower compared to the model without suction 4 experimental study 4 1 wind tunnel and particle image velocimetry the experimental study has been performed in the low speed wind tunnel nº1 fig 5 b at inta instituto nacional de técnica aeroespacial located in madrid spain the main features of the wind tunnel are their closed circuit with an elliptical open test section 2 3 m 2 dc 450 kw electric motor at 420 v that allows us reaching velocities up to 60 m s and low turbulence intensity which presents a value up to 0 5 the wind tunnel is composed of a streamlined platform that is streamlined leading and trailing edges to reduce the possible flow perturbations to analyze the flow pattern around the frigate experimentally an advanced technique fig 5 c has been used particle image velocimetry piv this technique is based on measuring the flow velocity from local measurements of small tracer particles which have been seeded previously in the airflow to be subsequently illuminated by a laser plane the generation of these tracer particles with a diameter of 1 μm has been done by using laskin atomizers connected to compressors in addition olive oil has been used as the material for these tracer particles the laser plane is generated with two 190 mj pulsed neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet nd yag lasers both lasers are pulsed with a time interval of 25 μs the capture of these pairs of flow images is done by using a high resolution camera ccd of 2048 2048 pixels nikon nikkor 50 mm 1 1 4d a synchronized system is used to capture the flow images at the same time the laser is pulsed once the pairs of flow images have been taken the commercial software needs to process them to obtain the average displacement between tracer particles of a pair of flow images a total of 100 pairs of flow images have been required for each experimental test the process of flow images is based on a cross correlation function which is implemented by a fast fourier transform fft all flow images are divided into small interrogation windows 32 32 pixels that are overlapped 50 by the nyquist sampling criteria due to the time interval between flow images δt is fixed and average displacement δ x between tracer particles of these flow images is calculated the velocity vector can be easily obtained u all flow images have been taken with a data frequency acquisition of 10 hz moreover a post processing task based on a local mean filtering has been performed to eliminate spurious velocity vectors and consequently fill them with new data the experimental testing in the low speed wind tunnel has consisted in three steps in the first place the base frigate with no suction effect is tested as a reference model for the following configurations with the modified flight deck in the second place the frigate with the different suction configurations over the flight deck has been tested to compare them with the previous model in the last step an optimization of the better configurations obtained in the previous step has been performed according to specific requirements therefore the final goal is to obtain velocity maps over the flight deck of multiple configurations to visualize and analyze the recirculation bubble over it which is the critical factor in helicopter operations and try to reduce their effect as maximum as possible the tested simple frigate sfs2 is presented in fig 5 a suction configurations tested defined in section 2 model are based on modifications over the flight deck mesh of holes with different diameters number of holes location of holes and suction power flow ratios by holes in particular three diameters have been studied 2 5 mm 4 0 mm and 6 0 mm five suction powers q1 q2 q3 q4 and q5 and three configurations of holes 35 holes 25 holes and 20 holes a total of 15 velocity maps have been tested the different cases of suction power tested have been adjusted by the suction system presented in fig 6 it has a venturi tube with a digital manometer thommen hm28 to control the velocity and flow ratio suctioned by the system during the tests the system has an adjustable ball valve that opens the system to the atmosphere to increase or decrease the suction flow ratio producing a by pass effect the suction is achieved by means of vacuum system connected through the lower duct in fig 6 4 2 analysis of experimental results figs 7 and 8 show the piv maps of non dimensional velocity magnitude over the flight deck defined by v v u where v u 2 w 2 and u is the free stream velocity in fig 7 it can be seen the simple frigate model in its base configuration no suction effect associated in fig 8 the suction configurations to remove or try to minimize the recirculation bubble are shown in this study the active flow control over the flight deck of the frigate is a mesh of 35 suction holes defined as in section 2 model fig 1 therefore the characterization of the flow has been conducted by modifying the diameter of these holes and the suction intensity from the flight deck to simplify the nomenclature of results the smallest suction intensity is named q1 obviously corresponds with the lowest flow rate in each of the holes and the largest suction intensity is q5 which is the largest in each of the diameter configurations table 2 shows the values of flow ratios in each of the diameter configurations dimensioned by the maximum suction intensity configuration q5 d6 a total of 15 suction mesh configurations from of the deck have been tested all non dimensional velocity maps in fig 8 show the free stream velocity of 10 m s orange region a region of lower velocity than the free stream velocity green area that corresponds to the frigate air wake and the recirculation bubble of low velocities of near zero velocities blue region the streamlines show the flow pattern of the free stream parallel to the frigate and the flow detachment that is generated due to the superstructure and flight deck in fig 7 the typical flow pattern over the flight deck is shown the nomenclature refers to fs free stream velocity without any perturbation from the frigate lsr low velocity area generated by the aerodynamic interference of the frigate sl 1 and sl 2 first and second shear layer respectively rb 1 recirculation bubble which is placed underneath sl 2 and generated due to the flow detachment on the superstructure and sl 3 and rb 2 third shear layer and recirculation bubble underneath sl 3 due to the end of flight deck in table 3 the centers of each recirculation bubble along with the dimension are presented the center of the recirculation bubble is measured from the center of the flight deck x 0 mm y 0 mm and the bubble dimension by the height and width therefore the selected recirculation bubble parameters have been x center y center height and width the center of the recirculation bubble is obtained with x center and y center defined as the distance from the center of the bubble to x 0 mm and to y 0 mm respectively the height and width have been defined according to the first curving streamline separated from the tangent streamline to the flight deck the height is measured in vertical direction and the width in line with the flight deck all recirculation bubble parameters are identified in fig 8 it can be seen that the dimension of this recirculation bubble both in height and width is notably reduced when the active flow control takes place in comparison with the frigate without suction moreover the center of the recirculation bubble is moved from the center of the flight deck while the suction is applied for all cases a really interesting point is that the dimension of the recirculation bubble is even more reduced as the suction intensity increases for each of the diameter configurations in addition to this in each of these configurations the center of the recirculation bubble is placed farther away from the center of the flight deck in x axis and at the same time this center is moving to the upper part of the superstructure in y axis taking into account these data the active flow control configuration that has proven to be most optimal is the one with the largest diameter d 6 mm and the highest suction intensity q5 in table 3 the non dimensional recirculation bubble parameters are presented for the most critical configurations as a last step it has been decided to study the most optimal suction configuration diameter of 6 mm and highest suction intensity q5 see the values of flow rates of each suction configuration in table 4 by modifying the number and position of holes the nomenclature and design of each resulting suction configuration is shown in fig 9 as the initial suction mesh has 35 holes over the flight deck of the frigate some of holes need to be plugged in order to perform this last experimental test therefore two or three rows of holes are covered in the nomenclature 2 and 3 refers to plugging 2 rows or 3 rows respectively if the covered holes are near the hangar the nomenclature is at otherwise it will be bt see fig 9 the simple frigate with suction configurations based on different number of holes but with same location of them for instance at 2 and at 3 show a similar behavior both configurations present analogous flow patterns the dimension of the recirculation bubble has hardly any variation in both height and width it could therefore be concluded that active flow control by changing the number of holes from 20 to 25 in the same position would not produce an appreciable beneficial effect this conclusion also applies to the other suction configuration bt 2 and bt 3 however comparing the positions of the covered holes it can be seen that when the holes are covered from the part nearest the center of the flight deck bt 2 and bt 3 the suction effect and therefore the improvement is greater in these cases the height and width of the recirculation bubble have been reduced and furthermore the center of the recirculation bubble has moved towards the hangar corner finally the size of the low speed area lsa above the flight deck in each case is measured as a ratio between the low velocity area points with lower non dimensional velocities than 0 3 and the total area above the flight deck the dimension of the low speed area above the flight deck lsa in percentage is obtained for all configurations tested see fig 10 these results validate the previous conclusions obtained from piv visualizations the size of the recirculation bubble in the base configuration is lsa 36 however by applying suction for the most unfavorable case 2 5 mm and q1 it is reduced by 33 lsa 27 it can be seen that in each flow rate condition separately the worst scenario that is the lower decrease of the recirculation bubble is for the smaller diameter 2 5 mm however the diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm in all flow rate conditions present a highly reduction of the recirculation bubble area that although there is a hardly any difference between them the reduction with the previous diameter is much relevant and the analysis must be focused on the largest diameters regarding to the flow rate as it increases the area of the recirculation bubble becomes smaller for the three diameters 2 5 4 and 6 mm taking into account these conclusions better results are presented for the suction configuration with a diameter of 4 mm and q5 where the final area reduction is from 36 to 6 a similar result is obtained for the configuration with a diameter of 6 mm and q5 where the lsa is 7 finally from fig 9 it can be obtained that the better results are obtained for the suction configuration with holes near to the hangar in this case the most optimal suction configuration is bt 3 with a minimum lsa of 3 5 conclusions in this study experimental and numerical simulations over the flight deck of a simple frigate model with active flow control have been performed the experimental study has been conducted in a low speed wind tunnel at inta by using particle image velocimetry piv for measuring the velocity field firstly the velocity field has been obtained for the base configuration of the frigate to analyze the aerodynamic problems due to its bluff geometry that is critical factor for helicopter operations regions of low velocity shear layers and recirculation bubbles appears behind the hangar generating oscillations and low frequency movements that are very dangerous for helicopter maneuvers consequently multiple suction configurations based on a mesh of holes on the flight deck have been tested in order to obtain the most optimal configuration for improving the aerodynamics in helicopter frigate interactions the results have shown that the active flow control by suction from the deck could be an easy way to reduce the low velocity bubble that appears behind the frigate superstructure the cases with 35 holes suctioning from the flight deck reduces the low velocity area from 36 to 6 increasing the effect with the suction intensity the most beneficial suction configuration has resulted to be the mesh with 20 holes placed near the hangar with the maximum diameter of 6 mm and maximum suction intensity q5 in this suction configuration the recirculation bubble size is the smallest lsa 3 and the incident velocities to the rotor of the helicopter could have the lowest gradients in comparison with other configurations credit authorship contribution statement r bardera conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original

20366,with high flexibility and low damping offshore wind turbines owts are prone to external vibrations such as wind wave and earthquake either attacked individually or as combined loading cases this study proposes a semi active variable stiffness tuned mass damper vstmd with magnetorheological elastomer mre materials to mitigate undesired dynamic responses of owt a jacket supported owt with mre tmd installed at the top of the tower is adopted as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design under multiple hazards a semi active frequency tracing algorithm is proposed through which the current dependent stiffness of mre tmd is controlled by tracking the acceleration of owt tower the numerical results demonstrate that the semi active mre tmd can effectively attenuate the dynamic responses of owt under multi hazard loadings and it outperforms the passive tmd in reducing the peak and rms displacements of tower structure robustness analysis of semi active mre tmd is also validated by considering owt sudden loss of partial stiffness under multiple loadings keywords offshore wind turbine vibration control tuned mass damper magnetorheological elastomer 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts are paid increasingly attention as desirable choice of clean energy production in practical various owts are available e g monopiles and gravity foundation type in shallow water depth 0 20 m jacket supported tripods and trusses in transitional water depth 40 60 m and floating structures in deep water 60 120 m hussan et al 2018 with the development of new material owt with large rotor and slender tower can be achieved in the design process for example in a latest nrel 5 mw owt structure rotor diameter is 126 m and the tower height is 87 6 m with the maximum wall thickness of 0 027 m zuo et al 2017 these thin walled structures have high flexibility and low damping ratio e g 1 1 5 martynowicz and szydlo 2013 which are vulnerable to external excitation e g wind and wave loadings in some hostile environments such as seismic prone area katsanos et al 2016 owt may also suffer violent seismic loadings which could cause excessive vibration responses the vibrations in offshore wind turbine would compromise the energy production and lead to structural failure chou and tu 2011 rezaee and aly 2018 during last decades extensive researches have been conducted to mitigate the vibration of owt structures under multiple hazard loadings many devices have been proposed and utilized for this purpose such as tuned liquid dampers tlds ha and cheong 2016 tuned liquid column dampers tlcds hemmati et al 2019 zhang and høeg 2020 tuned mass dampers tmds hussan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 yang and he 2020 zuo et al 2017 2020 frictional dampers minh le et al 2019 and viscoelastic or viscos fluid dampers zhao et al 2019 among these tmd is generally considered as a suitable and feasible method to control owt dynamic responses due to its effectiveness robustness and easy installation in principle tmd is an auxiliary spring damper mass system adhered to the primary wind turbine structure which resonates out of phase with targeted structure and hence a large amount of vibrating energy from the main structure is transferred and dissipated for offshore wind turbines in coastal area combined wind and wave loadings are assumed as the major external excitations the energies of wind wave loadings are concentrated in a low frequency range e g below 0 1 hz for wind and less than 0 2 hz for wave sarkar and fitzgerald 2020 which normally excites the first vibration mode of owt tower e g 0 31 hz in jacket type hussan et al 2018 0 27 hz in monopile type jahangiri and sun 2019 sun 2018 sun and jahangiri 2018 in this case it is reasonable to utilize one tmd device in the owt nacelle and the tmd s design parameters normally target the fundamental frequency of owt some related researches have been conducted lian et al 2018 yang et al 2019 and the vibration mitigation effects were confirmed however earthquake is another vibration excitation to be considered as the coastal areas where the owts are usually placed are also seismic prone regions it is known that seismic energy has a broader frequency range with dominant energy in the range of 0 7 hz 3 0 hz hussan et al 2018 which may excite high vibration modes of owt structure e g 1 19 hz in 2nd frequency of jacket supported owt hussan et al 2018 consequently for the worst scenarios e g under actions of wind wave and earthquake the first two vibration frequencies of owt may be simultaneously excited in this case one tmd device designed for the fundamental frequency of owt in wave wind loadings may be not be effective therefore a multiple tmds mtmd design was proposed in which each tmd was set to deal with one single vibration frequency zuo et al 2017 developed a series of mtmd along the owt tower their results showed that mtmd system could reduce dynamic responses in different vibration modes hussan et al 2018 proposed two tmds at the top and bottom of the tower respectively to mitigate vibration modes of one jacket supported owt in combined wind wave and seismic excitations however mtmd system would induce large installation and maintain costs nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 in addition these passive tmd and mtmd are very sensitive to tuning frequency ratio even when optimally designed rezaee and aly 2018 it is proved that a difference of 1 5 in frequency match to the primary structure leads to 70 deterioration in the vibration mitigation effect wang et al 2020 compared with passive devices semi active tmd possessing variable stiffness provides a solution to vibration control of owt since the variable stiffness semi active tmd is able to trace the varying excited frequency of owt in real time under multi hazards loadings in particular as there is only one single semi active tmd required the implementation costs could be substantially reduced in comparison with mtmd nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 dinh et al 2016 conducted an analysis of semi active tmd for vibration control of spar type offshore wind turbines its effectiveness was evaluated and validated under time varying mooring cable tension rotor speed and the blade stiffness of owt structure hemmati and oterkus 2018 proposed a semi active tmd for structural control of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and the numerical results demonstrated the proposed semi active tmd could mitigate the time variant vibration responses under different wind wave and seismic excitations sun 2018 developed a semi active tmd with variable stiffness to control monopile owt subjected to multi hazards e g wind wave and earthquake considering damage effects retuned real time semi active tmd still presented consistent effectiveness when the dominant frequency of owt was changeable the main contribution of the present work is to propose a variable stiffness tmd in the semi active vibration control of an offshore wind turbine under multiple hazards loadings using smart materials magnetorheological elastomer mre a smart elastomeric composite can adjust its elastic modulus or stiffness by altering external magnetic field and then immediately revert to its initial status when the field is removed recent studies demonstrate that mre is a potential candidate to semi active variable stiffness tmd gao et al 2019 kumbhar et al 2018 leng et al 2021 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017 although the potential of mre base structure for vibration control has been presented kandasamy et al 2016 the application of mre base device in ocean engineering has not been reported to this end a jacket supported offshore wind turbine is adopted as a case study multiple degree of freedom dof modelling of owt is established by the dynamic finite element method for semi active control a real time frequency trace algorithm is proposed the vibration control effectiveness is comprehensively evaluated and validated and the robustness of the control algorithm is also discussed the structure of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the structural model of offshore wind turbine excited by multiple hazard loadings design and working principles of variable stiffness mre tmd for vibration control of owt are proposed in section 3 numerical simulation results of vibration mitigation of owt mre tmd system are discussed in section 4 and its semi active robustness is also evaluated main conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 structural model 2 1 nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine jacket supported owt is a commonly structure to enable large scale implementation of offshore wind farms in transitional water depth in the range of 40 m 60 m hussan et al 2018 in the present work the studied case is nrel 5 mw jacket supported offshore wind turbine vorpahl et al 2011 jonkman et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 this owt structure is divided into five parts nacelle and blades tower transition piece tp and jacket base structure the length of each blade is 61 5 m and the rotor radius is 63 m the hub height is 90 55 m above mean sea level msl and the hub vertical offset is 2 4 m the conical tower has a total length of 68 m the tp is a rigid concrete block with a mass of 666 tons located at the top of the jacket and the bottom of the tp is at 16 15 m the height of the concrete transition piece is 4 m which sets the interface level at 20 15 m the structural parameters vorpahl et al 2011 of the jacket supported offshore wind turbine are listed in table 1 damping ratio is adopted as 1 excluding aerodynamic damping 2 2 numerical model and validation to investigate the dynamic responses of wind turbine a finite element model of nrel 5 mw jacket supported owt is established as shown in fig 2 the wind and wave loadings are calculated and applied to tower and jacket nodes as nodal force and moments and seismic loading is applied by inertia effect of individual element the established jacket is made of 4 central piles 4 levels of x braces mud braces four legs and a transition piece tp the tower is cone bucket structure and its material properties are listed in table 2 the rotor nacelle assembly rna is considered as lumped mass at the top of the tower hussan et al 2018 fig 2 and the influence of the geometries of the nacelle and blades is not considered such simplification is reasonable as the rotation of the blades mainly affected the blades themselves and has less effect on the owt main structure e g tower and jacket supported structure zuo et al 2017 please note that the scope of this paper limits at the parked condition of owt in which the dominant wind loading is the wind applied on owt tower and nacelle not blades assembles rezaee and aly 2018 the tp is assumed as a rectangular rigid body vorpahl et al 2011 in addition soil structure interaction ssi is not considered and six times of pipe diameter is applied at ground level to simulate the soil structural boundary condition this might slightly change the optimal frequency and damping parameter of designed tmd yet the effectiveness evaluation of vibration mitigation in owt tmd system is not compromised hussan et al 2018 fig 3 illustrates the mode shapes of owt structure and its natural frequencies are calculated in table 3 in the first two vibration modes offshore wind turbine vibrates orthogonally in side side and fore aft directions the obtained natural frequency of finite element model has been assimilated with the original reference model vorpahl et al 2011 due to the finite model has high number of dofs the simulation is rather complex so the model has to be simplified wu et al 2011 in this paper only the upwind direction fore aft direction is considered we can extract the mass and stiffness matrices m and k of owt model using the condensation method 2 3 multiple hazard loadings 2 3 1 wind load wind loading is consisted of a constant mean wind and a fluctuating component the wind velocity is expressed as follows 1 v z t v z v z t where v z is the average wind velocity at height z and v z t is the fluctuating wind velocity at height z in practical the wind velocity at a specific height should be firstly selected as a reference point e g the height of nacelle is chosen as the reference and the wind speed at different height v z is obtained according to the wind speed relationship as shown in eq 2 veritas 2004 2 v z v r e f z z r e f α where v r e f is the mean wind velocity at height z r e f v z is the mean wind velocity in any height z z r e f is the reference height and it is 90 55 m in the present work α is surface roughness coefficient taken as 0 12 in this study the davenport spectrum bisht and jain 1998 is utilized to model the power spectral density psd function of the fluctuating wind velocity expressed as follows 3 s v n 4 k v 10 x 2 n 1 x 2 4 3 in which s v n is wind power spectral density function n is fluctuating frequency x 1200 n v 10 v 10 is the mean wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface k is the roughness length the spatial correlation effect is used to capture the common features of the wind loads along the wind turbine tower in the present work this effect is described by a spatial coherency function c o h ω zuo et al 2017 2019 4 c o h ω exp ω c z 2 z i z j 2 2 π v ˆ in which ω is the circular frequency of wind velocity c z is the dimensionless attenuation coefficient v ˆ is the average mean wind velocity between i th point and j th

in which s i i ω and s j j ω represent the power spectrum of the fluctuating wind at location i and j respectively s i j ω represents the power spectrum between points i and j fast fourier transform fft is introduced here based on the harmonic superposition method to simulate the stochastic process of fluctuating wind velocity the periodic spectral density function matrix is 6 s ω s 11 ω s 1 n ω

ω ω n ω k n ω k is the starting point of frequency ω n is the end point of frequency n is the sampling point of frequency in this paper the calculated frequency range is 0 10 hz the sampling point of frequency n is 6000 the total wind loading acted on the offshore wind turbine is composed of a mean and a fluctuating component as murtagh et al 2005 9 f i t f i f i in which the mean nodal wind load f i is expressed as 10 f i 0 5 c d a ρ a v i 2 and the fluctuating nodal wind load f i is 11 f i c d a ρ a v i v i where the c d is the coefficient of drag ρ a is the density of air a is the windward area of the tower v i and v i is the mean and fluctuating wind velocity of point i respectively in this paper the roughness length parameter drag coefficient air density are 0 005 1 2 and 1 225 kg m3 and the mean wind velocity at hub height is 42 73 m s in parked wind turbine fig 4 a shows the wind velocity psds and the corresponding model values the model and simulated coherency loss function between tower top and base is shown in fig 4 b it is observed that the model and simulated values are matched well fig 5 shows the time history of total wind loading applied on the top and base of the owt tower 2 3 2 wave load sea wave is a typical random process and the energy distribution of the constituent waves can be described by wave spectrum the commonly used wave spectrum includes frequency

owt under seismic loading several typical earthquakes are utilized such as kobe taft el centro ns hachionhe etc in present work two types of seismic loading are utilized such as far fault earthquake ei centro 1940 featuring wider frequency range and last longer excitation time and near fault earthquake waveforms kobe 1995 containing large velocity pulses with lower frequency gu et al 2020 fig 8 represents the time history of acceleration and frequency response spectra 3 variable stiffness tmd the semi active variable stiffness tuned mass damper vstmd was initially proposed by nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 the vstmd has a single mass with variable stiffness spring and a damping component which has the distinct capacity of continuously retuning its frequency in real time fig 9 schematically shows the varied stiffness range of vstmd 3 1 variable stiffness mre tmd in the present work a multiple layer mre tmd is utilized for semi active vibration control of owt as shown in fig 10 it is consisted of an mre isolator connected to a mass block an enclosed magnetic path is formed composed of steel plates mre and coil components as shown in the red arrow the lateral stiffness of the device can be adjusted to be more than 10 times higher when sufficient magnetic field is provided to energize the mre materials in the device the magnetic field is generated by an electromagnetic coil with input current an mre isolator fabricated by gu et al 2016 is utilized in the present work the current dependent hysteresis performance of the mre isolator is shown in fig 11 a with the variation of the applied current the stiffness of mre device the slope of force displacement is changeable which provides the possibility for variable stiffness tmd the current dependent behaviors of mre based can be expressed by a nonlinear dynamic model as shown in fig 11 b in this model the current dependent properties can be expressed by the following equations gu et al 2016 21 k 0 i a 1 i a 0 22 c 0 i b 2 i 2 b 1 i b 0 23 α i c 2 i 2 c 1 i c 0 where k 0 i and c 0 i denotes the spring stiffness and damping viscosity coefficients and α i is a nonlinear parameter which is used to adjust the shape and scale of the hysteresis loops by experimental results these parameters are identified and the values of current dependent coefficients a 0 a 1 b 0 b 1 b 2 c 0 c 1 c 2 are obtained gu et al 2016 under multi hazard loadings the first two vibration modes of owt structure are likely to be excited thus the corresponding natural frequency range of these two modes are the targeted vibration suppression for mre tmd system referred to wang s work wang et al 2019 the optimal frequency ratio is set as λ o p t 1 0 5 μ 1 2 1 μ where μ is the mass ratio between mre tmd system and owt structure consequently the resonance frequency range of mre tmd system is targeted as λ o p t f 1 λ o p t f 2 where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the first and second natural frequency of offshore wind turbine structure as shown in section 2 2 the desired real time stiffness of mre tmd system k t m d is calculated by the desired frequency of mre tmd system f i and f i λ o p t f 1 λ o p t f 2 it is known that the mass ratio between tmd device and owt structure is normally designed to be from 1 to 8 hussan et al 2017 for optimal vibration mitigation effectiveness the mass ratio of mre tmd by owt structure is adopted as 5 in this paper following the above design principle and the first two natural frequencies in table 3 the mass stiffness and damping values of mre tmd can calculated by eq 24 as follows 24 m t m d μ m s k t m d 4 π 2 f i 2 m t m d c t m d 4 π ζ f i m t m d in which m s is the total mass of the owt structure m s 2817 tons and where μ is the mass ratio by mre tmd system and owt structure μ 5 f i is the desired frequency of mre tmd according to eq 24 the stiffness range of mre tmd system in theory can be calculated and listed in table 4 3 2 semi active frequency tracing control algorithm dynamic equation of the offshore wind turbine with mre tmd system under multi hazard loadings is shown in eq 25 25 m x c x k x b f t d f m r e t m d where x x x are the unknown displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively m c k are mass damping and stiffness matrices of the owt structure with order p the degrees of freedom of the owt structure the damping matrix c α m β k is obtained using reyleigh s damping ratio in vibration modes f t is the external loads matrix and f m r e t m d is the force vector which represents the control force generated by mre tmd system can be calculated by eq 26 b and d matrices are their location vectors the mass and stiffness matrices of owt model m and k are extracted by the finite element model mentioned in section 2 2 26 f m r e t m d i t k 0 i δ x t c 0 i δ x t α i δ x t 3 where δ x t δ x t are the relative displacement and velocity between mre tmd and tower top k 0 i c 0 i and α i are from eq 21 23 by numerically solving eq 25 the semi active control algorithm in short time fourier transform stft can be conducted in matlab and the dynamic responses of owt are obtained in practical high acceleration of the tower top can induce mechanical malfunctioning of acceleration sensitive parts in the nacelle e g gear box and generator hence the acceleration in tower top is chosen as tracing index short time fourier transform stft algorithm is adopted as the real time control algorithm to identify the time frequency characteristics of non stationary signals taking the acceleration signal x τ of tower top as the objective its weighted signal x ˆ τ can be constructed by multiplying a window function h τ t 27 x ˆ τ x τ h τ t in which x ˆ τ is a weighted signal t is the fixed time and τ is the running time applying fourier transformation to the weighted signal the spectrum x t ω can be obtained 28 x t ω 1 2 π e j ω t x ˆ 1 2 π e j ω t x τ h τ t the power spectral density p t ω at time t is as follows 29 p t ω x t ω 2 x t ω x t ω at the fixed time t i the dominant frequency ω i d is calculated by eq 29 and eq 30 30 ω i ω p t i ω max p t i ω 31 ω i d k max 1 i m 1 i ω i t k max p t k ω k max 1 i m 1 i max p t k ω where ω i is the instantaneous frequency and ω i d is the dominant frequency at t i calculated through averaging the values of the instantaneous frequencies over m time steps in this paper m 3 the flow chart of real time tuning strategy is shown in fig 12 the acceleration response of tower top is measured and its frequency is identified by stft the targeted natural frequency of mre tmd device is then determined and the stiffness of mre tmd to trace the real time acceleration response frequency is obtained using eq 21 23 the desirable control current can be obtained 4 results and discussions 4 1 model verification with mre tmd system sweep acceleration signal is utilized to verify the effectiveness of mre tmd device in the structure over a wide frequency range the frequency chosen is between 0 01 and 10 hz and a maximum peak ground acceleration pga 1 012 g is reached in 200 s with an equal spacing of 0 01 s fig 13 shows the amplitude of the accelerations in the top and base of the tower under uncontrolled passive and semi active control variable stiffness mre tmd system it is noted that passive system used in this paper refers to a system with mre tmd at zero current for comparison we use the term of passive tmd throughout the paper as shown in fig 13 the owt structure is excited at the first two fundamental natural frequencies under sweep frequency loading in terms of vibration mitigation passive tmd performs effective only at the first mode however semi active mre tmd can track the acceleration response frequency with variable stiffness and both first and second vibration modes can be effectively mitigated in addition the natural vibration frequency of owt mre tmd is reduced compared with that of uncontrolled owt this is because the mass block of tmd increase the total mass of the wind turbine leading to lower natural frequency the detailed comparison of acceleration amplitude reduction is listed in table 5 for the tower top the maximum amplitude are 13 97 db and 4 13 db for the first mode and second mode and they are reduced by 74 73 3 53 db and 0 24 4 12 db by passive tmd while with semi active mre tmd such two indexes are mitigated by 81 1 2 64 db and 62 23 1 56 db which demonstrates that semi active mre tmd outperforms the passive tmd such phenomenon can be also found by the comparison of the maximum amplitude of tower base it can be seen that semi active mre tmd performs effectively not only for the first mode but for the second mode of the owt structure 4 2 wind turbine under multi hazard loadings to examine the effectiveness of the mre tmd device we considered two excitation conditions firstly the combined wind and wave loadings are applied to the owt structure and these two excitations are in a period of 600s secondly a multiple hazard loading by wind wave and seismic loadings are considered with two seismic excitations e g the el centro excitation starts at 20s and ends at 73 8s and kobe starts at 30s and ends at 79 98s 4 2 1 combined wind and wave loadings fig 14 shows the time histories of the displacement at the owt tower top and base under uncontrolled passive control and semi active control the peak displacements of uncontrolled tower top and base are 0 9455 m and 0 1981 m respectively and these responses reduced up to 59 24 and 57 29 by the variable stiffness mre tmd it is shown that the mre tmd can significantly reduce the response to evaluate the effectiveness of the variable stiffness control the displacement responses of wind turbine tower with passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are listed in table 6 results confirm that compared with passive tmd semi active tmd with variable stiffness exhibits better performance in attenuating excessive vibration in different locations of tower structure the reduction by mre tmd for tower top is much obvious than that of tower base this is reasonable because the combined wind and wave loadings excite the first fundamental vibration mode in which the maximum displacement occurred at tower top when the semi active mre tmd is applied the reductions on rms and peak value of the displacement at tower top are 67 28 and 59 24 and they are 49 49 and 57 29 at tower base fig 15 presents the single sided spectrum of displacement amplitude and power spectrum density psd of displacement at tower top excessive vibration is diminished in the excited resonance part near fundamental natural frequency under combined wind and wave loadings especially by variable stiffness mre tmd although wind and wave loadings are low frequency excitations they are typical random excitations to induce the forced vibration of wind turbine structure hence variable stiffness mre tmd performs better than the passive one as shown in fig 15 the response spectrums of the passive and semi active systems have two distinct peaks caused by the added dof of the mre tmd rana and soong 1998 and the reductions on peak of displacement amplitude spectrum and displacement psd by variable stiffness mre tmd are 44 78 and 69 09 compared with passive device additionally it should be noted that due to the large mass of mre tmd the natural frequency of coupled owt mre tmd model is quite different from the uncontrolled owt structure additionally the stroke is an important index for the vibration device in wind turbine nacelle due to the limitation space the stroke of passive tmd and mre tmd under wind and wave excitation are shown in fig 16 it is desirable to obtain less stroke for reducing mis functionality of control system compared with passive tmd the peak stroke of mre tmd is reduced by 34 5 and rms stroke is decreased by 40 2 it is demonstrated that the use of semi active mre tmd can obtain stronger energy absorption ability with less stroke 4 2 2 combined wind wave and seismic loadings fig 17 shows the dynamic responses at tower top with passive tmd and mre tmd under different earthquakes at the beginning of earthquake event t 20 s in el centro and t 30 s in kobe the acceleration is obviously enlarged due to the low damping ratio of owt commonly less than or equal to 0 5 the effect of seismic responses remains for about 130 s after the removal of the earthquake loading el centro ends at 73 8s and kobe ends at 79 98s the same performance is also observed in fitzgerald et al s work fitzgerald and basu 2017 where the excessive responses by earthquake excitations remained dozens of seconds in contrary to the owt with passive tmd the margin of acceleration responses by controllable mre tmd decay instantly which shortens the time to normal responses after earthquake by utilizing controlled mre tmd the peak acceleration of tower top is reduced by 15 41 and 23 45 under kobe and el centro respectively the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement of the turbine tower nodes are compared in fig 18 it is shown that the lateral displacement distributes increasingly along the tower heights and variable stiffness mre tmd obviously reduces the maximum displacement the inter storey drift decreases in the tower structure which is reasonable for the control effect of lateral displacement reduction gained using semi active mre tmd especially for the inter storey drift from 3rd to 5th node along the tower the peak displacement reductions are up to 20 1 53 65 and 60 05 under el centro earthquake and 14 97 31 48 and 57 4 under kobe earthquake a comparison is presented in table 7 for displacement and acceleration obtained from the controlled owt under different strategies the reductions in rms on displacement and acceleration at tower top and base for passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are shown based on the computed rms value when mre tmd is applied it is observed that the rms displacement reductions on the tower top are 72 5 and 70 61 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with 54 79 and 46 78 controlled by passive tmd the rms displacement reductions on the tower base are 49 16 and 43 84 under semi active control compared with 44 57 and 19 65 under passive control and the reductions of rms acceleration at tower top and base are 99 96 and 10 67 under el centro and 99 97 and 34 02 under kobe by using semi active mre tmd compared with 53 97 and 4 56 under el centro and 21 04 and 2 09 under kobe by using passive tmd it is concluded that the frequency tracing algorithm performs better than passive one the reason is that the passive tmd aimed at mitigation loading in a constant frequency near the first vibration mode however in the combined seismic loadings with wind and wave loadings the second vibration mode of turbine structure is excited which is reflected by the following acceleration spectrum analysis and thus the tunable stiffness is superior additionally as shown in fig 19 applying semi active mre tmd has largely reduced the stroke of tmd system as 70 18 and 74 32 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with a passive tmd fig 20 shows acceleration amplitudes of the tower top and base and the obtained value of acceleration amplitudes are listed in table 8 according to fig 20 a and b the second mode of tower top acceleration response is excited the energy at the first vibration mode is significantly reduced and the reductions on passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are 81 31 and 91 61 under el centro respectively and 70 11 and 86 96 under kobe for the second vibration mode the reductions on semi active mre tmd control are up to 45 53 and 70 41 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with 2 62 and 0 26 by passive tmd fig 20 c and d are the acceleration amplitude of the tower base where the maximum amplitude of the second mode shape occurs the energy at the second vibration frequency mitigations under passive control and semi active control are 5 1 and 10 27 for el centro earthquake 2 85 and 56 98 for kobe earthquake the results demonstrate that the proposed semi active mre tmd control strategy in present study can not only control the first mode response but also can obviously suppress the second mode of vibrations the reasons can be explained with two aspects firstly mre tmd s stiffness is tunable i e mre tmd installed in the nacelle can tune its frequency as same as the second frequency of owt mode that is a certain reduction effect on the second vibration mode is shown the similar effectiveness of semi active mre tmd at the top for higher vibration mode of owt system is also presented in yang s work yang et al 2020 secondly although the maximum amplitude of the second mode is on the tower base in modal analysis yet under the environmental loads e g wind wave and seismic excitations the maximum response locates at the tower top nacelle as shown in fig 18 similar conclusions are shown in other work e g zuo et al 2017 hussan et al 2018 hence the proposed mre tmd installed in tower top could also reduce the dynamic responses of owt structure when the second vibration mode is excited additionally it should be noted that due to the different characteristics of the seismic excitations gu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the mre tmd is more feasible for near fault kobe than el centro earthquake 4 3 robustness control under the multi hazard loadings damage might occur to the foundation and the tower hence the robustness control of the controlled mre tmd system for owt considering damage is necessary in this work damage is considered through degrading the stiffness of the tower structure and kobe earthquake starts at 100s in all damage cases three damage cases are considered dc1 damage starts at 50s before kobe earthquake dc2 damage starts at 120s during earthquake dc3 damage starts at 180s after earthquake all cases compared with no damage nd condition a stiffness reduction of 5 hemmati and oterkus 2018 is introduced to represent the damage using frequency tracing stft algorithm the frequency of semi active mre tmd can be retuned in real time to match the varied dominant frequency of owt structure due to stiffness decay while the key parameters of passive tmd remain unchanged figs 21 23 show the displacement time histories and spectrum amplitudes of passive and semi active control under different damage cases table 9 compares the rms displacement at tower top for different damage cases and the reduction ratios by comparing semi active mre tmd to passive tmd are also calculated in table 9 when damage happens at 50s it is found that the displacement of passive tmd at tower top is significantly increased by 33 97 compared with nd case which indicates the passive tmd loses its effectiveness to the contrary the displacement controlled by the semi active mre tmd remains a low level regardless of the damage and stiffness variation of owt structure and the rms displacement by semi active mre tmd is reduced to 30 16 compared with nd case as shown in fig 21 the displacement spectrum amplitude of owt with stiffness decay effect is also mitigated to a low level when the semi active mre tmd is utilized under dc2 the displacement results are shown in fig 22 and table 9 it is seen that the tower top displacement of passive tmd increased up to 36 68 compared to nd case while the displacement amplitude remarkably reduced to a minimal level under semi active mre tmd similar conclusions can be drawn under dc3 in fig 23 and table 9 the displacement increase of passive tmd is 17 88 and the peak value is still effectively mitigated when semi active mre tmd is applied therefore the mre tmd have better robustness on multi mode vibration control and can effectively mitigate the displacement even under damage condition which will prolong its fatigue life and reduce the potential maintenance cost 5 conclusions this research focused on the vibration mitigation control of offshore wind turbine under combined wind wave and seismic loadings using mre tmd the design principle of proposed mre tmd is firstly presented using semi active frequency tracing algorithm the stiffness of mre can be tuned and the frequency of mre tmd is varied to the objective frequency of excited owt structure the feasibility of the proposed method has been evaluated and verified by numerical simulations some main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 semi active mre tmd is suitable for multi mode vibration control whereas passive tmd is mainly efficient for suppressing first mode vibration 2 under combined wind and wave loadings the controlled mre tmd can significantly reduce the peak displacement of owt tower top and base by 59 24 and 57 29 respectively compared with passive tmd semi active mre tmd with variable stiffness exhibits better performance to attenuate excessive vibration in different locations of tower structure in detail the reductions on peak of displacement amplitude spectrum and displacement psd by variable stiffness mre tmd are 44 78 and 69 09 of the passive tmd 3 under coupled wind wave and earthquake loadings the margin of acceleration responses of owt tower top by controlled mre tmd decay instantly which shortens the time to normal responses after earthquake compared with passive tmd rms displacement and acceleration responses are substantially decreased by semi active tmd in addition the semi active mre tmd achieves a smaller stroke than passive tmd which shows great advantage in practical application 4 under stiffness damage cases mre tmd consistently shows effective control on the dynamic responses of owt and presents strong robustness which may be helpful to prolong the structure fatigue life and reduce the maintenance cost credit authorship contribution statement dingxin leng writing original draft investigation editing validation yi yang writing reviewing

20366,with high flexibility and low damping offshore wind turbines owts are prone to external vibrations such as wind wave and earthquake either attacked individually or as combined loading cases this study proposes a semi active variable stiffness tuned mass damper vstmd with magnetorheological elastomer mre materials to mitigate undesired dynamic responses of owt a jacket supported owt with mre tmd installed at the top of the tower is adopted as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design under multiple hazards a semi active frequency tracing algorithm is proposed through which the current dependent stiffness of mre tmd is controlled by tracking the acceleration of owt tower the numerical results demonstrate that the semi active mre tmd can effectively attenuate the dynamic responses of owt under multi hazard loadings and it outperforms the passive tmd in reducing the peak and rms displacements of tower structure robustness analysis of semi active mre tmd is also validated by considering owt sudden loss of partial stiffness under multiple loadings keywords offshore wind turbine vibration control tuned mass damper magnetorheological elastomer 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts are paid increasingly attention as desirable choice of clean energy production in practical various owts are available e g monopiles and gravity foundation type in shallow water depth 0 20 m jacket supported tripods and trusses in transitional water depth 40 60 m and floating structures in deep water 60 120 m hussan et al 2018 with the development of new material owt with large rotor and slender tower can be achieved in the design process for example in a latest nrel 5 mw owt structure rotor diameter is 126 m and the tower height is 87 6 m with the maximum wall thickness of 0 027 m zuo et al 2017 these thin walled structures have high flexibility and low damping ratio e g 1 1 5 martynowicz and szydlo 2013 which are vulnerable to external excitation e g wind and wave loadings in some hostile environments such as seismic prone area katsanos et al 2016 owt may also suffer violent seismic loadings which could cause excessive vibration responses the vibrations in offshore wind turbine would compromise the energy production and lead to structural failure chou and tu 2011 rezaee and aly 2018 during last decades extensive researches have been conducted to mitigate the vibration of owt structures under multiple hazard loadings many devices have been proposed and utilized for this purpose such as tuned liquid dampers tlds ha and cheong 2016 tuned liquid column dampers tlcds hemmati et al 2019 zhang and høeg 2020 tuned mass dampers tmds hussan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 yang and he 2020 zuo et al 2017 2020 frictional dampers minh le et al 2019 and viscoelastic or viscos fluid dampers zhao et al 2019 among these tmd is generally considered as a suitable and feasible method to control owt dynamic responses due to its effectiveness robustness and easy installation in principle tmd is an auxiliary spring damper mass system adhered to the primary wind turbine structure which resonates out of phase with targeted structure and hence a large amount of vibrating energy from the main structure is transferred and dissipated for offshore wind turbines in coastal area combined wind and wave loadings are assumed as the major external excitations the energies of wind wave loadings are concentrated in a low frequency range e g below 0 1 hz for wind and less than 0 2 hz for wave sarkar and fitzgerald 2020 which normally excites the first vibration mode of owt tower e g 0 31 hz in jacket type hussan et al 2018 0 27 hz in monopile type jahangiri and sun 2019 sun 2018 sun and jahangiri 2018 in this case it is reasonable to utilize one tmd device in the owt nacelle and the tmd s design parameters normally target the fundamental frequency of owt some related researches have been conducted lian et al 2018 yang et al 2019 and the vibration mitigation effects were confirmed however earthquake is another vibration excitation to be considered as the coastal areas where the owts are usually placed are also seismic prone regions it is known that seismic energy has a broader frequency range with dominant energy in the range of 0 7 hz 3 0 hz hussan et al 2018 which may excite high vibration modes of owt structure e g 1 19 hz in 2nd frequency of jacket supported owt hussan et al 2018 consequently for the worst scenarios e g under actions of wind wave and earthquake the first two vibration frequencies of owt may be simultaneously excited in this case one tmd device designed for the fundamental frequency of owt in wave wind loadings may be not be effective therefore a multiple tmds mtmd design was proposed in which each tmd was set to deal with one single vibration frequency zuo et al 2017 developed a series of mtmd along the owt tower their results showed that mtmd system could reduce dynamic responses in different vibration modes hussan et al 2018 proposed two tmds at the top and bottom of the tower respectively to mitigate vibration modes of one jacket supported owt in combined wind wave and seismic excitations however mtmd system would induce large installation and maintain costs nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 in addition these passive tmd and mtmd are very sensitive to tuning frequency ratio even when optimally designed rezaee and aly 2018 it is proved that a difference of 1 5 in frequency match to the primary structure leads to 70 deterioration in the vibration mitigation effect wang et al 2020 compared with passive devices semi active tmd possessing variable stiffness provides a solution to vibration control of owt since the variable stiffness semi active tmd is able to trace the varying excited frequency of owt in real time under multi hazards loadings in particular as there is only one single semi active tmd required the implementation costs could be substantially reduced in comparison with mtmd nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 dinh et al 2016 conducted an analysis of semi active tmd for vibration control of spar type offshore wind turbines its effectiveness was evaluated and validated under time varying mooring cable tension rotor speed and the blade stiffness of owt structure hemmati and oterkus 2018 proposed a semi active tmd for structural control of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and the numerical results demonstrated the proposed semi active tmd could mitigate the time variant vibration responses under different wind wave and seismic excitations sun 2018 developed a semi active tmd with variable stiffness to control monopile owt subjected to multi hazards e g wind wave and earthquake considering damage effects retuned real time semi active tmd still presented consistent effectiveness when the dominant frequency of owt was changeable the main contribution of the present work is to propose a variable stiffness tmd in the semi active vibration control of an offshore wind turbine under multiple hazards loadings using smart materials magnetorheological elastomer mre a smart elastomeric composite can adjust its elastic modulus or stiffness by altering external magnetic field and then immediately revert to its initial status when the field is removed recent studies demonstrate that mre is a potential candidate to semi active variable stiffness tmd gao et al 2019 kumbhar et al 2018 leng et al 2021 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017 although the potential of mre base structure for vibration control has been presented kandasamy et al 2016 the application of mre base device in ocean engineering has not been reported to this end a jacket supported offshore wind turbine is adopted as a case study multiple degree of freedom dof modelling of owt is established by the dynamic finite element method for semi active control a real time frequency trace algorithm is proposed the vibration control effectiveness is comprehensively evaluated and validated and the robustness of the control algorithm is also discussed the structure of this paper is organized as

bucket structure and its material properties are listed in table 2 the rotor nacelle assembly rna is considered as lumped mass at the top of the tower hussan et al 2018 fig 2 and the influence of the geometries of the nacelle and blades is not considered such simplification is reasonable as the rotation of the blades mainly affected the blades themselves and has less effect on the owt main structure e g tower and jacket supported structure zuo et al 2017 please note that the scope of this paper limits at the parked condition of owt in which the dominant wind loading is the wind applied on owt tower and nacelle not blades assembles rezaee and aly 2018 the tp is assumed as a rectangular rigid body vorpahl et al 2011 in addition soil structure interaction ssi is not considered and six times of pipe diameter is applied at ground level to simulate the soil structural boundary condition this might slightly change the optimal frequency and damping parameter of designed tmd yet the effectiveness evaluation of vibration mitigation in owt tmd system is not compromised hussan et al 2018 fig 3 illustrates the mode shapes of owt structure and its natural frequencies are calculated in table 3 in the first two vibration modes offshore wind turbine vibrates orthogonally in side side and fore aft directions the obtained natural frequency of finite element model has been assimilated with the original reference model vorpahl et al 2011 due to the finite model has high number of dofs the simulation is rather complex so the model has to be simplified wu et al 2011 in this paper only the upwind direction fore aft direction is considered we can extract the mass and stiffness matrices m and k of owt model using the condensation method 2 3 multiple hazard loadings 2 3 1 wind load wind loading is consisted of a constant mean wind and a fluctuating component the wind velocity is expressed as follows 1 v z t v z v z t where v z is the average wind velocity at height z and v z t is the fluctuating wind velocity at height z in practical the wind velocity at a specific height should be firstly selected as a reference point e g the height of nacelle is chosen as the reference

structure at the mean sea level msl is shown in fig 7 2 3 3 seismic loadings in earthquake prone areas seismic loading may be a major environmental load for offshore wind turbine in previous work on owt under seismic loading several typical earthquakes are utilized such as kobe taft el centro ns hachionhe etc in present work two types of seismic loading are utilized such as far fault earthquake ei centro 1940 featuring wider frequency range and last longer excitation time and near fault earthquake waveforms kobe 1995 containing large velocity pulses with lower frequency gu et al 2020 fig 8 represents the time history of acceleration and frequency response spectra 3 variable stiffness tmd the semi active variable stiffness tuned mass damper vstmd was initially proposed by nagarajaiah and varadarajan 2005 the vstmd has a single mass with variable stiffness spring and a damping component which has the distinct capacity of continuously retuning its frequency in real time fig 9 schematically shows the varied stiffness range of vstmd 3 1 variable stiffness mre tmd in the present work a multiple layer mre tmd is utilized for semi active vibration control of owt as shown in fig 10 it is consisted of an mre isolator connected to a mass block an enclosed magnetic path is formed composed of steel plates mre and coil components as shown in the red arrow the lateral stiffness of the device can be adjusted to be more than 10 times higher when sufficient magnetic field is provided to energize the mre materials in the device the magnetic field is generated by an electromagnetic coil with input current an mre isolator fabricated by gu et al 2016 is utilized in the present work the current dependent hysteresis performance of the mre isolator is shown in fig 11 a with the variation of the applied current the stiffness of mre device the slope of force displacement is changeable which provides the possibility for variable stiffness tmd the current dependent behaviors of mre based can be expressed by a nonlinear dynamic model as shown in fig 11 b in this model the current dependent properties can be expressed by the following equations gu et al 2016 21 k 0 i a 1 i a 0 22 c 0 i b 2 i 2 b 1 i b 0 23 α i c 2 i 2 c 1 i c 0 where k 0 i and c 0 i denotes the spring stiffness and damping viscosity coefficients and α i is a nonlinear parameter which is used to adjust the shape and scale of the hysteresis loops by experimental results these parameters are identified and the values of current dependent coefficients a 0 a 1 b 0 b 1 b 2 c 0 c 1 c 2 are obtained gu et al 2016 under multi hazard loadings the first two vibration modes of owt structure are likely to be excited thus the corresponding natural frequency range of these two modes are the targeted vibration suppression for mre tmd system referred to wang s work wang et al 2019 the optimal frequency ratio is set as λ o p t 1 0 5 μ 1 2 1 μ where μ is the mass ratio between mre tmd system and owt structure consequently the resonance frequency range of mre tmd system is targeted as λ o p t f 1 λ o p t f 2 where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the first and second natural frequency of offshore wind turbine structure as shown in section 2 2 the desired real time stiffness of mre tmd system k t m d is calculated by the desired frequency of mre tmd system f i and f i λ o p t f 1 λ o p t f 2 it is known that the mass ratio between tmd device and owt structure is normally designed to be from 1 to 8 hussan et al 2017 for optimal vibration mitigation effectiveness the mass ratio of mre tmd by owt structure is adopted as 5 in this paper following the above design principle and the first two natural frequencies in table 3 the mass stiffness and damping values of mre tmd can calculated by eq 24 as follows 24 m t m d μ m s k t m d 4 π 2 f i 2 m t m d c t m d 4 π ζ f i m t m d in which m s is the total mass of the owt structure m s 2817 tons and where μ is the mass ratio by mre tmd system and owt structure μ 5 f i is the desired frequency of mre tmd according to eq 24 the stiffness range of mre tmd system in theory can be calculated and listed in table 4 3 2 semi active frequency tracing control algorithm dynamic equation of the offshore wind turbine with mre tmd system under multi hazard loadings is shown in eq 25 25 m x c x k x b f t d f m r e t m d where x x x are the unknown displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively m c k are mass damping and stiffness matrices of the owt structure with order p the degrees of freedom of the owt structure the damping matrix c α m β k is obtained using reyleigh s damping ratio in vibration modes f t is the external loads matrix and f m r e t m d is the force vector which represents the control force generated by mre tmd system can be calculated by eq 26 b and d matrices are their location vectors the mass and stiffness matrices of owt model m and k are extracted by the finite element model mentioned in section 2 2 26 f m r e t m d i t k 0 i δ x t c 0 i δ x t α i δ x t 3 where δ x t δ x t are the relative displacement and velocity between mre tmd and tower top k 0 i c 0 i and α i are from eq 21 23 by numerically solving eq 25 the semi active control algorithm in short time fourier transform stft can be conducted in matlab and the dynamic responses of owt are obtained in practical high acceleration of the tower top can induce mechanical malfunctioning of acceleration sensitive parts in the nacelle e g gear box and generator hence the acceleration in tower top is chosen as tracing index short time fourier transform stft algorithm is adopted as the real time control algorithm to identify the time frequency characteristics of non stationary signals taking the acceleration signal x τ of tower top as the objective its weighted signal x ˆ τ can be constructed by multiplying a window function h τ t 27 x ˆ τ x τ h τ t in which x ˆ τ is a weighted signal t is the fixed time and τ is the running time applying fourier transformation to the weighted signal the spectrum x t ω can be obtained 28 x t ω 1 2 π e j ω t x ˆ 1 2 π e j ω t x τ h τ t the power spectral density p t ω at time t is as follows 29 p t ω x t ω 2 x t ω x t ω at the fixed time t i the dominant frequency ω i d is calculated by eq 29 and eq 30 30 ω i ω p t i ω max p t i ω 31 ω i d k max 1 i m 1 i ω i t k max p t k ω k max 1 i m 1 i max p t k ω where ω i is the instantaneous frequency and ω i d is the dominant frequency at t i calculated through averaging the values of the instantaneous frequencies over m time steps in this paper m 3 the flow chart of real time tuning strategy is shown in fig 12 the acceleration response of tower top is measured and its frequency is identified by stft the targeted natural frequency of mre tmd device is then determined and the stiffness of mre tmd to trace the real time acceleration response frequency is obtained using eq 21 23 the desirable control current can be obtained 4 results and discussions 4 1 model verification with mre tmd system sweep acceleration signal is utilized to verify the effectiveness of mre tmd device in the structure over a wide frequency range the frequency chosen is between 0 01 and 10 hz and a maximum peak ground acceleration pga 1 012 g is reached in 200 s with an equal spacing of 0 01 s fig 13 shows the amplitude of the accelerations in the top and base of the tower under uncontrolled passive and semi active control variable stiffness mre tmd system it is noted that passive system used in this paper refers to a system with mre tmd at zero current for comparison we use the term of passive tmd throughout the paper as shown in fig 13 the owt structure is excited at the first two fundamental natural frequencies under sweep frequency loading in terms of vibration mitigation passive tmd performs effective only at the first mode however semi active mre tmd can track the acceleration response frequency with variable stiffness and both first and second vibration modes can be effectively mitigated in addition the natural vibration frequency of owt mre tmd is reduced compared with that of uncontrolled owt this is because the mass block of tmd increase the total mass of the wind turbine leading to lower natural frequency the detailed comparison of acceleration amplitude reduction is listed in table 5 for the tower top the maximum amplitude are 13 97 db and 4 13 db for the first mode and second mode and they are reduced by 74 73 3 53 db and 0 24 4 12 db by passive tmd while with semi active mre tmd such two indexes are mitigated by 81 1 2 64 db and 62 23 1 56 db which demonstrates that semi active mre tmd outperforms the passive tmd such phenomenon can be also found by the comparison of the maximum amplitude of tower base it can be seen that semi active mre tmd performs effectively not only for the first mode but for the second mode of the owt structure 4 2 wind turbine under multi hazard loadings to examine the effectiveness of the mre tmd device we considered two excitation conditions firstly the combined wind and wave loadings are applied to the owt structure and these two excitations are in a period of 600s secondly a multiple hazard loading by wind wave and seismic loadings are considered with two seismic excitations e g the el centro excitation starts at 20s and ends at 73 8s and kobe starts at 30s and ends at 79 98s 4 2 1 combined wind and wave loadings fig 14 shows the time histories of the displacement at the owt tower top and base under uncontrolled passive control and semi active control the peak displacements of uncontrolled tower top and base are 0 9455 m and 0 1981 m respectively and these responses reduced up to 59 24 and 57 29 by the variable stiffness mre tmd it is shown that the mre tmd can significantly reduce the response to evaluate the effectiveness of the variable stiffness control the displacement responses of wind turbine tower with passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are listed in table 6 results confirm that compared with passive tmd semi active tmd with variable stiffness exhibits better performance in attenuating excessive vibration in different locations of tower structure the reduction by mre tmd for tower top is much obvious than that of tower base this is reasonable because the combined wind and wave loadings excite the first fundamental vibration mode in which the maximum displacement occurred at tower top when the semi active mre tmd is applied the reductions on rms and peak value of the displacement at tower top are 67 28 and 59 24 and they are 49 49 and 57 29 at tower base fig 15 presents the single sided spectrum of displacement amplitude and power spectrum density psd of displacement at tower top excessive vibration is diminished in the excited resonance part near fundamental natural frequency under combined wind and wave loadings especially by variable stiffness mre tmd although wind and wave loadings are low frequency excitations they are typical random excitations to induce the forced vibration of wind turbine structure hence variable stiffness mre tmd performs better than the passive one as shown in fig 15 the response spectrums of the passive and semi active systems have two distinct peaks caused by the added dof of the mre tmd rana and soong 1998 and the reductions on peak of displacement amplitude spectrum and displacement psd by variable stiffness mre tmd are 44 78 and 69 09 compared with passive device additionally it should be noted that due to the large mass of mre tmd the natural frequency of coupled owt mre tmd model is quite different from the uncontrolled owt structure additionally the stroke is an important index for the vibration device in wind turbine nacelle due to the limitation space the stroke of passive tmd and mre tmd under wind and wave excitation are shown in fig 16 it is desirable to obtain less stroke for reducing mis functionality of control system compared with passive tmd the peak stroke of mre tmd is reduced by 34 5 and rms stroke is decreased by 40 2 it is demonstrated that the use of semi active mre tmd can obtain stronger energy absorption ability with less stroke 4 2 2 combined wind wave and seismic loadings fig 17 shows the dynamic responses at tower top with passive tmd and mre tmd under different earthquakes at the beginning of earthquake event t 20 s in el centro and t 30 s in kobe the acceleration is obviously enlarged due to the low damping ratio of owt commonly less than or equal to 0 5 the effect of seismic responses remains for about 130 s after the removal of the earthquake loading el centro ends at 73 8s and kobe ends at 79 98s the same performance is also observed in fitzgerald et al s work fitzgerald and basu 2017 where the excessive responses by earthquake excitations remained dozens of seconds in contrary to the owt with passive tmd the margin of acceleration responses by controllable mre tmd decay instantly which shortens the time to normal responses after earthquake by utilizing controlled mre tmd the peak acceleration of tower top is reduced by 15 41 and 23 45 under kobe and el centro respectively the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement of the turbine tower nodes are compared in fig 18 it is shown that the lateral displacement distributes increasingly along the tower heights and variable stiffness mre tmd obviously reduces the maximum displacement the inter storey drift decreases in the tower structure which is reasonable for the control effect of lateral displacement reduction gained using semi active mre tmd especially for the inter storey drift from 3rd to 5th node along the tower the peak displacement reductions are up to 20 1 53 65 and 60 05 under el centro earthquake and 14 97 31 48 and 57 4 under kobe earthquake a comparison is presented in table 7 for displacement and acceleration obtained from the controlled owt under different strategies the reductions in rms on displacement and acceleration at tower top and base for passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are shown based on the computed rms value when mre tmd is applied it is observed that the rms displacement reductions on the tower top are 72 5 and 70 61 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with 54 79 and 46 78 controlled by passive tmd the rms displacement reductions on the tower base are 49 16 and 43 84 under semi active control compared with 44 57 and 19 65 under passive control and the reductions of rms acceleration at tower top and base are 99 96 and 10 67 under el centro and 99 97 and 34 02 under kobe by using semi active mre tmd compared with 53 97 and 4 56 under el centro and 21 04 and 2 09 under kobe by using passive tmd it is concluded that the frequency tracing algorithm performs better than passive one the reason is that the passive tmd aimed at mitigation loading in a constant frequency near the first vibration mode however in the combined seismic loadings with wind and wave loadings the second vibration mode of turbine structure is excited which is reflected by the following acceleration spectrum analysis and thus the tunable stiffness is superior additionally as shown in fig 19 applying semi active mre tmd has largely reduced the stroke of tmd system as 70 18 and 74 32 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with a passive tmd fig 20 shows acceleration amplitudes of the tower top and base and the obtained value of acceleration amplitudes are listed in table 8 according to fig 20 a and b the second mode of tower top acceleration response is excited the energy at the first vibration mode is significantly reduced and the reductions on passive tmd and semi active mre tmd are 81 31 and 91 61 under el centro respectively and 70 11 and 86 96 under kobe for the second vibration mode the reductions on semi active mre tmd control are up to 45 53 and 70 41 under el centro and kobe respectively compared with 2 62 and 0 26 by passive tmd fig 20 c and d are the acceleration amplitude of the tower base where the maximum amplitude of the second mode shape occurs the energy at the second vibration frequency mitigations under passive control and semi active control are 5 1 and 10 27 for el centro earthquake 2 85 and 56 98 for kobe earthquake the results demonstrate that the proposed semi active mre tmd control strategy in present study can not only control the first mode response but also can obviously suppress the second mode of vibrations the reasons can be explained with two aspects firstly mre tmd s stiffness is tunable i e mre tmd installed in the nacelle can tune its frequency as same as the second frequency of owt mode that is a certain reduction effect on the second vibration mode is shown the similar effectiveness of semi active mre tmd at the top for higher vibration mode of owt system is also presented in yang s work yang et al 2020 secondly although the maximum amplitude of the second mode is on the tower base in modal analysis yet under the environmental loads e g wind wave and seismic excitations the maximum response locates at the tower top nacelle as shown in fig 18 similar conclusions are shown in other work e g zuo et al 2017 hussan et al 2018 hence the proposed mre tmd installed in tower top could also reduce the dynamic responses of owt structure when the second vibration mode is excited additionally it should be noted that due to the different characteristics of the seismic excitations gu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the mre tmd is more feasible for near fault kobe than el centro earthquake 4 3 robustness control under the multi hazard loadings damage might occur to the foundation and the tower hence the robustness control of the controlled mre tmd system for owt considering damage is necessary in this work damage is considered through degrading the stiffness of the tower structure and kobe earthquake starts at 100s in all damage cases three damage cases are considered dc1 damage starts at 50s before kobe earthquake dc2 damage starts at 120s during earthquake dc3 damage starts at 180s after earthquake all cases compared with no damage nd condition a stiffness reduction of 5 hemmati and oterkus 2018 is introduced to represent the damage using frequency tracing stft algorithm the frequency of semi active mre tmd can be retuned in real time to match the varied dominant frequency of owt structure due to stiffness decay while the key parameters of passive tmd remain unchanged figs 21 23 show the displacement time histories and spectrum amplitudes of passive and semi active control under different damage cases table 9 compares the rms displacement at tower top for different damage cases and the reduction ratios by comparing semi active mre tmd to passive tmd are also calculated in table 9 when damage happens at 50s it is found that the displacement of passive tmd at tower top is significantly increased by 33 97 compared with nd case which indicates the passive tmd loses its effectiveness to the contrary the displacement controlled by the semi active mre tmd remains a low level regardless of the damage and stiffness variation of owt structure and the rms displacement by semi active mre tmd is reduced to 30 16 compared with nd case as shown in fig 21 the displacement spectrum amplitude of owt with stiffness decay effect is also mitigated to a low level when the semi active mre tmd is utilized under dc2 the displacement results are shown in fig 22 and table 9 it is seen that the tower top displacement of passive tmd increased up to 36 68 compared to nd case while the displacement amplitude remarkably reduced to a minimal level under semi active mre tmd similar conclusions can be drawn under dc3 in fig 23 and table 9 the displacement increase of passive tmd is 17 88 and the peak value is still effectively mitigated when semi active mre tmd is applied therefore the mre tmd have better robustness on multi mode vibration control and can effectively mitigate the displacement even under damage condition which will prolong its fatigue life and reduce the potential maintenance cost 5 conclusions this research focused on the vibration mitigation control of offshore wind turbine under combined wind wave and seismic loadings using mre tmd the design principle of proposed mre tmd is firstly presented using semi active frequency tracing algorithm the stiffness of mre can be tuned and the frequency of mre tmd is varied to the objective frequency of excited owt structure the feasibility of the proposed method has been evaluated and verified by numerical simulations some main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 semi active mre tmd is suitable for multi mode vibration control whereas passive tmd is mainly efficient for suppressing first mode vibration 2 under combined wind and wave loadings the controlled mre tmd can significantly reduce the peak displacement of owt tower top and base by 59 24 and 57 29 respectively compared with passive tmd semi active mre tmd with variable stiffness exhibits better performance to attenuate excessive vibration in different locations of tower structure in detail the reductions on peak of displacement amplitude spectrum and displacement psd by variable stiffness mre tmd are 44 78 and 69 09 of the passive tmd 3 under coupled wind wave and earthquake loadings the margin of acceleration responses of owt tower top by controlled mre tmd decay instantly which shortens the time to normal responses after earthquake compared with passive tmd rms displacement and acceleration responses are substantially decreased by semi active tmd in addition the semi active mre tmd achieves a smaller stroke than passive tmd which shows great advantage in practical application 4 under stiffness damage cases mre tmd consistently shows effective control on the dynamic responses of owt and presents strong robustness which may be helpful to prolong the structure fatigue life and reduce the maintenance cost credit authorship contribution statement dingxin leng writing original draft investigation editing validation yi yang writing reviewing

20367,a numerical investigation is performed to examine the effect of side ratios sr separation ratio g and reynolds number re on the flow around tandem rectangles using the lattice boltzmann method the sr is set at 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 the g is varied from 0 5 to 10 the reynolds number is set at 75 100 125 and 150 the results reveal that the upstream cylinder has higher drag forces compared to the downstream cylinder the results further show that in case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow strongly interactive vortex shedding flow and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes a small increase in mean drag coefficient of upstream cylinder for all considered cases in this study is attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influenced by the upstream cylinder the results show that as the vortex shedding mostly occurs behind the downstream cylinder only root mean square value of lift coefficient is a considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder the results further show that as the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicates either in phase or anti phase flow behavior the numerical results are presented in detail in the form of vorticity contour streamline time history analysis of forces and vortex shedding frequencies keywords fluid forces flow regimes reynolds numbers simulation separation ratios side ratios 1 introduction slender engineering structures are generally seen in groups for example chimney stacks stays offshore platforms and masts in addition the flow around multiple inline cylinders is practically related to many engineering applications and is frequently encountered in industry such as aerospace engineering power engineering electronic cooling and ocean engineering the flow wake around the bluff structures can generate unsteady forces which have the potential to damage the structural integrity the difference in side ratio sr can make drastic changes in the fluid dynamic features around the cylinder rokugou et al 2008 research on tandem rectangles of different side ratios often arises from the interest to understand the loads on the structures due to the fluid motion and further to avoid the global instability issues that arises from the low side ratios bearman and trueman 1972 experimentally studied the flow around rectangles and proposed that the strouhal number st experiences a discontinuity at sr 2 8 okajima 1982 examined experimentally the flow around the rectangle by changing the side ratio and found that sudden discontinuity in st and flow regimes occurs at sr 2 and 3 for reynolds number re 500 and 1100 respectively there has been some more experimental work on flow past rectangles by changing the side ratios such as the work of norberg 1993 nakagawa et al 1999 and abdollah et al 2008 it is observed that most of these experimental studies are for fairly high reynolds numbers and they observed that the critical side ratio drastically changes the flow features and forces the effect of different sr values was numerically studied by okajima et al 1990 where some considerable changes in flow characteristics for re ranging from 500 to 1 2 103 were examined using finite difference methods fdm kondo and yamada 1995 examined the unsteady flow around rectangles for various side ratios ranging from 0 7 to 1 at re 10000 islam et al 2012 numerically investigated the flow around rectangles for sr ranging from 0 15 to 4 at re 100 150 200 and 250 using the lattice boltzmann method lbm tian et al 2013 conducted a numerical study to examine the flow patterns around rectangles and their numerical results show that the drag coefficient c d attains a maximum value at critical side ratio sr 0 2 for re 21 400 a number of numerical studies have been carried out for flow around a square cylinder sr 1 sohankar et al 1995 saha et al 2003 singh et al 2008 guo et al 2008 gera et al 2010 and sen et al 2011 these studies confirm the flow transition from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d grid independence the effect of computational domain and blockage effect at low reynolds numbers using different numerical methods the configuration of the multiple bluff bodies is generally classified into three different arrangements side by side tandem and staggered zdravkovich 1977 furthermore the two tandem cylinders flow is more complicated to separation ratio g and re than the isolated cylinder flow derakhshandeh and alam 2020 compared to the side by side arrangement the flow around two inline bluff bodies exhibits more complex characteristics because the downstream cylinder is submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder and faces more complex flow features because of shear layers and vortex motions which are produced by the upstream cylinder mizushima and suehiro 2005 patil and tiwari 2009 and by bao et al 2012 proposed that the force coefficients vortex shedding pattern and strouhal number are strongly influenced by the gap spacing between the tandem cylinders islam et al 2016a b performed a numerical study on the flow fields around three tandem square cylinders for the gap spacing ranging from 0 5 to 17 at re 75 they found different flow regimes and found that g 3 is the critical gap spacing between the cylinders etminan et al 2011 examined fluid forces acting on two tandem square cylinders at low reynolds numbers their results show that the onset of vortex shedding occurs for a reynolds number between 35 and 40 sohankar 2012 conducted numerical investigations on the effects of the various gap spacings and reynolds numbers on the flow past two tandem square cylinders at re 40 1000 using the gap spacing with g 0 3 12 the author found three different flow regimes i single slender body regime g 0 5 ii reattach regime g 4 and iii co shedding regime g 4 hu et al 2019 carried out a numerical simulation study of the flow past two tandem circular cylinders at re 2 2 104 and 3 106 for g varies from 2 to 5 their study focused on the flow regimes and they observed that for g 3 5 the vortex street is only formed behind the downstream cylinder while for g 3 5 the vortex shedding occurs from both upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder numerous studies have been carried out to examine the flow regimes and critical spacing between tandem square cylinders some representative investigations are those of sohankar and etminan 2009 islam et al 2016a b sohankar et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 shang et al 2019 yetik and mahir 2020 and wang et al 2020 the critical spacing was mostly shown by researchers to be in the range of 3 5 4 experimentally at large reynolds numbers okajima 1979 and xu and zhou 2004 the existence of the critical gap spacing between the tandem cylinders has been found in computations at low reynolds numbers between 75 and 200 patil and tiwari 2009 and bao et al 2012 these studies show that the gap spacing lies in the range between 3 and 4 most of the experimental and numerical studies in the literature have been conducted for different g and re for flow around tandem square cylinders as well as circular cylinders knowledge of the effect of g and re on flow past two tandem rectangles of different side ratios are far from complete in engineering applications however the interaction of the fluid with more than one bluff bodies may have different side ratios sr 1 the difference in the side ratio induces differences in the vortex sizes wake sizes separation points and vortex shedding frequencies of the tandem rectangles it is not clear how sr 1 influences the fluid dynamics forces strouhal numbers and flow regimes in comparison with the case of side ratio sr 1 the previous literature mainly focused on two tandem square cylinders while investigation on tandem rectangles of different side ratios is scarce the previous investigations show that the g and re are the two main parameters for flow regime transitions and sensitivity of the fluid forces the main objective of this study to examine the effect of side ratio for two tandem cylinders together with re and g the study of tandem structures is very important to support structures to get reasonably reliable knowledge of design parameters such as drag and lift forces wake size vortex shedding frequency etc is too important especially in case of tandem cylinders the upstream cylinder considerably reduces the drag of the downstream cylinder and as a result one can save energy in other words in the case of tandem cylinders the upstream cylinder plays a role of passive control device to reduce the drag and suppress the vortex shedding the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 consists of numerical details problem description and boundary conditions section 3 consists of grid independence domain independence and code validation numerical results are discussed in detail in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical details the lattice boltzmann method is an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd technique and is based both on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations wolf gladrow 2000 succi 2001 kruger et al 2017 and mohamad 2019 lbm has some advantages over other numerical methods based on its kinetic nature in lbm the convection operator is linear in velocity space the collision term of the lbm represents the nonlinear effects on the macroscopic level in lbm the equation of state can be used to directly calculate the pressure in other numerical methods the pressure must be obtained from the poisson equation conventional cfd schemes actually start with discretizing the navier stokes equations at the macroscopic level but lbm is actually based on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations chen and doolen 1998 one can also find the use of lbm for multiple bluff bodies at low reynolds numbers zhou et al 2005 agrawal et al 2006 kumar et al 2008 chatterjee et al 2010 etminan et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhou et al 2021 the simplified form of the boltzmann equation without an external force as mohamad 2019 1 t f e f here f e and are the distribution function velocity vector and collision operator respectively in 1954 bhatnagar gross and krook bgk introduced a simplified collision operator and is replaced by kruger et al 2017 2 f e q f τ here f eq and τ

written as 4 t f i e i f i f i e q f i τ one can easily obtain the governing continuity and navier stokes equations from eq 4 using the chapman enskog expansion kruger et al 2017 the left hand side

positions of particles time and increment in time respectively the f i eq in eq 5 for d 2 q 9 where d and q are the dimensions and number of particles respectively can be written as guo and shu 2013 6 f i e q ρ ω i 1 3 e i u 4 5 e i u 2 1 5 u u here ρ and w i are the density of the fluid and weighting coefficients respectively the corresponding weighting coefficients for the distribution functions

for incompressible flow for low mach number ma u c s 0 1 where c s is the speed of sound and u is the inflow velocity guo et al 2008 in lbm the kinematic viscosity ϑ of the fluid is related to the relaxation time parameter by 7 ϑ δ x 2 c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t where δx is the lattice spacing in this study we choose δx δt 1 the macroscopic density ρ and velocity u are calculated as 8 ρ i 0 8 f i i 0 8 f

1992 he and luo 1997 and sukop and thorne 2006 respectively the important parameters are the reynolds number re the side ratio sr the strouhal number st the separation ratio g the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l they are defined by the following formulas 11 r e u l ϑ 12 s r w l 13 s t f s l u 14 g g l 15 c d 2 f x ρ u 2 l 16 c l 2 f y ρ u 2 l where w l f s g f x and f y are the width of the rectangle length of the rectangle vortex shedding frequency the surface to surface distance between the cylinders drag force in the streamwise direction and lift force in the transverse direction respectively fig 2 shows a schematic view of tandem rectangles placed at the middle of the channel a cartesian coordinate system x y is used to present the flow where x and y are the incoming flow direction in the streamwise and transverse direction respectively l u l d l x and l y are an upstream distance from the inlet position to the front surface of the upstream cylinder c 1 downstream distance from the rear surface of the downstream cylinder c 2 to the exit of the domain length of the computational domain and height of the computational domain respectively c d and c l are the drag and lift forces in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively the origin 0 0 is the center of the rectangles at the entrance of the computational domain a parabolic velocity profile along the x direction is incorporated 17 u x 0 y u 1 y 1 y 18 v x 0 y 0 here u is the inflow velocity and x 2x l y and y 2y l y guo et al 2008 at the exit of the computational domain the boundary condition is x u 0 no slip boundary condition u v 0 is adopted for the surfaces of the rectangles mohamad 2019 furthermore a no slip boundary condition is also applied at the bottom and top walls of the computational domain the forces on the surfaces of the rectangles are calculated using the momentum exchange method yu et al 2003 3 grid independence and code validation the grid independence study and influence of the size of the computational domain are investigated before the computation in order to choose a suitable computational domain for better results with less computational time the mean drag coefficient c dmean and strouhal number for the two cylinders are computed for this purpose c dmean1 and c dmean2 represent the mean drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder respectively similarly st1 and st2 represent the strouhal number of the c 1 and c 2 respectively the computed results are tabulated in tables 1 4 for re 150 sr 1 and g 5 the percentage deviation in these tables is also given in brackets the results of l 20 with l 25 30 and 35 are reasonably small with the maximum deviation for c dmean2 approximately 3 0 table 1 confirming that the grid s effect is almost negligible with l 20 the results of β 11 14 16 and 20 are almost negligible with the maximum deviation for c dmean1 and c dmean2 approximately 3 2 and 3 1 respectively between β 11 and 14 table 2 confirming that the blockage effect is reasonably small with β 11 the l u influence was justified with l u 10l and l u 25l the maximum deviation between l u 10l and 25l is 1 7 for c dmean2 and 1 6 for st1 see table 3 furthermore the l d influence was justified with l d 35l and variation of l d from 40l to 55l the largest deviation between l d 35l and 55l is 1 8 for the st of the downstream cylinder see table 4 we adopt l 20 β 11 l u 10l and l d 35l for the rest of computations for code validation firstly we calculate a uniform flow with re 70 and 110 for sr 3 to assess the performance of the present method the results are qualitatively compared with the experimental results of chen and shao 2013 one can find the steady flow regime at re 70 fig 3 a and unsteady wake pattern at re 110 fig 3 b chen and shao 2013 also observed the steady flow regime at re 70 fig 3 c and unsteady wake pattern at re 110 fig 4 d chen and shao 2013 numerically found for re 110 that the st value is 0 132 in this study we found that the st value is 0 1326 at re 110 in order to further validate the present code we examine the onset of vortex shedding for flow past a square cylinder sr 1 by changing the reynolds numbers at re 1 fig 4 a the flow around a square cylinder is laminar and fully attached to the cylinder the flow nature is almost symmetric and has a clear stagnation point both in the front and at the rear of the cylinder for re 5 fig 4 b the flow is still laminar and separation occurs from both top side and bottom side enclosing two small symmetrical vortices behind the cylinder it can be seen that the vortices will generate a stable wake behind the square cylinder at least up to re 50 fig 4 d it is also observed that the two vortices grow linearly with increasing reynolds number and will remain attached to the cylinder fig 4 b d for re 55 fig 4 e the flow shows some instability the wake flow at some distance behind the square cylinder shows signs of a wavy character however to find out somehow the exact critical reynolds number value for such instability needs more computations between 50 and 55 with an increment of 0 1 moreover this critical reynolds value will be strongly dependent upon the computational domain in coming flow boundary conditions and numerical method sohankar et al 1995 have proposed a limiting value up to 54 saha et al 2003 show that re 56 is the critical value as the re increased the shedding of alternating vortices will now take place behind the cylinder fig 4 f for further validation of our developed code we have calculated different force coefficients like mean drag coefficient c dmean st root mean square value of drag coefficient c drms and lift coefficient c lrms for a single square cylinder at re 75 100 125 and 150 are calculated for both unconfined and confined flows the present numerical results are compared with the existing experimental okajima 1982 and norberg 1993 and numerical results sohankar et al 1995 saha et al 2003 singh et al 2008 guo et al 2008 gera et al 2010 sen et al 2011 in fig 5 a d the blockage ratios are different and we found 5 8 and 6 7 difference at re 100 with the experimental results of okajima 1982 and norberg 1993 for strouhal number our blockage ratios are the same as those reported by guo et al 2008 except guo et al 2008 all the results are dealing with the unconfined flows we are adopting confined flow situation in this study as a result one can see that our unconfined results for c dmean are in close agreement with the numerical results of sen et al 2011 on the other hand our confined results are predicts below as compared to sen et al 2011 for c dmean some results are close enough and some results are showing discrepancies sohankar et al 1995 adopted l u 11 1d l d 25 2d and β 5 for computations guo et al 2008 adopted l u 12 5d l d 50d and β 18 for computations 4 results and discussion calculations are carried out for flow around rectangles of different side ratios the effects of the separation ratio side ratio and reynolds number on flow features fluid forces flow transitions and strouhal number are studied four reynolds numbers re 75 100 125 and 150 and four side ratios sr 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 are considered the spacing between the cylinders is varied from 0 5 to 10 with 0 5 increments up to 5 and then 1 increment up to 10 fig 6 a e shows the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes revealed in this numerical study at fixed re 100 and sr 0 5 by changing the value of g it is important to state here that the flow regimes are named according to the behavior of vortex patterns and shear layers in the flow field the shear layers separated from cylinder c 1 reattach on the side surfaces of cylinder c 2 and roll up into vortices and shed alternatively behind cylinder c 2 as shown in fig 6 a the two tandem cylinders behave like a single cylinder in the flow field no vortex shedding occurs behind cylinder c 1 due to these flow features this flow regime is named the single bluff body flow regime zheng and alam 2019 made a similar observation for flow around three tandem square cylinders at re 150 and 1 2 g 3 sohankar 2012 also had similar observations for flow past two tandem square cylinders at g 0 5 again we observed the single bluff body flow regime as the spacing increased from g 0 5 to 1 5 the only difference is the streamwise and transverse spacing between the shed vortices behind the downstream cylinder as they move downstream at g 3 5 fig 6 c we observe an alternate shed vortex behind the upstream cylinder c 1 and have weak interaction with downstream cylinder c 2 this flow behavior is named a weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime another flow regime observed in this numerical study is the irregular flow regime fig 6 d at g 5 one fully developed vortex is observed from the lower side of the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder stops the alternate generation of vortex shed and also affects the vortex shed generation behind the downstream cylinder the two row vortex structure clearly seen up to some extent and then showing alternate generations of shed vortices near the exit of the domain we observe that the vortices between the gap have a strong interaction with the downstream cylinder c 2 fig 6 e also downstream the double row of vortices can be seen unlike other flow regimes vortices do not move in an alternate fashion behind the downstream cylinder c 2 that is why this flow regime is named a strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime in this flow regime the flow around two inline cylinders becomes more unsteady compared to a single bluff body flow regime especially near the exit of the domain the present results are in good agreement with the numerical results of sohankar 2012 our findings are in good agreement with the available studies of islam et al 2016a b for flow past three inline square cylinders they also observed such flow regimes for low reynolds numbers from the above analysis it is confirmed that the separation ratio strongly affects the flow features and the flow transition occurs once the value of g increased variation of c d and c l with time variation at fixed re 100 and sr 0 5 by changing the value of g is shown in fig 7 a j the solid and dotted lines present the upstream cylinder c 1 and downstream cylinder c 2 respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 in drag and lift coefficients present the c 1 and c 2 cylinders respectively it can be seen that the lift forces settle to a regular sinusoidal function after vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder in the case of a single bluff body flow regime fig 7 b d from fig 7 a c it can be observed that the drag coefficients of both cylinders are a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on cylinders except at second cylinder c 2 shown in fig 7 c we also observed a negative drag coefficient for downstream cylinder c 2 which is due to the pressure difference between the front and rear surface and as a result cylinder c 2 is pulled upstream see fig 7 a c it can also be seen that the lift amplitude of c 2 is larger than the lift amplitude of c 1 this ensures that after interacting with the downstream cylinder c 2 the flow finds reasonably enough free space to roll up in the form of shed vortices it should be noted that as the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicates either in phase or anti phase flow behavior it is observed that in most cases the lift coefficient amplitude for cylinder c 2 being larger than that of upstream cylinder c 1 largely attributed to the only vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder the lift forces of the two cylinders are in phase at weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime fig 7 f and nearly anti phase at strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime fig 7 j these plots clearly show that the vortex pattern behind the cylinders is dependent on the separation ratios furthermore the drag amplitude of the downstream cylinder considerably changes due to flow transitions see fig 7 e g i fig 8 a c show the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes at fixed sr 1 0 and g 4 by changing the value of re at re sr g 75 1 4 the flow is steady throughout the computational domain no unsteadiness observed for this combination in fig 8 a the flow is steady and separation occurs from both the top side and the bottom side of the upstream cylinder and quickly reattaches to the downstream cylinder this flow behavior is named as steady flow regime at re sr g 125 1 4 it can be seen that initially the flow is steady but in the far wake region of downstream cylinder c 2 it exhibits some unsteadiness fig 8 b some unsteady nature is clearly seen from the bottom side of the downstream cylinder this type of flow regime is categorized as a quasi unsteady flow regime at re sr g 150 1 4 it can be seen that the wake region is longer as compared to those presented in fig 8 a the waviness nature behind the downstream cylinder and two smalls shed vortices near downstream at the exit clearly illustrates the widewing of the streamwise distance of the vortices this flow behavior is named as wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime moreover in the wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime the shear layers from the upstream cylinder leading edges allow some fluid to go into the spacing between the two cylinders this confirms that the flow transition occurs by changing the values of re from 75 to 150 at fixed g and sr variation of drag and lift coefficients with time variation at fixed g 4 and sr 1 by changing the value of re is shown in fig 9 a f from fig 9 a it can be observed that the drag coefficients of both cylinders are a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on cylinders furthermore the lift coefficients of both cylinders are also constant in a steady flow regime we also observed a negative drag coefficient for downstream cylinder c 2 in both steady flow and quasi unsteady flow regimes fig 9 a c the time variation of lift coefficients shows sinusoidal variation for c 1 and c 2 in the case of quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes fig 9 d f it can also be seen that the lift amplitude of c 2 is larger than the lift amplitude of c 1 for both observed flow regimes from fig 9 e it can be observed that the drag coefficient of upstream cylinder c 1 is a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on c 1 and cylinder c 2 shows some small modulation fig 10 a c show the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes at fixed re 150 and g 1 by changing the value of sr in the next three graphs we will show how the sr affects the salient features of flow regimes and forces statistics for this we choose only one case at re 150 and g 1 it is clear from fig 10 a c that as the value of sr changes the flow transition occurs we observed the single bluff body flow regime steady flow regime and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime at sr 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively these features clearly illustrate that the side ratio considerably changes the flow features around rectangles variation of c d and c l with time variation at fixed re 150 and g 1 by changing the value of sr is shown in fig 11 a f in fig 11 a the drag force of the upstream cylinder shows a sinusoidal behavior at sr 0 25 and constant behavior at sr 0 5 as the side ratio increases the drag force of the upstream cylinder due to shear layer reattachment shows a straight line behavior on the other hand the drag force of the downstream cylinder confirms some small modulations in fig 11 e no straight line can be seen behind the downstream cylinder is attributed that the vortex pattern in the wake occurs behind the downstream cylinder interestingly in the case of c d1 the highest drag amplitude is observed at sr 0 25 the lift coefficients are changed their nature from antiphase to constant and then from constant to in phase once the flow transition occurs the drag coefficients are periodic in the case of a single bluff body flow regime it is observed that the frequency of the c d1 and c d2 are twice that of the c l1 and c l2 in the case of single bluff body flow regime the power spectrum of lift coefficients for observed flow regimes at various re g and sr is shown in fig 12 a d in fig 12 symbol e denotes the spectrum energy calculated from the lift coefficients and it is plotted against strouhal number st in fig 12 the highest peak refers to the primary vortex shedding frequencies while the other small harmonic represents the secondary cylinder interaction frequencies it can be seen that for irregular flow regime secondary peaks also exists along with the primary vortex shedding frequency in the spectrum graphs see fig 12 a irregular flow regime associated with st 0 4264 is the second harmonic of the primary vortex shedding frequency st 0 1449 see fig 12 a a small extra peak at st 0 4264 is almost three times larger than the strouhal number observed as a primary vortex shedding frequency st 0 1449 in fig 12 a this high frequency periodically changes the amplitude of cylinder c 2 no secondary frequency observed for other flow regimes except at irregular flow regimes the values of vortex shedding frequencies are decreased while changing the value of g from 0 5 to 1 5 and then showing an increasing behavior while increasing the value of g it is to be noted that no vortex shedding frequency is observed in the case of a steady flow regime due to constant lift coefficients behavior in the case of quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes we observed a considerably smaller amplitude of vortex shedding of c 1 as compared to c 2 fig 12 c and d the same strouhal values are observed in the case of a quasi unsteady flow regime moreover slightly different strouhal values are observed in the case of a wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime the power spectra confirm the existence of primary vortex shedding frequency for both quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes the power spectra confirm the existence of primary vortex shedding frequency for both quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes the vortex shedding becomes slower for both cylinders as the side ratio increases at this chosen re and g the variation in c dmean of each rectangle with g for different fixed re and sr is presented in fig 13 a h the single cylinder sc value is also included for comparison the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the mean drag coefficient of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively variation in c dmean of the downstream cylinder at sr 0 25 and 0 5 for re 75 is too complicated fig 13 a it is to be noted that the c dmean2 jumps once the flow regime transition takes place with the increase in g from 5 to 10 at strongly vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive flow regime the freestream flow entrainment into the sap between the two cylinders leading to an increase in c dmean for the downstream cylinder at wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes a small increase in c dmean1 for all considered cases in this study are attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influence by the upstream cylinder c 1 the combined effect of the vortex shedding from the c 1 and c 2 cylinders results in an increased c dmean for the downstream cylinder the maximum c dmean of each rectangle observed at g 10 is attributed to the alternate vortex shedding behind the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder in wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes c dmean1 is almost constant and remarkably increases for the downstream cylinder the increase in c dmean2 is due to the increase of pressure on the front surface of the downstream cylinder it is seen that as the spacing value g increases the c dmean1 decrease then increase and approach a constant value representative of that of the single rectangle furthermore we see that in general the c dmean2 are sufficiently less than the c dmean of sc at various separation ratios this ensures that the presence of bluff bodies in the wake of others reduces the c dmean this finding agrees well with the results of igarashi and suzuki 1984 for flow around three tandem circular cylinders they observed for the middle cylinder and downstream cylinder in presence of the upstream cylinder however for lower values of g the results of both cylinders are lower than the single cylinder shown in fig 14 a h is the dependence of strouhal number on g for fixed re and sr the variation of the shedding frequency of the cylinder c 2 is different from that of the cylinder c 1 at re 75 for sr 0 25 fig 14 a and 0 75 fig 14 b the minimum values of strouhal numbers for both cylinders observed for 3 g 4 by changing the reynolds numbers and side ratios no serious variations are seen in st for two rectangles except few discontinuous jumps once the flow transitions occur the strouhal numbers for both cylinders are almost identical in wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes for all chosen reynolds numbers at sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 at sr 0 25 for all considered reynolds numbers by varying g the st1 and st2 are slightly different the strouhal number up to g 3 decreases for all considered cases mostly due to the shift of shear layer reattachment from the front surface of the cylinder c 2 to the rear surface the st variation becomes relatively insensitive to g for re 75 100 and 150 at sr 0 75 and 1 fig 14 b d h the st s are almost approaching to sc value for all considered sr and re cases as the g increased this ensures that at the relatively large spacing between the rectangles the shed vortices from the upstream cylinder fully developed from fig 16 it can be seen that the strouhal value of both cylinders decreases and approaches to its minimum value and then it shows increasing behavior approaching the sc value it is also observed that the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow for all considered cases except for the irregular flow regime where one to two small peaks observed for the downstream cylinder the noted jumps at different values of g could be due to sr effects the minimum position changes as g vary both the cylinders attain their minimum values at different g for fixed re and sr for example it is noted that both the st1 and st2 reach their minimum values at the gap spacing g 4 for the re 125 and sr 1 see fig 14 f shown in fig 15 a h is the dependence of the root mean square value of drag coefficients on g for fixed re and sr the c drms graphs clearly indicate that the value of sr is impacting furthermore the value of c drms for both cylinders appears to be more scattered than the c dmean st and c lrms for both cylinders and more depends on the sr other than re for example even when g is greater than 5 c drms of both cylinders still show a dependence on sr and re fig 15 e no serious variations are observed in c drms for both rectangles except at re sr 125 0 25 and 0 5 and 150 0 25 and 0 5 when the flow separation occurs a discontinuous jump observed in c drms for example a large discontinuous jump occurring in c drms for both cylinders at g 1 fig 15 b separates a steady flow regime from a single bluff body flow regime as sr changes from 0 25 to 1 it is noted that the c drms2 reach their maximum value as the separation ratio g increases for the sr 0 25 case the maximum value for the c drms2 occur at g 4 for re 75 with corresponding maximum value given by 0 1917 see fig 15 a for another sr 1 case the maximum c drms2 value occur at g 7 with corresponding maximum value given by 0 0542 fig 15 f the most sensitive variation is happening when the side ratio of the cylinders is about 0 25 and 0 5 for reynolds number 150 fig 15 g the difference in the c drms2 value where the maximum value of c drms2 occurs for the sr 0 25 and 1 cases indicates the effect of sr on the fluid forces acting on the rectangles it is observed that the maximum value of c drms2 appears at a lower value of g than the corresponding maxima for c dmean st and c lrms the noted changes at low and high values of g could be due to sr effects the root mean square values of lift coefficients at different side ratios are presented in fig 16 a h it is observed that as the vortex shedding mostly observed behind the downstream cylinder only c lrms is considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder a discontinuous jump in c lrms2 is observed for re 75 100 and 125 for all chosen side ratios in 3 g 5 once the flow regime transformation occurs between quasi unsteady irregular and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes it can be seen that as the g increased the c lrms1 approaches to single rectangle value at re 75 for all chosen side ratios the c lrms2 is considerably higher than the sc value as the g value increased it is observed that at sr 0 25 for re 100 125 and 150 the c lrms2 is lower than the sc value fig 16 c e g the reverse trend is observed for sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 at re sr 75 0 25 and 0 5 and 75 re 150 0 75 the vortex shedding occurs from the cylinder c 2 c lrms2 is considerable higher for the cylinder c 2 than for cylinder c 1 we also observed that the c lrms1 c lrms2 at re g 100 5 g 10 and 125 and 150 4 g 10 at sr 0 25 in fig 16 it can be seen that for the higher separation ratio g 4 5 the c lrms1 is almost the same as the c lrms value observed for the isolated rectangle while for lower values of g 4 the c lrms1 is lower than the sc value this indicates that the position of shear layer reattachment for lower values of g and fully developed shed vortices for higher values of g have been observed behind the upstream cylinder the graphical representation of various flow regimes found in this numerical study is given in fig 17 a d at all the chosen g and re values for the fixed side ratio as the sr increases the occurrence of regime i reduced it can be observed that at low spacing ratios at sr 0 25 and 0 5 the single bluff body flow regime mostly occurs at all reynolds numbers at sr re 0 75 100 re 150 it occurs for g 0 5 at sr re 1 100 and 125 this flow regime occurs at g 0 5 also we did not observe the steady flow regime for sr 0 25 quasi unsteady flow regime for sr 0 5 and strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for sr 1 for all selected cases of re and g wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for all considered cases of sr and re for g 5 the position of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime changes from lower spacing ratios to a higher spacing ratio as the side ratio changed for fixed reynolds number at re sr g 75 0 25 1 5

regime occurs at re sr g 75 0 75 0 5 75 1 4 5 125 1 4 150 0 25 1 and 100 0 75 3 the quasi unsteady flow regime occurs the cases where we observed the negative mean drag coefficient of c 2 no strouhal numbers in case of steady flow regime and extra peak in power spectra of c 2 are given in tables 5 7 respectively the cases where we observed the negative value of c dmean of the downstream cylinder due to a highly negative pressure in the spacing between the two cylinders in the case of no strouhal values we found the steady flow regime for 75 re 150 and different g values the negative value of c dmean2 can be seen either at low separation ratio value g 0 5 or at high separation ratio value g 4 depending on sr 5 conclusions this paper presents a numerical study of a parabolic flow in a confined channel past two tandem rectangles using the lattice boltzmann method the separation ratio is varied from 0 5 to 10 four different values of reynolds numbers re 75 100 125 and 150 and side ratios sr 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 are considered for all computations important findings of this study are summarized below i on the basis of wake structure vortex shedding frequency time history analysis of forces power spectra of lift coefficients and fluid force seven different flow regimes are identified namely a single bluff body flow regime b steady flow regime c quasi unsteady flow regime d irregular flow regime e wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime f strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and g weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime ii it was found that the drag on the downstream cylinder is significantly reduced in the presence of the upstream cylinder for all selected ranges the reduction almost becomes less if the gap spacing between the cylinders is larger than 5 diameters on the other hand the drag on the upstream cylinder is not considerably affected by the downstream cylinder iii it is further found that in the case of negative value of c dmean of the downstream cylinder due to a highly negative pressure in the spacing between the two cylinders in the case of no strouhal values we found the steady flow regime for 75 re 150 and different g values the negative value of c dmean2 can be seen either at low separation ratio value g 0 5 or at high separation ratio value g 4 depending on sr iv it is found that in most cases the lift coefficient amplitude for the downstream cylinder being larger than that of the upstream cylinder largely attributed to the only vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder we found that once the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicate either in phase or anti phase flow behavior the lift forces of the two cylinders are anti phase at strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and nearly in phase at weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime the dominancy of primary vortex shedding frequency was observed for all considered cases except for those cases where we found the irregular flow regime in the case of an irregular flow regime we found more than one peak in the power spectra of the downstream cylinder v it is found that the variation in c dmean of the downstream cylinder at sr 0 25 and 0 5 for re 75 is too complicated in the case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow strongly interactive vortex shedding flow and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes we observed a small increase in c dmean1 for all considered cases in this study is attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influenced by the upstream cylinder we further observed that the combined effect of the vortex shedding from the upstream and downstream cylinders results in an increased mean drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder it is shown that in general the c dmean2 are sufficiently less than the c dmean of an isolated cylinder at various separation ratios this ensures that the presence of bluff bodies in the wake of others reduces the drag forces vi the present results show that the minimum values of strouhal numbers for both cylinders observed for 3 g 4 by changing the reynolds numbers and side ratios no serious variations are seen in st for two rectangles except few discontinuous jumps once the flow transitions occur the present results further show that the strouhal numbers for both cylinders are almost identical in the case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for all chosen reynolds numbers at sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 the root mean square value of drag coefficient was found for both cylinders appears to be more scattered than the mean drag coefficient strouhal number and root mean square value of lift coefficient for both cylinders and more depend on the side ratios other than reynolds numbers it was found that the most sensitive variation in terms of root mean square value of drag coefficient is happening when the side ratio of the cylinders is about 0 25 and 0 5 for reynolds number 150 it was found that as the vortex shedding mostly occurs behind the downstream cylinder only c lrms is considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder it is shown that for the higher separation ratio g 4 5 the c lrms1 is almost the same as the c lrms value is observed for the isolated rectangle while for lower values of g 4 the c lrms1 is lower than the single cylinder value credit author statement mr zia ul islam a phd scholar developed the

20367,a numerical investigation is performed to examine the effect of side ratios sr separation ratio g and reynolds number re on the flow around tandem rectangles using the lattice boltzmann method the sr is set at 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 the g is varied from 0 5 to 10 the reynolds number is set at 75 100 125 and 150 the results reveal that the upstream cylinder has higher drag forces compared to the downstream cylinder the results further show that in case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow strongly interactive vortex shedding flow and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes a small increase in mean drag coefficient of upstream cylinder for all considered cases in this study is attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influenced by the upstream cylinder the results show that as the vortex shedding mostly occurs behind the downstream cylinder only root mean square value of lift coefficient is a considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder the results further show that as the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicates either in phase or anti phase flow behavior the numerical results are presented in detail in the form of vorticity contour streamline time history analysis of forces and vortex shedding frequencies keywords fluid forces flow regimes reynolds numbers simulation separation ratios side ratios 1 introduction slender engineering structures are generally seen in groups for example chimney stacks stays offshore platforms and masts in addition the flow around multiple inline cylinders is practically related to many engineering applications and is frequently encountered in industry such as aerospace engineering power engineering electronic cooling and ocean engineering the flow wake around the bluff structures can generate unsteady forces which have the potential to damage the structural integrity the difference in side ratio sr can make drastic changes in the fluid dynamic features around the cylinder rokugou et al 2008 research on tandem rectangles of different side ratios often arises from the interest to understand the loads on the structures due to the fluid motion and further to avoid the global instability issues that arises from the low side ratios bearman and trueman 1972 experimentally studied the flow around rectangles and proposed that the strouhal number st experiences a discontinuity at sr 2 8 okajima 1982 examined experimentally the flow around the rectangle by changing the side ratio and found that sudden discontinuity in st and flow regimes occurs at sr 2 and 3 for reynolds number re 500 and 1100 respectively there has been some more experimental work on flow past rectangles by changing the side ratios such as the work of norberg 1993 nakagawa et al 1999 and abdollah et al 2008 it is observed that most of these experimental studies are for fairly high reynolds numbers and they observed that the critical side ratio drastically changes the flow features and forces the effect of different sr values was numerically studied by okajima et al 1990 where some considerable changes in flow characteristics for re ranging from 500 to 1 2 103 were examined using finite difference methods fdm kondo and yamada 1995 examined the unsteady flow around rectangles for various side ratios ranging from 0 7 to 1 at re 10000 islam et al 2012 numerically investigated the flow around rectangles for sr ranging from 0 15 to 4 at re 100 150 200 and 250 using the lattice boltzmann method lbm tian et al 2013 conducted a numerical study to examine the flow patterns around rectangles and their numerical results show that the drag coefficient c d attains a maximum value at critical side ratio sr 0 2 for re 21 400 a number of numerical studies have been carried out for flow around a square cylinder sr 1 sohankar et al 1995 saha et al 2003 singh et al 2008 guo et al 2008 gera et al 2010 and sen et al 2011 these studies confirm the flow transition from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d grid independence the effect of computational domain and blockage effect at low reynolds numbers using different numerical methods the configuration of the multiple bluff bodies is generally classified into three different arrangements side by side tandem and staggered zdravkovich 1977 furthermore the two tandem cylinders flow is more complicated to separation ratio g and re than the isolated cylinder flow derakhshandeh and alam 2020 compared to the side by side arrangement the flow around two inline bluff bodies exhibits more complex characteristics because the downstream cylinder is submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder and faces more complex flow features because of shear layers and vortex motions which are produced by the upstream cylinder mizushima and suehiro 2005 patil and tiwari 2009 and by bao et al 2012 proposed that the force coefficients vortex shedding pattern and strouhal number are strongly influenced by the gap spacing between the tandem cylinders islam et al 2016a b performed a numerical study on the flow fields around three tandem square cylinders for the gap spacing ranging from 0 5 to 17 at re 75 they found different flow regimes and found that g 3 is the critical gap spacing between the cylinders etminan et al 2011 examined fluid forces acting on two tandem square cylinders at low reynolds numbers their results show that the onset of vortex shedding occurs for a reynolds number between 35 and 40 sohankar 2012 conducted numerical investigations on the effects of the various gap spacings and reynolds numbers on the flow past two tandem square cylinders at re 40 1000 using the gap spacing with g 0 3 12 the author found three different flow regimes i single slender body regime g 0 5 ii reattach regime g 4 and iii co shedding regime g 4 hu et al 2019 carried out a numerical simulation study of the flow past two tandem circular cylinders at re 2 2 104 and 3 106 for g varies from 2 to 5 their study focused on the flow regimes and they observed that for g 3 5 the vortex street is only formed behind the downstream cylinder while for g 3 5 the vortex shedding occurs from both upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder numerous studies have been carried out to examine the flow regimes and critical spacing between tandem square cylinders some representative investigations are those of sohankar and etminan 2009 islam et al 2016a b sohankar et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 shang et al 2019 yetik and mahir 2020 and wang et al 2020 the critical spacing was mostly shown by researchers to be in the range of 3 5 4 experimentally at large reynolds numbers okajima 1979 and xu and zhou 2004 the existence of the critical gap spacing between the tandem cylinders has been found in computations at low reynolds numbers between 75 and 200 patil and tiwari 2009 and bao et al 2012 these studies show that the gap spacing lies in the range between 3 and 4 most of the experimental and numerical studies in the literature have been conducted for different g and re for flow around tandem square cylinders as well as circular cylinders knowledge of the effect of g and re on flow past two tandem rectangles of different side ratios are far from complete in engineering applications however the interaction of the fluid with more than one bluff bodies may have different side ratios sr 1 the difference in the side ratio induces differences in the vortex sizes wake sizes separation points and vortex shedding frequencies of the tandem rectangles it is not clear how sr 1 influences the fluid dynamics forces strouhal numbers and flow regimes in comparison with the case of side ratio sr 1 the previous literature mainly focused on two tandem square cylinders while investigation on tandem rectangles of different side ratios is scarce the previous investigations show that the g and re are the two main parameters for flow regime transitions and sensitivity of the fluid forces the main objective of this study to examine the effect of side ratio for two tandem cylinders together with re and g the study of tandem structures is very important to support structures to get reasonably reliable knowledge of design parameters such as drag and lift forces wake size vortex shedding frequency etc is too important especially in case of tandem cylinders the upstream cylinder considerably reduces the drag of the downstream cylinder and as a result one can save energy in other words in the case of tandem cylinders the upstream cylinder plays a role of passive control device to reduce the drag and suppress the vortex shedding the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 consists of numerical details problem description and boundary conditions section 3 consists of grid independence domain independence and code validation numerical results are discussed in detail in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical details the lattice boltzmann method is an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd technique and is based both on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations wolf gladrow 2000 succi 2001 kruger et al 2017 and mohamad 2019 lbm has some advantages over other numerical methods based on its kinetic nature in lbm the convection operator is linear in velocity space the collision term of the lbm represents the nonlinear effects on the macroscopic level in lbm the equation of state can be used to directly calculate the pressure in other numerical methods the pressure must be obtained from the poisson equation conventional cfd schemes actually start with discretizing the navier stokes equations at the macroscopic level but lbm is actually based on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations chen and doolen 1998 one can also find the use of lbm for multiple bluff bodies at low reynolds numbers zhou et al 2005 agrawal et al 2006 kumar et al 2008 chatterjee et al 2010 etminan et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhou et al 2021 the simplified form of the boltzmann equation without an external force as mohamad 2019 1 t f e f here f e and are the distribution function velocity vector and collision operator respectively in 1954 bhatnagar gross and krook bgk introduced a simplified collision operator and is replaced by kruger et al 2017 2 f e q f τ here f eq and τ are the equilibrium distribution function and relaxation time parameter respectively putting eq 2 into eq 1 we obtain 3 t f e f f e q f τ the discrete form of the boltzmann equation eq 3 can be written as 4 t f i e i f i f i e q f i τ one can easily obtain the governing continuity and navier stokes equations from eq 4 using the chapman enskog expansion kruger et al 2017 the left hand side and right hand side of eq 4 represent the streaming and collision process respectively equation 4 can be discretized as 5 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t f i e q x t f i x t δ t τ where x t and δt are the positions of particles time and increment in time respectively the f i eq in eq 5 for d 2 q 9 where d and q are the dimensions and number of particles respectively can be written as guo and shu 2013 6 f i e q ρ ω i 1 3 e i u 4 5 e i u 2 1 5 u u here ρ and w i are the density of the fluid and weighting coefficients respectively the corresponding weighting coefficients for the distribution functions are w 0 4 9 w i 1 2 3 4 1 9 and w i 5 6 7 8 1 36 the d 2 q 9 square lattice structure is shown in fig 1 in this model the speed of the central particle is zero the speeds for the rest particle and

for incompressible flow for low mach number ma u c s 0 1 where c s is the speed of sound and u is the inflow velocity guo et al 2008 in lbm the kinematic viscosity ϑ of the fluid is related to the relaxation time parameter by 7 ϑ δ x 2 c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t where δx is the lattice spacing in this study we choose δx δt 1 the macroscopic density ρ and velocity u are calculated as 8 ρ i 0 8 f i i 0 8 f i e q and 9 ρ u i 0 8 e i f i i 0 8 e i f i e q the pressure is calculated as 10 p ρ c s 2 one can also find the recovery of navier stokes equations theory and applications in the work of qian et al 1992 he and luo 1997 and sukop and thorne 2006 respectively the important parameters are the reynolds number re the side ratio sr the strouhal number st the separation ratio g the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l they are defined by the following formulas 11 r e u l ϑ 12 s r w l 13 s t f s l u 14 g g l 15 c d 2 f x ρ u 2 l 16 c l 2 f y ρ u 2 l where w l f s g f x and f y are the width of the rectangle length of the rectangle vortex shedding frequency the surface to surface distance between the cylinders drag force in the streamwise direction and lift force in the transverse direction respectively fig 2 shows a schematic view of tandem rectangles placed at the middle of the channel a cartesian coordinate system x y is used to present the flow where x and y are the incoming flow direction in the streamwise and transverse direction respectively l u l d l x and l y are an upstream distance from the inlet position to the front surface of the upstream cylinder c 1 downstream distance from the rear surface of the downstream cylinder c 2 to the exit of the domain length of the computational domain and height of the computational domain respectively c d and c l are the drag and lift forces in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively the origin 0 0 is the center of the rectangles at the entrance of the computational domain a parabolic velocity profile along the x direction is incorporated 17 u x 0 y u 1 y 1 y 18 v x 0 y 0 here u is the inflow velocity and x 2x l y and y 2y l y guo et al 2008 at the exit of the computational domain the boundary condition is x u 0 no slip boundary condition u v 0 is adopted for the surfaces of the rectangles mohamad 2019 furthermore a no slip boundary condition is also applied at the bottom and top walls of the computational domain the forces on the surfaces of the rectangles are calculated using the momentum exchange method yu et al 2003 3 grid independence and code validation the grid independence study and influence of the size of the computational domain are investigated before the computation in order to choose a suitable computational domain for better results with less computational time the mean drag coefficient c dmean and strouhal number for the two cylinders are computed for this purpose c dmean1 and c dmean2 represent the mean drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder respectively similarly st1 and st2 represent the strouhal number of the c 1 and c 2 respectively the computed results are tabulated in tables 1 4 for re 150 sr 1 and g 5 the percentage deviation in these tables is also given in brackets the results of l 20 with l 25 30 and 35 are reasonably small with the maximum deviation for c dmean2 approximately 3 0 table 1 confirming that the grid s effect is almost negligible with l 20 the results of β 11 14 16 and 20 are almost negligible with the maximum deviation for c dmean1 and c dmean2 approximately 3 2 and 3 1 respectively between β 11 and 14 table 2 confirming that the blockage effect is reasonably small with β 11 the l u influence was justified with l u 10l and l u 25l the maximum deviation between l u 10l and 25l is 1 7 for c dmean2 and 1 6 for st1 see table 3 furthermore the l d influence was justified with l d 35l and variation of l d from 40l to 55l the largest deviation between l d 35l and 55l is 1 8 for the st of the downstream cylinder see table 4 we adopt l 20 β 11 l u 10l and l d 35l for the rest of computations for code validation firstly we calculate a uniform flow with re 70 and 110 for sr 3 to assess the performance of the present method the results are qualitatively compared with the experimental results of chen and shao 2013 one can find the steady flow regime at re 70 fig 3 a and unsteady wake pattern at re 110 fig 3 b chen and shao 2013 also observed the steady flow regime at re 70 fig 3 c and unsteady wake pattern at re 110 fig 4 d chen and shao 2013 numerically found for re 110 that the st value is 0 132 in this study we found that the st value is 0 1326 at re 110 in order to further validate the present code we examine the onset of vortex shedding for flow past a square cylinder sr 1 by changing the reynolds numbers at re 1 fig 4 a the flow around a square cylinder is laminar and fully attached to the cylinder the flow nature is almost symmetric and has a clear stagnation point both in the front and at the rear of the cylinder for re 5 fig 4 b the flow is still laminar and separation occurs from both top side and bottom side enclosing two small symmetrical vortices behind the cylinder it can be seen that the vortices will generate a stable wake behind the square cylinder at least up to re 50 fig 4 d it is also observed that the two vortices grow linearly with increasing reynolds number and will remain attached to the cylinder fig 4 b d for re 55 fig 4 e the flow shows some instability the wake flow at some distance behind the square cylinder shows signs of a wavy character however to find out somehow the exact critical reynolds number value for such instability needs more computations between 50 and 55 with an increment of 0 1 moreover this critical reynolds value will be strongly dependent upon the computational domain in coming flow boundary conditions and numerical method sohankar et al 1995 have proposed a limiting value up to 54 saha et al 2003 show that re 56 is the critical value as the re increased the shedding of alternating vortices will now take place behind the cylinder fig 4 f for further validation of our developed code we have calculated different force coefficients like mean drag coefficient c dmean st root mean square value of drag coefficient c drms and lift coefficient c lrms for a single square cylinder at re 75 100 125 and 150 are calculated for both unconfined and confined flows the present numerical results are compared with the existing experimental okajima 1982 and norberg 1993 and numerical results sohankar et al 1995 saha et al 2003 singh et al 2008 guo et al 2008 gera et al 2010 sen et al 2011 in fig 5 a d the blockage ratios are different and we found 5 8 and 6 7 difference at re 100 with the experimental results of okajima 1982 and norberg 1993 for strouhal number our blockage ratios are the same as those reported by guo et al 2008 except guo et al 2008 all the results are dealing with the unconfined flows we are adopting confined flow situation in this study as a result one can see that our unconfined results for c dmean are in close agreement with the numerical results of sen et al 2011 on the other hand our confined results are predicts below as compared to sen et al 2011 for c dmean some results are close enough and some results are showing discrepancies sohankar et al 1995 adopted l u 11 1d l d 25 2d and β 5 for computations guo et al 2008 adopted l u 12 5d l d 50d and β 18 for computations 4 results and discussion calculations are carried out for flow around rectangles of different side ratios the effects of the separation ratio side ratio and reynolds number on flow features fluid forces flow transitions and strouhal number are studied four reynolds numbers re 75 100 125 and 150 and four side ratios sr 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 are considered the spacing between the cylinders is varied from 0 5 to 10 with 0 5 increments up to 5 and then 1 increment up to 10 fig 6 a e shows the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes revealed in this numerical study at fixed re 100 and sr 0 5 by changing the value of g it is important to state here that the flow regimes are named according to the behavior of vortex patterns and shear layers in the flow field the shear layers separated from cylinder c 1 reattach on the side surfaces of cylinder c 2 and roll up into vortices and shed alternatively behind cylinder c 2 as shown in fig 6 a the two tandem cylinders behave like a single cylinder in the flow field no vortex shedding occurs behind cylinder c 1 due to these flow features this flow regime is named the single bluff body flow regime zheng and alam 2019 made a similar observation for flow around three tandem square cylinders at re 150 and 1 2 g 3 sohankar 2012 also had similar observations for flow past two tandem square cylinders at g 0 5 again we observed the single bluff body flow regime as the spacing increased from g 0 5 to 1 5 the only difference is the streamwise and transverse spacing between the shed vortices behind the downstream cylinder as they move downstream at g 3 5 fig 6 c we observe an alternate shed vortex behind the upstream cylinder c 1 and have weak interaction with downstream cylinder c 2 this flow behavior is named a weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime another flow regime observed in this numerical study is the irregular flow regime fig 6 d at g 5 one fully developed vortex is observed from the lower side of the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder stops the alternate generation of vortex shed and also affects the vortex shed generation behind the downstream cylinder the two row vortex structure clearly seen up to some extent and then showing alternate generations of shed vortices near the exit of the domain we observe that the vortices between the gap have a strong interaction with the downstream cylinder c 2 fig 6 e also downstream the double row of vortices can be seen unlike other flow regimes vortices do not move in an alternate fashion behind the downstream cylinder c 2 that is why this flow regime is named a strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime in this flow regime the flow around two inline cylinders becomes more unsteady compared to a single bluff body flow regime especially near the exit of the domain the present results are in good agreement with the numerical results of sohankar 2012 our findings are in good agreement with the available studies of islam et al 2016a b for flow past three inline square cylinders they also observed such flow regimes for low reynolds numbers from the above analysis it is confirmed that the separation ratio strongly affects the flow features and the flow transition occurs once the value of g increased variation of c d and c l with time variation at fixed re 100 and sr 0 5 by changing the value of g is shown in fig 7 a j the solid and dotted lines present the upstream cylinder c 1 and downstream cylinder c 2 respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 in drag and lift coefficients present the c 1 and c 2 cylinders respectively it can be seen that the lift forces settle to a regular sinusoidal function after vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder in the case of a single bluff body flow regime fig 7 b d from fig 7 a c it can be observed that the drag coefficients of both cylinders are a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on cylinders except at second cylinder c 2 shown in fig 7 c we also observed a negative drag coefficient for downstream cylinder c 2 which is due to the pressure difference between the front and rear surface and as a result cylinder c 2 is pulled upstream see fig 7 a c it can also be seen that the lift amplitude of c 2 is larger than the lift amplitude of c 1 this ensures that after interacting with the downstream cylinder c 2 the flow finds reasonably enough free space to roll up in the form of shed vortices it should be noted that as the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicates either in phase or anti phase flow behavior it is observed that in most cases the lift coefficient amplitude for cylinder c 2 being larger than that of upstream cylinder c 1 largely attributed to the only vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder the lift forces of the two cylinders are in phase at weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime fig 7 f and nearly anti phase at strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime fig 7 j these plots clearly show that the vortex pattern behind the cylinders is dependent on the separation ratios furthermore the drag amplitude of the downstream cylinder considerably changes due to flow transitions see fig 7 e g i fig 8 a c show the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes at fixed sr 1 0 and g 4 by changing the value of re at re sr g 75 1 4 the flow is steady throughout the computational domain no unsteadiness observed for this combination in fig 8 a the flow is steady and separation occurs from both the top side and the bottom side of the upstream cylinder and quickly reattaches to the downstream cylinder this flow behavior is named as steady flow regime at re sr g 125 1 4 it can be seen that initially the flow is steady but in the far wake region of downstream cylinder c 2 it exhibits some unsteadiness fig 8 b some unsteady nature is clearly seen from the bottom side of the downstream cylinder this type of flow regime is categorized as a quasi unsteady flow regime at re sr g 150 1 4 it can be seen that the wake region is longer as compared to those presented in fig 8 a the waviness nature behind the downstream cylinder and two smalls shed vortices near downstream at the exit clearly illustrates the widewing of the streamwise distance of the vortices this flow behavior is named as wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime moreover in the wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime the shear layers from the upstream cylinder leading edges allow some fluid to go into the spacing between the two cylinders this confirms that the flow transition occurs by changing the values of re from 75 to 150 at fixed g and sr variation of drag and lift coefficients with time variation at fixed g 4 and sr 1 by changing the value of re is shown in fig 9 a f from fig 9 a it can be observed that the drag coefficients of both cylinders are a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on cylinders furthermore the lift coefficients of both cylinders are also constant in a steady flow regime we also observed a negative drag coefficient for downstream cylinder c 2 in both steady flow and quasi unsteady flow regimes fig 9 a c the time variation of lift coefficients shows sinusoidal variation for c 1 and c 2 in the case of quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes fig 9 d f it can also be seen that the lift amplitude of c 2 is larger than the lift amplitude of c 1 for both observed flow regimes from fig 9 e it can be observed that the drag coefficient of upstream cylinder c 1 is a straight line which shows that a constant drag force is exerted on c 1 and cylinder c 2 shows some small modulation fig 10 a c show the vorticity contour visualization corresponding to different flow regimes at fixed re 150 and g 1 by changing the value of sr in the next three graphs we will show how the sr affects the salient features of flow regimes and forces statistics for this we choose only one case at re 150 and g 1 it is clear from fig 10 a c that as the value of sr changes the flow transition occurs we observed the single bluff body flow regime steady flow regime and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime at sr 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively these features clearly illustrate that the side ratio considerably changes the flow features around rectangles variation of c d and c l with time variation at fixed re 150 and g 1 by changing the value of sr is shown in fig 11 a f in fig 11 a the drag force of the upstream cylinder shows a sinusoidal behavior at sr 0 25 and constant behavior at sr 0 5 as the side ratio increases the drag force of the upstream cylinder due to shear layer reattachment shows a straight line behavior on the other hand the drag force of the downstream cylinder confirms some small modulations in fig 11 e no straight line can be seen behind the downstream cylinder is attributed that the vortex pattern in the wake occurs behind the downstream cylinder interestingly in the case of c d1 the highest drag amplitude is observed at sr 0 25 the lift coefficients are changed their nature from antiphase to constant and then from constant to in phase once the flow transition occurs the drag coefficients are periodic in the case of a single bluff body flow regime it is observed that the frequency of the c d1 and c d2 are twice that of the c l1 and c l2 in the case of single bluff body flow regime the power spectrum of lift coefficients for observed flow regimes at various re g and sr is shown in fig 12 a d in fig 12 symbol e denotes the spectrum energy calculated from the lift coefficients and it is plotted against strouhal number st in fig 12 the highest peak refers to the primary vortex shedding frequencies while the other small harmonic represents the secondary cylinder interaction frequencies it can be seen that for irregular flow regime secondary peaks also exists along with the primary vortex shedding frequency in the spectrum graphs see fig 12 a irregular flow regime associated with st 0 4264 is the second harmonic of the primary vortex shedding frequency st 0 1449 see fig 12 a a small extra peak at st 0 4264 is almost three times larger than the strouhal number observed as a primary vortex shedding frequency st 0 1449 in fig 12 a this high frequency periodically changes the amplitude of cylinder c 2 no secondary frequency observed for other flow regimes except at irregular flow regimes the values of vortex shedding frequencies are decreased while changing the value of g from 0 5 to 1 5 and then showing an increasing behavior while increasing the value of g it is to be noted that no vortex shedding frequency is observed in the case of a steady flow regime due to constant lift coefficients behavior in the case of quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes we observed a considerably smaller amplitude of vortex shedding of c 1 as compared to c 2 fig 12 c and d the same strouhal values are observed in the case of a quasi unsteady flow regime moreover slightly different strouhal values are observed in the case of a wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime the power spectra confirm the existence of primary vortex shedding frequency for both quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes the power spectra confirm the existence of primary vortex shedding frequency for both quasi unsteady and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes the vortex shedding becomes slower for both cylinders as the side ratio increases at this chosen re and g the variation in c dmean of each rectangle with g for different fixed re and sr is presented in fig 13 a h the single cylinder sc value is also included for comparison the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the mean drag coefficient of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively variation in c dmean of the downstream cylinder at sr 0 25 and 0 5 for re 75 is too complicated fig 13 a it is to be noted that the c dmean2 jumps once the flow regime transition takes place with the increase in g from 5 to 10 at strongly vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive flow regime the freestream flow entrainment into the sap between the two cylinders leading to an increase in c dmean for the downstream cylinder at wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes a small increase in c dmean1 for all considered cases in this study are attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influence by the upstream cylinder c 1 the combined effect of the vortex shedding from the c 1 and c 2 cylinders results in an increased c dmean for the downstream cylinder the maximum c dmean of each rectangle observed at g 10 is attributed to the alternate vortex shedding behind the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder in wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes c dmean1 is almost constant and remarkably increases for the downstream cylinder the increase in c dmean2 is due to the increase of pressure on the front surface of the downstream cylinder it is seen that as the spacing value g increases the c dmean1 decrease then increase and approach a constant value representative of that of the single rectangle furthermore we see that in general the c dmean2 are sufficiently less than the c dmean of sc at various separation ratios this ensures that the presence of bluff bodies in the wake of others reduces the c dmean this finding agrees well with the results of igarashi and suzuki 1984 for flow around three tandem circular cylinders they observed for the middle cylinder and downstream cylinder in presence of the upstream cylinder however for lower values of g the results of both cylinders are lower than the single cylinder shown in fig 14 a h is the dependence of strouhal number on g for fixed re and sr the variation of the shedding frequency of the cylinder c 2 is different from that of the cylinder c 1 at re 75 for sr 0 25 fig 14 a and 0 75 fig 14 b the minimum values of strouhal numbers for both cylinders observed for 3 g 4 by changing the reynolds numbers and side ratios no serious variations are seen in st for two rectangles except few discontinuous jumps once the flow transitions occur the strouhal numbers for both cylinders are almost identical in wide wake shear layers reattachment strongly interactive vortex shedding and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes for all chosen reynolds numbers at sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 at sr 0 25 for all considered reynolds numbers by varying g the st1 and st2 are slightly different the strouhal number up to g 3 decreases for all considered cases mostly due to the shift of shear layer reattachment from the front surface of the cylinder c 2 to the rear surface the st variation becomes relatively insensitive to g for re 75 100 and 150 at sr 0 75 and 1 fig 14 b d h the st s are almost approaching to sc value for all considered sr and re cases as the g increased this ensures that at the relatively large spacing between the rectangles the shed vortices from the upstream cylinder fully developed from fig 16 it can be seen that the strouhal value of both cylinders decreases and approaches to its minimum value and then it shows increasing behavior approaching the sc value it is also observed that the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow for all considered cases except for the irregular flow regime where one to two small peaks observed for the downstream cylinder the noted jumps at different values of g could be due to sr effects the minimum position changes as g vary both the cylinders attain their minimum values at different g for fixed re and sr for example it is noted that both the st1 and st2 reach their minimum values at the gap spacing g 4 for the re 125 and sr 1 see fig 14 f shown in fig 15 a h is the dependence of the root mean square value of drag coefficients on g for fixed re and sr the c drms graphs clearly indicate that the value of sr is impacting furthermore the value of c drms for both cylinders appears to be more scattered than the c dmean st and c lrms for both cylinders and more depends on the sr other than re for example even when g is greater than 5 c drms of both cylinders still show a dependence on sr and re fig 15 e no serious variations are observed in c drms for both rectangles except at re sr 125 0 25 and 0 5 and 150 0 25 and 0 5 when the flow separation occurs a discontinuous jump observed in c drms for example a large discontinuous jump occurring in c drms for both cylinders at g 1 fig 15 b separates a steady flow regime from a single bluff body flow regime as sr changes from 0 25 to 1 it is noted that the c drms2 reach their maximum value as the separation ratio g increases for the sr 0 25 case the maximum value for the c drms2 occur at g 4 for re 75 with corresponding maximum value given by 0 1917 see fig 15 a for another sr 1 case the maximum c drms2 value occur at g 7 with corresponding maximum value given by 0 0542 fig 15 f the most sensitive variation is happening when the side ratio of the cylinders is about 0 25 and 0 5 for reynolds number 150 fig 15 g the difference in the c drms2 value where the maximum value of c drms2 occurs for the sr 0 25 and 1 cases indicates the effect of sr on the fluid forces acting on the rectangles it is observed that the maximum value of c drms2 appears at a lower value of g than the corresponding maxima for c dmean st and c lrms the noted changes at low and high values of g could be due to sr effects the root mean square values of lift coefficients at different side ratios are presented in fig 16 a h it is observed that as the vortex shedding mostly observed behind the downstream cylinder only c lrms is considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder a discontinuous jump in c lrms2 is observed for re 75 100 and 125 for all chosen side ratios in 3 g 5 once the flow regime transformation occurs between quasi unsteady irregular and wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regimes it can be seen that as the g increased the c lrms1 approaches to single rectangle value at re 75 for all chosen side ratios the c lrms2 is considerably higher than the sc value as the g value increased it is observed that at sr 0 25 for re 100 125 and 150 the c lrms2 is lower than the sc value fig 16 c e g the reverse trend is observed for sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 at re sr 75 0 25 and 0 5 and 75 re 150 0 75 the vortex shedding occurs from the cylinder c 2 c lrms2 is considerable higher for the cylinder c 2 than for cylinder c 1 we also observed that the c lrms1 c lrms2 at re g 100 5 g 10 and 125 and 150 4 g 10 at sr 0 25 in fig 16 it can be seen that for the higher separation ratio g 4 5 the c lrms1 is almost the same as the c lrms value observed for the isolated rectangle while for lower values of g 4 the c lrms1 is lower than the sc value this indicates that the position of shear layer reattachment for lower values of g and fully developed shed vortices for higher values of g have been observed behind the upstream cylinder the graphical representation of various flow regimes found in this numerical study is given in fig 17 a d at all the chosen g and re values for the fixed side ratio as the sr increases the occurrence of regime i reduced it can be observed that at low spacing ratios at sr 0 25 and 0 5 the single bluff body flow regime mostly occurs at all reynolds numbers at sr re 0 75 100 re 150 it occurs for g 0 5 at sr re 1 100 and 125 this flow regime occurs at g 0 5 also we did not observe the steady flow regime for sr 0 25 quasi unsteady flow regime for sr 0 5 and strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for sr 1 for all selected cases of re and g wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for all considered cases of sr and re for g 5 the position of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime changes from lower spacing ratios to a higher spacing ratio as the side ratio changed for fixed reynolds number at re sr g 75 0 25 1 5 4 125 0 25 4 and 5 150 0 25 4 and 5 150 0 5 4 5 125 0 75 4 and 4 5 150 0 75 4 5 and 150 1 4 and 4 5 125 0 75 4 and 4 5 150 0 25 4 and 5 150 0 5 4 5 150 0 75 4 5 and 150 1 4 and 4 5 the irregular flow regime occurs at re sr g 75 0 75 0 5 75 1 4 5 125 1 4 150 0 25 1 and 100 0 75 3 the quasi unsteady flow regime occurs the cases where we observed the negative mean drag coefficient of c 2 no strouhal numbers in case of steady flow regime and extra peak in power spectra of c 2 are given in tables 5 7 respectively the cases where we observed the negative value of c dmean of the downstream cylinder due to a highly negative pressure in the spacing between the two cylinders in the case of no strouhal values we found the steady flow regime for 75 re 150 and different g values the negative value of c dmean2 can be seen either at low separation ratio value g 0 5 or at high separation ratio value g 4 depending on sr 5 conclusions this paper presents a numerical study of a parabolic flow in a confined channel past two tandem rectangles using the lattice boltzmann method the separation ratio is varied from 0 5 to 10 four different values of reynolds numbers re 75 100 125 and 150 and side ratios sr 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 are considered for all computations important findings of this study are summarized below i on the basis of wake structure vortex shedding frequency time history analysis of forces power spectra of lift coefficients and fluid force seven different flow regimes are identified namely a single bluff body flow regime b steady flow regime c quasi unsteady flow regime d irregular flow regime e wide wake shear layers reattachment flow regime f strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and g weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime ii it was found that the drag on the downstream cylinder is significantly reduced in the presence of the upstream cylinder for all selected ranges the reduction almost becomes less if the gap spacing between the cylinders is larger than 5 diameters on the other hand the drag on the upstream cylinder is not considerably affected by the downstream cylinder iii it is further found that in the case of negative value of c dmean of the downstream cylinder due to a highly negative pressure in the spacing between the two cylinders in the case of no strouhal values we found the steady flow regime for 75 re 150 and different g values the negative value of c dmean2 can be seen either at low separation ratio value g 0 5 or at high separation ratio value g 4 depending on sr iv it is found that in most cases the lift coefficient amplitude for the downstream cylinder being larger than that of the upstream cylinder largely attributed to the only vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder we found that once the flow regime transition occurs the lift coefficients indicate either in phase or anti phase flow behavior the lift forces of the two cylinders are anti phase at strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and nearly in phase at weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime the dominancy of primary vortex shedding frequency was observed for all considered cases except for those cases where we found the irregular flow regime in the case of an irregular flow regime we found more than one peak in the power spectra of the downstream cylinder v it is found that the variation in c dmean of the downstream cylinder at sr 0 25 and 0 5 for re 75 is too complicated in the case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow strongly interactive vortex shedding flow and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regimes we observed a small increase in c dmean1 for all considered cases in this study is attributed to the reduction of wake width which confirms the weakened influenced by the upstream cylinder we further observed that the combined effect of the vortex shedding from the upstream and downstream cylinders results in an increased mean drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder it is shown that in general the c dmean2 are sufficiently less than the c dmean of an isolated cylinder at various separation ratios this ensures that the presence of bluff bodies in the wake of others reduces the drag forces vi the present results show that the minimum values of strouhal numbers for both cylinders observed for 3 g 4 by changing the reynolds numbers and side ratios no serious variations are seen in st for two rectangles except few discontinuous jumps once the flow transitions occur the present results further show that the strouhal numbers for both cylinders are almost identical in the case of wide wake shear layer reattachment flow regime strongly interactive vortex shedding flow regime and weakly interactive vortex shedding flow regime for all chosen reynolds numbers at sr 0 5 0 75 and 1 the root mean square value of drag coefficient was found for both cylinders appears to be more scattered than the mean drag coefficient strouhal number and root mean square value of lift coefficient for both cylinders and more depend on the side ratios other than reynolds numbers it was found that the most sensitive variation in terms of root mean square value of drag coefficient is happening when the side ratio of the cylinders is about 0 25 and 0 5 for reynolds number 150 it was found that as the vortex shedding mostly occurs behind the downstream cylinder only c lrms is considerably larger for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream cylinder it is shown that for the higher separation ratio g 4 5 the c lrms1 is almost the same as the c lrms value is observed for the isolated rectangle while for lower values of g 4 the c lrms1 is lower than the single cylinder value credit author statement mr zia ul islam a phd scholar developed the

20368,risk modeling of marine accidents involves many technical and environmental safety factors which cannot be predicted in advance the aim of this paper is to determine a safety criterion via risk assessment of marine accidents for a certain sea area the risk is assessed with a combination of two approaches one is based on a markov model and mcmc simulation and the other on three risk factors on the one hand the state space of the markov model consists of five states considering major accident types and its transition rates are obtained by mcmc simulation on the other hand accident occurrence probabilities are modeled based on the accident frequencies according to three risk factors sea state traffic density and ship s length respectively the risk value is estimated as a weighted average of results from the two approaches the safety criterion for navigation is determined based on a set of risk values obtained from the historical accident data for the sea area the proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example performing a sensitivity analysis and comparing the safety criterion with risk values for the accidents the comparing results are in good agreement keywords safety criterion marine accident markov model mcmc risk factor 1 introduction despite significant efforts to prevent the disaster at sea while the marine transportation is developing at high speed there are still a large number of accidents in the marine transportation industry marine accidents can cause loss of life and properties as well as tremendous damage to marine environment in the maritime safety committee msc of international maritime organization imo the structured formal safety assessment fsa was used to evaluate the accident risk in marine transportation although the fsa is internationally recognised as one of the best methods to describe risk it is not enough to consider all factors of risk in the marine transportation domain montewka et al 2014 many studies to model the accident risk in marine transportation focused on the simple statistics such as the expected value of accident frequency over time the occurrence of accident can be considered complicated probabilistic process therefore straightforward statistics such as accident frequency are not sufficient to predict accident risk over time the concept of accident risk is defined as probability of damaging and undesirable events in some marine systems or as a combination of the probability and the degree of possible human injury damage to property and damage to the environment vanem et al 2008 aven 2010 several methodologies have been made to assess the quantitative accident risk of operation in the offshore and marine industries abaei et al 2018 celik et al 2010 david et al 2013 mazaheri et al 2013 compared some models for ship grounding from the view point of assessment and prevention of some risks li et al 2012 also compared the several accident risk models for marine transportation systems and concluded that there is no single model applicable to all types of marine systems some researchers considered only one type of marine accident and assessed the accident risk among all types of accidents collision and grounding are of the most frequent types and risk assessments for them were often proposed goerlandt et al 2012 modeled marine collision using ship traffic data and defined risk as collision probability at sea merrick et al 2005 proposed simulation model for probabilistic risk assessment in maritime transportation systems and discussed its uncertainty wang et al 2002 analysed the accident risk on collision and grounding from the structural strength of ships goerlandt and kujala 2014 investigated a case study of ship ship collision and highlighted the limitations of the previous risk analysis methods montewka et al 2012 defined minimum distance to collision mdtc as the shortest distance between two ships at which they must take evasive actions to avoid a ship ship collision and estimated the probability of maritime accidents using a ship motion model for a range of ship types courses and speeds and thus its dynamic nature zhang et al 2016 proposed a model for near miss ship ship encounters by screening maritime traffic data from the automatic identification system ais including distance between two ships relative velocity course and ship s size and evaluated the collision risk and mdtc to prevent the ship ship collision akyuz 2015 dealt with potential navigational contingencies in particular grounding incident and proposed a hybrid accident analysis method by using accident analyse mapping accimap and analytical network process anp methods celik and akyuz 2016 integrated decision making trail and evaluation laboratory dematel method with interval type 2 fuzzy sets it2fss to analyse significant accident causal factors and their effects in case of ship collision to reduce the fatality by fire accidents and improve the safety of fireproofing in ship design some researchers proposed a probabilistic method for fatality estimation of fire accidents focusing on the evacuation of crews and passengers wu et al 2018 in maritime transportation some researches have occurred to evaluate the relation between traffic density traffic speed and maritime risk by using ais kang et al 2018 zaman et al 2015 merrick et al 2003 evaluated the effect of traffic density on the level of congestion on the waterway and on the safety of vessels in the area when increasing the frequency and coverage of ferry service some papers focused on human error which is one of the most prevalent causes of marine accidents akyuz 2017 islam et al 2018 ung 2018 liu et al 2005 to establish the navigation safety system after analysing the data of 107 marine incidents classified the accidents into four types by the gray clustering method and concluded that the crew s negligence accounts for 93 5 for the cause of all accidents celik and cebi 2009 proposed an analytical system to analyse and classify the human factors based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp in order to identify the role of human errors in marine accidents in probabilistic risk assessment markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation has been widely used mcmc approaches to sampling directly from the joint posterior distribution of unknown model parameters led to tremendous advances in bayesian inference capability in a wide variety of fields kelly and smith 2009 wang et al 2012 introduced a common type of mcmc algorithm i e gibbs sampling into the aviation sector and realised the air traffic forecast on the airport faghih roohi et al 2014 proposed an accident model for assessing accident risk in marine transportation based on markov modelling and mcmc simulation a three state continuous time markov model was used to estimate accident occurrence rates and probabilities bayesian network or dynamic bayesian network were also suggested to model the maritime safety and estimate the maritime accident risk akhtar and utne 2014 hänninen 2014 jiang and lu 2020 in light of the above there is lack of study in the literature on markov model whose state space is a set of major accident types such as collision and grounding for assessing marine accident risk to our best knowledge there have been few studies on determining safety criterion by considering such risk factors as current sea state traffic density and ship s length the paper aims at determining a safety criterion in a certain sea area based on the newly proposed two approaches to assessment of marine accident risk section 2 proposes two approaches to assess the risk and determines the safety criterion in section 3 the proposed method is illustrated with a case study conclusions and potential contributions of the study are given in section 4 2 methods 2 1 markov modeling with five states and mcmc simulation marine accidents at sea are stochastic processes occurring at any time and place due to different causes therefore most of them can have the property of markov chain assuming that a sequence of marine accidents is a homogeneous markov process we propose a continuous time markov model with state space based on major accident types its transition rate and probability are the accident occurrence rate and probability respectively marine accident cases are investigated to specify the state space of the model of all the marine accidents occurred in the gulf of finland in 1997 1999 and 2001 2006 48 was due to grounding and 20 due to collisions being the most common types kujala 2009 the waterway accidents data investigation in the past decade showed that collision 60 3 was the dominant cause imran et al 2017 besides collision contact and grounding fire accident was a common type of the marine accident soares and teixeira 2001 roberts et al 2013 weng and yang 2015 emsa in its annual overview of marine casualties and incidents presented collision contact damage to ship equipment and grounding stranding as the major accidents to ships from 2014 to 2019 emsa 2020 with these considerations we suggested five states for the state space of the markov model according to major marine accident types as follows s0 normal state s1 collision state s2 contact state s3 grounding state s4 disabled state when an accident occurs in a vessel at sea a transition will occur from one state to another in the markov model as shown in table 1 fig 1 shows transition diagram between states in the markov model in fig 1 q i j i j

type principal dimensions etc the meteorological conditions sea state wind speed visibility etc balmat el al 2011 and other dynamic parameters ship speed traffic density ship s position in a waterway etc for the reason that the approach described in section 2 1 depends only on the past marine accident data and doesn t reflect the current situation of the sea area or waterway we propose another risk assessment model based on three risk factors sea state traffic density in the sea area or waterway and ship s length probability of an accident occurring at all is clearly dependent upon the routeing of the ship which is affected by the weather sea state and traffic density met rawson and tupper 2005 sea states can be characterised by the significant wave height osinowo and lin 2017 hereafter significant wave height is simply referred to as wave height traffic density is generally determined by the number of ships which are in service in a sea area or waterway during a day for ship s size ship s length out of principal dimensions by which ship s displacement or gross tonnage can be calculated is taken they can be obtained by using ais vts arpa and inmarsat data now we suppose three events as follows event a a marine accident which occurs in current wave height event b a marine accident which occurs in current traffic density event c a marine accident which occurs in a ship of the length of interest in this approach accident risk r 2 is defined as probability with which an accident occurs in a ship of interest in consideration of current wave height and traffic density then the risk r 2 is expressed as follows 11 r 2 p a b c p a p b p c p a b p a c p b c p a b c assuming that the events a b and c are mutually exclusive 12 r 2 p a p b p c p a p b p a p c p b p c p a p b p c p a p b and p c are the probabilities of events a b and c respectively however the probabilities are impossible to estimate by the number of occurrences of a certain event throughout a probability experiment therefore the frequencies of the past marine accidents are investigated with respect to the wave height traffic density and ship s length respectively e g fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the frequencies tend to follow some probabilistic distributions now we consider rayleigh distribution for the frequencies with respect to wave height and traffic density while normal distribution for the frequency with respect to ship s length we let the frequencies be random variables n a n b and n c and let the probability density functions of them be f a f b and f c respectively eq 13 13 n

three assumptions are made about three risk factors to estimate the p a p b and p c i marine accidents occurred in a sea state of lower wave height will probably occur in a sea state of higher wave height as well which means that the higher the wave height is the more dangerous the navigation is ii marine accidents occurred in lower traffic density will probably occur in higher traffic density as well which means the higher the traffic density is the more dangerous the navigation is iii larger ships will be safer than smaller ones it is generally recognised that the smaller the ship is the more fatal the accidents occurred to it are under the above assumptions we estimate the probabilities of three events by the cumulative distribution functions of the frequencies with respect to three factors respectively given wave height h traffic density ρ and ship s length l the probabilities are 14 p a 0 h f a x μ a d x 15 p b 0 ρ f b x μ b d x 16 p c 1 0 l f c x μ c σ c d x as a result the risk r 2 is calculated by eq 12 the error analysis associated with this approach is discussed in section 3 in detail 2 3 determination of a safety criterion the marine accident risk is assessed with a combination of the two approaches section 2 1 and 2 2 and a safety criterion for a given sea area is determined the marine accident risk r is estimated as a weighted average of two risk values r 1 and r 2 eq 17 17 r k 1 r 1 k 2 r 2 where k 1 k 2 are the weight coefficients 18 k 1 k 2 1 these weight coefficients reflect whether the user gives more importance to the risk value based on the historical accident data or based on such current situation as sea state traffic density and ship s length it should be noted that the risk r involves the historical accident data for the sea area and current situation of the navigation based on the risk assessment we propose a safety criterion in a given sea area the safety criterion is composed of two threshold values i e threshold value of danger and threshold value of warning letting the threshold values of danger and warning be d 0 and w 0 respectively they can be obtained as follows i based on the historical data of accidents occurred in a given sea area the risk is assessed for each accident case as a result a set of n risk values r 1 r 2 r n is collected from n accident cases ii assuming that the risk values follow a normal distribution the parameters of the distribution are determined from the risk value set eq 19 19 r n μ r σ r where μ r and σ r are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution iii the threshold value of danger is represented as μ r and the threshold value of warning as μ r σ r i e 20 d 0 μ r w 0 μ r σ r let the estimated risk for a ship to navigate in the sea area be r in case that r d 0 then it is recognised as danger situation and it is strongly recommended to keep the ship from navigating in case that w 0 r d o then it is recognised as warning situation and it is necessary for the master and seafarers to keep alert during navigation if r w 0 it is recognised as safe situation whenever there occurs a marine accident in the sea area the historical data is updated by adding the new accident case and consequently the threshold values of danger and warning are also updated 3 results and discussion 3 1 risk assessment in this section the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study the purpose is to establish the safety criterion of vessels in a port we referred to marine accident reports by the port authority the reported accident data were appropriate to the proposed method table 2 shows the marine accident frequencies recorded in the port from 2013 to 2019 firstly we assessed the risk based on the approach described in section 2 1 uniform distributions were considered for the prior distributions to estimate the accident occurrence rates for example uniform 25 37 was used for the prior distribution of collision accident rate there are a number of mcmc simulation methods such as gibbs sampling slice sampling and metropolis hastings algorithm of these methods the slice sampling algorithm is widely used with bayesian inference because of its simplicity and efficiency rostami et al 2013 therefore the slice sampling algorithm was chosen and implemented in matlab r2014a software the algorithm ran 1000 times with the initial value of the expected value of the prior distribution the sampled occurrence rates and mean values for each accident type are shown in fig 3 as can be seen in figs 3 and 1000 times were enough for the mean values of the accident occurrence rates to converge the resulting occurrence rates and standard deviations are shown in table 3 for four major accident types substituting the accident occurrence rates into eq 5 then r 1 0 228 to check the stability of the proposed markov model we performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the initial occurrence rate in the slice sampling algorithm for example let u n i f o r m a 01 b 01 be the prior distribution of collision occurrence rate q 01 changing the initial occurrence rate by a step length of b 01 a 01 10 the mcmc simulation was implemented repeatedly and the error was computed as a result of the sensitivity analysis the simulated occurrence rates had the absolute errors less than 5 and were not affected significantly by the initial rates secondly we assessed the risk based on the approach described in section 2 2 based on the detailed accident data for the port the frequencies probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions were modeled with respect to wave height traffic density and ship s length respectively fig 4 table 4 shows the results of our modeling including standard deviations given the current sea state traffic density and ship s length the results of accident risk assessments were obtained using eq 14 16 as shown in table 5 substituting the risk values into eq 12 then r 2 0 97 given that k 1 0 7 and k 2 0 3 then r 0 451 where r is the resulting risk value 3 2 safety criterion determination we obtained the safety criterion for the port following the steps specified in section 2 3 the risk values were calculated using the 7 year accident data in table 2 to obtain a set of risk values assuming that the resulting risk values follow a normal distribution then μ r 0 546 and σ r 0 085 where μ r and σ r are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution respectively fig 5 therefore the resulting threshold values of danger and warning are 21 d 0 0 546 w 0 0 461 it can be seen that r was smaller than w 0 i e r w 0 if not sailors should be warned of this risk in navigation to evaluate the accuracy of the safety criterion the safety criterion using accident data from 2013 to 2018 for the port was determined and then was compared to the risk values for the accident data of the year 2019 fig 6 as a result it was found that the calculated risk values for more than 95 of the accidents occurred in 2019 were greater than the threshold value of danger or between the threshold values of danger and warning on the contrary for most of the safe navigations the risk values were smaller than the threshold value of warning or between the threshold values of danger and warning in fig 6 the distinction between accidents and non accidents is rather clear with a few mixed points the distinction can be related to ship s length which is to be included in the investigation for marine accidents we didn t include accident records for ships less than 30 m in length in our study also it can be said that it is difficult to accurately measure the wave height and traffic density when the accident occurs therefore oow master can use the safety criterion for a sea area of interest and its estimated risk value to get the reasonable description of the area they can also be informed of which would be more dangerous collision or grounding the application of the proposed method according to ship types would give more accurate results and our computations at different weight coefficients have shown that the weight coefficients could be assumed to be of little significance the number of years is also important for investigation we investigated the marine accidents for the past 6 7 years this suggests that the greater the number of years the more accurate results would be obtained however it should be noted that the proposed method could distinguish the accidents and non accidents by the risk values and give the practical contribution for the ship operators 4 conclusions to estimate marine accident risks we conducted markov modeling and mcmc simulation and made a probability analysis considering current sea state traffic density and ship s length in a certain sea area or waterway then the safety criterion was established based on the historical accident data of the sea area markov modeling was performed for five states according to the major marine accident types mcmc simulation was applied to predict the occurrence rates and the accident risks were then calculated using the markov model the stability of the model was verified by a sensitivity analysis the results showed that the simulated occurrence rates were not affected significantly by the initial rates although markov modeling and mcmc simulation are not new for probability simulation it is novel that the proposed markov model consists of five states according to the major accident types also it should be noted that the proposed method is significant that it was based on three risk factors a criterion for safe navigation was established based on the proposed method the advantages of this method are its simplicity flexibility applicable to any type of marine accidents and that there is no need for large scale data collection the contribution of this paper is to propose a kind of marine chart based on the safety criterion so that risks en route could be warned of in advance for safe navigation as well as rescue equipment could be tapped in an effective way in order to minimize loss of life and damage to properties and environment in case of emergencies in addition the proposed method would offer more accurate results as more accident data accumulate the number and other detailed records of accidents are updated regularly over time e g annually further studies should be focused on determining the range of lengths of ships to be investigated for the proposed method and on what to do in case that traffic density is not available the authors will continue to research for more accurate and comprehensive assessment of marine accident risk by considering other aspects of marine accidents including human s errors credit authorship contribution statement min

20368,risk modeling of marine accidents involves many technical and environmental safety factors which cannot be predicted in advance the aim of this paper is to determine a safety criterion via risk assessment of marine accidents for a certain sea area the risk is assessed with a combination of two approaches one is based on a markov model and mcmc simulation and the other on three risk factors on the one hand the state space of the markov model consists of five states considering major accident types and its transition rates are obtained by mcmc simulation on the other hand accident occurrence probabilities are modeled based on the accident frequencies according to three risk factors sea state traffic density and ship s length respectively the risk value is estimated as a weighted average of results from the two approaches the safety criterion for navigation is determined based on a set of risk values obtained from the historical accident data for the sea area the proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example performing a sensitivity analysis and comparing the safety criterion with risk values for the accidents the comparing results are in good agreement keywords safety criterion marine accident markov model mcmc risk factor 1 introduction despite significant efforts to prevent the disaster at sea while the marine transportation is developing at high speed there are still a large number of accidents in the marine transportation industry marine accidents can cause loss of life and properties as well as tremendous damage to marine environment in the maritime safety committee msc of international maritime organization imo the structured formal safety assessment fsa was used to evaluate the accident risk in marine transportation although the fsa is internationally recognised as one of the best methods to describe risk it is not enough to consider all factors of risk in the marine transportation domain montewka et al 2014 many studies to model the accident risk in marine transportation focused on the simple statistics such as the expected value of accident frequency over time the occurrence of accident can be considered complicated probabilistic process therefore straightforward statistics such as accident frequency are not sufficient to predict accident risk over time the concept of accident risk is defined as probability of damaging and undesirable events in some marine systems or as a combination of the probability and the degree of possible human injury damage to property and damage to the environment vanem et al 2008 aven 2010 several methodologies have been made to assess the quantitative accident risk of operation in the offshore and marine industries abaei et al 2018 celik et al 2010 david et al 2013 mazaheri et al 2013 compared some models for ship grounding from the view point of assessment and prevention of some risks li et al 2012 also compared the several accident risk models for marine transportation systems and concluded that there is no single model applicable to all types of marine systems some researchers considered only one type of marine accident and assessed the accident risk among all types of accidents collision and grounding are of the most frequent types and risk assessments for them were often proposed goerlandt et al 2012 modeled marine collision using ship traffic data and defined risk as collision probability at sea merrick et al 2005 proposed simulation model for probabilistic risk assessment in maritime transportation systems and discussed its uncertainty wang et al 2002 analysed the accident risk on collision and grounding from the structural strength of ships goerlandt and kujala 2014 investigated a case study of ship ship collision and highlighted the limitations of the previous risk analysis methods montewka et al 2012 defined minimum distance to collision mdtc as the shortest distance between two ships at which they must take evasive actions to avoid a ship ship collision and estimated the probability of maritime accidents using a ship motion model for a range of ship types courses and speeds and thus its dynamic nature zhang et al 2016 proposed a model for near miss ship ship encounters by screening maritime traffic data from the automatic identification system ais including distance between two ships relative velocity course and ship s size and evaluated the collision risk and mdtc to prevent the ship ship collision akyuz 2015 dealt with potential navigational contingencies in particular grounding incident and proposed a hybrid accident analysis method by using accident analyse mapping accimap and analytical network process anp methods celik and akyuz 2016 integrated decision making trail and evaluation laboratory dematel method with interval type 2 fuzzy sets it2fss to analyse significant accident causal factors and their effects in case of ship collision to reduce the fatality by fire accidents and improve the safety of fireproofing in ship design some researchers proposed a probabilistic method for fatality estimation of fire accidents focusing on the evacuation of crews and passengers wu et al 2018 in maritime transportation some researches have occurred to evaluate the relation between traffic density traffic speed and maritime risk by using ais kang et al 2018 zaman et al 2015 merrick et al 2003 evaluated the effect of traffic density on the level of congestion on the waterway and on the safety of vessels in the area when increasing the frequency and coverage of ferry service some papers focused on human error which is one of the most prevalent causes of marine accidents akyuz 2017 islam et al 2018 ung 2018 liu et al 2005 to establish the navigation safety system after analysing the data of 107 marine incidents classified the accidents into four types by the gray clustering method and concluded that the crew s negligence accounts for 93 5 for the cause of all accidents celik and cebi 2009 proposed an analytical system to analyse and classify the human factors based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp in order to identify the role of human errors in marine accidents in probabilistic risk assessment markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation has been widely used mcmc approaches to sampling directly from the joint posterior distribution of unknown model parameters led to tremendous advances in bayesian inference capability in a wide variety of fields kelly and smith 2009 wang et al 2012 introduced a common type of mcmc algorithm i e gibbs sampling into the aviation sector and realised the air traffic forecast on the airport faghih roohi et al 2014 proposed an accident model for assessing accident risk in marine transportation based on markov modelling and mcmc simulation a three state continuous time markov model was used to estimate accident occurrence rates and probabilities bayesian network or dynamic bayesian network were also suggested to model the maritime safety and estimate the maritime accident risk akhtar and utne 2014 hänninen 2014 jiang and lu 2020 in light of the above there is lack of study in the literature on markov model whose state space is a set of major accident types such as collision and grounding for assessing marine accident risk to our best knowledge there have been few studies on determining safety criterion by considering such risk factors as current sea state traffic density and ship s length the paper aims at determining a safety criterion in a certain sea area based on the newly proposed two approaches to assessment of marine accident risk section 2 proposes two approaches to assess the risk and determines the safety criterion in section 3 the proposed method is illustrated with a case study conclusions and potential contributions of the study are given in section 4 2 methods 2 1 markov modeling with five states and mcmc simulation marine accidents at sea are stochastic processes occurring at any time and place due to different causes therefore most of them can have the property of markov chain assuming that a sequence of marine accidents is a homogeneous markov process we propose a continuous time markov model with state space based on major accident types its transition rate and probability are the accident occurrence rate and probability respectively marine accident cases are investigated to specify the state space of the model of all the marine accidents occurred in the gulf of finland in 1997 1999 and 2001 2006 48 was due to grounding and 20 due to collisions being the most common types kujala 2009 the waterway accidents data investigation in the past decade showed that collision 60 3 was the dominant cause imran et al 2017 besides collision contact and grounding fire accident was a common type of the marine accident soares and teixeira 2001 roberts et al 2013 weng and yang 2015 emsa in its annual overview of marine casualties and incidents presented collision contact damage to ship equipment and grounding stranding as the major accidents to ships from 2014 to 2019 emsa 2020 with these considerations we suggested five states for the state space of the markov model according to major marine accident types as follows s0 normal state s1 collision state s2 contact state s3 grounding state s4 disabled state when an accident occurs in a vessel at sea a transition will occur from one state to another in the markov model as shown in table 1 fig 1 shows transition diagram between states in the markov model in fig 1 q i j i j

traffic density and ship s length the results of accident risk assessments were obtained using eq 14 16 as shown in table 5 substituting the risk values into eq 12 then r 2 0 97 given that k 1 0 7 and k 2 0 3 then r 0 451 where r is the resulting risk value 3 2 safety criterion determination we obtained the safety criterion for the port following the steps specified in section 2 3 the risk values were calculated using the 7 year accident data in table 2 to obtain a set of risk values assuming that the resulting risk values follow a normal distribution then μ r 0 546 and σ r 0 085 where μ r and σ r are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution respectively fig 5 therefore the resulting threshold values of danger and warning are 21 d 0 0 546 w 0 0 461 it can be seen that r was smaller than w 0 i e r w 0 if not sailors should be warned of this risk in navigation to evaluate the accuracy of the safety criterion the safety criterion using accident data from 2013 to 2018 for the port was determined and then was compared to the risk values for the accident data of the year 2019 fig 6 as a result it was found that the calculated risk values for more than 95 of the accidents occurred in 2019 were greater than the threshold value of danger or between the threshold values of danger and warning on the contrary for most of the safe navigations the risk values were smaller than the threshold value of warning or between the threshold values of danger and warning in fig 6 the distinction between accidents and non accidents is rather clear with a few mixed points the distinction can be related to ship s length which is to be included in the investigation for marine accidents we didn t include accident records for ships less than 30 m in length in our study also it can be said that it is difficult to accurately measure the wave height and traffic density when the accident occurs therefore oow master can use the safety criterion for a sea area of interest and its estimated risk value to get the reasonable description of the area they can also be informed of which would be more dangerous collision or grounding the application of the proposed method according to ship types would give more accurate results and our computations at different weight coefficients have shown that the weight coefficients could be assumed to be of little significance the number of years is also important for investigation we investigated the marine accidents for the past 6 7 years this suggests that the greater the number of years the more accurate results would be obtained however it should be noted that the proposed method could distinguish the accidents and non accidents by the risk values and give the practical contribution for the ship operators 4 conclusions to estimate marine accident risks we conducted markov modeling and mcmc simulation and made a probability analysis considering current sea state traffic density and ship s length in a certain sea area or waterway then the safety criterion was established based on the historical accident data of the sea area markov modeling was performed for five states according to the major marine accident types mcmc simulation was applied to predict the occurrence rates and the accident risks were then calculated using the markov model the stability of the model was verified by a sensitivity analysis the results showed that the simulated occurrence rates were not affected significantly by the initial rates although markov modeling and mcmc simulation are not new for probability simulation it is novel that the proposed markov model consists of five states according to the major accident types also it should be noted that the proposed method is significant that it was based on three risk factors a criterion for safe navigation was established based on the proposed method the advantages of this method are its simplicity flexibility applicable to any type of marine accidents and that there is no need for large scale data collection the contribution of this paper is to propose a kind of marine chart based on the safety criterion so that risks en route could be warned of in advance for safe navigation as well as rescue equipment could be tapped in an effective way in order to minimize loss of life and damage to properties and environment in case of emergencies in addition the proposed method would offer more accurate results as more accident data accumulate the number and other detailed records of accidents are updated regularly over time e g annually further studies should be focused on determining the range of lengths of ships to be investigated for the proposed method and on what to do in case that traffic density is not available the authors will continue to research for more accurate and comprehensive assessment of marine accident risk by considering other aspects of marine accidents including human s errors credit authorship contribution statement min

20369,a very simple non linear operator technique is introduced for creating localised extreme wave events from underlying linear sea wave models both maximal and sub maximal extreme events can be generated the technique for generating extreme waves is intended as the basis of a practical tool for marine engineers however it does reflect the effect s of the processes involved in the nonlinear propagation of sea waves extreme wave model phase cancellation intermode energy transfer dear editor 1 introduction the practical significance of extreme wave events that are highly localised in time and space within globally less severe sea conditions has stimulated significant research interest the following are a sample of the literature which provide descriptions of such events and their consequences lehner et al 2002 rosenthal and lehner s 2008 didenkulova et al 2006 haver 2004 dysthe et al 2008 stansell 2004 rosenthal and lehner s 2008 early attempts to describe this phenomenon in terms of the traditional linear wave statistics developed by pioneers such as longuette higgins 1952 did not in general yield fruit however under certain bathymetries that lead to wave focussing it was possible to describe such events in terms of linear waves kurkin and pelinovsk 2002 clearly this does not explain the presence of such waves observed in the absence of such special topographic conditions while in principle a linear fourier based approach is able to describe any sea surface profile to do so requires very specific coherent magnitude and phase relationships between components this requirement is at odds with the standard oceanographic model within which wave characteristics are random or at most very weakly correlated goda et al 1979 the limitations of the applicability of linear wave theory prompted interest in nonlinear models to describe emergent extreme wave events a large variety of model systems have been tried as evidenced in the reviews of the subject manzetti 2018 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 often borrowing from other disciplines alidi and panajtov 2017 kibler et al 2010 residori et al 2016 however particular attention has been given to the modified nonlinear scrödinger equation a small sample of which is smith 1976 dai et al 2012 kruglov 2005 osborne et al 2000 such treatments include extreme events resulting from wave interactions with both currents and also with the very energetic large shed eddies that are often found far from prevailing currents where they are generated with very few exceptions onorato et al 2013 most such nonlinear formalisms do not match well with the needs of engineers interested in simple wave generating tools typical applications being the exploration of the responses of vessels and structures subject to the extreme wave events furthermore most treatments do not readily lend themselves to describing the emergence of extreme waves from the underlying wave background for a wide range of different multi directional sea conditions the present approach is intended to make some progress towards the eventual creation of a tool designed for this role it also transpires that the methodology and its extensions reflect many of the characteristics of typical propagating nonlinear events 1 1 the approach in summary the method presented here involves first creating a traditional sea model appropriate to the context of interest this constitutes the underlying wave system from which the extreme event emerges a nonlinear phase cancellation operator is then applied to the sea model description from a practical computational perspective this involves incorporating a function localised in time and space which partially or totally cancels the phases of the wave components as stated in the introduction a fourier representation with a very specific set of interrelated parameters can describe any arbitrary profile but that such a requirement applied globally is in conflict with well established oceanographic principles it is also well known that the maximum value of a fourier sum or integral as employed in wave descriptions has a maximum value when all the components are in phase and at their respective maxima this strongly suggests that a model encompassing some local form of phase modification may offer promise as a technique for creating emergent extreme waves from the prevailing wave spectrum in this context latifah and van groesen 2016 explored restricting the range of phases to obtain what they term pseudo maximal wave events the present approach also addresses the issue of phase relationships but does so via a nonlinear phase cancelling operator γ this operator induces a highly localised extreme wave event when applied to a traditional statistically stationary multi directional wave model of the sea surface elevation 2 the one dimensional problem the approach is motivated by considering the purely one dimensional problem of an emerging transient large event that achieves its absolute maximum at a single value of the coordinate η this motivating problem involves a function f η typified by a fourier sum or integral which is acted upon by a non linear operator γ this results in a new function that transiently grows in size over a finite interval then decays back to its previous form in the first case the maximum will correspond to the absolute maximum value of f η this requirement will then be relaxed the function f η will be described by 1 f η 1 2 π f k e j k η d k a continuous operator γ now induces a phase shifting function ϕ k η onto f η of the form 2 γ f η 1 2 π f k e j k η e j ϕ k η d k i e 3 γ f η 1 2 π f k e j f k ϕ k η e j k η d k which induces an absolute maximum at η 0 i e 4 γ f η η 0 1 2 π f k d k the operator γ is clearly nonlinear because its form varies with that of the function upon which it operates it is defined over the whole domain but only significantly departs from unity over a local region about η 0 2 1 the properties required of ϕ k η the above requires that γ and hence ϕ k η exhibit a set of properties 1 at time η 0 the function ϕ k η has the form 5 ϕ k 0 e j f k 2 the operator γ may be considered as equivalent to a nonlinear system whose input is f η and whose output at η 0 is the absolute maximum of f η 3 with a view to an extension to wave propagation on physical grounds it is necessary to assume that ϕ k η is continuous in both k and η 4 the operator γ is defined globally but only departs from unity locally ensuring it is a continuous function c 2 2 choosing a possible form for ϕ k η and it s consequences combining the above properties suggests the simplest possible form for ϕ k η is 6 ϕ k μ f k u η where u η is some form of localised window function with a maximum value of unity at η 0 this implies that u η acts equally on all wavenumber components a more sophisticated choice would allow u to be dispersive i e u u k η 2 3 hence equation 3 becomes 7 γ f η 1 2 π f k e j f k u k η e j k η d k i e 8 γ f η 1 2 π f k e j 1 u η f k e j k η d k 3 actual sea waves the extension of the previous one dimensional problem to long crested irregular linear sea waves is immediate with f t becoming f x t 9 f x t 1 2 π f k e j k x ω k t d k the absolute maximum will achieved at x 0 t 0 and again be given by 10 γ f x t x 0 t 0 1 2 π f k d k hence the effect of the nonlinear operator γ will be to induce an absolute maximum at the coordinates x 0 t 0 which will be produced by both temporal and spatial phase shifting i e 11 γ f t 1 2 π f ω e j k x ω k t f k ϕ k x t d k where ω k introduces the dispersion relationship the simplest choice of ϕ k x t is then 12 ϕ k x t f k u k t x 3 1 hence equation 12 becomes 13 γ f t 1 2 π f k e j 1 u k x t f k e j k x ω k t d k equation 13 means that the standard linear deep water gravity wave equation can be generalised in terms of a propagating wave with a spectrum which is typically statistically stationary but very locally non stationary f k x t 14 γ f t 1 2 π f k x t e j k x k g t d k where 15 f k x t f k e j 1 u k t x f k the width in space and time where the extreme wave event begins to emerge will be characterised by the x and t scales λ x and λ t respectively i e 16 u k x t u k x λ x t λ t 3 2 non maximum waves so far it has been assumed that the phase cancellation is complete leading to an absolute maximum if however ϕ k x t is scaled by some factor α where 0 α 1 then only partial cancellation of the initial phases occurs leading to non maximal events thus the non stationary spectrum f k x t in equation 15 generalises to 17 f k x t f k e j 1 α u k t x f k 3 3 alternative coordinates the expressions obtained give rise to a wave which peaks at the spatial and temporal origins a simple change of coordinates to x x x m t t t m allows the freak wave to be described at some arbitrary location x m t m equation 14 then taking the form 18 γ f t 1 2 π f k e j k x m ω k t m 1 α u x x m λ x t t m λ m f k e j k x ω k t d k equation 18 can again be written as the propagation of a linear gravity wave with a locally non stationary spectrum f x t x m t m k 19 γ f t 1 2 π f x t x m t m k e j k

becoming 21 f r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ e j ω 2 g r cos θ φ ω t k d k d φ i e 22 f r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t f k φ k d k d φ 3 5 the corresponding operator γ induces 23 γ f r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t f k φ e j ϕ f k φ k φ r θ t k d k d φ where the function ϕ f k φ k φ r θ t induces the phase cancellation process which can be anisotrpic the simplest case which carries over from the irregular long crested one spatial dimensional situation is 24 ϕ f k φ k φ r θ t α k r θ t u k r θ t f k φ as in the one dimensional case u k r θ t is a local window function in k r θ t with a maximum value of unity at r 0 θ 0 t 0 in the local coordinate frame however in this two dimensional example the function α that controls the degree of phase cancellation has now been generalised into a function of k r θ t this allows the phase cancellation process to be anisotropic typically in both strength and length scale as in the long crested wave case equation 24 means that the standard two dimensional linear deep water gravity wave equation can be generalised in terms of a propagating wave with a spectrum which is typically statistically stationary but very locally non stationary 3 6 a numerical illustrations 3 6 1 one dimensional example using the original x t coordinates a one dimensional long crested irregular wave simulation employing the deep water dispersion relationship was performed the pierson moskowitz power density spectrum was used which means the context is deep water long fetch fully developed wave systems a simple wave number independent gaussian form was used for the space time windowing function u k x t i e 25 α u k x t α e x 2 λ x 2 t 2 λ t 2 the wave number independence is probably an over simplification but this example does demonstrate the majority of the properties of the approach the timescales reported in the literature of the emergence and decay of the extreme event seem to be a low integer multiple of λ t the peak period of the average power density spectrum of the prevailing wave system the associated length scale being also a low integer multiple of λ x the corresponding wavelength derived from the deep water dispersion relationship in the simulations the multiplier used was 3 but this is purely for illustration and was not derived in any sense using a pierson moskowitz parent power density spectrum produces λ t 2 π u 19 5 0 887 g and λ x 2 π u 19 5 2 0 887 2 g the pierson and moskowitz wind speed parameter u 19 5 was set to 15 m sec 1 the individual realisations of f x t were produced as follows i the phases of each wave component were sampled from a uniform distribution over 0 2 π ii the magnitudes of each component were obtained by sampling from rayleigh distributions whose parameter was determined from the variance of the parent power density spectrum chong et al 1982 the later process means that both phase and amplitude are random this is necessary in order to obtain a wave model that creates sea wave elevation time series with the correct runs statistics tucker et al 1984 the remaining parameters employed were number of spatial samples 1000 number of time samples 1000 number of spectral component 100 time step 0 2 s space step 1 5 m angular frequency step 0 0229 r a d sec 1 maximum angular frequency 2 29 r a d sec 1 the small step sizes used meant that the analytic frequency domain integrals that describe the surface elevation could be evaluated by simple direct discretisation using the same set of magnitudes and phases fig 1 compares the time evolution at the spatial origin for values of α 0 and α 1 the former being the underlying wave and the later with full cancellation of the initial phases at the spatio temporal origin the results for α 1 indicate the presence of a large symmetrical peak at time zero while outside the spatio temporal range of the function u x t the wave profile follows that of the α 0 case fig 2 shows the equivalent spatial domain forms at time zero using temporal data fig 3 demonstrates the ratio of the dependence of the ratio of the peak value to the rms value on the phase cancellation parameter α fig 4 shows the equivalent plot to fig 3 this time based upon spatial data at time zero given that each spectrum is a sample from an infinite number of possibilities a number of separate evaluations of the dependence shown in figs 3 and 4 are plotted to indicate the envelope in each case a probability density plot for the ratio of peak rms based upon 10 4 wave profiles is shown as fig 5 with the wave cancellation parameter set to unity 3 7 two dimensional example for this example the window was initially set up in cartesian coordinates which is the most conveniently way to impose the markedly different length scales associated with the x and y directions typically observed in extreme wave events hence the relevant parts of the phase cancellation function then has the form 26 α u k x y t α e x 2 λ x 2 y 2 λ y 2 t 2 λ t 2 in the case considered the y length scale λ y was made four times longer than the x length scale λ x the phase cancellation parameter α was simply set to be unity hence the polar form required by equation 24 is 27 ϕ f k φ k φ r θ t α e r cos θ 2 λ x 2 r sin θ 2 λ y 2 t 2 λ t 2 f k φ the simulation was carried out in the same general manner as in the one dimensional case the parent power density spectrum associated with each wave direction is again the pierson moskowitz pm form which is appropriately sampled tucker et al 1984 to create the component amplitudes as in the one dimensional case the directional wind system v φ that parameterises in the pm spectra was described by 28 v φ v max cos φ φ m i d φ m i d φ r a n g e 2 φ φ m i d φ r a n g e 2 where v max is the maximum wind speed that occurs in the direction φ m i d and φ r a n g e is the angular spread of the wind directions the phases were again selected randomly from a uniform distribution over 0 f k 2 π the simulation parameters were as follows number of wave directions 20 number of frequency components per wave direction 20 angular range φ r a n g e 0 1 π φ m i d 0 v max 20 m sec 1 x domain size 200 m y domain size 2000m number of spatial points in both x and y directions 350 maximum frequency 8 times the peak frequency of the pierson and moskowitz distribution associated with v max λ x 3 times the wavelength at the peak of the pierson and moskowitz distribution associated with v max λ y 10 λ x fig 6 a shows the two dimensional spatial plot of the extreme event at the instant of the peak amplitude i e at time t 0 while fig 6 b shows the corresponding plot of the underlying wave system with identical magnitudes and phases and α 0 at the same instant of time to aid in the comparison of the two surface plots the sea surface elevation has been normalised to the peak value of the extreme event 4 discussion 4 1 overall findings the very simple method that can be immediately applied to all types of wave spectrum yields a localised extreme event that emerges from a conventional wave profile the peak being located at the spatio temporal point of zero total phase clearly the absolute size of this peak and its relative size in relation to the prevailing wave system are both defined by the underlying global wave spectrum in the case of the pierson moskowitz spectrum its functional form meant that while the absolute peak height increases with wind speed the ratio of the extreme event peak to the rms of the prevailing wave system is independent of wind speed for compete cancellation of the initial phase in the pierson moskowitz case the actual value of the peak to global rms ratio is close to 9 corresponding to a peak to significant wave height h s value of 2 25 this exceeds the loose threshold for events being classified as freak waves i e peak to h s ratio of 2 however this simple approach cannot describe the largest events recorded this is to be expected for the present model does not involve explicit energy transfer between modes i e it does not change the short term shape of the magnitude spectrum which would be needed to further increase the peak to rms ratio most treatments of extreme waves concentrate on the event itself however a limited number of two dimensional approaches do actually reflect the specific underlying sea conditions for example the nonlinear wave focussing approach of slunyaev et al 2002 where the form of the evolution of the associated benjamin feir instability shares much with fig 7 the technique also does not address the well known sensitivity of the formation of extreme wave events to the details of the prevailing phase resolved wave spectrum the most significant shortcoming in the present approach is that while it emulates the phase changes brought about by the underlying physical mechanisms it does not incorporate the transfer of power between spectral components that inevitably arises with all non linear phenomena this point is taken up in section 4 below and forms the basis for future extensions of the methodology 4 2 the motivation behind the approach the motivation behind the present simple approach is that it is well known that nonlinear operators combine the phases of various spectral components wave propagation can be described as a spatio temporal cascade of weakly non linear steps each step can be described by a taylor expansion the polynomial operators of which generate sums and differences of the phases from the trigonometric terms comprising thus passing waves along such a cascade results in the averaging of the phases across the whole spectrum given that the phases in a standard sea model can be represented as uncorrelated samples from a uniform random distribution over π φ π the result of such multiple averaging tends to zero as in the present model disregarding cases of linear wave focussing it is necessary for the actual nonlinear physical processes associated with extreme waves to transiently change the form of the original sea spectrum to induce the extreme peak while the proposed phase cancellation based representation of extreme waves does display many of the observed properties of such events it says nothing about the anticipated transient changes to magnitudes of the wave components any extension of the present approach would clearly need to address this in this context it is interesting to note that the form of both measured and modelled extreme waves is highly symmetrical about the peak suggesting that the short term complex wave spectrum fourier transform is a real function hence the phases are either all zero or zeros and π s furthermore the local shapes of the peaks are very reminiscent of sinc functions as will be demonstrated in the following argument for the now famous example known as the new year s wave reproduced in fig 7 first the local region around the peak is replaced with an extrapolation of the underlying sea profile second this underlying wave profile is removed from the observed data what remains is the profile of the short range function needed to induce the extreme event interestingly the ratio of peak to neighbouring troughs in this short range function agrees surprisingly well with that of a sinc function the spectra of the class of functions to which sinc belongs are very uniform sinc has a rectangular spectrum and have zero phases leading to real fourier coefficients as indicated above a sequence of cascaded weakly nonlinear operations on a standard sea model is likely to induce zero phases at each step in the cascade it also produces products spectral magnitudes throughout the wave spectrum furthermore the spectral magnitudes of the underlying global wave system are also random samples it is not surprising that such repeated combination of multiplications of magnitudes from various parts of the spectrum would produce a more uniform spectrum than that of the underlying sea model returning to the sinc like form of the peak a relevant property is that sinc has the maximum value of peak to rms value of the class of symmetrical real spectra for example this ratio is 2 3 larger for a rectangular spectrum than a triangular real spectrum having the same bandwidth these remarks suggest a possible further direction for the present approach in which a transient operator working in concert with γ acts on the magnitudes temporarily redistributing the wave energy into a more symmetrical band limited spectral form this would allow the description of events with larger peak to rms ratios than possible with the present phase only approach it is worth repeating that for a given total energy in the prevailing global sea under the phase cancellation operator a rectangular spectrum gives the largest possible sea peak to global rms ratio at the point where all components all have zero initial phase 5 concluding remarks the present approach provides a very simple technique for capturing the main properties of extreme wave events in relation to the sea wave system from which they emerge it is essentially empirical in that it focusses far more upon the profiles and their spectra than on the underlying physical phenomena involved however other approaches typified by the nonlinear schrödinger equation are equally only model systems not being derived directly form the navier stokes equation irrespective of the details of the true dynamical extreme wave equation the above arguments based upon the observed properties of extreme waves and on the general properties of cascaded weakly nonlinear operators do suggest the following very general characteristics of extreme waves firstly they are created by very local nonlinear processes that involve the temporary removal of the initial phases secondly the wave spectral profile is temporarily transformed into a more uniform shape declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the

function in k r θ t with a maximum value of unity at r 0 θ 0 t 0 in the local coordinate frame however in this two dimensional example the function α that controls the degree of phase cancellation has now been generalised into a function of k r θ t this allows the phase cancellation process to be anisotropic typically in both strength and length scale as in the long crested wave case equation 24 means that the standard two dimensional linear deep water gravity wave equation can be generalised in terms of a propagating wave with a spectrum which is typically statistically stationary but very locally non stationary 3 6 a numerical illustrations 3 6 1 one dimensional example using the original x t coordinates a one dimensional long crested irregular wave simulation employing the deep water dispersion relationship was performed the pierson moskowitz power density spectrum was used which means the context is deep water long fetch fully developed wave systems a simple wave number

example does demonstrate the majority of the properties of the approach the timescales reported in the literature of the emergence and decay of the extreme event seem to be a low integer multiple of λ t the peak period of the average power density spectrum of the prevailing wave system the associated length scale being also a low integer multiple of λ x the corresponding wavelength derived from the deep water dispersion relationship in the simulations the multiplier used was 3 but this is purely for illustration and was not derived in any sense using a pierson moskowitz parent power density spectrum produces λ t 2 π u 19 5 0 887 g and λ x 2 π u 19 5 2 0 887 2 g the pierson and moskowitz wind speed parameter u 19 5 was set to 15 m sec 1 the individual realisations of f x t were produced as follows i the phases of each wave component were sampled from a uniform distribution over 0 2 π ii the magnitudes of each component were obtained by sampling from rayleigh distributions whose parameter was determined from the variance of the parent power density spectrum chong et al 1982 the later process means that both phase and amplitude are random this is necessary in order to obtain a wave model that creates sea wave elevation time series with the correct runs statistics tucker et al 1984 the remaining parameters employed were number of spatial samples 1000 number of time samples 1000 number of spectral component 100 time step 0 2 s space step 1 5 m angular frequency step 0 0229 r a d sec 1 maximum angular frequency 2 29 r a d sec 1 the small step sizes used meant that the analytic frequency domain integrals that describe the surface elevation could be evaluated by simple direct discretisation using the same set of magnitudes and phases fig 1 compares the time evolution at the spatial origin for values of α 0 and α 1 the former being the underlying wave and the later with full cancellation of the initial phases at the spatio temporal origin the results for α 1 indicate the presence of a large symmetrical peak at time zero while outside the spatio temporal range of the function u x t the wave profile follows that of the α 0 case fig 2 shows the equivalent spatial domain forms at time zero using temporal data fig 3 demonstrates the ratio of the dependence of the ratio of the peak value to the rms value on the phase cancellation parameter α fig 4 shows the equivalent plot to fig 3 this time based upon spatial data at time zero given that each spectrum is a sample from an infinite number of possibilities a number of separate evaluations of the dependence shown in figs 3 and 4 are plotted to indicate the envelope in each case a probability density plot for the ratio of peak rms based upon 10 4 wave profiles is shown as fig 5 with the wave cancellation parameter set to unity 3 7 two dimensional example for this example the window was initially set up in cartesian coordinates which is the most conveniently way to impose the markedly different length scales associated with the x and y directions typically observed in extreme wave events hence the relevant parts of the phase cancellation function then has the form 26 α u k x y t α e x 2 λ x 2 y 2 λ y 2 t 2 λ t 2 in the case considered the y length scale λ y was made four times longer than the x length scale λ x the phase cancellation parameter α was simply set to be unity hence the polar form required by equation 24 is 27 ϕ f k φ k φ r θ t α e r cos θ 2 λ x 2 r sin θ 2 λ y 2 t 2 λ t 2 f k φ the simulation was carried out in the same general manner as in the one dimensional case the parent power density spectrum associated with each wave direction is again the pierson moskowitz pm form which is appropriately sampled tucker et al 1984 to create the component amplitudes as in the one dimensional case the directional wind system v φ that parameterises in the pm spectra was described by 28 v φ v max cos φ φ m i d φ m i d φ r a n g e 2 φ φ m i d φ r a n g e 2 where v max is the maximum wind speed that occurs in the direction φ m i d and φ r a n g e is the angular spread of the wind directions the phases were again selected randomly from a uniform distribution over 0 f k 2 π the simulation parameters were as follows number of wave directions 20 number of frequency components per wave direction 20 angular range φ r a n g e 0 1 π φ m i d 0 v max 20 m sec 1 x domain size 200 m y domain size 2000m number of spatial points in both x and y directions 350 maximum frequency 8 times the peak frequency of the pierson and moskowitz distribution associated with v max λ x 3 times the wavelength at the peak of the pierson and moskowitz distribution associated with v max λ y 10 λ x fig 6 a shows the two dimensional spatial plot of the extreme event at the instant of the peak amplitude i e at time t 0 while fig 6 b shows the corresponding plot of the underlying wave system with identical magnitudes and phases and α 0 at the same instant of time to aid in the comparison of the two surface plots the sea surface elevation has been normalised to the peak value of the extreme event 4 discussion 4 1 overall findings the very simple method that can be immediately applied to all types of wave spectrum yields a localised extreme event that emerges from a conventional wave profile the peak being located at the spatio temporal point of zero total phase clearly the absolute size of this peak and its relative size in relation to the prevailing wave system are both defined by the underlying global wave spectrum in the case of the pierson moskowitz spectrum its functional form meant that while the absolute peak height increases with wind speed the ratio of the extreme event peak to the rms of the prevailing wave system is independent of wind speed for compete cancellation of the initial phase in the pierson moskowitz case the actual value of the peak to global rms ratio is close to 9 corresponding to a peak to significant wave height h s value of 2 25 this exceeds the loose threshold for events being classified as freak waves i e peak to h s ratio of 2 however this simple approach cannot describe the largest events recorded this is to be expected for the present model does not involve explicit energy transfer between modes i e it does not change the short term shape of the magnitude spectrum which would be needed to further increase the peak to rms ratio most treatments of extreme waves concentrate on the event itself however a limited number of two dimensional approaches do actually reflect the specific underlying sea conditions for example the nonlinear wave focussing approach of slunyaev et al 2002 where the form of the evolution of the associated benjamin feir instability shares much with fig 7 the technique also does not address the well known sensitivity of the formation of extreme wave events to the details of the prevailing phase resolved wave spectrum the most significant shortcoming in the present approach is that while it emulates the phase changes brought about by the underlying physical mechanisms it does not incorporate the transfer of power between spectral components that inevitably arises with all non linear phenomena this point is taken up in section 4 below and forms the basis for future extensions of the methodology 4 2 the motivation behind the approach the motivation behind the present simple approach is that it is well known that nonlinear operators combine the phases of various spectral components wave propagation can be described as a spatio temporal cascade of weakly non linear steps each step can be described by a taylor expansion the polynomial operators of which generate sums and differences of the phases from the trigonometric terms comprising thus passing waves along such a cascade results in the averaging of the phases across the whole spectrum given that the phases in a standard sea model can be represented as uncorrelated samples from a uniform random distribution over π φ π the result of such multiple averaging tends to zero as in the present model disregarding cases of linear wave focussing it is necessary for the actual nonlinear physical processes associated with extreme waves to transiently change the form of the original sea spectrum to induce the extreme peak while the proposed phase cancellation based representation of extreme waves does display many of the observed properties of such events it says nothing about the anticipated transient changes to magnitudes of the wave components any extension of the present approach would clearly need to address this in this context it is interesting to note that the form of both measured and modelled extreme waves is highly symmetrical about the peak suggesting that the short term complex wave spectrum fourier transform is a real function hence the phases are either all zero or zeros and π s furthermore the local shapes of the peaks are very reminiscent of sinc functions as will be demonstrated in the following argument for the now famous example known as the new year s wave reproduced in fig 7 first the local region around the peak is replaced with an extrapolation of the underlying sea profile second this underlying wave profile is removed from the observed data what remains is the profile of the short range function needed to induce the extreme event interestingly the ratio of peak to neighbouring troughs in this short range function agrees surprisingly well with that of a sinc function the spectra of the class of functions to which sinc belongs are very uniform sinc has a rectangular spectrum and have zero phases leading to real fourier coefficients as indicated above a sequence of cascaded weakly nonlinear operations on a standard sea model is likely to induce zero phases at each step in the cascade it also produces products spectral magnitudes throughout the wave spectrum furthermore the spectral magnitudes of the underlying global wave system are also random samples it is not surprising that such repeated combination of multiplications of magnitudes from various parts of the spectrum would produce a more uniform spectrum than that of the underlying sea model returning to the sinc like form of the peak a relevant property is that sinc has the maximum value of peak to rms value of the class of symmetrical real spectra for example this ratio is 2 3 larger for a rectangular spectrum than a triangular real spectrum having the same bandwidth these remarks suggest a possible further direction for the present approach in which a transient operator working in concert with γ acts on the magnitudes temporarily redistributing the wave energy into a more symmetrical band limited spectral form this would allow the description of events with larger peak to rms ratios than possible with the present phase only approach it is worth repeating that for a given total energy in the prevailing global sea under the phase cancellation operator a rectangular spectrum gives the largest possible sea peak to global rms ratio at the point where all components all have zero initial phase 5 concluding remarks the present approach provides a very simple technique for capturing the main properties of extreme wave events in relation to the sea wave system from which they emerge it is essentially empirical in that it focusses far more upon the profiles and their spectra than on the underlying physical phenomena involved however other approaches typified by the nonlinear schrödinger equation are equally only model systems not being derived directly form the navier stokes equation irrespective of the details of the true dynamical extreme wave equation the above arguments based upon the observed properties of extreme waves and on the general properties of cascaded weakly nonlinear operators do suggest the following very general characteristics of extreme waves firstly they are created by very local nonlinear processes that involve the temporary removal of the initial phases secondly the wave spectral profile is temporarily transformed into a more uniform shape declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
