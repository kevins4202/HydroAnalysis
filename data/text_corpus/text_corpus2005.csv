water content than the ck treatment at 20 60 cm soil depth across the three growing seasons the average soil water contents within the 0 100 cm soil layer under the t1 15 3 and t2 26 4 treatments were higher than the ck treatment the results indicated that the t2 and t1 treatments generally enhanced soil water storage within the 0 100 cm soil layer compared to the ck treatment during the three growing seasons fig 4 in 2016 and 2017 soil water storage sws had the greatest values at the harvest time whereas in 2018 the highest sws was observed at the jointing stage in 2016 the precipitation was concentrated at the maturity stage the sws increased with the increased precipitation at maturity stage and harvest time in 2017 and 2018 precipitation increased at grain filling stages and summer maize grew well with increased water consumption the t2 and t1 treatments had 13 8 and 12 3 higher mean soil water storage within the 0 100 cm soil layer than the ck treatment across the three maize growing seasons 3 2 maize growth 3 2 1 leaf rolling index leaf erection index and spatial density of leaf area averaged across the 3 years the t2 treatment decreased the leaf rolling index and increased the leaf erection index fig 5 the average leaf rolling index was higher at early growth stages 3 leaf jointing and tasseling than later growth stages grain filling and maturity compared with the ck treatment the t2 and t1 treatments decreased the leaf rolling index at each growth stage with significant decreases observed during grain filling and at maturity at the 3 leaf stage each year the t2 treatment had lower leaf rolling index than the ck and t1 treatments for the leaf erection index the ck t1 and t2 treatments were ranked as t2 t1 ck changes in the leaf erection index generally followed consistent trends each year the results of the linear mixed effects model for treatments on leaf rolling index leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area and their interactions are summarized in table 2 the treatments had significant effects on maize growth i e there were significant interactions between leaf rolling index leaf erection index and spatial density of leaf area seasonal fluctuations in the spatial density of leaf area lai and plant height followed similar trends for each treatment in each year fig 6 s1 and s2 generally the t2 treatment had a higher spatial density of leaf area than the ck and t1 treatments for the ck t1 and t2 treatments the plant height and lai of summer maize first increased and then decreased as growth proceeded during the 3 years of the study maximum plant height and lai occurred at grain filling stage after which plant height and lai gradually decreased as plants senesced figs s1 and s2 the plant height and lai values of the t2 treatment were significantly greater than those of the ck and t1 treatments 3 2 2 green canopy cover aboveground biomass and plant water content a negative relationship was found between average plant water content and aboveground biomass fig 7a similarly there is a negative correlation between average plant content and green canopy cover fig 7b averaged across the 3 years 2016 2018 the t2 treatment had higher green canopy cover compared to the t1 and ck treatments fig s3 after the jointing stage significant treatment effects occurred for green canopy cover the t2 treatment had the highest green canopy cover at the grain filling stage being 15 0 18 7 and 13 3 higher than that of ck in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in addition the t2 treatment had higher aboveground biomass both fresh and dry than the ck and t1 treatments at each growth stage in each year fig s4 3 2 3 grain yield harvest index evapotranspiration and water use efficiency wue grain yield and harvest index values are presented in table 3 the t2 treatment had 5 9 and 3 9 higher grain yield than the ck and t1 treatment in 2016 5 4 and 4 1 higher in 2017 and 13 4 and 8 9 higher in 2018 respectively the t2 treatment had the highest harvest index and grain yield across the three seasons of summer maize the highest wue was recorded under the t2 treatment than those values under the ck and t1 treatments in addition the t2 treatment had the lower et values and the ck treatment had the highest values the t2 treatment had 5 8 7 7 and 11 2 greater 100 kernel weight than the ck treatment and the t1 treatment had 4 9 3 8 and 5 6 greater 100 kernel weight than ck in 2016 2017 and 2018 table 3 respectively in the linear mixed effects model we found significant year effects for grain yield aboveground biomass

discussion 4 1 soil water our results demonstrated that the straw returning treatments t1 and t2 increased the 0 100 cm soil water during the early growing stages 3 leaf and jointing stages of summer maize figs 3 and 4 the significant soil water advantages for straw application compared to traditional tillage e g only chemical fertilization were also everywhere reported from other planting systems chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in this study one of the major purposes of the optimized straw incorporation t2 treatment was to increase the soil water and improve summer maize growth recent findings from our experiment site confirmed that the t2 treatment enhanced annual soil water storage which may explain the higher maize production of the t2 treatment compared to the ck treatment zou et al 2020 soil water plays a very crucial role in promoting crop yield production shaver et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 the increase in soil water content under straw addition was likely due to the increased amounts of precipitation during the growing seasons bu et al 2013 ding et al 2018 li et al 2020 in addition the excessive irrigation and chemical fertilizer may lead to low water use efficiency and the contamination of water resources hassanli et al 2009 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 although irrigation has been used to increase crop production in arid areas of china yan et al 2017 available water resources are severe shortage in agricultural croplands panda et al 2004 tolk et al 1999 therefore for summer maize cultivation under rainfed drylands exploring optimal straw returning may be one of the most promising options to improve the use of available water resources and increase summer maize production in our study the t2 treatment had lower et than the ck and t1 treatments tables 2 and 3 straw returning could reduce soil evaporation which favors soil water storage in semiarid croplands zhao et al 2014 studies have linked increasing soil water content to increasing precipitation i e mainly in september and decreasing evaporation during crop growth zhang et al 2010 li et al 2013 reported that straw addition impeded evaporation losses during maize growth period which is consistent with the findings in our study in addition the seasonal wue results in the current study were consistent with those of hsiao and acevedo 1974 i e straw mulching reduced soil surface evaporation we found that straw with a low c n ratio increased soil water storage compared to traditional straw returning fig 4 the ammoniated straw incorporation t2 increased wue and decreased et during three maize growing seasons table 3 which is in line with yu et al 2017 the t2 treatment may reduce evaporation and improve soil moisture for maize growth table 3 straw application could decrease early evaporation and change water consumption patterns from soil water evaporation to crop transpiration deng et al 2006 li et al 2013 different mulching technologies have varying effects on water consumption fan et al 2016 li et al 2013 here straw with a low c n ratio t2 increased wue compared to the ck and t1 treatments in a semi arid growing season improving the soil water regime to increase summer maize growth 4 2 summer maize growth across the three growing seasons our results indicated that the t2 treatment improved summer maize growth i e higher average of lai leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area plant height and green canopy cover in comparison to the ck and t1 treatments figs 5 6 s1 s2 and s3 previous studies have demonstrated that straw application could conserve soil water and impede weed growth rahman et al 2005 gao et al 2009 and hsiao and acevedo 1974 stated that straw addition could decrease leaf growth at emergence stage however the effect of straw application on crop growth and grain yield has been inconsistent chen et al 2015 stated that straw returning increased winter wheat yields compared with no straw returning tu et al 2006 reported straw addition could improve maize growth by increasing leaf area and plant height at jointing and silking stages this complies very well with recent results from our experimental site which confirmed that the t2 treatment increased leaf area and plant height explaining the higher aboveground biomass of the t2 treatment relative to the ck and t1 treatments figs s1 and s2 one explanation might be that the increased leaf growth under the t2 treatment due to soil nutrient dynamics caused by straw decomposition guan et al 2020 soil water stress may be one of the most important factors decreasing lai and plant height bai et al 2009 zheng et al 2018 stated that the maximum lai occurred at the grain filling stage before decreasing gradually due to leaf senescence leaf rolling index spatial density of leaf area and leaf erection index as the key parameters of plant growth characteristics can be a sensitive indicator for soil water at different growing stages song et al 2018 xiang et al 2012 collectively based on the present study the ammoniated straw incorporated into the croplands is essential to summer maize growth offering the potential to improve aboveground biomass and grain yield in semi arid croplands in our study the t2 treatment had the highest average total dry biomass and grain yield across the three growing seasons suggesting that ammoniated crop straw improved grain yield table 3 indeed the t1 and t2 treatments had higher aboveground biomass and grain yield than the ck treatment supporting the suggestion that straw with low c n ratios increased grain productivity ishfaq et al 2020 plante et al 2006 zou et al 2020 also reported that ammoniated straw could increase grain yield of winter wheat the increase in aboveground biomass would be attributed to leaf and plant growth bavec and bavec 2002 borrás et al 2007 li et al 2013 stated that the increase in aboveground biomass and yield induced by straw addition was associated with an improvement in leaf area index and leaf growth the response of aboveground biomass varied with the t1 and t2 treatments fig 6 and was consistent with the reported link between leaf growth and plant growth campos et al 2004 further research is urgently needed to explain the influences of ammoniated straw management on leaf photosynthetic characteristics and associations with biomass grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in semi arid zones across the three consecutive growing seasons of summer maize the negative correlation was found between leaf rolling index and leaf erection index fig 9 plant height has been closely correlated with total leaf area liu et al 2017 suggesting that maize canopy structure could help researchers evaluate morphological traits and spatial density of leaf area in maize ma et al 2014 straw incorporation favored maize growth tables 3 and 4 figs 8 and 9 which may be due to the changes in soil moisture responses to straw incorporated into the soil significant positive associations occurred among aboveground biomass yield and wue p 0 05 fig 9 leaf growth may be correlated with canopy growth which might be correlated with crop biomass ciganda et al 2009 ma et al 2014 uddling et al 2007 wang et al 2019 to clarify the impacts of the t2 treatment on soil water maize growth and grain yield long term continuous observations and field samplings are urgently warranted 5 conclusion across the 3 year study we found that the t2 treatment increased soil water storage enhanced grain yield and promoted wue relative to the ck and t1 treatments also the t2 treatment improved maize growth i e the t2 treatment had a higher leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area green canopy cover and aboveground biomass during maize growing seasons the t2 treatment can maintain or increase grain yield and aboveground biomass during three growing years furthermore those findings are beneficial for better understanding the maize planting system that increases soil water storage and crop production by applying optimized straw practices long term and continuous field observations or measurements in the same agroecosystems are urgently warranted to clarify the effects of ammoniated straw incorporation on long term crop growth and soil water changes in semiarid regions declaration of competing

maize with no top dressing during each growing season cropping information at the experimental site is presented in table 1 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water during each summer maize growing season the gravimetric water content to 100 cm depth was measured at the 3 leaf jointing tasseling grain filling and maturity stages soil samples were taken at 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths using stainless steel cylinders 50 mm diameter in triplicate which were oven dried at 105 c to determine soil water content before sowing and after harvesting time soil water content 10 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm was measured to determine changes in soil water storage sws mm in the soil profile throughout the summer maize growing season extra measurements were also taken before and after precipitation soil water storage was calculated using eq 1 1 s w s 10 h a b 100 where sws is soil water storage mm h is soil depth cm a is soil density g cm 3 and b is soil water content wt wt respectively 2 3 2 leaf area spatial density of leaf area leaf rolling index and leaf erection index six representative maize plants were randomly selected for plant height and leaf area measurements at the 3 leaf jointing tasseling grain filling and maturity stages in each growing season which were manually measured using a tape the maximum width and length of each maize

fresh weight of maize plants was weighed after cutting and dry weight of maize plants was determined after oven drying at 75 c to constant weight the plots were harvested manually on october 12 2016 october 12 2017 and september 30 2018 and grain yield and 100 kernel weights were recorded plant water content θ was calculated using eq 8 8 θ w f w d w f 100 where wf is fresh weight of aboveground

three growing years fig 3 during the 3 leaf stage the t2 treatment had higher soil water content than the ck and t1 treatments at 20 40 cm soil depth in 2016 2017 and 2018 growing years p 0 05 at the

water content than the ck treatment at 20 60 cm soil depth across the three growing seasons the average soil water contents within the 0 100 cm soil layer under the t1 15 3 and t2 26 4 treatments were higher than the ck treatment the results indicated that the t2 and t1 treatments generally enhanced soil water storage within the 0 100 cm soil layer compared to the ck treatment during the three growing seasons fig 4 in 2016 and 2017 soil water storage sws had the greatest values at the harvest time whereas in 2018 the highest sws was observed at the jointing stage in 2016 the precipitation was concentrated at the maturity stage the sws increased with the increased precipitation at maturity stage and harvest time in 2017 and 2018 precipitation increased at grain filling stages and summer maize grew well with increased water consumption the t2 and t1 treatments had 13 8 and 12 3 higher mean soil water storage within the 0 100 cm soil layer than the ck treatment across the three maize growing seasons 3 2 maize growth 3 2 1 leaf rolling index leaf erection index and spatial density of leaf area averaged across the 3 years the t2 treatment decreased the leaf rolling index and increased the leaf erection index fig 5 the average leaf rolling index was higher at early growth stages 3 leaf jointing and tasseling than later growth stages grain filling and maturity compared with the ck treatment the t2 and t1 treatments decreased the leaf rolling index at each growth stage with significant decreases observed during grain filling and at maturity at the 3 leaf stage each year the t2 treatment had lower leaf rolling index than the ck and t1 treatments for the leaf erection index the ck t1 and t2 treatments were ranked as t2 t1 ck changes in the leaf erection index generally followed consistent trends each year the results of the linear mixed effects model for treatments on leaf rolling index leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area and their interactions are summarized in table 2 the treatments had significant effects on maize growth i e there were significant interactions between leaf rolling index leaf erection index and spatial density of leaf area seasonal fluctuations in the spatial density of leaf area lai and plant height followed similar trends for each treatment in each year fig 6 s1 and s2 generally the t2 treatment had a higher spatial density of leaf area than the ck and t1 treatments for the ck t1 and t2 treatments the plant height and lai of summer maize first increased and then decreased as growth proceeded during the 3 years of the study maximum plant height and lai occurred at grain filling stage after which plant height and lai gradually decreased as plants senesced figs s1 and s2 the plant height and lai values of the t2 treatment were significantly greater than those of the ck and t1 treatments 3 2 2 green canopy cover aboveground biomass and plant water content a negative relationship was found between average plant water content and aboveground biomass fig 7a similarly there is a negative correlation between average plant content and green canopy cover fig 7b averaged across the 3 years 2016 2018 the t2 treatment had higher green canopy cover compared to the t1 and ck treatments fig s3 after the jointing stage significant treatment effects occurred for green canopy cover the t2 treatment had the highest green canopy cover at the grain filling stage being 15 0 18 7 and 13 3 higher than that of ck in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in addition the t2 treatment had higher aboveground biomass both fresh and dry than the ck and t1 treatments at each growth stage in each year fig s4 3 2 3 grain yield harvest index evapotranspiration and water use efficiency wue grain yield and harvest index

treatment had the highest harvest index and grain yield across the three seasons of summer maize the highest wue was recorded under the t2 treatment than those values under the ck and t1 treatments in addition the t2 treatment had the lower et values and the ck treatment had the highest values the t2 treatment had 5 8 7 7 and 11 2 greater 100 kernel weight than the ck treatment and the t1 treatment had 4 9 3 8 and 5 6 greater 100 kernel weight than ck in 2016 2017 and 2018 table 3 respectively in the linear mixed effects model we found significant year effects for grain yield aboveground biomass

discussion 4 1 soil water our results demonstrated that the straw returning treatments t1 and t2 increased the 0 100 cm soil water during the early growing stages 3 leaf and jointing stages of summer maize figs 3 and 4 the significant soil water advantages for straw application compared to traditional tillage e g only chemical fertilization were also everywhere reported from other planting systems chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in this study one of the major purposes of the optimized straw incorporation t2 treatment was to increase the soil water and improve summer maize growth recent findings from our experiment site confirmed that the t2 treatment enhanced annual soil water storage which may explain the higher maize production of the t2 treatment compared to the ck treatment zou et al 2020 soil water plays a very crucial role in promoting crop yield production shaver et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 the increase in soil water content under straw addition was likely due to the increased amounts of precipitation during the growing seasons bu et al 2013 ding et al 2018 li et al 2020 in addition the excessive irrigation and chemical fertilizer may lead to low water use efficiency and the contamination of water resources hassanli et al 2009 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 although irrigation has been used to increase crop production in arid areas of china yan et al 2017 available water resources are severe shortage in agricultural croplands panda et al 2004 tolk et al 1999 therefore for summer maize cultivation under rainfed drylands exploring optimal straw returning may be one of the most promising options to improve the use of available water resources and increase summer maize production in our study the t2 treatment had lower et than the ck and t1 treatments tables 2 and 3 straw returning could reduce soil evaporation which favors soil water storage in semiarid croplands zhao et al 2014 studies have linked increasing soil water content to increasing precipitation i e mainly in september and decreasing evaporation during crop growth zhang et al 2010 li et al 2013 reported that straw addition impeded evaporation losses during maize growth period which is consistent with the findings in our study in addition the seasonal wue results in the current study were consistent with those of hsiao and acevedo 1974 i e straw mulching reduced soil surface evaporation we found that straw with a low c n ratio increased soil water storage compared to traditional straw returning fig 4 the ammoniated straw incorporation t2 increased wue and decreased et during three maize growing seasons table 3 which is in line with yu et al 2017 the t2 treatment may reduce evaporation and improve soil moisture for maize growth table 3 straw application could decrease early evaporation and change water consumption patterns from soil water evaporation to crop transpiration deng et al 2006 li et al 2013 different mulching technologies have varying effects on water consumption fan et al 2016 li et al 2013 here straw with a low c n ratio t2 increased wue compared to the ck and t1 treatments in a semi arid growing season improving the soil water regime to increase summer maize growth 4 2 summer maize growth across the three growing seasons our results indicated that the t2 treatment improved summer maize growth i e higher average of lai leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area plant height and green canopy cover in comparison to the ck and t1 treatments figs 5 6 s1 s2 and s3 previous studies have demonstrated that straw application could conserve soil water and impede weed growth rahman et al 2005 gao et al 2009 and hsiao and acevedo 1974 stated that straw addition could decrease leaf growth at emergence stage however the effect of straw application on crop growth and grain yield has been inconsistent chen et al 2015 stated that straw returning increased winter wheat yields compared with no straw returning tu et al 2006 reported straw addition could improve maize growth by increasing leaf area and plant height at jointing and silking stages this complies very well with recent results from our experimental site which confirmed that the t2 treatment increased leaf area and plant height explaining the higher aboveground biomass of the t2 treatment relative to the ck and t1 treatments figs s1 and s2 one explanation might be that the increased leaf growth under the t2 treatment due to soil nutrient dynamics caused by straw decomposition guan et al 2020 soil water stress may be one of the most important factors decreasing lai and plant height bai et al 2009 zheng et al 2018 stated that the maximum lai occurred at the grain filling stage before decreasing gradually due to leaf senescence leaf rolling index spatial density of leaf area and leaf erection index as the key parameters of plant growth characteristics can be a sensitive indicator for soil water at different growing stages song et al 2018 xiang et al 2012 collectively based on the present study the ammoniated straw incorporated into the croplands is essential to summer maize growth offering the potential to improve aboveground biomass and grain yield in semi arid croplands in our study the t2 treatment had the highest average total dry biomass and grain yield across the three growing seasons suggesting that ammoniated crop straw improved grain yield table 3 indeed the t1 and t2 treatments had higher aboveground biomass and grain yield than the ck treatment supporting the suggestion that straw with low c n ratios increased grain productivity ishfaq et al 2020 plante et al 2006 zou et al 2020 also reported that ammoniated straw could increase grain yield of winter wheat the increase in aboveground biomass would be attributed to leaf and plant growth bavec and bavec 2002 borrás et al 2007 li et al 2013 stated that the increase in aboveground biomass and yield induced by straw addition was associated with an improvement in leaf area index and leaf growth the response of aboveground biomass varied with the t1 and t2 treatments fig 6 and was consistent with the reported link between leaf growth and plant growth campos et al 2004 further research is urgently needed to explain the influences of ammoniated straw management on leaf photosynthetic characteristics and associations with biomass grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in semi arid zones across the three consecutive growing seasons of summer maize the negative correlation was found between leaf rolling index and leaf erection index fig 9 plant height has been closely correlated with total leaf area liu et al 2017 suggesting that maize canopy structure could help researchers evaluate morphological traits and spatial density of leaf area in maize ma et al 2014 straw incorporation favored maize growth tables 3 and 4 figs 8 and 9 which may be due to the changes in soil moisture responses to straw incorporated into the soil significant positive associations occurred among aboveground biomass yield and wue p 0 05 fig 9 leaf growth may be correlated with canopy growth which might be correlated with crop biomass ciganda et al 2009 ma et al 2014 uddling et al 2007 wang et al 2019 to clarify the impacts of the t2 treatment on soil water maize growth and grain yield long term continuous observations and field samplings are urgently warranted 5 conclusion across the 3 year study we found that the t2 treatment increased soil water storage enhanced grain yield and promoted wue relative to the ck and t1 treatments also the t2 treatment improved maize growth i e the t2 treatment had a higher leaf erection index spatial density of leaf area green canopy cover and aboveground biomass during maize growing seasons the t2 treatment can maintain or increase grain yield and aboveground biomass during three growing years furthermore those findings are beneficial for better understanding the maize planting system that increases soil water storage and crop production by applying optimized straw practices long term and continuous field observations or measurements in the same agroecosystems are urgently warranted to clarify the effects of ammoniated straw incorporation on long term crop growth and soil water changes in semiarid regions declaration of competing

10026,under climate change the rainfall is predicted to become more intense and less frequent causing summer drought events and rainwater loss by deep percolation resulting in both inefficient use of rainwater and yield reduction super absorbent polymers saps have been studied as soil amendments in arid and semi arid environments but little is known about potential use for drought stress mitigation in humid subtropical climates under rainfed conditions this study investigated the potential of three k based saps stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 to act as water reservoirs during periods of drought in the laboratory saps mixed with sandy soil were tested for water absorption capacity wac and re swelling capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks water holding capacity whc and storage of simulated rainfall saps showed high wac re swelling capacity reduced ks and increased soil whc with performance dependent more on saps concentration than saps type the three saps

respectively the retained rainwater resulted in higher leaf water potential leading to enhanced plant growth and wpbiomass stockosorb 660 performed best in terms of rainwater saving while hydrosource was the most effective in terms of plant growth and wpbiomass the results suggest that saps soil amendment is a potential approach to mitigate drought stress under rainfed conditions in humid subtropical climates keywords super absorbent polymers rainfall corn drought water productivity water holding capacity 1 introduction drought is a critical factor that adversely affects crop production and yield stability ahopelto et al 2019 saha et al 2020b as the result of climate change rainfall variability is expected to increase leading to more frequent drought events and intense rainfall events with devastating consequences for crop productivity and the whole agroecosystem hunt et al 2020 zhiña et al 2019 yield losses due to drought become intensified in light textured soils with low water retention when evapotranspiration is high or when plants have a shallow root system abdallah 2019a bhardwaj et al 2007 the consequences of weather variability might be lessened by enhancing soil adaptability to drought periods and to high rainfall intensities through increasing soil water holding capacity whc the total amount that a particular soil can retain patra et al 2019 williams et al 2018 2016 to increase topsoil whc a suitable management tool could be the use of hydrogels super absorbent polymers saps which absorb a significant amount of water and improve the top soil s ability to store water abdallah 2019a kassem et al 2020 sivapalan 2006 zekry et al 2020 however the influence of saps on soil hydraulic properties rainwater transport and storage and crop growth under rainfed agriculture especially under adequate but poorly distributed rainfall is poorly studied since most of the studies are limited to laboratory and glasshouse conditions in arid and semi arid environments saha et al 2020a an agricultural drought is a period when plant water requirements are not met by soil moisture wilhite and glantz 1985 consequently drought is usually manifested by water stress that negatively affects crop growth and productivity especially when drought occurs at critical growth stages of the cultivated crop ayanlade et al 2018 bodner et al 2015 rainfall amount intensity and distribution are vital factors that determine the severity and longevity of drought stress in rainfed agriculture precipitation may meet or exceed crop water requirements but is poorly distributed with intense rain events that exceed soil whc kimaru et al 2019 tsige et al 2019 only the water retained in the root zone is effective for plant growth ali and mubarak 2017 several factors influence the portion of effective rainfall including climatic i e rain amount intensity and frequency while others are soil related i e infiltration capacity and soil whc chehab et al

echeverri et al 2020 therefore to increase crop production in such environments a larger portion of rain irrigation water must be retained in the topsoil rather than being leached or lost by runoff saha et al 2020a the use of saps can improve the whc of the soil kassem et al 2020 satriani et al 2018 saps are hydrophilic networks that can absorb and retain up to 1000 times more water than their original weight hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 hydrogels are insoluble materials that form three dimensional networks swell in water and hold significant amounts of water due to their cross bonds agaba et al 2010 hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 in this way saps incorporated into the soil could quickly absorb the rain and or irrigation water and act as a water reservoir that releases water to plants when soil in the root zone starts to dry al jabari et al 2019 sinha 2018 yang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 application of saps to soil may increase soil whc decrease water loss by percolation and increase yield and water fertilizer use efficiency el asmar et al 2017 wei and durian 2014 yu et al 2017 the effects of varying types and amounts of saps in agricultural horticultural or forestry applications have been widely investigated saps application improve tree establishment hüttermann et al 1999 orikiriza et al 2013 enhance tree growth apostol et al 2009 arbona et al 2005 han et al 2013 enhance the growth of ornamental plants koupai et al 2008 and increase yield and growth indices of nursery plants leciejewski 2009 additionally saps have been shown to enhance field crops growth and productivity islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 satriani et al 2018 however several studies demonstrated that saps are subject to aging and their efficiency is significantly reduced after wetting drying cycles banedjschafie and durner 2015 zekry et al 2020 saps beneficial effect on the whc of the soil was found to be decreased by 30 after 2 5 months geesing and schmidhalter 2004 14 after 6 months zekry et al 2020 and 50 after three months banedjschafie and durner 2015 the reduction of the positive effectiveness of saps was attributed to the dissolved salt in soil water or fertilizers bai et al 2013 han et al 2010 zekry et al 2020 cations permanently attach to the carboxylic acid groups of acrylic acid and thus block the active negative sites of the saps and decrease the affinity for water spagnol et al 2012c 2012a zhou et al 2012 therefore the longevity and efficiency of saps in soil depends on soil and irrigation water salinity accordingly it is expected that saps might be more viable under rainfed agriculture due to lower salt input the potential of saps as soil amendment have been widely tested in arid and semi arid environments under irrigated agriculture in particular under laboratory mirdarikvande et al 2014 yu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 and glasshouse conditions dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 sánchez orozco et al 2017 with limited focus on field studies saha et al 2020a however the effect of saps on rainwater transport and storage and crop growth under rainfed agriculture especially under unevenly distributed rainfall is poorly investigated according to the review of saha et al 2020a more studies are required for identifying the best saps application rate in the southeastern usa including north carolina nc several reports indicated that precipitation patterns are shifting towards wetter winters and drier summers with extreme precipitation events boyles and raman 2003 ingram et al 2013 kenneth et al 2013 moreover with the expected increase in air temperature kenneth et al 2013 summer drought events become more frequent longer and more intense due to the increased duration between rain events carbone et al 2008 ingram et al 2013 strzepek et al 2010 many areas in nc are cecil soils ultisols cecil top soils are characterized as brown sandy loam very deep well drained moderately permeable and characterized by low soil whc pan et al 2012 swaby et al 2016 therefore the potential use of saps to increase soil whc under rainfed agriculture is of great importance particularly when summer drought events occur during critical stages of plant growth therefore the objectives of this study were to compare the most promising commercially available saps as well as the optimum concentration that might increase rainwater storage in the surface layer of light textured soil and apply this technology in a study of corn growth under rainfed conditions in nc usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments the water absorption capacity wac and re swelling ability of three commercially available saps were investigated moreover the whc of saps amended soil ks transport and storage of simulated rainfall at two different rainfall intensities were determined the three saps were white granular insoluble hydrophilic polymers and k based cross linked copolymers the saps were selected based on availability and positive effects reported in the literature the selected polymers were stockosorb 660 1 0 2 5 mm polyacrylic acid evonik corporation canada hydrosource 1 0 2 0 mm polyacrylamide hydrosource llc ar usa superab a200 2 5 mm 61 2 mm 20 1 mm 19 acrylamide k acrylate copolymer iramont inc canada the laboratory experiments were conducted using samples of a commercial native sandy soil acquired from a local vendor the soil contained 98 6 1 4 and 1 0 of sand silt and clay respectively the soils were air dried ground and passed through 2 mm sieve and fractions of less than 2 mm were used in the experiments the sandy soil was selected for the experiment because it is well established that saps are more functional in sandy soils therefore we aimed at studying the effect of saps on soil hydraulic properties at their maximum potential efficiency 2 1 1 the water absorption capacity and saps response to salinity to determine the wac one g of each sap type was packed in a teabag and submerged into distilled water until the equilibrium swelling was achieved after excess water was drained out from tea bag the swollen saps was then removed and the total mass g was measured buchholz 1998 similarly the wac was measured at different water salinity 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 ds m 1 water salinity was prepared using nacl and cacl2 2 1 to simulate the dominant dissolved salts in saline water the equilibrium water absorbency of swollen samples was calculated using the following equation spagnol et al 2012a wac ws wd wd where wac is the swelling capacity g water g 1 saps ws and wd are mass of the swollen and dry samples g respectively 2 1 2 re swelling capacity one g of each sap type was immersed in distilled water to reach the swelling equilibrium then swollen saps were filtered out weighted and dehydrated at 80 c after complete drying the recovered saps were rewetted and dehydrated twice consisting three swelling dehydration cycles shahid et al 2012 2 1 3 water holding capacity sealed bottom pvc columns with a diameter of 12 cm and provided with a fine metal mesh in the bottom were used the saps were mixed in the soil at concentrations of 0 2 and 0 4 w w in addition to the soil control without saps the soil columns were saturated from the bottom using tap water 0 5 ds m 1 and once saturated the columns were allowed to drain until all excess water was removed after which soil columns were weighted and the corresponding volumetric water content which represents the whc was calculated abdallah et al 2019 chen et al 2003 2 1 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks a cylinder 20 cm height and a diameter of 8 cm with a fine metal screen at the bottom was used to determine the ks according to moutier et al 2000 the saps amended air dried soil 0 4 w w was packed in the cylinder at a bulk density of 1 6 mg m 3 the cylinders were saturated from the bottom then flow direction was reversed and a constant pressure head of 5 cm was applied the leachate

pvc columns 16 cm height and a cross section area of 176 6 cm2 with sealed bottoms and a fine metal mesh at the bottom were used the saps amended air dried soil was packed into the column then compacted to reach a desired bulk density of 1 6 mg m 3 using a hammer narjary et al 2012 each sap was mixed with the soil at a concentration of 0 4 w w all columns received a fixed amount of rainfall 100 mm that was enough to generate percolation at two different intensities i e 100 or 200 mm h 1 to collect the percolated water a rubber tube was connected to the bottom of the column after terminating the simulated rain shower the top of the column was enclosed with para film to avoid water loss by evaporation the columns allowed to completely drain the gravimetric water the volume of the percolated and retained water was recorded and their percentage relative to volume of total rainfall was calculated the percentage of stored and percolated water were calculated using the following equations psw vt vp vt 100 ppw vp vt 100 where psw and ppw are the percentage of stored and percolated water respectively vt and vp are the volume cm3 of total water applied and percolated

presented in table 1 2 2 2 outdoor pot experimental design the experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different saps type and concentrations on rainwater storage transport rainwater productivity and growth and physiological performance of corn plants grown in pots in the field for 70 days under natural rainfed conditions during the plant growth period daily precipitation data were determined by a rain gauge installed at the experimental field site corn crop was selected as it is one of the main summer crops in the region that could be adversely affected by drought the experimental design was randomized complete block design with three replications experiment treatments included three types of saps stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 and three concentrations of each 0 15 0 30 and 0 45 w w in addition to the control 30 pots that were randomized to the experimental units containers air dried surface loamy sand soil sample table 1 was amended with each sap type then containers of 32 l volume 37 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in depth were filled with sap amended soil bulk density of saps amended soil was adjusted to 1 45 mg m 3 to simulate bulk density in the field to reduce the micro climate effect on the pots gheysari et al 2017 each pot was covered with a white plastic bag to reduce the effect of heat conduction through the sides of the pots that was mounted using rubber material without covering soil surface additionally the pots were placed above wooden structures to minimize heat transfer between the pots and the soil and to allow for collecting percolated water if any moreover the pots were weekly hand shifted within the experimental site to ensure that all plants had similar microclimate three corn seeds pot were sown on may 20 2015 pots were not irrigated and rainfed agriculture was practiced each plant received the recommended rate of slow release fertilizer osmocote plus scotts sierra horticultural products marysville oh usa 15 9 12 n p k which was thoroughly mixed with the soil before planting after emergence and upon full expansion of the third leaf v2 growth stage seedlings were thinned to one plant per pot the percolated water if any was collected using white plastic bags mounted carefully around the pots from the bottom and its volume was determined after each rain event the ratio of retained water in the soil to total precipitation measured by a rain gage located 10 m away from the plants was used as a measure of rainwater storage for each rain event the cumulative water retained rainwater storage in the soil was calculated by subtracting the cumulative percolation from the cumulative rainfall measured by the on site rain gage the moisture content was measured by weighting the pots and using a

absorption capacity of saps the results of wac of saps at different water salinity are presented in fig 1 all saps exhibited high wac in distilled water where a large amount of water ranging from 238 3 to 374 g g 1 g water g 1 saps was absorbed for the saps a non linear negative relation between wac g g 1 and water salinity ds m 1 was recorded the wac was lessened by more than half when a salinity of 0 5 ds m 1 was used the salinity response curve might be divided into two stages the first stage from 0 0 to 1 0 ds m 1 with a sharp decrease in wac in response to increased water salinity and the second stage from 1 0 to 5 0 ds m 1 where a smooth and gradual reduction in wac was observed under high salinity conditions 5 0 ds m 1 the saps were still able to absorb a noteworthy amount of water 52 7 91 7 g g 1 the wac of the tested saps followed this order stockosorb 660 hydrosource superab a200 stockosorb 660 showed a significantly p 0 05 higher wac at all water salinities 3 1 2 re swelling capacity of tested polymers the results presented in fig 2 revealed that all tested saps were able to re swell in the water but with a downward trend in the second and third swelling cycles in first swelling cycle maximum wac was recorded ranged from 238 3 to 374 3 g g 1 in the second cycle the maximum wac reduced to range from 221 7 362 0 g g 1 stockosorb 660 was superior to superab a200 and hydrosource for the three wetting drying cycles demonstrating higher wac and re swelling ability for example in the third swelling cycle the swelling capacity of stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 was reduced by 4 43 8 5 and 11 9 respectively compared to the initial swelling 1st swelling cycle 3 1 3 water holding capacity of the soil all tested saps drastically increased the whc of the soil 98 6 sand as compared with the control fig 3 the whc was a function of saps concentration and saps type pooling the data for the saps type the whc of saps amended soil was higher than the control by 2 38 2 12 and 2 18 times for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively amending the soil with 0 2 saps increased the whc by 2 08 1 9 and 2 0 times for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively compared to the control increasing saps concentration to 0 4 increased the whc by 2 7 2 35 and 2 36 folds for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively stockosorb 660 at any concentration increased soil whc in comparison to superab a200 and hydrosource that exhibited similar soil whc at both concentrations 3 1 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity the results presented in fig 4 showed that the ks values were a function of polymer type and concentration the presence of polymers significantly p 0 05 reduced the ks which were initially 1 35 m h 1 summing the data for the saps concentration the ks was reduced by 37 7 40 5 and 44 3 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively lower ks values were recorded at the higher saps concentration fig 4 no significant differences were observed between superab a200 and stockosorb 660 at any given concentration however hydrosource exhibited lower ks values as compared to both superab a200 and stockosorb 660 at 0 2 w w concentration 3 1 5 simulation of rainwater transport and storage in this experiment 100 mm of simulated rainwater was applied after which the percolated water was measured the amount of percolated water and thereby the retained water in the soil was affected by rainfall intensity more than saps type relative to the control saps treated soil retained higher amounts of rainwater thus lower percolated water volumes were observed fig 5 the effect of saps was more pronounced under low rainfall intensity in which saps treated soil retained 87 0 mm and 69 7 mm for the low and high rain intensities respectively while the control soil retained only 33 6 mm under the low rainfall intensity the tested saps acted equally where about 87 5 mm of rainwater was stored in the soil fig 5 however when rain intensity increased stockosorb 660 retained a higher amount of water as compared to superab a200 and hydrosource 3 2 outdoor pot experiment 3 2 1 rainfall distribution pattern the study was conducted during the summer 20th may to 25th july at the experimental site the monthly average rainfall was quite uniformly distributed in which 134 62 mm and 113 8 mm for june and july respectively were recorded however the results presented in table 2 and in the supplementary materials fig s1 revealed that daily rainfall distribution throughout the study period was very erratic about 60 of total precipitation was accrued only in five days with consecutive days of rainfall occurring only once during the period of 17th and 18th june fig s1 these five rainy days represented 6 9 of total period with an average of 29 7 mm day 1 event however 46 dry days without precipitation represented 63 8 of total period with maximum et0 values recorded for june and july this non uniform rainwater distribution suggested that corn plants grown in such light textured soils loamy sand were subjected to short drought periods on one hand and intensive rain events of over watering on the other hand that could decrease yield and result in inefficient use of rainwater and possible leaching of nutrients 3 2 2 infield rainwater transport and storage the percolated water was collected after each rain event if any saps application markedly increased the percentage of cumulative retained water conceptually the decline in the percolated water led to an increase in the retained water the amount of cumulative water percolated out of saps treated pots was significantly lower compared with the control treatment with no significant differences among the tested saps regardless of saps concentration the percentage of percolated water was 9 7 12 3 and 12 6 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively compared to 41 8 in the case of control treatment for the three investigated saps water loss by percolation was reduced by increasing saps concentration fig 6 the percentage of percolated water at saps concentration of 0 15 w w was 17 6 21 6 and 22 3 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively and further declined to 4 8 5 5 and 6 0 when saps concentration was increased to 0 45 w w similar trends were observed for the retained water for example saps at a concentration of 0 45 w w increased the percentage of retained water to 95 2 94 5 and 94 0 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively relative to 58 7 retention in the control 3 2 3 soil water content soil water content was measured after two consecutive rain events on june 17th and 18th see fig s1 that totaled 50 0 mm all saps at any tested concentration increased swc significantly relative to the control treatment summing the data for each saps type pots treated with stockosorb 660 resulted in a significant increase in swc compared to hydrosource and superab a200 that both responded similarly the swc was significantly increased by 77 1 63 1 and 59 7 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively relative to the control treatment fig 7 the increase in swc was proportional to concentration for the three tested saps for example in the case of hydrosource the swc was increased to 32 4 38 8 and 43 2 at concentrations of 0 15 0 3 and 0 45 w w respectively compared to 23 4 in the control interestingly saps at concentration 0 45 resulted in a dramatic increase in swc with stockosorb 660 having the greatest effect swc at a saps concentrations of 0 45 w w was 2 06 1 84 and 1 80 fold greater than the control for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively moreover stockosorb 660 at 0 30 was non significantly different from hydrosource and superab a200 at 0 45 w w respectively 3 2 4 plant growth parameters 3 2 4 1 number of leaves the effect of saps addition on number of leaves table 3 was minimal as leaf number was not significantly different from the control at all concentrations however by summing the results for saps type the maximum number of leaves was observed for superab a200 which was significantly higher stockosorb 660 but on par with hydrosource 3 2 4 2 plant height ph saps application at any given concentration significantly dunnett test enhanced ph table 3 fig s2 compared with the control treatment when data were pooled over each saps type no significant differences among the tested saps were observed ph was higher than the control by 21 9 25 9 and 23 2 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively surprisingly no significant differences in ph were recorded in favor of increasing saps concentration table 3 in which all saps treatments were non significantly different 3 2 4 3 leaf area la relative to the control treatment the la was non significantly dunnett test affected by saps type or sap concentration table 3 the only exception was superab a200 at 0 45 w w concentration in which a significantly higher la was observed by pooling the data for each saps type la was increased by 10 66 8 12 and 15 48 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively as compared with the control with no significant differences between the three tested saps maximum la was recorded for superab200 0 45 w w followed by stockosorb 660 0 3 w w and hydrosource 0 30 w w however no significant differences were observed among all saps treatments 3 2 4 4 above ground dry matter agdm the three tested saps at all concentrations significantly dunnett test increased agdm compared with the control treatment table 4 except stockosorb 660 0 45 w w and superab a200 0 15 w w which were statistically equal to the control treatment by pooling the data for each sap type the agdm followed the order hydrosource superab a200 stockosorb 660 hydrosource increased agdm significantly over stockosorb 660 and non significantly over superab a200 table 4 saps treatment increased agdm by 78 5 123 1 and 102 8 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively compared with the control treatment in the case of hydrosource and superab a200 increasing saps concentration had no significant effect on the agdm however in case of stockosorb 660 the highest agdm was recorded at the middle concentration 0 30 w w while further increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w resulted in a significant reduction in agdm maximum agdm was observed for hydrosource 0 45 w w which was on par with all treatments except stockosorb 660 0 45 w w and the control treatment 3 2 4 5 root dry weight rdm in general root dry weight was non significantly dunnett test affected by saps type and concentration with the exceptions being hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 3 w w concentration and super ab a200 0 45 w w in which higher rdm was observed table 4 by summing the results for each sap type hydrosource increased rdm significantly over stockosorb 660 and non significantly over superab a200 table 4 relative to the control treatment saps treated plants had higher rdm by 117 6 334 4 and 177 2 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively rdm was non significantly affected by saps concentration the highest rdm was recorded in case of hydrosource at 0 45 w w that was statistically equal to all treatments except stockosorb 660 0 45 w w superab200 0 15 w w and the control maximum rdm followed a general trend of hydrosource 0 45 w w hydrosource 0 30 w w superab a200 0 45 w w where rdm was 5 37 4 61 and 4 32 fold greater respectively relative to the control 3 2 4 6 dry matter yield dmy dry matter yield is the sum of agdm and rdm all saps treatments significantly dunnett test increased dmy relative to the control treatment with the exceptions being for stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 w w table 4 summing the data over each saps type revealed that hydrosource significantly increased dmy compared to stockosorb 660 and superab a200 with increases over the control of 90 1 184 2 and 124 6 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively maximum dmy was recorded for hydrosource 0 45 w w which was on par with all treatments except stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 w w which were statistically equal to the control treatment in case of hydrosource and superab a200 increasing the concentration showed no effect on dmy as compared to the low concentrations 0 15 and 0 30 w w however in the case of stockosorb 660 maximum dmy was recorded for 0 30 w w concentration while increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w resulted in significant dmy reduction maximum dmy was recorded for the hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed by superab200 at 0 45 w w in which dmy was 3 28 2 94 and 2 8 fold greater than the control treatment respectively 3 2 4 7 leaf water potential leaf water potential was significantly dunnett test higher due to saps application at any given concentration as compared with the control treatment table 3 summing the data over saps type leaf water potential was significantly higher for stockosorb 600 as compared to both hydrosource and superab a200 leaf water potential was significantly higher than the control by 27 3 22 5 and 23 1 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively maximum leaf water potential was observed for stockosorb 660 at 0 45 w w concentration which was on par with all treatments except superab a200 at 0 30 w w and the control treatments table 3 increasing saps concentration to 0 45 w w significantly increased leaf water potential of superab a200 and stockosorb 660 treated plants relative to their own concentrations of 0 30 and 0 15 w w respectively while leaf water potential of hydrosource was not affected by saps concentration 3 2 4 8 biomass rainwater productivity wpbiomass wpbiomass g mm 1 is the ratio between the dmy and the amount of water applied total rainfall with the exceptions of stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 all saps treatments significantly dunnett test enhanced the wpbiomass as compared with the control treatment table 4 summing the results over each saps type hydrosource showed maximum wpbiomass which was significantly higher than stockosorb 600 but at par with superab a200 compared to the control treatment wpbiomass was increased by 90 0 184 0 and 124 0 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively increasing saps concentration showed no significant effect on wpbiomass in the case of hydrosource and superab a200 while in case of stockosorb 660 increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w significantly reduced wpbiomass compared to stockosorb 660 at 0 30 w w maximum wpbiomass was recorded for hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed by superab a200 at 0 45 w w as wpbiomass was 3 3 2 9 and 2 75 fold greater respectively compared to the control 4 discussion with climate change rainfall is becoming irregularly distributed with higher intensity shorter duration and less frequency leading to periods of drought this becomes a serious problem for agriculture when soil whc is low temperatures are high and drought conditions occur at critical growth stages of a cultivated crop saps have been used as water retaining materials that can absorb and retain water in the soil then slowly release it during drought in rainfed agriculture saps might represent a promising twofold benefit retaining a significant amount of rainwater in the soil thus minimizing water percolation by reducing the downward movement of rainwater and providing plants with the water stored inside saps particles when the soil dries in other words saps act as a water reservoir that is quickly filled by water swelling during the rain shower then releases the water de swelling during drought the influence of saps on soil hydraulic properties rainwater transport and storge and crop growth under rainfed agriculture in humid subtropical climate is poorly studied in the present study three commercially available saps were studied and compared under laboratory and field conditions 4 1 laboratory experiments the three tested saps showed high wac with stockosorb 660 having the greatest values at all salinity levels the capacity of saps to absorb water is attributed to their high molecular weight high negative charge three dimensional cross linked structure and hydrophilic functional groups i e hydroxyl carboxyl amide and sulfonic hüttermann et al 2009 spagnol et al 2012c however the wac of saps is known to decline as water salinity increases spagnol et al 2012b zekry et al 2020 the superiority of the stockosorb 660 over superab a200 in terms of wac might be attributed to a smaller particle size bhardwaj et al 2007 and abdallah 2019a found that the wac was inversely correlated with saps particle size however the superiority of stockosorb 660 over hydrosource might be attributed to the difference in the chemical composition polyacrylic acid versus polyacrylamide as both have the same particle size suggesting higher negative charge density in the case of the stockosorb 660 in the presence of soluble salts the cations block the negative active sites in the active groups in the polymer decreasing the water absorbency of the sap spagnol et al 2012c 2012a zhou et al 2012 the pattern of wac with water increasing salinity fig 1 suggests that saps might best perform under rainfed conditions since the three saps were found to be sensitive to salinity with wac almost halved when salinity increased from 0 0 ds m 1 to only 0 5 ds m 1 saps not only were able to retain large amounts of water but also exhibited ability to re swell in the free water fig 2 the observed downward trend in the second and third swelling dehydration cycles has been reported previously abdallah 2019a akhter et al 2004 han et al 2013 spagnol et al 2012c the reduction in wac after repeated wetting drying cycles might be due to the presence of polyvalent cations ca2 and mg2 forming insoluble salts with acrylic acid relatively stable acrylic acid carboxylates shahid et al 2012 the ability of saps to swell in water was confirmed also in the soil where a dramatic increase in whc of saps treated soil was observed in the laboratory fig 3 in such experiments saps performance might be overestimated because saps were provided sufficient time to reach maximum wac by saturating the soil from the bottom however under rainfed conditions water moves quickly downward through soil profile thus an important characteristic of saps is the capacity to quickly absorb rainwater fast swelling before leaching below the root zone this is especially important in light textured soils under intensive rainfall where vertical water movement in the soil is high wei and durian 2014 in a rainfall simulation experiment fig 5 saps decreased the portion of percolated water especially under low rainfall intensity this confirmed that the saps tested here responded as expected for hydrogels to reduce the vertical water flow and accordingly reduce water percolation and increase soil water storage abdallah 2019b farrell et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the observed high rates of water percolation in the control soil could be attributed to the preferential flow paths annaka and hanayama 2010 tullis and wright 2007 yang et al 2015 in light textured soils rainwater only wets a shallow top layer of the soil then the wetting front penetrates the soil and forms narrow water channels wei and durian 2014 the rainwater follows these channels to drain while the rest of the soil remains dry leading to low overall soil water storage and high percolation wei and durian 2014 however in the presence of saps particles the swollen saps effect soil pore geometry and thus reduce the ks the effect of saps application on the portion of percolated water was complimented by the observed reduction in ks values of saps amended soil fig 4 that has been previously well documented abedi koupai et al 2008 agaba et al 2010 andry et al 2009 bhardwaj et al 2007 the reduction in ks of saps treated soil might be ascribed to the swollen saps occupation of soil pores resulting in pore blockage levy et al 2005 bhardwaj et al 2007 han et al 2013 4 2 outdoor pot experiment an outdoor pot experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions in loamy sand soil raleigh nc usa to assess the effects incorporating saps into soil at different concentrations on rainwater storage and physiological performance and growth of corn plants the observed positive effect of saps in minimizing rainwater loss by percolation in the laboratory was confirmed in the pot experiment under rainfed conditions a significant reduction in percolated water volumes was associated with an increase is soil water storage of saps treated soil fig 6 this was reflected by a dramatic increase in soil water content of saps amended soil after two consecutive rain showers 50 mm fig 7 the increased soil water storage and hence decreased water percolation might be attributed to several reasons first a significant part of rainwater was absorbed and retained inside saps particles instead of being percolated abdallah 2019a narjary et al 2012 second when water enters into saps network a gel blocking layer is formed between soil particles that reduced the downward movement of water hüttermann et al 2009 yu et al 2011 third the clogging effects of the swollen saps particles enhanced the capillary storage of water in soil pores taulemesse et al 2015 wei and durian 2014 2013 fourth swelling saps particles modified soil pore geometry size and shape so that rainwater may be directed to dry neighboring pores bhardwaj et al 2007 wei and durian 2014 in saps treated soil at a concentration of 0 45 w w approximately 10 of rainwater was lost by percolation fig 6 similarly wei and durian 2014a reported that saps cannot fully prevent water percolation since saps cannot completely prevent the formation of the narrow water channels because saps have a maximum wac water application rate rain intensity might be higher than water absorption rate by saps and the modification in soil pore structure cannot prevent the formation of narrow water channels the results of our rainfall simulation laboratory experiment fig 5 support this scenario in which a significantly lower percolation for all tested saps was observed under lower rainfall intensity amending the soil with saps resulted in a remarkable positive effect on corn growth parameters under rainfed conditions i e plant height above ground dry weight root dry wight and dry matter yield saps incorporation into the soil resulted in rainwater saving through reduction in water losses by percolation which increased the duration of the presence of water in the soil allowing plants to avoid drought stress and thereby improved plant growth saha et al 2020a the results obtained here under rainfed conditions in a humid subtropical climate nc were consistent with previous ﬁndings for olive trees grown under rainfed conditions in an arid region chehab et al 2018 and for corn plants grown under irrigation in arid and semi arid environments in the green house dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 or in the open field sandoval et al 2017 thus saps appear to be suitable soil conditioners over a wide range of climate and environmental conditions the significant improvement in corn growth observed in the current study in saps treated soil implies that the plants in nc in summer months are subjected to drought stress the use of saps helped to alleviate the problem of poor rainwater distribution throughout the study period about 60 of total rainfall accrued in only five days where each rain event averaged 29 7 mm day 1 in the control treatment the irregular daily rainwater distribution led to a significant water loss by percolation 41 7 of total rainfall and less soil water storage thus plants were subjected to water stress this result was confirmed by the leaf water potential values in which the control treatment exhibited a significantly lower leaf water potential compared to all saps at any given concentration the higher leaf water potential of saps treated plants verified that the soil water content was high for remobilization by the root system to fully complement plant water requirement similar results were observed on olive trees chehab et al 2018 corn islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 guava seedlings abdallah 2019a citrus trees arbona et al 2005 hybrid poplar trees beniwal et al 2010 quercus suber seedlings chirino et al 2011 and pinus halepensis seedlings hüttermann et al 1999 the decline in soil moisture in the control treatment due to rainwater loss by percolation led to a decline in dmy it is well established that reductions in photosynthesis lead to declines in shoot biomass abdallah et al 2019 kemper et al 2011 medrano et al 2015 under water stress particularly under high evaporation demand conditions plants tend to close their stomata leading to a reduction in photosynthesis and thus dmy kemper et al 2011 in contrast the results from saps treatments suggest that plants avoided drought stress because of favorable moisture content therefore producing greater biomass and dmy similarly several studies chehab et al 2018 islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 reported that water stress caused a marked decline in photosynthetic capacity but the application of saps resulted in increased photosynthetic activity and fresh forage production the increase in plant biomass of saps treated soils is in agreement with the published results abdallah 2019a orikiriza et al 2013 sandoval et al 2017 unsurprisingly the dmy was greater in plants that exhibited higher leaf water potential compared to control plants having the poorest water status similar to our results islam et al 2011 reported that corn plants with higher leaf water potential yielded higher dmy since all treatments received the same amount of precipitation the remarkable increase dmy of saps treatment caused a significant increase in wpbiomass of saps treated plants table 4 improvements in wpbiomass under non water stressed conditions following saps treatment has been reported by others abdallah 2019a chehab et al 2018 dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 the noteworthy negative impact on corn growth in case of stockosorb 660 at the highest concentration of 0 45 w w was possibly related to the marked increase in moisture content after rain events and decreased air ﬁlled porosity of soils wei and durian 2014 2013 the presence of stockosorb 660 at 0 45 w w resulted in the minimum percolation and maximum water storage possibly resulting in waterlogging that negatively affected corn plants it may also be caused by lower adaptability of corn seedlings under high moisture levels du et al 2010 olive et al 1990 similar results was reported by islam et al 2011 in which they tested the impact of saps on corn growth under different water regimes and found the rdm sdm and dmy decreased marginally under adequate irrigation of saps treated soil however this was not the case for both hydrosource and superab a200 in which the maximum growth was observed at the maximum concentration 0 45 w w implying that each sap type has a recommended application rate to enhance crop growth the current study due to presumed negative effects of the small number of plants 30 plants on uniform pollination and resultant yield was terminated at r1 growth stage silking stage 70 days after planting to allow for investigating the saps effect on shoot and root biomass accumulation further open field full season experiments are needed to investigate the effect of saps on maize grain yield as well as other crops 5 conclusions in the current study the tested saps showed high wac re swelling capacity and markedly increased whc of the soil and their performance was dependent on water salinity and concentration more than sap type the rainfall simulation experiment showed the ability of the three saps to reduce water loss by percolation and increase soil water storage particularly at low rainfall intensity in an outdoor pot study conducted under rainfed conditions where corn growth was restricted by drought stress the tested saps were capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of rainfall in the soil enhancing soil water storage and reducing the amount of water percolated from 41 0 in the control soil to 4 8 5 5 and 6 02 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively at 0 45 w w concentration the retained water in the soil remained available for the plants resulting in higher leaf water potential and facilitating greater plant growth thus increased biological yields i e plant height above ground dry mass root dry mass and dmy and increased wpbiomass hydrosource at 0 45 w w soil amendment worked best among the tested saps maximum wpbiomass was recorded for hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed by superab a200 at 0 45 w w with respect to the water retention efﬁciency of saps amended soil plant growth at 0 45 w w sap treatment was the optimum selection for sandy loam soils from these trends soil amendment with saps could be suitable practice in rainfed agriculture with irregular rain distribution humid subtropical further open field full season studies are

10026,under climate change the rainfall is predicted to become more intense and less frequent causing summer drought events and rainwater loss by deep percolation resulting in both inefficient use of rainwater and yield reduction super absorbent polymers saps have been studied as soil amendments in arid and semi arid environments but little is known about potential use for drought stress mitigation in humid subtropical climates under rainfed conditions this study investigated the potential of three k based saps stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 to act as water reservoirs during periods of drought in the laboratory saps mixed with sandy soil were tested for water absorption capacity wac and re swelling capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks water holding capacity whc and storage of simulated rainfall saps showed high wac re swelling capacity reduced ks and increased soil whc with performance dependent more on saps concentration than saps type the three saps effectively reduced rainwater transport and increased soil water storage during simulated rainfall in north carolina usa an outdoor pot study with corn in loamy sand soil under rainfed conditions tested the effects of the three saps at three concentrations 0 15 0 30 and 0 45 w w on rainwater transport storage biomass production and biomass rainwater productivity wpbiomass under field conditions 41 76 of rainwater was percolated in the absence of saps while in saps amended soil 0 45 w w only 4 8 5 5 and 6 02 was lost by percolation for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively the retained rainwater resulted in higher leaf water potential leading to enhanced plant growth and wpbiomass stockosorb 660 performed best in terms of rainwater saving while hydrosource was the most effective in terms of plant growth and wpbiomass the results suggest that saps soil amendment is a potential approach to mitigate drought stress under rainfed conditions in humid subtropical climates keywords super absorbent polymers rainfall corn drought water productivity water holding capacity 1 introduction drought is a critical factor that adversely affects crop production and yield stability ahopelto et al 2019 saha et al 2020b as the result of climate change rainfall variability is expected to increase leading to more frequent drought events and intense rainfall events with devastating consequences for crop productivity and the whole agroecosystem hunt et al 2020 zhiña et al 2019 yield losses due to drought become intensified in light textured soils with low water retention when evapotranspiration is high or when plants have a shallow root system abdallah 2019a bhardwaj et al 2007 the consequences of weather variability might be lessened by enhancing soil adaptability to drought periods and to high rainfall intensities through increasing soil water holding capacity whc the total amount that a particular soil can retain patra et al 2019 williams et al 2018 2016 to increase topsoil whc a suitable management tool could be the use of hydrogels super absorbent polymers saps which absorb a significant amount of water and improve the top soil s ability to store water abdallah 2019a kassem et al 2020 sivapalan 2006 zekry et al 2020 however the influence of saps on soil hydraulic properties rainwater transport and storage and crop growth under rainfed agriculture especially under adequate but poorly distributed rainfall is poorly studied since most of the studies are limited to laboratory and glasshouse conditions in arid and semi arid environments saha et al 2020a an agricultural drought is a period when plant water requirements are not met by soil moisture wilhite and glantz 1985 consequently drought is usually manifested by water stress that negatively affects crop growth and productivity especially when drought occurs at critical growth stages of the cultivated crop ayanlade et al 2018 bodner et al 2015 rainfall amount intensity and distribution are vital factors that determine the severity and longevity of drought stress in rainfed agriculture precipitation may meet or exceed crop water requirements but is poorly distributed with intense rain events that exceed soil whc kimaru et al 2019 tsige et al 2019 only the water retained in the root zone is effective for plant growth ali and mubarak 2017 several factors influence the portion of effective rainfall including climatic i e rain amount intensity and frequency while others are soil related i e infiltration capacity and soil whc chehab et al 2018 pan et al 2012 the whc is a vital soil health parameter that can help the agro ecosystem adapt to the occurrence of extreme events e g intensive rain and summer drought blaschek et al 2019 munera echeverri et al 2020 therefore to increase crop production in such environments a larger portion of rain irrigation water must be retained in the topsoil rather than being leached or lost by runoff saha et al 2020a the use of saps can improve the whc of the soil kassem et al 2020 satriani et al 2018 saps are hydrophilic networks that can absorb and retain up to 1000 times more water than their original weight hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 hydrogels are insoluble materials that form three dimensional networks swell in water and hold significant amounts of water due to their cross bonds agaba et al 2010 hüttermann et al 2009 orikiriza et al 2013 in this way saps incorporated into the soil could quickly absorb the rain and or irrigation water and act as a water reservoir that releases water to plants when soil in the root zone starts to dry al jabari et al 2019 sinha 2018 yang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 application of saps to soil may increase soil whc decrease water loss by percolation and increase yield and water fertilizer use efficiency el asmar et al 2017 wei and durian 2014 yu et al 2017 the effects of varying types and amounts of saps in agricultural horticultural or forestry applications have been widely investigated saps application improve tree establishment hüttermann et al 1999 orikiriza et al 2013 enhance tree growth apostol et al 2009 arbona et al 2005 han et al 2013 enhance the growth of ornamental plants koupai et al 2008 and increase yield and growth indices of nursery plants leciejewski 2009 additionally saps have been shown to enhance field crops growth and productivity islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 satriani et al 2018 however several studies demonstrated that saps are subject to aging and their efficiency is significantly reduced after wetting drying cycles banedjschafie and durner 2015 zekry et al 2020 saps beneficial effect on the whc of the soil was found to be decreased by 30 after 2 5 months geesing and schmidhalter 2004 14 after 6 months zekry et al 2020 and 50 after three months banedjschafie and durner 2015 the reduction of the positive effectiveness of saps was attributed to the dissolved salt in soil water or fertilizers bai et al 2013 han et al 2010 zekry et al 2020 cations permanently attach to the carboxylic acid groups of acrylic acid and thus block the active negative sites of the saps and decrease the affinity for water spagnol et al 2012c 2012a zhou et al 2012 therefore the longevity and efficiency of saps in soil depends on soil and irrigation water salinity accordingly it is expected that saps might be more viable under rainfed agriculture due to lower salt input the potential of saps as soil amendment have been widely tested in arid and semi arid environments under irrigated agriculture in particular under laboratory mirdarikvande et al 2014 yu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 and glasshouse conditions dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 sánchez orozco et al 2017 with limited focus on field studies saha et al 2020a however the effect of saps on rainwater transport and storage and crop growth under rainfed agriculture especially under unevenly distributed rainfall is poorly investigated according to the review of saha et al 2020a more studies are required for identifying the best saps application rate in the southeastern usa including north carolina nc several reports indicated that precipitation patterns are shifting towards wetter winters and drier summers with extreme precipitation events boyles and raman 2003 ingram et al 2013 kenneth et al 2013 moreover with the expected increase in air temperature kenneth et al 2013 summer drought events become more frequent longer and more intense due to the increased duration between rain events carbone et al 2008 ingram et al 2013 strzepek et al 2010 many areas in nc are cecil soils ultisols cecil top soils are characterized as brown sandy loam very deep well drained moderately permeable and characterized by low soil whc pan et al 2012 swaby et al 2016 therefore the potential use of saps to increase soil whc under rainfed agriculture is of great importance particularly when summer drought events occur during critical stages of plant growth therefore the objectives of this study were to compare the most promising commercially available saps as well as the optimum concentration that might increase rainwater storage in the surface layer of light textured soil and apply this technology in a study of corn growth under rainfed conditions in nc usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments the water absorption capacity wac and re swelling ability of three commercially available saps were investigated moreover the whc of saps amended soil ks transport and storage of simulated rainfall at two different rainfall intensities were determined the three saps were white granular insoluble hydrophilic polymers and k based cross linked copolymers the saps were selected based on availability and positive effects reported in the literature the selected polymers were stockosorb 660 1 0 2 5 mm polyacrylic acid evonik corporation canada hydrosource 1 0 2 0 mm polyacrylamide hydrosource llc ar usa superab a200 2 5 mm 61 2 mm 20 1 mm 19 acrylamide k acrylate copolymer iramont inc canada the laboratory experiments were conducted using samples of a commercial native sandy soil acquired from a local vendor the soil contained 98 6 1 4 and 1 0 of sand silt and clay respectively the soils were air dried ground and passed through 2 mm sieve and fractions of less than 2 mm were used in the experiments the sandy soil was selected for the experiment because it is well established that saps are more functional in sandy soils therefore we aimed at studying the effect of saps on soil hydraulic properties at their maximum potential efficiency 2 1 1 the water absorption capacity and saps response to salinity to determine the wac one g of each sap type was packed in a teabag and submerged into distilled water until the equilibrium swelling was achieved after excess water was drained out from tea bag the swollen saps was then removed and the total mass g was measured buchholz 1998 similarly the wac was measured at different water salinity 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 ds m 1 water salinity was prepared using nacl and cacl2 2 1 to simulate the dominant dissolved salts in saline water the equilibrium water absorbency of swollen samples was calculated using the following equation spagnol et al 2012a wac ws wd wd where wac is the swelling capacity g water g 1 saps ws and wd are mass of the swollen and dry samples g respectively 2 1 2 re swelling capacity one g of each sap type was immersed in distilled water to reach the swelling equilibrium then swollen saps were filtered out weighted and dehydrated at 80 c after complete drying the recovered saps were rewetted and dehydrated twice consisting three swelling dehydration cycles shahid et al 2012 2 1 3 water holding capacity sealed bottom pvc columns with a diameter of 12 cm and provided with a fine metal mesh in the bottom were used the saps were mixed in the soil at concentrations of 0 2 and 0 4 w w in addition to the soil control without saps the soil columns were saturated from the bottom using tap water 0 5 ds m 1 and once saturated the columns were allowed to drain until all excess water was removed after which soil columns were weighted and the corresponding volumetric water content which represents the whc was calculated abdallah et al 2019 chen et al 2003 2 1 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks a cylinder 20 cm height and a diameter of 8 cm with a fine metal screen at the bottom was used to determine the ks according to moutier et al 2000 the saps amended air dried soil 0 4 w w was packed in the cylinder at a bulk density of 1 6 mg m 3 the cylinders were saturated from the bottom then flow direction was reversed and a constant pressure head of 5 cm was applied the leachate was collected and ks was calculated using darcy s law by measuring the water volume q cm3 measured through a specific time t sec length l cm of specimen cross sectional area a cm2 of the specimen and head h cm all treatments were done in three replicates ks q a t i where i is the hydraulic gradient along a soil column specimen of length l 2 1 5 rainwater transport and storage rainfall simulation pvc columns 16 cm height and a cross section area of 176 6 cm2 with sealed bottoms and a fine metal mesh at the bottom were used the saps amended air dried soil was packed into the column then compacted to reach a desired bulk density of 1 6 mg m 3 using a hammer narjary et al 2012 each sap was mixed with the soil at a concentration of 0 4 w w all columns received a fixed amount of rainfall 100 mm that was enough to generate percolation at two different intensities i e 100 or 200 mm h 1 to collect the percolated water a rubber tube was connected to the bottom of the column after terminating the simulated rain shower the top of the column was enclosed with para film to avoid water loss by evaporation the columns allowed to completely drain the gravimetric water the volume of the percolated and retained water was recorded and their percentage relative to volume of total rainfall was calculated the percentage of stored and percolated water were calculated using the following equations psw vt vp vt 100 ppw vp vt 100 where psw and ppw are the percentage of stored and percolated water respectively vt and vp are the volume cm3 of total water applied and percolated respectively 2 2 outdoor pot experiment 2 2 1 experimental site and climate the experiment was established at the inwood road field site of the usda ars plant research unit in raleigh nc from may to july 2015 the experimental site lies between latitude 35 72 longitude 78 67 and the site elevation is 116 43 m above sea level the climate of the region is humid subtropical the agro metrological data were obtained from the nearest weather station located at the lake wheeler rd field lab lake state climate office of nc nc agricultural research service during 2015 the average daily minimum

acidic very deep well drained and moderately permeable the soil is loamy sand in texture and classified as typic kanhapludults soil survey staff 2014 the main soil physical and chemical properties are presented in table 1 2 2 2 outdoor pot experimental design the experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different saps type and concentrations on rainwater storage transport rainwater productivity and growth and physiological performance of corn plants grown in pots in the field for 70 days under natural rainfed conditions during the plant growth period daily precipitation data were determined by a rain gauge installed at the experimental field site corn crop was selected as it is one of the main summer crops in the region that could be adversely affected by drought the experimental design was randomized complete block design with three replications experiment treatments included three types of saps stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 and three concentrations of each 0 15 0 30 and 0 45 w w in addition to the control 30 pots that were randomized to the experimental units containers air dried surface loamy sand soil sample table 1 was amended with each sap type then containers of 32 l volume 37 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in depth were filled with sap amended soil bulk density of saps amended soil was adjusted to 1 45 mg m 3 to simulate bulk density in the field to reduce the micro climate effect on the pots gheysari et al 2017 each pot was covered with a white plastic bag to reduce the effect of heat conduction through the sides of the pots that was mounted using rubber material without covering soil surface additionally the pots were placed above wooden structures to minimize heat transfer between the pots and the soil and to allow for collecting percolated water if any moreover the pots were weekly hand shifted within the experimental site to ensure that all plants had similar microclimate three corn seeds pot were sown on may 20 2015 pots were not irrigated and rainfed agriculture was practiced each plant received the recommended rate of slow release fertilizer osmocote plus scotts sierra horticultural products marysville oh usa 15 9 12 n p k which was thoroughly mixed with the soil before planting after emergence and upon full expansion of the third leaf v2 growth stage seedlings were thinned to one plant per pot the percolated water if any was collected using white plastic bags mounted carefully around the pots from the bottom and its volume was determined after each rain event the ratio of retained water in the soil to total precipitation measured by a rain gage located 10 m away from the plants was used as a measure of rainwater storage for each rain event the cumulative water retained rainwater storage in the soil was calculated by subtracting the cumulative percolation from the cumulative rainfall measured by the on site rain gage the moisture content was measured by weighting the pots and using a soil moisture meter model hb 2 manufacturer rittenhouse of st catharines ontario canada which provided real time readings at 70 days after planting r1 growth stage silking stage plants were harvested and plant growth parameters were determined 2 2 3 measurements 2 2 3 1 leaf water potential ψw leaf water potential was measured at vt growth stage tasseling stage complete leaf and root development

replicate the third fully expanded fully emerged leaf from the plant s tip was selected cut and immediately placed in the pressure chamber with about 5 mm of the cut end protruding through the compressible rubber gland used to seal the chamber compressed breathing air was released into the chamber until the sap returned to the cut end of the xylem and the pressure required was recorded mpa

completely randomized design using glmmix procedure in sas 9 4 sas 2013 inc cary nc 2013 laboratory experiments were analyzed as one way factorial treatments and significance of differences among means were determined using tukey s test the data of outdoor pot experiment were subjected to the analysis of variance using as one way factorial design when treatments were compared to the common control using dunnet s test however a two way factorial treatment structure was used when the main effects of the saps were compared using tukey s test significant effects and interactions were determined at significance level of 5 p 0 05 and were compared according to tukey s test treatments were compared at significance level of 5 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 laboratory studies 3 1 1 water absorption capacity of saps the results of wac of saps at different water salinity are presented in fig 1 all saps exhibited high wac in distilled water where a large amount of water ranging from 238 3 to 374 g g 1 g water g 1 saps was absorbed for the saps a non linear negative relation between wac g g 1 and water salinity ds m 1 was recorded the wac was lessened by more than half when a salinity of 0 5 ds m 1 was used the salinity response curve might be divided into two stages the first stage from 0 0 to 1 0 ds m 1 with a sharp decrease in wac in response to increased water salinity and the second stage from 1 0 to 5 0 ds m 1 where a smooth and gradual reduction in wac was observed under high salinity conditions 5 0 ds m 1 the saps were still able to absorb a noteworthy amount of water 52 7 91 7 g g 1 the wac of the tested saps followed this order stockosorb 660 hydrosource superab a200 stockosorb 660 showed a significantly p 0 05 higher wac at all water salinities 3 1 2 re swelling capacity of tested polymers the results presented in fig 2 revealed that all tested saps were able to re swell in the water but with a downward trend in the second and third swelling cycles in first swelling cycle maximum wac was recorded ranged from 238 3 to 374 3 g g 1 in the second cycle the maximum wac reduced to range from 221 7 362 0 g g 1 stockosorb 660 was superior to superab a200 and hydrosource for the three wetting drying cycles demonstrating higher wac and re swelling ability for example in the third swelling cycle the swelling capacity of stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 was reduced by 4 43 8 5 and 11 9 respectively compared to the initial swelling 1st swelling cycle 3 1 3 water holding capacity of the soil all tested saps drastically increased the whc of the soil 98 6 sand as compared with the control fig 3 the whc was a function of saps concentration and saps type pooling the data for the saps type the whc of saps amended soil was higher than the control by 2 38 2 12 and 2 18 times for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively amending the soil with 0 2 saps increased the whc by 2 08 1 9 and 2 0 times for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively compared to the control increasing saps concentration to 0 4 increased the whc by 2 7 2 35 and 2 36 folds for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively stockosorb 660 at any concentration increased soil whc in comparison to superab a200 and hydrosource that exhibited similar soil whc at both concentrations 3 1 4 saturated hydraulic conductivity the results presented in fig 4 showed that the ks values were a function of polymer type and concentration the presence of polymers significantly p 0 05 reduced the ks which were initially 1 35 m h 1 summing the data for the saps concentration the ks was reduced by 37 7 40 5 and 44 3 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively lower ks values were recorded at the higher saps concentration fig 4 no significant differences were observed between superab a200 and stockosorb 660 at any given concentration however hydrosource exhibited lower ks values as compared to both superab a200 and stockosorb 660 at 0 2 w w concentration 3 1 5 simulation of rainwater transport and storage in this experiment 100 mm of simulated rainwater was applied after which the percolated water was measured the amount of percolated water and thereby the retained water in the soil was affected by rainfall intensity more than saps type relative to the control saps treated soil retained higher amounts of rainwater thus lower percolated water volumes were observed fig 5 the effect of saps was more pronounced under low rainfall intensity in which saps treated soil retained 87 0 mm and 69 7 mm for the low and high rain intensities respectively while the control soil retained only 33 6 mm under the low rainfall intensity the tested saps acted equally where about 87 5 mm of rainwater was stored in the soil fig 5 however when rain intensity increased stockosorb 660 retained a higher amount of water as compared to superab a200 and hydrosource 3 2 outdoor pot experiment 3 2 1 rainfall distribution pattern the study was conducted during the summer 20th may to 25th july at the experimental site the monthly average rainfall was quite uniformly distributed in which 134 62 mm and 113 8 mm for june and july respectively were recorded however the results presented in table 2 and in the supplementary materials fig s1 revealed that daily rainfall distribution throughout the study period was very erratic about 60 of total precipitation was accrued only in five days with consecutive days of rainfall occurring only once during the period of 17th and 18th june fig s1 these five rainy days represented 6 9 of total period with an average of 29 7 mm day 1 event however 46 dry days without precipitation represented 63 8 of total period with maximum et0 values recorded for june and july this non uniform rainwater distribution suggested that corn plants grown in such light textured soils loamy sand were subjected to short drought periods on one hand and intensive rain events of over watering on the other hand that could decrease yield and result in inefficient use of rainwater and possible leaching of nutrients 3 2 2 infield rainwater transport and storage the percolated water was collected after each rain event if any saps application markedly increased the percentage of cumulative retained water conceptually the decline in the percolated water led to an increase in the retained water the amount of cumulative water percolated out of saps treated pots was significantly lower compared with the control treatment with no significant differences among the tested saps regardless of saps concentration the percentage of percolated water was 9 7 12 3 and 12 6 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively compared to 41 8 in the case of control treatment for the three investigated saps water loss by percolation was reduced by increasing saps concentration fig 6 the percentage of percolated water at saps concentration of 0 15 w w was 17 6 21 6 and 22 3 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively and further declined to 4 8 5 5 and 6 0 when saps concentration was increased to 0 45 w w similar trends were observed for the retained water for example saps at a concentration of 0 45 w w increased the percentage of retained water to 95 2 94 5 and 94 0 for stockosorb 660 superab a200 and hydrosource respectively relative to 58 7 retention in the control 3 2 3 soil water content soil water content was measured after two consecutive rain events on june 17th and 18th see fig s1 that totaled 50 0 mm all saps at any tested concentration increased swc significantly relative to the control treatment summing the data for each saps type pots treated with stockosorb 660 resulted in a significant increase in swc compared to hydrosource and superab a200 that both responded similarly the swc was significantly increased by 77 1 63 1 and 59 7 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively relative to the control treatment fig 7 the increase in swc was proportional to concentration for the three tested saps for example in the case of hydrosource the swc was increased to 32 4 38 8 and 43 2 at concentrations of 0 15 0 3 and 0 45 w w respectively compared to 23 4 in the control interestingly saps at concentration 0 45 resulted in a dramatic increase in swc with stockosorb 660 having the

case of hydrosource and superab a200 increasing saps concentration had no significant effect on the agdm however in case of stockosorb 660 the highest agdm was recorded at the middle concentration 0 30 w w while further increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w resulted in a significant reduction in agdm maximum agdm was observed for hydrosource 0 45 w w which was on par with all treatments except stockosorb 660 0 45 w w and the control treatment 3 2 4 5 root dry weight rdm in general root dry weight was non significantly dunnett test affected by saps type and concentration with the exceptions

relative to the control treatment with the exceptions being for stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 w w table 4 summing the data over each saps type revealed that hydrosource significantly increased dmy compared to stockosorb 660 and superab a200 with increases over the control of 90 1 184 2 and 124 6 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively maximum dmy was recorded for hydrosource 0 45 w w which was on par with all treatments except stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 w w which were statistically equal to the control treatment in case of hydrosource and superab a200 increasing the concentration showed no effect on dmy as compared to the low concentrations 0 15 and 0 30 w w however in the case of stockosorb 660 maximum dmy was recorded for 0 30 w w concentration while increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w resulted in significant dmy reduction maximum dmy was recorded for the hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed

maximum leaf water potential was observed for stockosorb 660 at 0 45 w w concentration which was on par with all treatments except superab a200 at 0 30 w w and the control treatments table 3 increasing saps concentration to 0 45 w w significantly increased leaf water potential of superab a200 and stockosorb 660 treated plants relative to their own concentrations of 0 30 and 0 15 w w respectively while leaf water potential of hydrosource was not affected by saps concentration 3 2 4 8 biomass rainwater productivity wpbiomass wpbiomass g mm 1 is the ratio between the dmy and the amount of water applied total rainfall with the exceptions of stockosorb 660 0 45 and 0 15 w w and super ab a200 0 15 all saps treatments significantly dunnett test enhanced the wpbiomass as compared with the control treatment table 4 summing the results over each saps type hydrosource showed maximum wpbiomass which was significantly higher than stockosorb 600 but at par with superab a200 compared to the control treatment wpbiomass was increased by 90 0 184 0 and 124 0 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively increasing saps concentration showed no significant effect on wpbiomass in the case of hydrosource and superab a200 while in case of stockosorb 660 increasing the concentration to 0 45 w w significantly reduced wpbiomass compared to stockosorb 660 at 0 30 w w maximum wpbiomass was recorded for hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed by superab a200 at 0 45 w w as wpbiomass was 3 3 2 9 and 2 75 fold greater respectively compared to the control 4 discussion with climate change rainfall is becoming irregularly distributed with higher intensity shorter duration and less frequency leading to periods of drought this becomes a serious problem for agriculture when soil whc is low temperatures are high and drought conditions occur at critical growth stages of a cultivated crop saps have been used as water retaining materials that can absorb and retain water in the soil then slowly release it during drought in rainfed agriculture saps might represent a promising twofold benefit retaining a significant amount of rainwater in the soil thus minimizing water percolation by reducing the downward movement of rainwater and providing plants with the water stored inside saps particles when the soil dries in other words saps act as a water reservoir that is quickly filled by water swelling during the rain shower then releases the water de swelling during drought the influence of saps on soil hydraulic properties rainwater transport and storge and crop growth under rainfed agriculture in humid subtropical climate is poorly studied in the present study three commercially available saps were studied and compared under laboratory and field conditions 4 1 laboratory experiments the three tested saps showed high wac with stockosorb 660 having the greatest values at all salinity levels the capacity of saps to absorb water is attributed to their high molecular weight high negative charge three dimensional cross linked structure and hydrophilic functional groups i e hydroxyl carboxyl amide and sulfonic hüttermann et al 2009 spagnol et al 2012c however the wac of saps is known to decline as water salinity increases spagnol et al 2012b zekry et al 2020 the superiority of the stockosorb 660 over superab a200 in terms of wac might be attributed to a smaller particle size bhardwaj et al 2007 and abdallah 2019a found that the wac was inversely correlated with saps particle size however the superiority of stockosorb 660 over hydrosource might be attributed to the difference in the chemical composition polyacrylic acid versus polyacrylamide as both have the same particle size suggesting higher negative charge density in the case of the stockosorb 660 in the presence of soluble salts the cations block the negative active sites in the active groups in the polymer decreasing the water absorbency of the sap spagnol et al 2012c 2012a zhou et al 2012 the pattern of wac with water increasing salinity fig 1 suggests that saps might best perform under rainfed conditions since the three saps were found to be sensitive to salinity with wac almost halved when salinity increased from 0 0 ds m 1 to only 0 5 ds m 1 saps not only were able to retain large amounts of water but also exhibited ability to re swell in the free water fig 2 the observed downward trend in the second and third swelling dehydration cycles has been reported previously abdallah 2019a akhter et al 2004 han et al 2013 spagnol et al 2012c the reduction in wac after repeated wetting drying cycles might be due to the presence of polyvalent cations ca2 and mg2 forming insoluble salts with acrylic acid relatively stable acrylic acid carboxylates shahid et al 2012 the ability of saps to swell in water was confirmed also in the soil where a dramatic increase in whc of saps treated soil was observed in the laboratory fig 3 in such experiments saps performance might be overestimated because saps were provided sufficient time to reach maximum wac by saturating the soil from the bottom however under rainfed conditions water moves quickly downward through soil profile thus an important characteristic of saps is the capacity to quickly absorb rainwater fast swelling before leaching below the root zone this is especially important in light textured soils under intensive rainfall where vertical water movement in the soil is high wei and durian 2014 in a rainfall simulation experiment fig 5 saps decreased the portion of percolated water especially under low rainfall intensity this confirmed that the saps tested here responded as expected for hydrogels to reduce the vertical water flow and accordingly reduce water percolation and increase soil water storage abdallah 2019b farrell et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the observed high rates of water percolation in the control soil could be attributed to the preferential flow paths annaka and hanayama 2010 tullis and wright 2007 yang et al 2015 in light textured soils rainwater only wets a shallow top layer of the soil then the wetting front penetrates the soil and forms narrow water channels wei and durian 2014 the rainwater follows these channels to drain while the rest of the soil remains dry leading to low overall soil water storage and high percolation wei and durian 2014 however in the presence of saps particles the swollen saps effect soil pore geometry and thus reduce the ks the effect of saps application on the portion of percolated water was complimented by the observed reduction in ks values of saps amended soil fig 4 that has been previously well documented abedi koupai et al 2008 agaba et al 2010 andry et al 2009 bhardwaj et al 2007 the reduction in ks of saps treated soil might be ascribed to the swollen saps occupation of soil pores resulting in pore blockage levy et al 2005 bhardwaj et al 2007 han et al 2013 4 2 outdoor pot experiment an outdoor pot experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions in loamy sand soil raleigh nc usa to assess the effects incorporating saps into soil at different concentrations on rainwater storage and physiological performance and growth of corn plants the observed positive effect of saps in minimizing rainwater loss by percolation in the laboratory was confirmed in the pot experiment under rainfed conditions a significant reduction in percolated water volumes was associated with an increase is soil water storage of saps treated soil fig 6 this was reflected by a dramatic increase in soil water content of saps amended soil after two consecutive rain showers 50 mm fig 7 the increased soil water storage and hence decreased water percolation might be attributed to several reasons first a significant part of rainwater was absorbed and retained inside saps particles instead of being percolated abdallah 2019a narjary et al 2012 second when water enters into saps network a gel blocking layer is formed between soil particles that reduced the downward movement of water hüttermann et al 2009 yu et al 2011 third the clogging effects of the swollen saps particles enhanced the capillary storage of water in soil pores taulemesse et al 2015 wei and durian 2014 2013 fourth swelling saps particles modified soil pore geometry size and shape so that rainwater may be directed to dry neighboring pores bhardwaj et al 2007 wei and durian 2014 in saps treated soil at a concentration of 0 45 w w approximately 10 of rainwater was lost by percolation fig 6 similarly wei and durian 2014a reported that saps cannot fully prevent water percolation since saps cannot completely prevent the formation of the narrow water channels because saps have a maximum wac water application rate rain intensity might be higher than water absorption rate by saps and the modification in soil pore structure cannot prevent the formation of narrow water channels the results of our rainfall simulation laboratory experiment fig 5 support this scenario in which a significantly lower percolation for all tested saps was observed under lower rainfall intensity amending the soil with saps resulted in a remarkable positive effect on corn growth parameters under rainfed conditions i e plant height above ground dry weight root dry wight and dry matter yield saps incorporation into the soil resulted in rainwater saving through reduction in water losses by percolation which increased the duration of the presence of water in the soil allowing plants to avoid drought stress and thereby improved plant growth saha et al 2020a the results obtained here under rainfed conditions in a humid subtropical climate nc were consistent with previous ﬁndings for olive trees grown under rainfed conditions in an arid region chehab et al 2018 and for corn plants grown under irrigation in arid and semi arid environments in the green house dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 or in the open field sandoval et al 2017 thus saps appear to be suitable soil conditioners over a wide range of climate and environmental conditions the significant improvement in corn growth observed in the current study in saps treated soil implies that the plants in nc in summer months are subjected to drought stress the use of saps helped to alleviate the problem of poor rainwater distribution throughout the study period about 60 of total rainfall accrued in only five days where each rain event averaged 29 7 mm day 1 in the control treatment the irregular daily rainwater distribution led to a significant water loss by percolation 41 7 of total rainfall and less soil water storage thus plants were subjected to water stress this result was confirmed by the leaf water potential values in which the control treatment exhibited a significantly lower leaf water potential compared to all saps at any given concentration the higher leaf water potential of saps treated plants verified that the soil water content was high for remobilization by the root system to fully complement plant water requirement similar results were observed on olive trees chehab et al 2018 corn islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 guava seedlings abdallah 2019a citrus trees arbona et al 2005 hybrid poplar trees beniwal et al 2010 quercus suber seedlings chirino et al 2011 and pinus halepensis seedlings hüttermann et al 1999 the decline in soil moisture in the control treatment due to rainwater loss by percolation led to a decline in dmy it is well established that reductions in photosynthesis lead to declines in shoot biomass abdallah et al 2019 kemper et al 2011 medrano et al 2015 under water stress particularly under high evaporation demand conditions plants tend to close their stomata leading to a reduction in photosynthesis and thus dmy kemper et al 2011 in contrast the results from saps treatments suggest that plants avoided drought stress because of favorable moisture content therefore producing greater biomass and dmy similarly several studies chehab et al 2018 islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 reported that water stress caused a marked decline in photosynthetic capacity but the application of saps resulted in increased photosynthetic activity and fresh forage production the increase in plant biomass of saps treated soils is in agreement with the published results abdallah 2019a orikiriza et al 2013 sandoval et al 2017 unsurprisingly the dmy was greater in plants that exhibited higher leaf water potential compared to control plants having the poorest water status similar to our results islam et al 2011 reported that corn plants with higher leaf water potential yielded higher dmy since all treatments received the same amount of precipitation the remarkable increase dmy of saps treatment caused a significant increase in wpbiomass of saps treated plants table 4 improvements in wpbiomass under non water stressed conditions following saps treatment has been reported by others abdallah 2019a chehab et al 2018 dorraji et al 2010 islam et al 2011 sandoval et al 2017 the noteworthy negative impact on corn growth in case of stockosorb 660 at the highest concentration of 0 45 w w was possibly related to the marked increase in moisture content after rain events and decreased air ﬁlled porosity of soils wei and durian 2014 2013 the presence of stockosorb 660 at 0 45 w w resulted in the minimum percolation and maximum water storage possibly resulting in waterlogging that negatively affected corn plants it may also be caused by lower adaptability of corn seedlings under high moisture levels du et al 2010 olive et al 1990 similar results was reported by islam et al 2011 in which they tested the impact of saps on corn growth under different water regimes and found the rdm sdm and dmy decreased marginally under adequate irrigation of saps treated soil however this was not the case for both hydrosource and superab a200 in which the maximum growth was observed at the maximum concentration 0 45 w w implying that each sap type has a recommended application rate to enhance crop growth the current study due to presumed negative effects of the small number of plants 30 plants on uniform pollination and resultant yield was terminated at r1 growth stage silking stage 70 days after planting to allow for investigating the saps effect on shoot and root biomass accumulation further open field full season experiments are needed to investigate the effect of saps on maize grain yield as well as other crops 5 conclusions in the current study the tested saps showed high wac re swelling capacity and markedly increased whc of the soil and their performance was dependent on water salinity and concentration more than sap type the rainfall simulation experiment showed the ability of the three saps to reduce water loss by percolation and increase soil water storage particularly at low rainfall intensity in an outdoor pot study conducted under rainfed conditions where corn growth was restricted by drought stress the tested saps were capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of rainfall in the soil enhancing soil water storage and reducing the amount of water percolated from 41 0 in the control soil to 4 8 5 5 and 6 02 for stockosorb 660 hydrosource and superab a200 respectively at 0 45 w w concentration the retained water in the soil remained available for the plants resulting in higher leaf water potential and facilitating greater plant growth thus increased biological yields i e plant height above ground dry mass root dry mass and dmy and increased wpbiomass hydrosource at 0 45 w w soil amendment worked best among the tested saps maximum wpbiomass was recorded for hydrosource at 0 45 w w and 0 30 w w followed by superab a200 at 0 45 w w with respect to the water retention efﬁciency of saps amended soil plant growth at 0 45 w w sap treatment was the optimum selection for sandy loam soils from these trends soil amendment with saps could be suitable practice in rainfed agriculture with irregular rain distribution humid subtropical further open field full season studies are

10027,water consumption is closely related to crop growth and development and optimizing its characteristics will be beneficial to water saving and high yield of crops to find out the more promising cultivation technology to optimize water consumption characteristics and improve crop water productivity for winter wheat a four year field experiment in 2015 2019 was conducted in a randomized and complete block design in the loess plateau of northwest china the experimental treatments i whole plastic film mulching pfm coverage rate was approximately 100 ii straw strips mulching ssm including the alternating straw strip 0 5 m and plant strip 0 35 m and the coverage rate was 59 iii conventional flat planting without mulching ck the obtained results showed that pfm and ssm increased the contribution rate of precipitation to evapotranspiration inhibited evaporation but promoted transpiration to a great extent reduced soil water storage consumption in the 0 60 cm but promoted it in the 150 200 cm soil layer reduced soil water storage consumption at the early growth stage but promoted it at the middle growth stage compared with ck in 2015 2019 compared with ck pfm and ssm respectively decreased soil water consumption by 12 4 and 10 6 in the 0 60 cm soil layer but increased it by 46 6 and 27 7 in the 150 200 cm soil layer pfm and ssm reduced evapotranspiration by 20 1 and 14 4 before the jointing stage due to the low water consumption intensity but increased it by 26 8 and 11 1 from jointing to blooming stage due to the high water consumption intensity besides pfm and ssm respectively improved crop water productivity by 20 1 and 19 1 improved precipitation use efficiency by 20 0 and 18 6 and eventually increased grain yield by 18 1 and 16 5 ssm was less effective than pfm but taking the friendly sustainability into consideration ssm would probably be a potential practice to develop the rainfed agriculture keywords plastic film straw strips soil water storage evapotranspiration winter wheat 1 introduction drought is a worldwide severe problem for crop production limiting agricultural development including the rare annual precipitation and unevenly temporal distribution gan et al 2013 high evaporation and low precipitation use efficiency and crop water productivity peng et al 2020 particularly serious on the semi arid loess plateau of china and these problems are becoming more serious with the significant impacts on agriculture of global climate change winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the main grain crop in china its main growth stage is from april to june which is widely planted in northwest china and plays an important role in national grain production however the yield of winter wheat is low and unstable due to the seasonal drought he et al 2016 2017 and the contradiction between supply and demand of soil water ahmadzai et al 2017 plastic mulching and straw mulching are two major agricultural water conservation strategies to improve crop water productivity and increase crop production tang et al 2008 kader et al 2017 the plastic film mulching decreases the evaporation s x li et al 2013 enhances the soil water conservation gan et al 2013 distributes the soil water storage again and therefore relieves water stress to a large extent li et al 2004 chakraborty et al 2008 ultimately improves the soil water supply capacity zhou et al 2011 li et al 2004 besides it also improves the crop yield due to its positive effects such as the high crop water productivity mo et al 2017 however the long term plastic film mulching causes large amounts of plastic residues in the soil which has a negative effect on soil environment and restrains the sustainable development of agriculture ultimately straw mulching is a simple and easy to operate technique which is more environmental friendly than plastic film mulching in areas with locally available straw resources it plays a role of conserving soil moisture sidhu et al 2007 balwinder singh et al 2011 and decreasing soil temperature chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019 reducing soil evaporation chen et al 2007 s x li et al 2013 and improving the crop yield sidhu et al 2007 however the adverse effects on soil temperature especially in the spring have limited the development of straw mulching in recent years straw mulch technology has been improved by zhao et al 2019 as an alternative to plastic film mulch for wheat production on the loess plateau which provides a prospect for the exploration and development of straw mulching technology it is probably necessary to carry out a new straw mulching technology to improve soil water storage and optimize water consumption characteristics in particular it s very important to improve crop water productivity and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions by narrowing the gap between soil water supply and crop water demand rockström et al 2007 reducing invalid water consumption in the upper soil layer li et al 2016 and promoting the deep water utilization li et al 2004 is an urgent problem in the water saving agriculture and making full use of precipitation to save the soil water as much as possible is one of the basic way to realize efficient water use in dryland agriculture li et al 2016 mo et al 2017 our study adopted a whole plastic film mulching system pfm to completely prevent evaporation from the soil surface and collect the precipitation as much as possible yang et al 2012 y p wang et al 2016 adopted straw strips mulching system ssm to reduce the threat of low temperature in spring and high temperature in summer previous researches on the northwest loess plateau showed that the plastic film mulching system significantly improved corn yield by improving soil water storage and root distribution thidar et al 2020 and the straw strips mulching system significantly improved yield and crop water productivity for potato by regulating water and temperature as well as influencing temporal and spatial variation chen et al 2019 chang et al 2020 compared with the conventional tillage without mulch but didn t do a further study about the water consumption characteristics as for the effect of mulching cultivation on water consumption the previous studies wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 thidar et al 2020 peng et al 2020 chang et al 2020 were mainly based on the fact that the soil water storage was different for each treatment at the sowing stage due to mulching in advance or continuous cropping however from the perspective of the same soil water storage at the sowing stage under all treatments in this paper researching the water consumption characteristics and winter wheat grain yield under the improved technologies in a semiarid area of northwest china would provide the theoretical basis for agricultural water management and field crops research at home and abroad therefore we conducted a four year field experiment from 2015 to 2019 on the semi arid loess plateau of china the objectives were 1 to assess the effects of whole plastic film mulching and straw strips mulching on winter wheat grain yield 2 to evaluate crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency 3 to research for the characteristic of water consumption and 4 to determine a relatively appropriate mulching cultivation pattern for winter wheat combined with economic benefit analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted during four growing seasons of winter wheat at tongwei modern dryland circular farming experiment station 35 11 n 105 19 e altitude 1750 m dingxi city gansu province of china the annual mean soil evaporation was 1500 mm in the experimental site and general situation had been described in previous studies chen et al 2019 chang et al 2020 this region was a typical temperate continental climate with large variation in rainfall quantity and distribution rainfall mainly concentrated in july august and september but relatively less in the main water demand period april may and june of winter wheat the soil type was classified as loess soil and the average bulk density was 1 25 g cm 3 in terms of 0 200 cm soil layer the fundamental soil characteristics were reported as follows soil organic carbon 8 81 9 12 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 69 0 72 g kg 1 available phosphorus 6 94 7 66 mg kg 1 and available potassium 115 5 133 8 mg kg 1 and ph 8 1 8 3 2 2 weather conditions precipitation was shown in fig 1a the total precipitation p 0 mm was 194 8 mm 2015 2016 200 7 mm 2016 2017 272 5 mm 2017 2018 and 239 5 mm 2018 2019 respectively during the whole growing period of winter wheat at the experimental station and the precipitation p 5 mm was up to 112 8 mm 127 1 mm 190 5 mm and 219 6 mm respectively the air temperature of each day fig 1b was different obviously during winter wheat growth period from regreening to the maturity stage and abnormal climate cold spell in later spring occurred before or after jointing or booting which caused the greatest amplitude of temperature variation around the may 13th of 2016 april 19th of 2017 april 15th of 2018 and may 7th of 2019 and the minimum daily mean air temperature was 2 0 3 0 2 7 and 3 3 respectively in particular it was characterized by low temperature at the early stage but high temperature at the late stage in 2015 2016 while it was rainy and low temperature during the critical growth period in 2018 2019 according to the average precipitation 219 6 mm during the whole growth period over the past 46 years the first and the second study year were relatively dry the third and the fourth study year were relatively wet 2 3 experimental design and field management the following three cultivation treatments were arranged in a randomized and complete block design with three replicates per treatment in the plots of more than 50 m2 length 8 5 28 0 m width 6 0 15 0 m in 2015 2019 depending on the size of the experimental field and the ease of operation 1 whole plastic film mulching pfm the soil was fully covered by plastic film and the coverage rate was approximately 100 the plastic film was white polyethylene with 1 2 m width and 0 008 mm in thickness and there were small holes caused by a sharp object spaced at 0 4 m on it for rainfall infiltration winter wheat was sown by a hill drop planter with 0 2 m spacing between rows there were about 10 seeds in a single hole pic 1 2 conventional flat planting without mulching ck the row distances were all 0 2 m pic 2 3 straw strips mulching ssm including the alternating the straw strip 0 5 m width and the plant strip 0 35 m width and the coverage rate was 59 the sowing quantity of winter wheat per unit area is calculated according to the total area of the straw strip zones and the plant strip zones three rows drill seeding with local density were evenly carried out in the plant strip the row spacing was 0 15 m and the spacing between the edge of the straw strip zone and the rows on both sides of the plant strip zone was 2 5 cm to prevent the straw from pressing the seedlings pic 3 in terms of the straw strips mulching the air dried maize straws were uniformly placed by hand on the pre reserved straw strips at three leaf stage of wheat at a rate of 9 0 t ha 1 equivalent to the local maize straws production per unit area that were collected from the harvested maize fields of local farmers the soil tillage and sowing time fertilizer amount and field management measures were the same for each treatment the sowing quantity of winter wheat longzhong 2 per unit area was 225 kg ha 1 make it certain at a density of 375 104 plants ha 1 for all treatments in accordance with local practice both urea 150 kg n ha 1 and superphosphate 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 as base fertilizer were evenly broadcast on the soil surface and ploughed into the soil prior to sowing 2 4 sampling and measurement methods 2 4 1 soil water

al 2019 chang et al 2020 a 0 05 m diameter handheld soil auger was used to take the random soil samples in the middle part between the two rows of plants in plots of the three treatments 2 4 2 evapotranspiration and crop water productivity evapotranspiration et was determined by the total precipitation and soil water storage consumption because there was no irrigation surface runoff or groundwater during the growth period crop water productivity cwp kg m 3 was defined as grain yield divided by et fernández et al 2020 and precipitation use efficiency pue kg m 3 was defined as grain yield divided by precipitation peng et al 2020 the evapotranspiration was determined by the equation of soil water balance et p δw where p is the total precipitation during the growth period and the δw is the change of soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer 2 4 3 estimation of evaporation and transpiration we made a simple estimation according to the method of a chinese scholar who did the estimation of evaporation evapotranspiration e et for winter wheat in the arid region of northwest china based on simdualkc model z s wang et al 2016 the surface coverage of whole plastic film mulching was approximately 100 because the holes were small and covered by plants so the value of e et was about 1 06 for it according to the above method we used dry matter of different stages and the corresponding transpiration from whole plastic film mulching plots to develop a regression equation to estimate the water loss by transpiration in non mulched and straw strips mulched plots s x li et al 2013 2 4 4 yield and its components whole plots were harvested at the maturity stage each year and grain yields determined at 13 grain moisture content spike number of unit area was surveyed in the field kernel number per spike and thousand grain weight was tested in the science lab 2 5 statistical analyses the data and figures of air temperature soil moisture storage cwp evapotranspiration and yield were processed with the software of microsoft excel 2010 ibm spss statistics 22 and origin pro 9 all the data were analyzed by using one way analysis of variance anova and the differences of mean values among different treatments were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer fig 2 showed the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer under different treatments was basically the same and great at the sowing stage but was different and less at the maturity stage mulching cultivation improved sws at the maturity stage compared with ck on the whole but varied with growing season to be specific pfm and ssm respectively improved p 0 05 sws by 13 2 mm and 25 9 mm in 2015 2016 pfm reduced sws by 15 9 mm p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between ssm and ck in 2016 2017 pfm improved sws by 13 2 mm p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between ssm and ck in 2017 2018 there was no significant difference among different treatments in 2018 2019 3 2 precipitation and soil water storage consumption 3 2 1 precipitation and soil water storage consumption during the whole growing period the water consumption due to evapotranspiration during the whole growth period of winter wheat mainly depended on the natural precipitation and also involved soil water storage consumption δw of 0 200 cm soil layer table 1 on the whole mulching improved the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration decreased the ratio of δw to evapotranspiration in the upper 0 60 cm soil layer but increased it in the deeper 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck mulching cultivation had the effect of saving water on the whole in addition to increasing et compared with ck in 2016 2017 pfm and ssm reduced et more or less in other years although there was no significant difference among different treatments for δw in the total 0 200 cm soil layer there were significant differences in the different soil layers in the relatively dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 mulching significantly decreased the quantity of δw in the 0 60 cm soil layer but significantly increased that in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck in the relatively wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 in addition to pfm reducing the δw p 0 05 compared with ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in 2017 2018 there was no significant difference among different treatments for δw in the both 0 60 cm and 150 200 cm soil layer according to the average of four years pfm and ssm significantly decreased the quantity of δw by 12 4 and 10 6 in the 0 60 cm soil layer but significantly increased it by 46 6 and 27 7 in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck respectively 3 2 2 precipitation and soil water storage consumption at the different growth stages the water consumption due to evapotranspiration et at the different growth stages of winter wheat still mainly depended on the natural precipitation table 2 mulching increased the contribution rate of precipitation to evapotranspiration p et but decreased the ratio of δw to evapotranspiration δw et in early stage decreased p et but increased δw et in middle stage compared with ck on the whole according to the average of four years pfm and ssm increased p et or decreased δw et by 15 5 and 10 4 points from sowing to the jointing stage but decreased p et or increased δw et by 14 6 and 6 9 points from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck in terms of the soil water storage consumption δw in the 0 200 cm soil layer mulching decreased δw in the early stage but increased it in the middle stage compared with ck on the whole according to the average of four years pfm and ssm significantly decreased δw by 52 6 and 37 7 from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it by 87 1 and 36 0 from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck 3 2 3 spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water storage consumption there was a relatively general trend in different years that is the δw under almost all treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layer were highest before the jointing stage but the δw under almost all treatments in the 60 150 cm soil layer were highest from jointing to the blooming stage the effect of mulching on soil water storage consumption δw mainly occurred in the 0 60 cm and 60 150 cm soil layers in the early sowing jointing and middle jointing blooming stages on the whole fig 3 to be specific from sowing to jointing pfm and ssm significantly decreased the δw by 15 2 mm and 9 6 mm in the 0 60 cm soil layer significantly decreased it by 13 1 mm and 10 3 mm in the 60 150 cm soil layer compared with ck according to the average of four years from jointing to blooming pfm and ssm significantly increased the δw by 15 1 mm and 7 9 mm in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased it by 10 9 mm p 0 05 and 2 1 mm p 0 05 in the 60 150 cm soil layer compared with ck according to the average of four years 3 3 evapotranspiration and its proportion at the different growth stages evapotranspiration was differentially affected by cultivation measurements at the different growth stages table 3 mulching cultivation inhibited evapotranspiration in the early stage sowing jointing but promoted it in the middle stage jointing blooming in different years on the whole in terms of the proportion of evapotranspiration at the different stages pfm and ssm decreased it by 8 7 and 5 7 points from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it by 9 1 and 4 3 points from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck according to the average of four years in terms of evapotranspiration at the different stages pfm and ssm significantly decreased it by 20 1 and 14 4 from sowing to the jointing stage but significantly increased it by 26 8 and 11 1 from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck according to the average of four years in terms of daily evapotranspiration at the different stages it was the lowest in the early growth stage but relatively high in the middle and later growth stage in different years on the whole similar to evapotranspiration mulching cultivation inhibited the daily evapotranspiration in the early stage but promoted it in the middle stage in different years on the whole from sowing to the jointing stage both pfm and ssm significantly decreased the daily evapotranspiration by 20 4 and 14 3 according to the average of four years compared with ck from jointing to the blooming stage both pfm and ssm significantly increased the daily evapotranspiration by 27 4 and 12 2 according to the average of four years compared with ck 3 4 estimation of evaporation and transpiration estimation of evaporation e and transpiration t was shown as fig 4 the total e for pfm was very small because the soil was completely covered which made almost all of the soil water consumption be used for transpiration production evaporation was an important part of evapotranspiration et under ck and ssm treatments especially obvious before the jointing stage of winter wheat ssm inhibited evaporation at the different growth stages compared with ck in different years and it significantly reduced evaporation by 15 6 45 4 from sowing to the jointing stage by 17 3 49 2 from jointing to the blooming stage by 22 0 65 7 from blooming to the maturity stage respectively and finally reduced it by 17 9 35 9 during the whole growing period in terms of the average transpiration in 2015 2019 compared with ck pfm significantly improved it by 66 0 from sowing to the jointing stage by 42 3 from jointing to the blooming stage by 38 8 from blooming to the maturity stage respectively and finally improved it by 49 2 during the whole growing period ssm couldn t significantly improve transpiration from sowing to the jointing stage but significantly improved it by 17 0 from jointing to the blooming stage by 21 6 from blooming to the maturity stage and finally improved it by 12 3 during the whole growing period the value of e et under ck and ssm was shown as fig 5 ssm was better than ck at the different growth stages of winter wheat in different years in terms of the effect of inhibiting evaporation in 2015 2019 the average value of e et was up to 53 4 for ck and 46 8 for ssm from sowing to the jointing stage up to 13 6 for ck and 7 4 for ssm from jointing to the blooming stage up to 32 2 for ck and 19 7 for ssm from blooming to the maturity stage and up to 34 8 for ck and 25 2 for ssm during the whole growth period 3 5 yield components and crop water productivity from 2015 2019 the yield and its related indicators were significantly affected by year treatment and their interactions table 4 yield was low in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 but high in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 and it was highest under pfm but least under ck in different years on the whole pfm increased gw but ssm increased sn both of which increased yield cwp and pue compared with ck in different years according to the average of four years pfm significantly improved by 9 9 for gw by 20 1 for cwp by 20 0 for pue and by 18 1 for yield compared with ck ssm significantly improved by 9 5 for sn by 19 1 for cwp by 18 6 for pue and by 16 5 for yield compared with ck in particular according to the average in dry years pfm significantly improved by 15 5 for gw by 37 6 for cwp by 45 2 for pue and by 44 3 for yield compared with ck ssm significantly improved by 11 8 for sn by 39 9 for cwp by 41 9 for pue and by 41 2 for yield compared with ck in terms of effects of pfm on sn and kns pfm had less sn by 13 1 p 0 05 but more kns by 45 0 p 0 05 on average in dry years but it had more sn by 14 3 p 0 05 but less kns by 13 6 p 0 05 on average in wet years than those of ck eventually pfm significantly increased kns by 6 3 compared with ck according to the average of four years but there was no significant difference for sn in terms of effects of ssm on kns and gw ssm significantly increased kns by 25 0 37 4 compared with ck in dry years but there was no significant difference in wet years and eventually ssm significantly increased kns by 8 9 according to the average of four years as for the effect of ssm on gw ssm significantly increased it by 7 0 compared with ck only in 2018 2019 but the difference was not significant in other years 3 6 economic analysis mulching improved output revenue compared with conventional flat planting without mulching ck but also increased input at the same time due to the labor costs and mulching material costs whole plastic film mulching pfm had the lowest net income and output input in all years because of the highest input straw strips mulching ssm increased net income and output input in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 but slightly decreased these two in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 compared with ck table 5 according to the average of four years compared with ck ssm improved net income by 10 0 and had a roughly comparable output input pfm decreased net income by 34 1 and decreased output input by 32 2 as can be seen from the above results the high yield of plastic film mulching is based on high energy consumption which does not meet the requirements of sustainable agricultural development 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching on water consumption characteristics precipitation is usually the only source of soil moisture in rain fed agricultural production so it is essential for crop production to conserve water as much as possible ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 in our study whole plastic film mulching pfm and straw strips mulching ssm improved soil water storage compared with ck fig 2 optimizing the temporal and spatial fluctuation of soil water storage consumption fig 3 as for the explanation for this phenomenon it s probably because mulching improved the utilization and conservation of precipitation thus alleviating the effect of seasonal precipitation and its distribution on soil water gan et al 2013 montenegro et al 2013 optimizing water consumption characteristics is conducive to maintaining high yield and high efficiency of agricultural production in arid areas and the efficient water consumption is the key to improve crop water productivity zhang et al 2019 it was found in this four year experimental study that pfm and ssm respectively decreased p 0 05 the soil water storage consumption in the 0 60 cm soil layer but increased p 0 05 it in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck which was beneficial for plants to increase the soil water consumption rate during the critical periods by improving the utilization of deeper soil water when crops required a lot of water zhang et al 2019 it is crucial to provide sufficient soil water for crops to avoid extreme drought by optimizing water consumption characteristics for rainfed agriculture especially during the sensitive periods when crops need water yu et al 2018 the results in our study showed that mulching didn t make much of a difference to total evapotranspiration compared with ck but changed the water consumption patterns that is both pfm and ssm remarkably reduced evapotranspiration and its proportion by reducing water consumption intensity during the early growth period but increased evapotranspiration and its proportion by improving water consumption intensity during the middle growth period table 3 it indicated that the mulching cultivation treatments were beneficial to balance the contradiction between water supply and demand and it also played a positive role in the creation of high crop water productivity chen et al 2019 had a similar idea for dryland potato under plastic mulching and straw strips mulching treatments in northwest china the daily evapotranspiration could be changed at the different growth stages by mulching the soil surface r li et al 2013 in this study pfm and ssm reduced daily evapotranspiration from sowing to jointing but increased it from jointing to blooming compared with ck as for the reasons for this phenomenon evaporation was the main form of water consumption due to the small size of the plants and the weak transpiration s x li et al 2013 for a long time during the early growth period so the water consumption intensity under pfm and ssm was less than that of ck due to the low evaporation in the middle stage of growth transpiration became the main form of water consumption because of the vigorous growth of plants s x li et al 2013 so the water consumption intensity under pfm and ssm was greater than that of ck due to the high transpiration balwinder singh et al 2011 also showed that rice straw mulching decreased daily evapotranspiration at the early growth stage in india soil evaporation is an ineffective water loss and reducing it as much as possible can improve crop water productivity wang et al 2010 qin et al 2018 it is difficult to measure soil evaporation by experimental methods but the reasonable estimation can greatly reduce the workload of field research these previous studies of z s wang et al 2016 and s x li et al 2013 in semi arid regions provided a theoretical basis for the estimation of evaporation and transpiration to this experiment the reason why the evaporation was extremely low under pfm treatment should be explained and there was little chance of evaporation for pfm because the soil was completely enclosed by plastic film except the small holes were covered by plants in this regard yang et al 2012 and y p wang et al 2016 concluded that the soil water evaporation could be assumed to be negligible under the plastic film mulching therefore the estimated value of e et was 1 06 for pfm which was completely acceptable pfm and ssm significantly reduced soil evaporation but significantly increased transpiration fig 4 which made more water be used for crop production and greatly improved the availability of water s x li et al 2013 4 2 effect of mulching on grain yield and crop water productivity mulching measures had significant effects on grain yield composition and crop water productivity but the impact of mulching on crop productivity may vary with the climatic conditions yu et al 2018 the rainfall in arid and semi arid regions on the loess plateau showed obvious temporal and spatial variation resulting in great variations of grain yields in different precipitation conditions y p wang et al 2016 the yields of winter wheat under different treatments were even smaller in dry years than those in wet years although pfm and ssm improved yield in both dry years and wet years the effect of yield increasing decreased with the increase of precipitation and even the difference was not significant 2017 2018 p 0 05 it followed that the over adequate precipitation would not advocate the adoption of the water saving practice because the positive benefit of increasing yield by improving soil hydrothermal conditions would not be necessarily obvious y p wang et al 2016 the main probable reason was that excessive rainfall 92 5 mm from blooming to the maturity stage usually led to the poor solar thermal condition then soil temperature would replace soil water and became the key limiting factor of restricting crop growth ren et al 2016 the drought limited agricultural production directly to some extent in the semiarid areas but it could be improved by appropriate mulching cultivation techniques to increase crop yields and crop water productivity mcmaster et al 2002 li et al 2018 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2008 the positive effect of whole plastic film mulching for yield was well known in addition some scholars suggested that straw mulching was one of the main practices to gain more yields in semi areas such as the loess plateau zhang et al 2013 and the previous study showed that the straw mulching increased wheat yield by 14 5 wang and shangguan 2015 and increased potato yield by 16 0 li et al 2018 on average it was consistent with the results of this paper both whole plastic film mulching pfm and straw strips mulching ssm significantly improved grain yield and crop water productivity compared with the conventional flat planting without mulching ck which provided an important technical guarantee for high and stable grain yield the inter annual variation of precipitation and its distribution in different seasons also affected crop yields y p wang et al 2016 continuous drought conditions would seriously affect the growth and development of crops osakabe et al 2014 the drought in 2015 2016 was more serious because the effective precipitation p 5 mm during the whole growth period of winter wheat was only 112 8 mm and it mostly occurred after the jointing stage 73 2 mm which resulted in the extremely low yield 1268 2 kg ha 1 for ck treatment due to the insufficient soil moisture in the early growth stage of winter wheat however the grain yield could still reach 2045 4 kg ha 1 for pfm and 2144 9 kg ha 1 for ssm and this might be because these two mulching measurements significantly decreased the δw by 42 9 mm and 34 3 mm in the 0 150 cm soil layer respectively compared with ck in the early growth stage from sowing to jointing thus laid a good moisture foundation for the next stage and alleviated the effects of extreme drought on crop growth in the sensitive period to some extent zhang et al 2019 li et al 2004 mu et al 2021 in general the high yield effect of mulching cultivation techniques was better in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 than that in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 in this paper and y p wang et al 2016 also reported the same conclusion in dryland maize production in semiarid areas of china these results indicated that mulching cultivation could effectively alleviate the effect of insufficient precipitation on crop yield by optimizing water consumption characteristics and improving crop water productivity on the semi arid loess plateau of china more importantly yield effect of straw strips mulching was equal to that of whole plastic film mulching table 4 but the former was even more cost saving and efficiency increasing table 5 and it also met the requirements of environmental protection and sustainable development therefore it s completely possible to reduce the application of plastic film mulching in experimental area and other similar areas by popularizing straw strips mulching technology which will eventually obtain the higher economic benefits and promote the sustainable development of dry farming production zhao et al 2019 5 conclusion the whole plastic film mulching and straw strips mulching had the effect of soil water storage preservation and improved the utilization of precipitation these two measures optimized the temporal spatial characteristics of soil water storage consumption δw significantly reduced δw in the 0 60 cm soil layer from the sowing to the jointing stage but promoted it in the 150 200 cm soil layer from blooming to the maturity stage these two measures also had the effect of inhibiting evaporation and promoting transpiration especially reduced the evapotranspiration from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it from jointing to the blooming stage which alleviated the mismatch between water supply and demand to a large extent and finally showed significantly high yield and high crop water productivity although straw strips mulching was not as effective as the whole plastic film mulching in improving yield and optimizing water consumption it met the low cost easily operated and environment friendly standards under the conditions of scarce precipitation straw strips mulching will probably be a relatively promising cultivation measure to improve yield and efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors

10027,water consumption is closely related to crop growth and development and optimizing its characteristics will be beneficial to water saving and high yield of crops to find out the more promising cultivation technology to optimize water consumption characteristics and improve crop water productivity for winter wheat a four year field experiment in 2015 2019 was conducted in a randomized and complete block design in the loess plateau of northwest china the experimental treatments i whole plastic film mulching pfm coverage rate was approximately 100 ii straw strips mulching ssm including the alternating straw strip 0 5 m and plant strip 0 35 m and the coverage rate was 59 iii conventional flat planting without mulching ck the obtained results showed that pfm and ssm increased the contribution rate of precipitation to evapotranspiration inhibited evaporation but promoted transpiration to a great extent reduced soil water storage consumption in the 0 60 cm but promoted it in the 150 200 cm soil layer reduced soil water storage consumption at the early growth stage but promoted it at the middle growth stage compared with ck in 2015 2019 compared with ck pfm and ssm respectively decreased soil water consumption by 12 4 and 10 6 in the 0 60 cm soil layer but increased it by 46 6 and 27 7 in the 150 200 cm soil layer pfm and ssm reduced evapotranspiration by 20 1 and 14 4 before the jointing stage due to the low water consumption intensity but increased it by 26 8 and 11 1 from jointing to blooming stage due to the high water consumption intensity besides pfm and ssm respectively improved crop water productivity by 20 1 and 19 1 improved precipitation use efficiency by 20 0 and 18 6 and eventually increased grain yield by 18 1 and 16 5 ssm was less effective than pfm but taking the friendly sustainability into consideration ssm would probably be a potential practice to develop the rainfed agriculture keywords plastic film straw strips soil water storage evapotranspiration winter wheat 1 introduction drought is a worldwide severe problem for crop production limiting agricultural development including the rare annual precipitation and unevenly temporal distribution gan et al 2013 high evaporation and low precipitation use efficiency and crop water productivity peng et al 2020 particularly serious on the semi arid loess plateau of china and these problems are becoming more serious with the significant impacts on agriculture of global climate change winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the main grain crop in china its main growth stage is from april to june which is widely planted in northwest china and plays an important role in national grain production however the yield of winter wheat is low and unstable due to the seasonal drought he et al 2016 2017 and the contradiction between supply and demand of soil water ahmadzai et al 2017 plastic mulching and straw mulching are two major agricultural water conservation strategies to improve crop water productivity and increase crop production tang et al 2008 kader et al 2017 the plastic film mulching decreases the evaporation s x li et al 2013 enhances the soil water conservation gan et al 2013 distributes the soil water storage again and therefore relieves water stress to a large extent li et al 2004 chakraborty et al 2008 ultimately improves the soil water supply capacity zhou et al 2011 li et al 2004 besides it also improves the crop yield due to its positive effects such as the high crop water productivity mo et al 2017 however the long term plastic film mulching causes large amounts of plastic residues in the soil which has a negative effect on soil environment and restrains the sustainable development of agriculture ultimately straw mulching is a simple and easy to operate technique which is more environmental friendly than plastic film mulching in areas with locally available straw resources it plays a role of conserving soil moisture sidhu et al 2007 balwinder singh et al 2011 and decreasing soil temperature chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019 reducing soil evaporation chen et al 2007 s x li et al 2013 and improving the crop yield sidhu et al 2007 however the adverse effects on soil temperature especially in the spring have limited the development of straw mulching in recent years straw mulch technology has been improved by zhao et al 2019 as an alternative to plastic film mulch for wheat production on the loess plateau which provides a prospect for the exploration and development of straw mulching technology it is probably necessary to carry out a new straw mulching technology to improve soil water storage and optimize water consumption characteristics in particular it s very important to improve crop water productivity and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions by narrowing the gap between soil water supply and crop water demand rockström et al 2007 reducing invalid water consumption in the upper soil layer li et al 2016 and promoting the deep water utilization li et al 2004 is an urgent problem in the water saving agriculture and making full use of precipitation to save the soil water as much as possible is one of the basic way to realize efficient water use in dryland agriculture li et al 2016 mo et al 2017 our study adopted a whole plastic film mulching system pfm to completely prevent evaporation from the soil surface and collect the precipitation as much as possible yang et al 2012 y p wang et al 2016 adopted straw strips mulching system ssm to reduce the threat of low temperature in spring and high temperature in summer previous researches on the northwest loess plateau showed that the plastic film mulching system significantly improved corn yield by improving soil water storage and root distribution thidar et al 2020 and the straw strips mulching system significantly improved yield and crop water productivity for potato by regulating water and temperature as well as influencing temporal and spatial variation chen et al 2019 chang et al 2020 compared with the conventional tillage without mulch but didn t do a further study about the water consumption characteristics as for the effect of mulching cultivation on water consumption the previous studies wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 thidar et al 2020 peng et al 2020 chang et al 2020 were mainly based on the fact that the soil water storage was different for each treatment at the sowing stage due to mulching in advance or continuous cropping however from the perspective of the same soil water storage at the sowing stage under all treatments in this paper researching the water consumption characteristics and winter wheat grain yield under the improved technologies in a semiarid area of northwest china would provide the theoretical basis for agricultural water management and field crops research at home and abroad therefore we conducted a four year field experiment from 2015 to 2019 on the semi arid loess plateau of china the objectives were 1 to assess the effects of whole plastic film mulching and straw strips mulching on winter wheat grain yield 2 to evaluate crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency 3 to research for the characteristic of water consumption and 4 to determine a relatively appropriate mulching cultivation pattern for winter wheat combined with economic benefit analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted during four growing seasons of winter wheat at tongwei modern dryland circular farming experiment station 35 11 n 105 19 e altitude 1750 m dingxi city gansu province of china the annual mean soil evaporation was 1500 mm in the experimental site and general situation had been described in previous studies chen et al 2019 chang et al 2020 this region was a typical temperate continental climate with large variation in rainfall quantity and distribution rainfall mainly concentrated in july august and september but relatively less in the main water demand period april may and june of winter wheat the soil type was classified as loess soil and the average bulk density was 1 25 g cm 3 in terms of 0 200 cm soil layer the fundamental soil characteristics were reported as follows soil organic carbon 8 81 9 12 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 69 0 72 g kg 1 available phosphorus 6 94 7 66 mg kg 1 and available potassium 115 5 133 8 mg kg 1 and ph 8 1 8 3 2 2 weather conditions precipitation was shown in fig 1a the total precipitation p 0 mm was 194 8 mm 2015 2016 200 7 mm 2016 2017 272 5 mm 2017 2018 and 239 5 mm 2018 2019 respectively during the whole growing period of winter wheat at the experimental station and the precipitation p 5 mm was up to 112 8 mm 127 1 mm 190 5 mm and 219 6 mm respectively the air temperature of each day fig 1b was different obviously during winter wheat growth period from regreening to the maturity stage and abnormal climate cold spell in later spring occurred before or after jointing or booting which caused the greatest amplitude of temperature variation around the may 13th of 2016 april 19th of 2017 april 15th of 2018 and may 7th of 2019 and the minimum daily mean air temperature was 2 0 3 0 2 7 and 3 3 respectively in particular it was characterized by low temperature at the early stage but high temperature at the late stage in 2015 2016 while it was rainy and low temperature during the critical growth period in 2018 2019 according to the average precipitation 219 6 mm during the whole growth period over the past 46 years the first and the second study year were relatively dry the third and the fourth study year were relatively wet 2 3 experimental design and field management the following three cultivation treatments were arranged in a randomized and complete block design with three replicates per treatment in the plots of more than 50 m2 length 8 5 28 0 m width 6 0 15 0 m in 2015 2019 depending on the size of the experimental field and the ease of operation 1 whole plastic film mulching pfm the soil was fully covered by plastic film and the coverage rate was approximately 100 the plastic film was white polyethylene with 1 2 m width and 0 008 mm in thickness and there were small holes caused by a sharp object spaced at 0 4 m on it for rainfall infiltration winter wheat was sown by a hill drop planter with 0 2 m spacing between rows there were about 10 seeds in a single hole pic 1 2 conventional flat planting without mulching ck the row distances were all 0 2 m pic 2 3 straw strips mulching ssm including the alternating the straw strip 0 5 m width and the plant strip 0 35 m width and the coverage rate was 59 the sowing quantity of winter wheat per unit area is calculated according to the total area of the straw strip zones and the plant strip zones three rows drill seeding with local density were evenly carried out in the plant strip the row spacing was 0 15 m and the spacing between the edge of the straw strip zone and the rows on both sides of the plant strip zone was 2 5 cm to prevent the straw from pressing the seedlings pic 3 in terms of the straw strips mulching the air dried maize straws were uniformly placed by hand on the pre reserved straw strips at three leaf stage of wheat at a rate of 9 0 t ha 1 equivalent to the local maize straws production per unit area that were collected from the harvested maize fields of local farmers the soil tillage and sowing time fertilizer amount and field management measures were the same for each treatment the sowing quantity of winter wheat longzhong 2 per unit area was 225 kg ha 1 make it certain at a density of 375 104 plants ha 1 for all treatments in accordance with local practice both urea 150 kg n ha 1 and superphosphate 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 as base fertilizer were evenly broadcast on the soil surface and ploughed into the soil prior to sowing 2 4 sampling and measurement methods 2 4 1 soil water

al 2019 chang et al 2020 a 0 05 m diameter handheld soil auger was used to take the random soil samples in the middle part between the two rows of plants in plots of the three treatments 2 4 2 evapotranspiration and crop water productivity evapotranspiration et was determined by the total precipitation and soil water storage consumption because there was no irrigation surface runoff or groundwater during the growth period crop water productivity cwp kg m 3 was defined as grain yield divided by et fernández et al 2020 and precipitation use efficiency pue kg m 3 was defined as grain yield divided by precipitation peng et al 2020 the evapotranspiration was determined by the equation of soil water balance et p δw where p is the total precipitation during the growth period and the δw is the change of soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer 2 4 3 estimation of evaporation and transpiration we made a simple estimation according to the method of a chinese scholar who did the estimation of evaporation evapotranspiration e et for winter wheat in the arid region of northwest china based on simdualkc model z s wang et al 2016 the surface coverage of whole plastic film mulching was approximately 100 because the holes were small and covered by plants so the value of e et was about 1 06 for it according to the above method we used dry matter of different stages and the corresponding transpiration from whole plastic film mulching plots to develop a regression equation to estimate the water loss by transpiration in non mulched and straw strips mulched plots s x li et al 2013 2 4 4 yield and its components whole plots were harvested at the maturity stage each year and grain yields determined at 13 grain moisture content spike number of unit area was surveyed in the field kernel number per spike and thousand grain weight was tested in the science lab 2 5 statistical analyses the data and figures of air temperature soil moisture storage cwp evapotranspiration and yield were processed with the software of microsoft excel 2010 ibm spss statistics 22 and origin pro 9 all the data were analyzed by using one way analysis of variance anova and the differences of mean values among different treatments were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer fig 2 showed the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer under different treatments was basically the same and great at the sowing stage but was different and less at the maturity stage mulching cultivation improved sws at the maturity stage compared with ck on the whole but varied with growing season to be specific pfm and ssm respectively improved p 0 05 sws by 13 2 mm and 25 9 mm in 2015 2016 pfm reduced sws by 15 9 mm p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between ssm and ck in 2016 2017 pfm improved sws by 13 2 mm p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between ssm and ck in 2017 2018 there was no significant difference among different treatments in 2018 2019 3 2 precipitation and soil water storage consumption 3 2 1 precipitation and soil water storage consumption during the whole growing period the water consumption due to evapotranspiration during the whole growth period of winter wheat mainly depended on the natural precipitation and also involved soil water storage consumption δw of 0 200 cm soil layer table 1 on the whole mulching improved the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration decreased the ratio of δw to evapotranspiration in the upper 0 60 cm soil layer but increased it in the deeper 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck mulching cultivation had the effect of saving water on the whole in addition to increasing et compared with ck in 2016 2017 pfm and ssm reduced et more or less in other years although there was no significant difference among different treatments for δw in the total 0 200 cm soil layer there were significant differences in the different soil layers in the relatively dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 mulching significantly decreased the quantity of δw in the 0 60 cm soil layer but significantly increased that in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck in the relatively wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 in addition to pfm reducing the δw p 0 05 compared with ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in 2017 2018 there was no significant difference among different treatments for δw in the both 0 60 cm and 150 200 cm soil layer according to the average of four years pfm and ssm significantly decreased the quantity of δw by 12 4 and 10 6 in the 0 60 cm soil layer but significantly increased it by 46 6 and 27 7 in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck respectively 3 2 2 precipitation and soil water storage consumption at the different growth stages the water consumption due to evapotranspiration et at the different growth stages of winter wheat still mainly depended on the natural precipitation table 2 mulching increased the contribution rate of precipitation to evapotranspiration p et but decreased the ratio of δw to evapotranspiration δw et in early stage decreased p et but increased δw et in middle stage compared with ck on the whole according to the average of four years pfm and ssm increased p et or decreased δw et by 15 5 and 10 4 points from sowing to the jointing stage but decreased p et or increased δw et by 14 6 and 6 9 points from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck in terms of the soil water storage consumption δw in the 0 200 cm soil layer mulching decreased δw in the early stage but increased it in the middle stage compared with ck on the whole according to the average of four years pfm and ssm significantly decreased δw by 52 6 and 37 7 from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it by 87 1 and 36 0 from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck 3 2 3 spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water storage consumption there was a relatively general trend in different years that is the δw under almost all treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layer were highest before the jointing stage but the δw under almost all treatments in the 60 150 cm soil layer were highest from jointing to the blooming stage the effect of mulching on soil water storage consumption δw mainly occurred in the 0 60 cm and 60 150 cm soil layers in the early sowing jointing and middle jointing blooming stages on the whole fig 3 to be specific from sowing to jointing pfm and ssm significantly decreased the δw by 15 2 mm and 9 6 mm in the 0 60 cm soil layer significantly decreased it by 13 1 mm and 10 3 mm in the 60 150 cm soil layer compared with ck according to the average of four years from jointing to blooming pfm and ssm significantly increased the δw by 15 1 mm and 7 9 mm in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased it by 10 9 mm p 0 05 and 2 1 mm p 0 05 in the 60 150 cm soil layer compared with ck according to the average of four years 3 3 evapotranspiration and its proportion at the different growth stages evapotranspiration was differentially affected by cultivation measurements at the different growth stages table 3 mulching cultivation inhibited evapotranspiration in the early stage sowing jointing but promoted it in the middle stage jointing blooming in different years on the whole in terms of the proportion of evapotranspiration at the different stages pfm and ssm decreased it by 8 7 and 5 7 points from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it by 9 1 and 4 3 points from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck according to the average of four years in terms of evapotranspiration at the different stages pfm and ssm significantly decreased it by 20 1 and 14 4 from sowing to the jointing stage but significantly increased it by 26 8 and 11 1 from jointing to the blooming stage compared with ck according to the average of four years in terms of daily evapotranspiration at the different stages it was the lowest in the early growth stage but relatively high in the middle and later growth stage in different years on the whole similar to evapotranspiration mulching cultivation inhibited the daily evapotranspiration in the early stage but promoted it in the middle stage in different years on the whole from sowing to the jointing stage both pfm and ssm significantly decreased the daily evapotranspiration by 20 4 and 14 3 according to the average of four years compared with ck from jointing to the blooming stage both pfm and ssm significantly increased the daily evapotranspiration by 27 4 and 12 2 according to the average of four years compared with ck 3 4 estimation of evaporation and transpiration estimation of evaporation e and transpiration t was shown as fig 4 the total e for pfm was very small because the soil was completely covered which made almost all of the soil water consumption be used for transpiration production evaporation was an important part of evapotranspiration et under ck and ssm treatments especially obvious before the jointing stage of winter wheat ssm inhibited evaporation at the different growth stages compared with ck in different years and it significantly reduced evaporation by 15 6 45 4 from sowing to the jointing stage by 17 3 49 2 from jointing to the blooming stage by 22 0 65 7 from blooming to the maturity stage respectively and finally reduced it by 17 9 35 9 during the whole growing period in terms of the average transpiration in 2015 2019 compared with ck pfm significantly improved it by 66 0 from sowing to the jointing stage by 42 3 from jointing to the blooming stage by 38 8 from blooming to the maturity stage respectively and finally improved it by 49 2 during the whole growing period ssm couldn t significantly improve transpiration from sowing to the jointing stage but significantly improved it by 17 0 from jointing to the blooming stage by 21 6 from blooming to the maturity stage and finally improved it by 12 3 during the whole growing period the value of e et under ck and ssm was shown as fig 5 ssm was better than ck at the different growth stages of winter wheat in different years in terms of the effect of inhibiting evaporation in 2015 2019 the average value of e et was up to 53 4 for ck and 46 8 for ssm from sowing to the jointing stage up to 13 6 for ck and 7 4 for ssm from jointing to the blooming stage up to 32 2 for ck and 19 7 for ssm from blooming to the maturity stage and up to 34 8 for ck and 25 2 for ssm during the whole growth period 3 5 yield components and crop water productivity from 2015 2019 the yield and its related indicators were significantly affected by year treatment and their interactions table 4 yield was low in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 but high in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 and it was highest under pfm but least under ck in different years on the whole pfm increased gw but ssm increased sn both of which increased yield cwp and pue compared with ck in different years according to the average of four years pfm significantly improved by 9 9 for gw by 20 1 for cwp by 20 0 for pue and by 18 1 for yield compared with ck ssm significantly improved by 9 5 for sn by 19 1 for cwp by 18 6 for pue and by 16 5 for yield compared with ck in particular according to the average in dry years pfm significantly improved by 15 5 for gw by 37 6 for cwp by 45 2 for pue and by 44 3 for yield compared with ck ssm significantly improved by 11 8 for sn by 39 9 for cwp by 41 9 for pue and by 41 2 for yield compared with ck in terms of effects of pfm on sn and kns pfm had less sn by 13 1 p 0 05 but more kns by 45 0 p 0 05 on average in dry years but it had more sn by 14 3 p 0 05 but less kns by 13 6 p 0 05 on average in wet years than those of ck eventually pfm significantly increased kns by 6 3 compared with ck according to the average of four years but there was no significant difference for sn in terms of effects of ssm on kns and gw ssm significantly increased kns by 25 0 37 4 compared with ck in dry years but there was no significant difference in wet years and eventually ssm significantly increased kns by 8 9 according to the average of four years as for the effect of ssm on gw ssm significantly increased it by 7 0 compared with ck only in 2018 2019 but the difference was not significant in other years 3 6 economic analysis mulching improved output revenue compared with conventional flat planting without mulching ck but also increased input at the same time due to the labor costs and mulching material costs whole plastic film mulching pfm had the lowest net income and output input in all years because of the highest input straw strips mulching ssm increased net income and output input in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 but slightly decreased these two in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 compared with ck table 5 according to the average of four years compared with ck ssm improved net income by 10 0 and had a roughly comparable output input pfm decreased net income by 34 1 and decreased output input by 32 2 as can be seen from the above results the high yield of plastic film mulching is based on high energy consumption which does not meet the requirements of sustainable agricultural development 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching on water consumption characteristics precipitation is usually the only source of soil moisture in rain fed agricultural production so it is essential for crop production to conserve water as much as possible ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 in our study whole plastic film mulching pfm and straw strips mulching ssm improved soil water storage compared with ck fig 2 optimizing the temporal and spatial fluctuation of soil water storage consumption fig 3 as for the explanation for this phenomenon it s probably because mulching improved the utilization and conservation of precipitation thus alleviating the effect of seasonal precipitation and its distribution on soil water gan et al 2013 montenegro et al 2013 optimizing water consumption characteristics is conducive to maintaining high yield and high efficiency of agricultural production in arid areas and the efficient water consumption is the key to improve crop water productivity zhang et al 2019 it was found in this four year experimental study that pfm and ssm respectively decreased p 0 05 the soil water storage consumption in the 0 60 cm soil layer but increased p 0 05 it in the 150 200 cm soil layer compared with ck which was beneficial for plants to increase the soil water consumption rate during the critical periods by improving the utilization of deeper soil water when crops required a lot of water zhang et al 2019 it is crucial to provide sufficient soil water for crops to avoid extreme drought by optimizing water consumption characteristics for rainfed agriculture especially during the sensitive periods when crops need water yu et al 2018 the results in our study showed that mulching didn t make much of a difference to total evapotranspiration compared with ck but changed the water consumption patterns that is both pfm and ssm remarkably reduced evapotranspiration and its proportion by reducing water consumption intensity during the early growth period but increased evapotranspiration and its proportion by improving water consumption intensity during the middle growth period table 3 it indicated that the mulching cultivation treatments were beneficial to balance the contradiction between water supply and demand and it also played a positive role in the creation of high crop water productivity chen et al 2019 had a similar idea for dryland potato under plastic mulching and straw strips mulching treatments in northwest china the daily evapotranspiration could be changed at the different growth stages by mulching the soil surface r li et al 2013 in this study pfm and ssm reduced daily evapotranspiration from sowing to jointing but increased it from jointing to blooming compared with ck as for the reasons for this phenomenon evaporation was the main form of water consumption due to the small size of the plants and the weak transpiration s x li et al 2013 for a long time during the early growth period so the water consumption intensity under pfm and ssm was less than that of ck due to the low evaporation in the middle stage of growth transpiration became the main form of water consumption because of the vigorous growth of plants s x li et al 2013 so the water consumption intensity under pfm and ssm was greater than that of ck due to the high transpiration balwinder singh et al 2011 also showed that rice straw mulching decreased daily evapotranspiration at the early growth stage in india soil evaporation is an ineffective water loss and reducing it as much as possible can improve crop water productivity wang et al 2010 qin et al 2018 it is difficult to measure soil evaporation by experimental methods but the reasonable estimation can greatly reduce the workload of field research these previous studies of z s wang et al 2016 and s x li et al 2013 in semi arid regions provided a theoretical basis for the estimation of evaporation and transpiration to this experiment the reason why the evaporation was extremely low under pfm treatment should be explained and there was little chance of evaporation for pfm because the soil was completely enclosed by plastic film except the small holes were covered by plants in this regard yang et al 2012 and y p wang et al 2016 concluded that the soil water evaporation could be assumed to be negligible under the plastic film mulching therefore the estimated value of e et was 1 06 for pfm which was completely acceptable pfm and ssm significantly reduced soil evaporation but significantly increased transpiration fig 4 which made more water be used for crop production and greatly improved the availability of water s x li et al 2013 4 2 effect of mulching on grain yield and crop water productivity mulching measures had significant effects on grain yield composition and crop water productivity but the impact of mulching on crop productivity may vary with the climatic conditions yu et al 2018 the rainfall in arid and semi arid regions on the loess plateau showed obvious temporal and spatial variation resulting in great variations of grain yields in different precipitation conditions y p wang et al 2016 the yields of winter wheat under different treatments were even smaller in dry years than those in wet years although pfm and ssm improved yield in both dry years and wet years the effect of yield increasing decreased with the increase of precipitation and even the difference was not significant 2017 2018 p 0 05 it followed that the over adequate precipitation would not advocate the adoption of the water saving practice because the positive benefit of increasing yield by improving soil hydrothermal conditions would not be necessarily obvious y p wang et al 2016 the main probable reason was that excessive rainfall 92 5 mm from blooming to the maturity stage usually led to the poor solar thermal condition then soil temperature would replace soil water and became the key limiting factor of restricting crop growth ren et al 2016 the drought limited agricultural production directly to some extent in the semiarid areas but it could be improved by appropriate mulching cultivation techniques to increase crop yields and crop water productivity mcmaster et al 2002 li et al 2018 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2008 the positive effect of whole plastic film mulching for yield was well known in addition some scholars suggested that straw mulching was one of the main practices to gain more yields in semi areas such as the loess plateau zhang et al 2013 and the previous study showed that the straw mulching increased wheat yield by 14 5 wang and shangguan 2015 and increased potato yield by 16 0 li et al 2018 on average it was consistent with the results of this paper both whole plastic film mulching pfm and straw strips mulching ssm significantly improved grain yield and crop water productivity compared with the conventional flat planting without mulching ck which provided an important technical guarantee for high and stable grain yield the inter annual variation of precipitation and its distribution in different seasons also affected crop yields y p wang et al 2016 continuous drought conditions would seriously affect the growth and development of crops osakabe et al 2014 the drought in 2015 2016 was more serious because the effective precipitation p 5 mm during the whole growth period of winter wheat was only 112 8 mm and it mostly occurred after the jointing stage 73 2 mm which resulted in the extremely low yield 1268 2 kg ha 1 for ck treatment due to the insufficient soil moisture in the early growth stage of winter wheat however the grain yield could still reach 2045 4 kg ha 1 for pfm and 2144 9 kg ha 1 for ssm and this might be because these two mulching measurements significantly decreased the δw by 42 9 mm and 34 3 mm in the 0 150 cm soil layer respectively compared with ck in the early growth stage from sowing to jointing thus laid a good moisture foundation for the next stage and alleviated the effects of extreme drought on crop growth in the sensitive period to some extent zhang et al 2019 li et al 2004 mu et al 2021 in general the high yield effect of mulching cultivation techniques was better in dry years 2015 2016 2016 2017 than that in wet years 2017 2018 2018 2019 in this paper and y p wang et al 2016 also reported the same conclusion in dryland maize production in semiarid areas of china these results indicated that mulching cultivation could effectively alleviate the effect of insufficient precipitation on crop yield by optimizing water consumption characteristics and improving crop water productivity on the semi arid loess plateau of china more importantly yield effect of straw strips mulching was equal to that of whole plastic film mulching table 4 but the former was even more cost saving and efficiency increasing table 5 and it also met the requirements of environmental protection and sustainable development therefore it s completely possible to reduce the application of plastic film mulching in experimental area and other similar areas by popularizing straw strips mulching technology which will eventually obtain the higher economic benefits and promote the sustainable development of dry farming production zhao et al 2019 5 conclusion the whole plastic film mulching and straw strips mulching had the effect of soil water storage preservation and improved the utilization of precipitation these two measures optimized the temporal spatial characteristics of soil water storage consumption δw significantly reduced δw in the 0 60 cm soil layer from the sowing to the jointing stage but promoted it in the 150 200 cm soil layer from blooming to the maturity stage these two measures also had the effect of inhibiting evaporation and promoting transpiration especially reduced the evapotranspiration from sowing to the jointing stage but increased it from jointing to the blooming stage which alleviated the mismatch between water supply and demand to a large extent and finally showed significantly high yield and high crop water productivity although straw strips mulching was not as effective as the whole plastic film mulching in improving yield and optimizing water consumption it met the low cost easily operated and environment friendly standards under the conditions of scarce precipitation straw strips mulching will probably be a relatively promising cultivation measure to improve yield and efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors

10028,understanding the variation characteristics and related determining factors of water requirements under climate change is crucial for crop production and agricultural water resource utilization therefore in this study the crop coefficient method and water balance model were employed to estimate the crop water requirement cwr and irrigation water requirement ir of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 the impacts of different meteorological factors on the cwr and ir variations were explored using sensitivity and contribution analyses and their determining factors were identified the results showed that effective precipitation increased at a rate of 0 98 mm year from 1981 to 2015 meanwhile the cwr and ir decreased significantly at 2 27 mm year and 3 26 mm year respectively with annual mean values of 620 mm and 499 mm respectively the cwr exhibited relatively high sensitivities to sunshine duration and wind speed indicating that these factors were more likely to cause changes in the cwr of which wind speed was the determining factor of the cwr variation because of its high sensitivity and substantial reduction while increased temperature caused an increase in the cwr its influence was relatively limited and was offset by the impact caused by other factors meanwhile the determining factor of the ir variation was the cwr contribution rate of 83 11 and the contribution of effective precipitation was only 16 89 nevertheless spatial differences existed in the cwr and ir variations and corresponding determining factors as it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on water requirements for effective agricultural water resource utilization the results of this study will provide valuable information for mitigating the impacts of climate change and improving agricultural water management in the yzr and its two tributaries keywords climate change crop water requirement irrigation water requirement sensitivity analysis winter wheat yarlung zangbo river 1 introduction as a scientific phenomenon climate change has become an increasingly important issue for scholars and governments worldwide according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the mean global temperature has been increasing since 1880 and is expected to continue to rise these increased temperatures are expected to be accompanied by more intense precipitation variability ipcc 2013 climate change has a considerable impact on natural ecosystems and socioeconomic development especially with respect to agricultural production and water resource utilization its effects are wide reaching and incur uncertainties to regional sustainable development allen and ingram 2002 elgaali et al 2007 li and shu 2013 agovino et al 2019 referred to as the third pole the tibetan plateau is also known as the water tower of asia as it supports more than a billion people downstream the tibetan plateau is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and has experienced a pronounced warming trend in recent decades qiu 2008 wang et al 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2012 you et al 2016 jia et al 2019a the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation in this region are complex because of the plateau s unique geographical features located in the southern area of the tibetan plateau the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river yzr and its two tributaries the lhasa and nianchu rivers are the main agricultural regions of the tibet autonomous region zhong et al 2014 meanwhile the yzr and its two tributaries are sensitive to climate change and have relatively fragile ecologies therefore accurate estimations of the crop water requirement cwr and irrigation water requirement ir and a comprehensive understanding of their determining factors in the context of climate change are of great significance for agricultural water resource management and production cwr is determined by many factors including meteorological factors and crop characteristics meanwhile ir refers to the water supplemented by irrigation to ensure that crops grow under optimal water conditions the method employed for estimating the cwr and ir mainly include two categories i calculation by crop coefficients combined with the water balance equation and ii crop model simulations wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019a 2019b although the crop model simulation method can better reflect the characteristics of water requirements throughout the growing period a series of complicated parameters and field experiment calibrations are necessary thus it is difficult to achieve precise estimates and effectively reflect the spatial variability with the limited data available for many regions including the tibetan plateau because of their complex terrain ding et al 2017 conversely using crop coefficients combined with the water balance model is often employed to estimate the cwr and ir in different regions with regard to present or future scenarios zhu et al 2015 singh 2016 yang et al 2016 xu et al 2019a 2019b ruan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 studies have investigated the impact of climate change on water requirements mainly using the correlation analyses sensitivity analyses and model simulations however most studies have primarily concentrated on arid areas or important food production areas and less attention has been given to plateau agricultural areas moreover it is imperative to consider the temporal distribution of the cwr and precipitation over a timescale of days to improve the accuracy of ir estimates further studies concerning the determining factors of the cwr and ir variations as well as accurately assessing their responses to climate change are still insufficient therefore in this study based on meteorological and agrometeorological data for the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries the temporal variation and spatial difference of the cwr and ir of winter wheat were analyzed for the period of 1981 2015 in addition the sensitivity of the cwr and ir variations to meteorological factors was quantified and the corresponding contributions to these variations were calculated in combination with a trend analysis further the determining factors of these variations were explored especially in regard to climate change the results of this study will provide valuable information for mitigating the impacts of climate change on agricultural production and agricultural water management in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate the winter wheat water requirements and analyze the variation characteristics for the 1981 2015 period in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries 2 to explore the sensitivity of the cwr and ir variations to meteorological factors and 3 to identify the determining factors of the variations in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the yzr lhasa river lr and nianchu river nr watersheds fig 1 the yzr is the highest major river in the world the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries are located between 87 and 93 e and 28 31 n covering an area of 6 67 104 km2 the region is dominated by a plateau temperate monsoon semi arid climate and has an undulating terrain precipitation generally decreases from east to west and is mainly concentrated between may and september it is also a central agricultural region with a relatively dense population and plays a significant role in the agricultural development of tibet zhong et al 2012 winter wheat is an important crop in this study area accounting for approximately 20 30 of the total grain crop area or yield and this proportion reaches as high as 50 in some regions of shannan and lasa 2 2 datasets daily observed meteorological data including the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were obtained from 1981 to 2015 from nine meteorological stations fig 1 because of the different construction times of these stations the datasets from nanmulin gongga and mozhugongka only began in 1991 the meteorological stations are mainly distributed near crop growing areas and rivers where the altitude is relatively low note that the missing and abnormal values were preprocessed by elimination or linear interpolation to control the quality of the meteorological data the winter wheat crop data such as the phenological phase and plant height were derived from the agrometeorological station in lasa from 2002 to 2013 and the multi year average values were adopted although the growth period varies based on time and region winter wheat in the study area is generally sown in early october and harvested at the end of july or early august of the following year meteorological and agrometeorological data were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration 2 3 estimation of the cwr the winter wheat cwr during the growth period at each station was estimated using the crop coefficient method recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao in which the daily value was determined by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient as follows allen et al 1998 1 e t c e t 0 k c where et c represents the cwr mm et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm and k c is the crop coefficient et o was calculated using the penman monteith equation proposed by the fao for which the net radiation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were calculated based on the sunshine hours and wind speed at a height of 10 m which were derived directly from the meteorological data the et o was calculated as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the land surface mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 d δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c t is the mean air temperature at a height of 2 m c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the crop coefficients at different stages allen et al 1998 the growing periods of winter wheat can be separated into four distinct stages initial crop development mid season and late season the typical crop coefficient recommended by the fao for each stage was adjusted using related meteorological data the corresponding crop coefficients were calculated using the following 3 k c k c t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the mean wind speed at a height of 2 m m s rh min is the minimum relative humidity h is the crop height over the corresponding growth stages m and k ctab is the recommended crop coefficient the recommended k ctab values of winter wheat for the initial mid season and the end of the late season stages were 0 7 1 15 and 0 4 respectively note that the k ctab value for the winter wheat dormancy period was set to 0 4 2 4 estimation of the ir the ir can be defined as the difference between the cwr and effective precipitation döll and stefan 2002 4 i r e t c p e where ir is the daily ir mm et c is the daily cwr mm and p e is the daily effective precipitation mm the p e is the fraction of rainfall that excludes surface runoff and deep percolation and can be approximated as follows wu et al 2019 5 p e p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 m m 1 17 0 1 p p 8 3 m m where p is the daily precipitation mm 2 5 trend analysis the meteorological factors and water requirements trends were identified using the mann kendall m k test including the trend characteristics z and slope statistics and significance tests sen 1968 deng et al 2018 jia et al 2019b the relative change rc of each factor was expressed as the percentage of change during the study period relative to its absolute mean value yin et al 2010 6 r c s l p o e t x 100 where slope represents the variation rate x represents the mean value and t represents the number of years of the study period 2 6 sensitivity and contribution analysis the cwr and ir sensitivities to climate changes were quantified by assessing the impact of factor changes on the model output while assuming that other factors were fixed gong et al 2006 yin et al 2010 ruan et al 2020 the relative sensitivity coefficient s was calculated as follows lenhart et al 2002 7 s δ e t c δ x x e t c where δx represents the relative change in the factor and δet c represents the relative change in et c induced by δx positive negative s values indicate that the et c variation is consistent with contrary to the factor variation the higher the s value the greater is the factor impact in this study the cwrs and irs were recalculated by making a 10 change in each factor to calculate the s value by assuming that all other factors remained unchanged the changes in the cwr and ir induced by one factor can be determined by multiplying the relative change by the corresponding s value thus the contribution of one factor to the cwr and ir variations can be obtained as follows 8 c s r c where c represents the contribution of one factor to the cwr and ir variations s and rc are as previously defined the contribution rate of a single factor can be represented by the percentage of the contribution induced by one factor relative to all the factors 3 results 3 1 variation in meteorological factors meteorological factors directly affect cwr and ir estimates table 1 lists the variation characteristics of the main meteorological factors in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 based on the m k test the annual maximum and minimum temperatures showed significant a significance level of 0 05 was considered in this study increasing trends of 0 04 year and 0 06 year respectively with multi year average values of 15 55 c and 0 40 respectively in particular the increasing trend and actual increase in the minimum temperature were higher than those of the maximum temperature meanwhile the annual sunshine duration exhibited a decreasing trend 0 01 h year with a multi year average value of 8 42 h which changed little during 1981 2015 similarly the annual relative humidity decreased slightly with a multi year average value of 42 26 further wind speed displayed a significant decreasing trend of 0 03 m s a and multi year average value of 1 87 m s overall the variation in temperature was the highest followed by wind speed while the variations in sunshine duration and relative humidity were not significant in addition relatively consistent increasing and decreasing trends were observed for the temperature and wind speed datasets respectively of the different stations moreover regional differences in the variation trends at different stations were mainly associated with the sunshine duration and relative humidity 3 2 variations in the cwr and ir the cwr of winter wheat displayed a significant decreasing trend 2 27 mm year from 1981 to 2015 with a multi year average cwr of 620 mm fig 2 specifically the cwr ranged from 574 mm in 1983 to 671 mm in 2002 indicating that the cwr mainly decreased from 1981 to 2002 and only presented a slightly increasing trend after 2002 precipitation during the winter wheat growth period ranged from 72 mm to 390 mm with an increasing trend that was not significant from 1981 to 2015 the effective precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat ranged from 50 mm to 192 mm multi year average of 121 mm and first increased before decreasing peaking in 2004 effective precipitation exhibited an overall increasing trend 0 98 mm year that was not significant between 1981 and 2015 affected by the cwr and effective precipitation variations the ir had a multi year average of 499 mm and showed a significant decreasing trend 3 26 mm year which was generally similar to that of the cwr from 1981 to 2015 meanwhile nearly all stations displayed similar cwr and ir decreasing trends with the exception of two stations that presented different effective precipitation variation trends 3 3 spatial differences in the cwr and ir fig 3 shows the spatial differentiations in the multi year average cwr for winter wheat from 1981 to 2015 the cwrs of lazi zedang and mozhugongka were relatively high 650 mm followed by those of jiangzi lasa and gongga 600 650 mm and then rikaze nimu and nanmulin 600 mm the precipitation and effective precipitation of the stations in the eastern and northern parts of the study area were generally higher than those in the western and southern areas the precipitation was highest at mozhugongka and the lowest at jiangzi similarly the effective precipitation at mozhugongka 181 mm exceeded that at the other stations and the effective precipitation values at lazi and jiangzi were only 96 mm and 91 mm respectively regarding the ir regional differences existed because of the cwr and effective precipitation influences the irs at lazi jiangzi and zedang which are located in the south part of the study area were generally 500 mm with that at lazi was almost 600 mm conversely the irs at nanmulin and nimu were relatively low e g 402 mm in nimu and those at the other stations ranged from 460 mm to 480 mm 3 4 determining factor of the cwr variation the sensitivity of the cwr to certain single meteorological factors was quantified by artificially setting a 10 variation which can provide meaningful insights for understanding cwr variations in response to climate change as shown in fig 4 the highest cwr sensitivity was to sunshine duration with a mean s value of 0 29 this indicates that if the sunshine duration changed by 10 with other factors remaining unchanged the cwr would change by 2 9 further the sensitivity of the cwr to wind speed was also relatively high with a s value ranging from 0 20 to 0 29 mean of 0 24 for all the stations the s value of the cwr to the maximum temperature ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 while those of the relative humidity and minimum temperature were 0 05 thus the cwr was the least sensitive to the minimum temperature with a mean s value of 0 01 in particular the sensitivity of the cwr to the maximum temperature was higher than that of the minimum temperature indicating that an increased maximum temperature may have a greater impact on the cwr than the minimum temperature in addition the meteorological factor sensitivities varied among different meteorological stations nevertheless the highest sensitivity at most stations was sunshine duration meanwhile the sensitivity to wind speed was the highest at lazi mozhugongka and zedang the cwrs at all stations showed very low sensitivities to the minimum temperature suggesting that the cwr was almost insensitive to this factor in general the cwr of winter wheat was most sensitive to sunshine duration and wind speed in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 which implies that variations in these two factors are more likely to cause changes in the cwr according to the sensitivity analyses and variation trends the contributions of meteorological factors to cwr variations were for 1981 2015 to explore the corresponding impact of climate change the wind speed decreased by approximately 41 20 from 1981 to 2015 resulting in a mean decrease of 10 45 in the winter wheat cwr which contributed the most to changes in the cwr table 2 owing to the relatively low s value for temperature increased temperatures caused a total increase of 2 36 in the cwr which was contrary to the variation in the cwr therefore the contribution rate of the temperature to the cwr was 26 45 although the relative change in the minimum temperature was the highest its contribution rate to the variation in the cwr was relatively low 9 15 owing to its low s value which suggests that a continually increasing minimum temperature had a limited impact on the variation in the cwr meanwhile the sensitivity of the cwr to sunshine duration was high however its contribution to cwr variation was only 0 62 because of the small relative change in sunshine duration further the variation caused by relative humidity was the smallest because of its small relative change and low sensitivity achieving a contribution rate of only 2 45 considering the influence of all five meteorological factors the cwr decreased by 8 92 which was similar to the actual change in the cwr of 9 09 the attribution analysis using sensitivity and trend analyses showed good reliability therefore wind speed was the overall determining factor for the significant decrease in the cwr of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 these results indicate that the cwrs in the study area primarily experienced the impact of climate change as wind speed followed by the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration and relative humidity with the exception of nanmulin most stations revealed that with respect to the absolute contributions of meteorological factors to the cwr at different stations wind speed was the determining factor of the variation in the cwr fig 5 the determining factor of the cwr variation at nanmulin was maximum temperature which caused a 1 0 change in the cwr and made an absolute contribution of 6 74 mm while wind speed caused only a 0 79 change in the cwr although the contribution of the maximum temperature was generally higher than that of the minimum temperature the results varied for certain stations such as nimu moreover relative humidity contributed little to the variation in the cwr at all stations overall increased temperatures would have led to an increase in the cwr in the study area from 1981 to 2015 however this contribution was relatively limited and wind speed remained as the determining factor of cwr variation 3 5 determining factor of the variation in the ir the significant decrease in the ir of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 was generally caused by a decrease in the cwr and an increase in effective precipitation in terms of sensitivity the s values of the ir to the cwr ranged from 1 17 to 1 39 while the mean s value of the ir to effective precipitation was 0 26 overall the sensitivity of the ir to the cwr was higher than that to the effective precipitation suggesting that the cwr may have had a greater impact on ir variation than the effective precipitation moreover owing to the high sensitivity the change in the cwr was more likely to cause a change in the ir than a change in the effective precipitation however the actual contribution of factors to ir variation during the study period must be calculated in combination with a trend analysis the contributions of the cwr and effective precipitation to variations in the ir were analyzed using the same method used for the cwr variation the results showed that the ir variation caused by the cwr was 11 49 whereas that caused by effective precipitation was on average only 2 34 therefore the cwr was the determining factor of ir variation contribution rate of 83 11 in the study area from 1981 to 2015 whereas the effective precipitation had a contribution rate of only 16 89 regarding different stations fig 6 the determining factor of the ir variation was at most stations the cwr with the exception of lasa wherein effective precipitation was the major contributing factor accounting for 72 82 while the cwr only accounted for 27 18 at rikaze the contribution rates of the cwr and effective precipitation to the ir variation were similar 51 54 and 48 46 respectively meanwhile the contributions of the cwr at the other stations were all 70 in addition the cwr effective precipitation and ir at mozhugongka exhibited decreasing trends wherein the effective precipitation contributed 28 05 to the ir variation and the substantial reduction in the cwr was the determining factor for the decrease in ir in general although the results varied between stations the cwr was the determining factor for ir variation in the study area 4 discussion in this study the cwr of winter wheat exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1981 to 2015 in which wind speed was the dominant determining factor because of its substantial reduction and the cwr s relatively high sensitivity these results are consistent with those of previous studies which demonstrated that wind speed was the major controlling factor for the variation in the potential evapotranspiration a key parameter of the cwr on the tibetan plateau chen et al 2006 yin et al 2010 in china over the past 40 years wind speed has exhibited a decreasing trend yin et al 2010 this includes that on the tibetan plateau which has been less disturbed by human activities than other chinese regions changes in atmospheric circulation are most likely the cause of this wind speed reduction zhang et al 2009 the increasing temperature in the study area led to an increase in the cwr of winter wheat however its contribution was relatively low and offset by the changes caused by other factors from 1981 to 2015 moreover note that the response of the cwr to the maximum and minimum temperatures differed and the more obvious increased minimum temperature exhibited a weaker influence on the variation of the cwr compared with the maximum temperature this reduced the influence of climate warming to a certain extent moreover the results showed that the overall impact of climate warming on the cwr in the study region is relatively limited nevertheless the results of this study are not consistent with those of related studies li et al 2017 reported that the sensitivity of the reference evapotranspiration to the relative humidity was the highest in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi whereas the maximum temperature showed the highest contribution rate to reference evapotranspiration variation ruan et al 2020 found that the cwr increased from 2000 to 2018 in central asia and that maximum temperature exerted the greatest impact on the cwr in terms of climate factors affected by the cwr and effective precipitation the ir of winter wheat showed a significant decreasing trend from 1981 to 2015 according to the water balance model used in this study however wu et al 2019 reported that the ir for winter wheat did not change significantly from 1980 to 2012 in the north china plain further in the northeast farming region of china the ir has been reported to increase under future climate change xu et al 2019a 2019b therefore the variation and related determining factors of the cwr and ir are regionally dependent specifically they are related not only to regional climatic conditions but also to the complex mathematical relationships between climatic factors and water requirements furthermore it has also been shown that the results are inconsistent for a given region during different study periods which implies that the impacts of climate change on the cwr and ir vary over time thereby increasing the uncertainty of related studies fan and thomas 2018 zhang et al 2019 ruan et al 2020 as the impact of climate change on the cwr and ir is complex many additional factors need to be considered including the response of crop phenology to climate warming estrella et al 2007 wang et al 2013 in this study daily effective precipitation was considered instead of annual precipitation in order to improve to a certain degree the accuracy of the ir calculation however different models of effective precipitation perform differently in different regions making it necessary to build a regional model to achieve accurate estimations by considering factors such as soil water moisture meanwhile the temporal distribution of precipitation should be emphasized as ignoring the seasonal characteristics of precipitation generally leads to an underestimation of the ir although the cwr and ir decreased significantly from 1981 to 2015 this does not indicate that the agricultural water pressure in this region was reduced in fact related materials and field research in the study area have shown that water resources are relatively scarce in some regions especially on a seasonal basis and that irrigation and water conservancy facilities are incomplete in addition the impact of climate change is still associated with considerable uncertainties including runoff which is important for water resources wang et al 2019 furthermore as a special region on the tibetan plateau human activities in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries have intensified in recent years which may have increased the pressure on water resources and fragile ecology this could have global implications owing to the unique status of the tibetan plateau our research mainly focused on the cwr and ir in terms of unit area which is helpful for adjusting the crop planting structure under climate change in fact crop area is an important factor influencing the total volume of water requirements and it could also reflect the influence of human activities further several researchers have explored the effect of crop area changes on agricultural water requirements yang et al 2016 ruan et al 2020 thus it is important to pay attention to the variation and attribution analysis of the cwr and ir under the combined influence of climate change and human activities in future studies meanwhile a thorough understanding of the impact of climate change on water requirements of crops is crucial for achieving sustainable water resource utilization and rational agricultural production management 5 conclusions in this study the variation characteristics of the cwr and ir of winter wheat from 1981 to 2015 were analyzed and the corresponding determining factors under climate change were revealed the results showed that the effective precipitation during the study period exhibited a slightly increasing trend 0 98 mm year that was not significant meanwhile significant decreasing trends for the cwr 2 27 mm year and ir 3 26 mm year were observed with annual mean values of 620 mm and 499 mm respectively in terms of the spatial differences among meteorological stations relatively high cwr and ir were observed at lazi while these values at nimu were relatively low moreover the highest sensitivity of the cwr was to sunshine duration followed by wind speed maximum temperature relative humidity and minimum temperature note that wind speed was found to be the determining factor of the cwr variation as it contributed the most to changes in the cwr owing to its high sensitivity and significant decreasing trend interestingly increased temperatures caused an increase in the cwr however the influence was still relatively limited in comparison to wind speed although differences existed among stations the cwr was the overall determining factor of the ir variation contribution rate of approximately 83 11 while the contribution rate of effective precipitation was only 16 89 given the uncertainties in climate change it is necessary to understand the related impacts on water requirements of crops particularly in plateau agricultural regions that are sensitive to climate change thus cwr and ir variations and related determining meteorological factors should be considered in regional agricultural water management practices the results of this study will help mitigate the impacts of climate change and improve regional anticipatory water management planning in the yzr and its two tributaries declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10028,understanding the variation characteristics and related determining factors of water requirements under climate change is crucial for crop production and agricultural water resource utilization therefore in this study the crop coefficient method and water balance model were employed to estimate the crop water requirement cwr and irrigation water requirement ir of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 the impacts of different meteorological factors on the cwr and ir variations were explored using sensitivity and contribution analyses and their determining factors were identified the results showed that effective precipitation increased at a rate of 0 98 mm year from 1981 to 2015 meanwhile the cwr and ir decreased significantly at 2 27 mm year and 3 26 mm year respectively with annual mean values of 620 mm and 499 mm respectively the cwr exhibited relatively high sensitivities to sunshine duration and wind speed indicating that these factors were more likely to cause changes in the cwr of which wind speed was the determining factor of the cwr variation because of its high sensitivity and substantial reduction while increased temperature caused an increase in the cwr its influence was relatively limited and was offset by the impact caused by other factors meanwhile the determining factor of the ir variation was the cwr contribution rate of 83 11 and the contribution of effective precipitation was only 16 89 nevertheless spatial differences existed in the cwr and ir variations and corresponding determining factors as it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on water requirements for effective agricultural water resource utilization the results of this study will provide valuable information for mitigating the impacts of climate change and improving agricultural water management in the yzr and its two tributaries keywords climate change crop water requirement irrigation water requirement sensitivity analysis winter wheat yarlung zangbo river 1 introduction as a scientific phenomenon climate change has become an increasingly important issue for scholars and governments worldwide according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the mean global temperature has been increasing since 1880 and is expected to continue to rise these increased temperatures are expected to be accompanied by more intense precipitation variability ipcc 2013 climate change has a considerable impact on natural ecosystems and socioeconomic development especially with respect to agricultural production and water resource utilization its effects are wide reaching and incur uncertainties to regional sustainable development allen and ingram 2002 elgaali et al 2007 li and shu 2013 agovino et al 2019 referred to as the third pole the tibetan plateau is also known as the water tower of asia as it supports more than a billion people downstream the tibetan plateau is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and has experienced a pronounced warming trend in recent decades qiu 2008 wang et al 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2012 you et al 2016 jia et al 2019a the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation in this region are complex because of the plateau s unique geographical features located in the southern area of the tibetan plateau the middle reaches of the yarlung zangbo river yzr and its two tributaries the lhasa and nianchu rivers are the main agricultural regions of the tibet autonomous region zhong et al 2014 meanwhile the yzr and its two tributaries are sensitive to climate change and have relatively fragile ecologies therefore accurate estimations of the crop water requirement cwr and irrigation water requirement ir and a comprehensive understanding of their determining factors in the context of climate change are of great significance for agricultural water resource management and production cwr is determined by many factors including meteorological factors and crop characteristics meanwhile ir refers to the water supplemented by irrigation to ensure that crops grow under optimal water conditions the method employed for estimating the cwr and ir mainly include two categories i calculation by crop coefficients combined with the water balance equation and ii crop model simulations wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019a 2019b although the crop model simulation method can better reflect the characteristics of water requirements throughout the growing period a series of complicated parameters and field experiment calibrations are necessary thus it is difficult to achieve precise estimates and effectively reflect the spatial variability with the limited data available for many regions including the tibetan plateau because of their complex terrain ding et al 2017 conversely using crop coefficients combined with the water balance model is often employed to estimate the cwr and ir in different regions with regard to present or future scenarios zhu et al 2015 singh 2016 yang et al 2016 xu et al 2019a 2019b ruan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 studies have investigated the impact of climate change on water requirements mainly using the correlation analyses sensitivity analyses and model simulations however most studies have primarily concentrated on arid areas or important food production areas and less attention has been given to plateau agricultural areas moreover it is imperative to consider the temporal distribution of the cwr and precipitation over a timescale of days to improve the accuracy of ir estimates further studies concerning the determining factors of the cwr and ir variations as well as accurately assessing their responses to climate change are still insufficient therefore in this study based on meteorological and agrometeorological data for the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries the temporal variation and spatial difference of the cwr and ir of winter wheat were analyzed for the period of 1981 2015 in addition the sensitivity of the cwr and ir variations to meteorological factors was quantified and the corresponding contributions to these variations were calculated in combination with a trend analysis further the determining factors of these variations were explored especially in regard to climate change the results of this study will provide valuable information for mitigating the impacts of climate change on agricultural production and agricultural water management in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate the winter wheat water requirements and analyze the variation characteristics for the 1981 2015 period in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries 2 to explore the sensitivity of the cwr and ir variations to meteorological factors and 3 to identify the determining factors of the variations in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the yzr lhasa river lr and nianchu river nr watersheds fig 1 the yzr is the highest major river in the world the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries are located between 87 and 93 e and 28 31 n covering an area of 6 67 104 km2 the region is dominated by a plateau temperate monsoon semi arid climate and has an undulating terrain precipitation generally decreases from east to west and is mainly concentrated between may and september it is also a central agricultural region with a relatively dense population and plays a significant role in the agricultural development of tibet zhong et al 2012 winter wheat is an important crop in this study area accounting for approximately 20 30 of the total grain crop area or yield and this proportion reaches as high as 50 in some regions of shannan and lasa 2 2 datasets daily observed meteorological data including the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were obtained from 1981 to 2015 from nine meteorological stations fig 1 because of the different construction times of these stations the datasets from nanmulin gongga and mozhugongka only began in 1991 the meteorological stations are mainly distributed near crop growing areas and rivers where the altitude is relatively low note that the missing and abnormal values were preprocessed by elimination or linear interpolation to control the quality of the meteorological data the winter wheat crop data such as the phenological phase and plant height were derived from the agrometeorological station in lasa from 2002 to 2013 and the multi year average values were adopted although the growth period varies based on time and region winter wheat in the study area is generally sown in early october and harvested at the end of july or early august of the following year meteorological and agrometeorological data were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration 2 3 estimation of the cwr the winter wheat cwr during the growth period at each station was estimated using the crop coefficient method recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao in which the daily value was determined by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient as follows allen et al 1998 1 e t c e t 0 k c where et c represents the cwr mm et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm and k c is the crop coefficient et o was calculated using the penman monteith equation proposed by the fao for which the net radiation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were calculated based on the sunshine hours and wind speed at a height of 10 m which were derived directly from the meteorological data the et o was calculated as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the land surface mj m2 d

vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the crop coefficients at different stages allen et al 1998 the growing periods of winter wheat can be separated into four distinct stages initial crop development mid season and late season the typical crop coefficient recommended by the fao for each stage was adjusted using related meteorological data the corresponding crop coefficients were calculated using the following 3 k c k c t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the mean wind speed at a height of 2 m m s rh min is the minimum relative humidity h is the crop height over the corresponding growth stages m and k ctab is the recommended crop coefficient the recommended k ctab values of winter wheat for the initial mid season and the end of the late season stages were 0 7 1 15 and 0 4 respectively note that the k ctab value for the winter wheat dormancy period was set to 0 4 2 4 estimation of the ir the ir can be defined as the difference between the cwr and effective precipitation döll and stefan 2002 4 i r e t c p e where ir is the daily ir mm et c is the daily cwr mm and p e is the daily effective precipitation mm the p e is the fraction of rainfall that excludes surface runoff and deep percolation and can be approximated as follows wu et al

mann kendall m k test including the trend characteristics z and slope statistics and significance tests sen 1968 deng et al 2018 jia et al 2019b the relative change rc of each factor was expressed as the percentage of change during the study period relative to its absolute mean value yin et al 2010 6 r c s l p o e t x 100 where slope represents the variation rate x represents the mean value and t represents the number of years of the study period 2 6 sensitivity and contribution analysis the cwr and ir sensitivities to climate changes were quantified by assessing the impact of factor changes on the model output while assuming that other factors were fixed gong et al 2006 yin et al 2010 ruan et al 2020 the relative sensitivity coefficient s was calculated as follows lenhart et al 2002 7 s δ e t c δ x x e t c where δx represents the relative change in the factor and δet c represents the relative change in et c induced by δx positive negative s values indicate that the et c variation is consistent with contrary to the factor variation the higher the s value the greater is the factor impact in this study the cwrs and irs were recalculated by making a 10 change in each factor to calculate the s value by assuming that all other factors remained unchanged the changes in the cwr and ir induced by one factor can be determined by multiplying the relative change by the corresponding s value thus the contribution of one factor to the cwr and ir variations can be obtained as follows 8 c s r c where c represents the contribution of one factor to the cwr and ir variations s and rc are as previously defined the contribution rate of a single factor can be represented by the percentage of the contribution induced by one factor relative to all the factors 3 results 3 1 variation in meteorological factors meteorological factors directly affect cwr and ir estimates table 1 lists the variation characteristics of the main meteorological factors in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 based on the m k test the annual maximum and minimum temperatures showed significant a significance level of 0 05 was considered in this study increasing trends of 0 04 year and 0 06 year respectively with multi year average values of 15 55 c and 0 40 respectively in particular the increasing trend and actual increase in the minimum temperature were higher than those of the maximum temperature meanwhile the annual sunshine duration exhibited a decreasing trend 0 01 h year with a multi year average value of 8 42 h which changed little during 1981 2015 similarly the annual relative humidity decreased slightly with a multi year average value of 42 26 further wind speed displayed a significant decreasing trend of 0 03 m s a and multi year average value of 1 87 m s overall the variation in temperature was the highest followed by wind speed while the variations in sunshine duration and relative humidity were not significant in addition relatively consistent increasing and decreasing trends were observed for the temperature and wind speed datasets respectively of the different stations moreover regional differences in the variation trends at different stations were mainly associated with the sunshine duration and relative humidity 3 2 variations in the cwr and ir the cwr of winter wheat displayed a significant decreasing trend 2 27 mm year from 1981 to 2015 with a multi year average cwr of 620 mm fig 2 specifically the cwr ranged from 574 mm in 1983 to 671 mm in 2002 indicating that the cwr mainly decreased from 1981 to 2002 and only presented a slightly increasing trend after 2002 precipitation during the winter wheat growth period ranged from 72 mm to 390 mm with an increasing trend that was not significant from 1981 to 2015 the effective precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat ranged from 50 mm to 192 mm multi year average of 121 mm and first increased before decreasing peaking in 2004 effective precipitation exhibited an overall increasing trend 0 98 mm year that was not significant between 1981 and 2015 affected by the cwr and effective precipitation variations the ir had a multi year average of 499 mm and showed a significant decreasing trend 3 26 mm year which was generally similar to that of the cwr from 1981 to 2015 meanwhile nearly all stations displayed similar cwr and ir decreasing trends with the exception of two stations that presented different effective precipitation variation trends 3 3 spatial differences in the cwr and ir fig 3 shows the spatial differentiations in the multi year average cwr for winter wheat from 1981 to 2015 the cwrs of lazi zedang and mozhugongka were relatively high 650 mm followed by those of jiangzi lasa and gongga 600 650 mm and then rikaze nimu and nanmulin 600 mm the precipitation and effective precipitation of the stations in the eastern and northern parts of the study area were generally higher than those in the western and southern areas the precipitation was highest at mozhugongka and the lowest at jiangzi similarly the effective precipitation at mozhugongka 181 mm exceeded that at the other stations and the effective precipitation values at lazi and jiangzi were only 96 mm and 91 mm respectively regarding the ir regional differences existed because of the cwr and effective precipitation influences the irs at lazi jiangzi and zedang which are located in the south part of the study area were generally 500 mm with that at lazi was almost 600 mm conversely the irs at nanmulin and nimu were relatively low e g 402 mm in nimu and those at the other stations ranged from 460 mm to 480 mm 3 4 determining factor of the cwr variation the sensitivity of the cwr to certain single meteorological factors was quantified by artificially setting a 10 variation which can provide meaningful insights for understanding cwr variations in response to climate change as shown in fig 4 the highest cwr sensitivity was to sunshine duration with a mean s value of 0 29 this indicates that if the sunshine duration changed by 10 with other factors remaining unchanged the cwr would change by 2 9 further the sensitivity of the cwr to wind speed was also relatively high with a s value ranging from 0 20 to 0 29 mean of 0 24 for all the stations the s value of the cwr to the maximum temperature ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 while those of the relative humidity and minimum temperature were 0 05 thus the cwr was the least sensitive to the minimum temperature with a mean s value of 0 01 in particular the sensitivity of the cwr to the maximum temperature was higher than that of the minimum temperature indicating that an increased maximum temperature may have a greater impact on the cwr than the minimum temperature in addition the meteorological factor sensitivities varied among different meteorological stations nevertheless the highest sensitivity at most stations was sunshine duration meanwhile the sensitivity to wind speed was the highest at lazi mozhugongka and zedang the cwrs at all stations showed very low sensitivities to the minimum temperature suggesting that the cwr was almost insensitive to this factor in general the cwr of winter wheat was most sensitive to sunshine duration and wind speed in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 which implies that variations in these two factors are more likely to cause changes in the cwr according to the sensitivity analyses and variation trends the contributions of meteorological factors to cwr variations were for 1981 2015 to explore the corresponding impact of climate change the wind speed decreased by approximately 41 20 from 1981 to 2015 resulting in a mean decrease of 10 45 in the winter wheat cwr which contributed the most to changes in the cwr table 2 owing to the relatively low s value for temperature increased temperatures caused a total increase of 2 36 in the cwr which was contrary to the variation in the cwr therefore the contribution rate of the temperature to the cwr was 26 45 although the relative change in the minimum temperature was the highest its contribution rate to the variation in the cwr was relatively low 9 15 owing to its low s value which suggests that a continually increasing minimum temperature had a limited impact on the variation in the cwr meanwhile the sensitivity of the cwr to sunshine duration was high however its contribution to cwr variation was only 0 62 because of the small relative change in sunshine duration further the variation caused by relative humidity was the smallest because of its small relative change and low sensitivity achieving a contribution rate of only 2 45 considering the influence of all five meteorological factors the cwr decreased by 8 92 which was similar to the actual change in the cwr of 9 09 the attribution analysis using sensitivity and trend analyses showed good reliability therefore wind speed was the overall determining factor for the significant decrease in the cwr of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 these results indicate that the cwrs in the study area primarily experienced the impact of climate change as wind speed followed by the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration and relative humidity with the exception of nanmulin most stations revealed that with respect to the absolute contributions of meteorological factors to the cwr at different stations wind speed was the determining factor of the variation in the cwr fig 5 the determining factor of the cwr variation at nanmulin was maximum temperature which caused a 1 0 change in the cwr and made an absolute contribution of 6 74 mm while wind speed caused only a 0 79 change in the cwr although the contribution of the maximum temperature was generally higher than that of the minimum temperature the results varied for certain stations such as nimu moreover relative humidity contributed little to the variation in the cwr at all stations overall increased temperatures would have led to an increase in the cwr in the study area from 1981 to 2015 however this contribution was relatively limited and wind speed remained as the determining factor of cwr variation 3 5 determining factor of the variation in the ir the significant decrease in the ir of winter wheat in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries from 1981 to 2015 was generally caused by a decrease in the cwr and an increase in effective precipitation in terms of sensitivity the s values of the ir to the cwr ranged from 1 17 to 1 39 while the mean s value of the ir to effective precipitation was 0 26 overall the sensitivity of the ir to the cwr was higher than that to the effective precipitation suggesting that the cwr may have had a greater impact on ir variation than the effective precipitation moreover owing to the high sensitivity the change in the cwr was more likely to cause a change in the ir than a change in the effective precipitation however the actual contribution of factors to ir variation during the study period must be calculated in combination with a trend analysis the contributions of the cwr and effective precipitation to variations in the ir were analyzed using the same method used for the cwr variation the results showed that the ir variation caused by the cwr was 11 49 whereas that caused by effective precipitation was on average only 2 34 therefore the cwr was the determining factor of ir variation contribution rate of 83 11 in the study area from 1981 to 2015 whereas the effective precipitation had a contribution rate of only 16 89 regarding different stations fig 6 the determining factor of the ir variation was at most stations the cwr with the exception of lasa wherein effective precipitation was the major contributing factor accounting for 72 82 while the cwr only accounted for 27 18 at rikaze the contribution rates of the cwr and effective precipitation to the ir variation were similar 51 54 and 48 46 respectively meanwhile the contributions of the cwr at the other stations were all 70 in addition the cwr effective precipitation and ir at mozhugongka exhibited decreasing trends wherein the effective precipitation contributed 28 05 to the ir variation and the substantial reduction in the cwr was the determining factor for the decrease in ir in general although the results varied between stations the cwr was the determining factor for ir variation in the study area 4 discussion in this study the cwr of winter wheat exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1981 to 2015 in which wind speed was the dominant determining factor because of its substantial reduction and the cwr s relatively high sensitivity these results are consistent with those of previous studies which demonstrated that wind speed was the major controlling factor for the variation in the potential evapotranspiration a key parameter of the cwr on the tibetan plateau chen et al 2006 yin et al 2010 in china over the past 40 years wind speed has exhibited a decreasing trend yin et al 2010 this includes that on the tibetan plateau which has been less disturbed by human activities than other chinese regions changes in atmospheric circulation are most likely the cause of this wind speed reduction zhang et al 2009 the increasing temperature in the study area led to an increase in the cwr of winter wheat however its contribution was relatively low and offset by the changes caused by other factors from 1981 to 2015 moreover note that the response of the cwr to the maximum and minimum temperatures differed and the more obvious increased minimum temperature exhibited a weaker influence on the variation of the cwr compared with the maximum temperature this reduced the influence of climate warming to a certain extent moreover the results showed that the overall impact of climate warming on the cwr in the study region is relatively limited nevertheless the results of this study are not consistent with those of related studies li et al 2017 reported that the sensitivity of the reference evapotranspiration to the relative humidity was the highest in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi whereas the maximum temperature showed the highest contribution rate to reference evapotranspiration variation ruan et al 2020 found that the cwr increased from 2000 to 2018 in central asia and that maximum temperature exerted the greatest impact on the cwr in terms of climate factors affected by the cwr and effective precipitation the ir of winter wheat showed a significant decreasing trend from 1981 to 2015 according to the water balance model used in this study however wu et al 2019 reported that the ir for winter wheat did not change significantly from 1980 to 2012 in the north china plain further in the northeast farming region of china the ir has been reported to increase under future climate change xu et al 2019a 2019b therefore the variation and related determining factors of the cwr and ir are regionally dependent specifically they are related not only to regional climatic conditions but also to the complex mathematical relationships between climatic factors and water requirements furthermore it has also been shown that the results are inconsistent for a given region during different study periods which implies that the impacts of climate change on the cwr and ir vary over time thereby increasing the uncertainty of related studies fan and thomas 2018 zhang et al 2019 ruan et al 2020 as the impact of climate change on the cwr and ir is complex many additional factors need to be considered including the response of crop phenology to climate warming estrella et al 2007 wang et al 2013 in this study daily effective precipitation was considered instead of annual precipitation in order to improve to a certain degree the accuracy of the ir calculation however different models of effective precipitation perform differently in different regions making it necessary to build a regional model to achieve accurate estimations by considering factors such as soil water moisture meanwhile the temporal distribution of precipitation should be emphasized as ignoring the seasonal characteristics of precipitation generally leads to an underestimation of the ir although the cwr and ir decreased significantly from 1981 to 2015 this does not indicate that the agricultural water pressure in this region was reduced in fact related materials and field research in the study area have shown that water resources are relatively scarce in some regions especially on a seasonal basis and that irrigation and water conservancy facilities are incomplete in addition the impact of climate change is still associated with considerable uncertainties including runoff which is important for water resources wang et al 2019 furthermore as a special region on the tibetan plateau human activities in the middle reaches of the yzr and its two tributaries have intensified in recent years which may have increased the pressure on water resources and fragile ecology this could have global implications owing to the unique status of the tibetan plateau our research mainly focused on the cwr and ir in terms of unit area which is helpful for adjusting the crop planting structure under climate change in fact crop area is an important factor influencing the total volume of water requirements and it could also reflect the influence of human activities further several researchers have explored the effect of crop area changes on agricultural water requirements yang et al 2016 ruan et al 2020 thus it is important to pay attention to the variation and attribution analysis of the cwr and ir under the combined influence of climate change and human activities in future studies meanwhile a thorough understanding of the impact of climate change on water requirements of crops is crucial for achieving sustainable water resource utilization and rational agricultural production management 5 conclusions in this study the variation characteristics of the cwr and ir of winter wheat from 1981 to 2015 were analyzed and the corresponding determining factors under climate change were revealed the results showed that the effective precipitation during the study period exhibited a slightly increasing trend 0 98 mm year that was not significant meanwhile significant decreasing trends for the cwr 2 27 mm year and ir 3 26 mm year were observed with annual mean values of 620 mm and 499 mm respectively in terms of the spatial differences among meteorological stations relatively high cwr and ir were observed at lazi while these values at nimu were relatively low moreover the highest sensitivity of the cwr was to sunshine duration followed by wind speed maximum temperature relative humidity and minimum temperature note that wind speed was found to be the determining factor of the cwr variation as it contributed the most to changes in the cwr owing to its high sensitivity and significant decreasing trend interestingly increased temperatures caused an increase in the cwr however the influence was still relatively limited in comparison to wind speed although differences existed among stations the cwr was the overall determining factor of the ir variation contribution rate of approximately 83 11 while the contribution rate of effective precipitation was only 16 89 given the uncertainties in climate change it is necessary to understand the related impacts on water requirements of crops particularly in plateau agricultural regions that are sensitive to climate change thus cwr and ir variations and related determining meteorological factors should be considered in regional agricultural water management practices the results of this study will help mitigate the impacts of climate change and improve regional anticipatory water management planning in the yzr and its two tributaries declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10029,agriculture in ethiopia has a historical dependency on rainfed wet season and surface water based dry season irrigation projects the performances of which rely heavily on jjas precipitation this is more sensitive in the upper blue nile ubn basin where precipitation uncertainty and hydrological droughts often overshadow the effectiveness of these irrigation schemes challenging the water food security efforts in general to explore this issue we developed a numerical framework based on a groundwater model using modflow nwt coupled with the outputs of the crop model dssat the framework was implemented in an irrigated site namely the koga irrigation scheme located within in the ubn basin ethiopia the coupling of groundwater modelling with crop water modelling in data scarce environments is a key contribution of this work the groundwater model was calibrated with in situ data collected via a citizen science initiative csi for hydraulic head h and soil moisture θ and against a distributed hydrological model crest simulated evapotranspiration et normalized root mean squared error nrmse values of 0 047 0 05 and 0 06 were obtained through calibration for h θ and et

further be adversely affected by seasonal precipitation reductions christensen et al 2007 mohamed 2017 at present there is little to no rainfall during the dry season feb may which may be further exacerbated by climatic uncertainties in the future awulachew et al 2008 mccartney and girma 2012 the country s irrigation potential is estimated at 3 7 million ha of which only about 190 thousand ha is irrigated tesfaye et al 2008 haile and kasa 2015 this pushed the country s interest towards harnessing the potential of local irrigation schemes mostly surface water based to increase dry season crop growth bceom 1999 kebede et al 2006 chebud and melesse 2009 nigussie et al 2019 however droughts in recent years have challenged the upshots of these irrigation schemes which not only affected local water food security but also per capita water availability in general viste et al 2013 funk et al 2016 philip et al 2018 studies suggest that gw in ethiopia with purportedly about 3 6 billion m3 exploitable estimates annually has the potential to substantially address the water and food security issues that are driven by precipitation and climate uncertainties chebud and melesse 2009 kebede 2012 haile and kasa 2015 and at the same time foster human development linked to the water food and energy wfe nexus gaye and tindimugaya 2012 in this study we deployed a numerical framework to assess the potential of gw based irrigation to address water shortages through a better understanding of the vadose zone water availability in irrigated areas we implemented and calibrated a modflow model specifically focusing on an irrigated site named the koga irrigation scheme located within the ubn region of ethiopia we used the modular 3 d finite difference modflow model with nwt solver modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 and the unsaturated zone package the model was forced with daily distributed hydrological variables infiltration and evapotranspiration demand simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model recently developed for the upper blue nile basin lazin et al 2020 previous modeling studies indicated a substantial amount of physical availability of gw resources in the ubn region khadim et al 2020b khadim et al 2020b assessed shallow gw availability in the koga area our study area which has potential to aid in supplementing irrigation during periods of low rainfall driven by this this research focuses on the assessment of vadose zone water availability following irrigation and compares with a process based model dssat simulated crop water requirement the calibrated modflow model is used in this study to investigate different irrigation scenarios aimed at improving water food security by reducing crop water stress through adequate water use this numerical investigation also evaluated the prospects of using gw to supplement surface water based irrigation during extreme drought years water stress can be defined as a situation in which plant s normal functions are interfered by the shortage of water transported and distributed through transpiration bal et al 2018 improving water productivity in the dry season by alleviating crop water stress is a major concern in the study area alemayehu 2014 to overcome such challenge understanding the relationship between water deficit and yield of certain crops is the key to increase food production with limited water resources howell 2001 lavergne et al 2019 process based gw and crop yield models can aid decision making for achieving enhanced water use efficiency especially in semiarid regions like ethiopia xiang et al 2020 studies have showcased applications of numerical models to support decision making pertaining to improved water food security one approach is to infer decision making strategies solely from a gw simulation perspective often neglecting crop specific water demands ebraheem et al 2003 dawoud et al 2005 mao et al 2005 mylopoulos et al 2007 hanson et al 2010 wada et al 2012 there exist agronomic model based approaches that simulate interactions between crop physiology weather and management on one dimensional soil profiles but do not consider dynamic gw processes yang et al 2006 wu et al 2015 even though approaches that employ coupled gw and crop models to improve water food security have been applied before bulatewicz et al 2010 varela ortega et al 2011 xu et al 2012 hadded et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 these approaches had focused on large scale processes not field scale crop physiology based interactions with dynamic gw conditions in a recent study xiang et al 2020 demonstrated advanced field scale coupling of modflow dssat where the two models are linked interchangeably by exchanging interdependent crop and dynamic gw specific information and simulating the models separately the coupling mechanism of modflow with dssat in our research is similar to some extent to this research xiang et al 2020 however in our study we initially forced the modflow model with more realistic infiltration values comprising actual in situ irrigation during dry season combined with the jjas precipitation induced infiltration simulated by another hydrological model crest lazin et al 2020 this way the modeling approach presented in this research is more integrated and links a land surface hydrological model crest with a physically based groundwater model that is driven by in situ irrigation data with a process based crop model with crop specific physiographic details the calibration approach we attempted in this study i e calibrating an unsaturated gw flow model against three distinctive but hydrologically connected variables namely hydraulic head h soil moisture θ and evapotranspiration et adds substantial complexity in our model this is also a scientific challenge as to the timeline of this research we did not find any literature attempting the same more specifically the scientific contributions of this research are the following a novel numerical framework integrating multiple models to aid farm scale decision making on irrigation management b extensive calibration of the modflow model through fine tuning a set of hydrogeological parameters using data collected from a local citizen science initiative as well as estimates simulated from fine resolution hydrological models crest which itself brings robustness in the model performance to represent reality and c conceptualizing irrigation scenarios by considering the qualitative ethnographic information on local irrigation management the numerical framework adopted in this study has the potential to be implemented in other economically sensitive surface water based irrigated areas where existing practices to achieve sustainable water food security are often challenged with growing hydroclimatic uncertainties the approach to couple different sectoral models in this study can also be carried out in other data scarce developing countries with some field specific soil and crop management inputs the broader aim of this numerical framework is to benefit farmers agronomists and water managers who constitute the principal user group the understanding of soil wetness and crop water stress for the three different scenarios in each command area would essentially help the farmers to make decisions on crop types and planting dates furthermore this information would allow water managers to foresee the broader food security impacts and release irrigation water in a timely manner whereas it would help the agronomists to convey accurate estimates on dry season crop water requirements it is noteworthy that the numerical framework presented here is already being used to benefit the aforementioned user groups from ethiopia by providing seasonal water and crop forecasts from 2018 under an nsf water and food security initiative nsf pire 2020 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area this numerical framework was implemented in the koga irrigation scheme ethiopia 11 37 n and 37 12 e coordinates it is one of the biggest irrigation schemes in north central ethiopia designed to irrigate approximately 7000 ha of agriculture land by releasing water during dry season from the koga reservoir mott macdonald 2008 the irrigation scheme completed in 2011 lijalem 2018 mulugeta 2019 is operated through non optimized guiding curves based on reservoir water level volume and irrigable lands where the end decision heavily depends on the operator s judgment mott macdonald 2008 birhanu et al 2014 with about a decade of operations the irrigation scheme either due to management or water availability issues typically reaches less than 73 5 of design capacity birhanu et al 2014 this limitation on water availability along with crop water stress have often led to local food insecurity alemayehu 2014 the koga reservoir is created through a dam across the koga river which is one of the major tributaries of the gilgel abay river the gilgel abay river eventually discharges into lake tana a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake at the source of the upper blue nile river wood and talling 1988 the horizontal spatial domain of the model comprises 9000 ha of which 7000 ha is the design irrigation coverage area lijalem 2018 spreading through 12 command areas one for each secondary canal fig 1 a shows the

variations along with the crest lazin et al 2020 simulated flow in the koga area are shown in fig 1 b the flow simulations indicate that the area suffered from two severe droughts in 2009 and 2015 the

on literature review hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 khadim et al 2020b discussed in section 2 3 1 the modflow model was forced with 12 years 2008 2019 of daily infiltration and et demands simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 crest model itself is forced with seven meteorological variables precipitation air temperature air pressure longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity and wind speed

on crest model performance parameters and other technicalities are available in lazin et al 2020 gwt depths at five shallow gw wells located in the command area 2 ca02 in fig 1 were monitored at weekly intervals from june 2017 to august 2019 as part of a citizen science initiative csi jointly operated by the university of connecticut uconn and bahir dar university bu dokou et al 2018 khadim et al 2020b the csi also entails tdr soil moisture measurements at nine different locations from october 2017 to august 2019 these data are used to calibrate the groundwater model for hydraulic head h and soil moisture θ we collected borehole log data from abay basin authority aba for one well situated in the downstream of the koga irrigation scheme we also obtained daily dry season reservoir levels starting july 2012 to august 2019 reservoir releases irrigation canal types and layout canal geometry design flow capacity along with some general guidance pertaining to field scale practices on koga reservoir and structural operations from the aba in may 2018 and june 2019 the research team carried out a couple of weeklong field investigations at the study area which along with qualitative ethnographic information collected as part of nsf pire water and food security project nsf pire 2020 helped conceptualizing a set of irrigation scenarios considered during the groundwater model application 2 3 numerical framework details the numerical framework comprises three major components first the field scale calibration of a modflow model forced with in situ irrigation information and crest simulated land surface variables infiltration and et demand second the consideration of three irrigation scenarios to analyze irrigation estimates third to estimate crop water stress by comparing the modflow model simulated root water uptake with dssat simulated potential transpiration using a major cereal crop wheat cultivated in the dry season dssat estimates crop specific potential transpiration based on crop type growth management input as well as climate data on the other hand modflow simulates 3 d root water uptake considering more irrigation details which includes canal layout canal geometry daily irrigation releases canal operations etc it is noteworthy that the root water uptake could also be simulated by dssat but considering modflow s better representation of local details irrigation structures and mechanism as well as the grid based 3 d spatial outputs the latter was used to compensate the effects of crop specific details in modflow we used the crop extinction water content and extinction depth as calibration parameters which were adjusted during calibration the irrigation scenarios we considered in this study are a non regulated nreg where we consider the gates of all irrigation canals to stay open during the entire irrigation season b regulated reg where we considered a pseudo optimized alternative for the frequency of the irrigation canal operations which takes into account ethnographic input from the field and c regulated with groundwater pumping reg gw which is the reg scenario with added gw pumping to supplement irrigation we focused on the understanding of water stress for these three scenarios and specifically assessed for the reg gw scenario a hypothetical consecutive occurrence of two extreme drought years 2015 and 2009 this scenario was chosen to explore whether it would be hydrologically sustainable to alleviate the effects of severe droughts on water food security by harnessing gw for supplemental irrigation the modflow model used in this study was based on a 200 m horizontal grid and a 12 hourly temporal resolution fig 2 shows a process diagram that highlights key activities of this research 2 3 1 conceptual model the conceptual model is inspired from khadim et al 2020b in terms of aquifers and boundaries enhanced by the inclusion of a thin layer on top to add more details while simulating the vadose zone the vertical discretization used in the model is as follows from top a topsoil thickness of 6 m a gravel fractured basalt layer of 15 m followed by a fractured basalt layer of 200 m and a sedimentary formation of about 4 km thickness the topsoil and basalt sequence thicknesses are derived based on the bore log information provided by aba for that area overall the stratigraphic assembly considered in this groundwater model is consistent with available literature hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 fig 1 c showed the vertical discretization considered in the model the koga irrigation scheme allows water from the reservoir to be conveyed through a 19 7 km main canal 12 lined secondary canals 52 km supported by 11 night storage reservoirs nsrs 156 km of tertiary canals 905 km of quaternary canals followed by field canals lijalem 2018 in our model we incorporated the structures up to the tertiary canals and simulated flows entering each secondary canal based on in situ reservoir release information to implement field scale irrigation we then converted these flows m3 d into vertical infiltration m d by dividing the estimates by their respective command areas and a 20 conveyance loss in irrigation canals which is consistent with local literature aseres et al 2019 then we combined this irrigation driven infiltration dry season with crest simulated infiltration to force the groundwater model we applied the irrigation for 12 hour spans representing daytime irrigation in our model we did not include the nsrs to avoid computational complexities since their exact hydrological interaction with the rest of the structures is very much dependent on operative judgments which are difficult to incorporate into the model in addition to the irrigation we specified in situ koga reservoir levels as boundaries along the south east border of the model domain which allowed a one way exchange of subsurface flow into the aquifer system the conceptual model of fig 1 c shows the major recharge discharge processes considered in the model 2 3 2 numerical model modflow nwt a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow was applied using the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 coupled with unsaturated flow using the modflow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 the uzf package uses the method of characteristics to solve a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation to simulate vertical 1d unsaturated flow we used the uzf package to simulate recharge using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1966 in the uppermost active cell based on specified maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone this process routes infiltrated water through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table of the uppermost active cell niswonger et al 2006 the uzf package was also used to simulate evapotranspiration et in the unsaturated zone the evapotranspiration rate depends on the amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone above a specified depth extinction depth and the specified et demand based on the uzf package formulation et can also be supplied by gw when the water table is above the specified extinction depth niswonger et al 2006 the model s consideration for irrigation return flow occurs both in terms of surface and groundwater flow the provided irrigation amount is used to meet the specified et demand and to retain soil moisture in the vadose zone while the remainder eventually reaches the groundwater table as recharge niswonger et al 2006 in case the groundwater table rises above the irrigation canal bed water will be available for the irrigation canals as leakage which is more prominent in the earthen tertiary canals due to their permeable bed material niswonger and prudic 2005 the model simulates the flow in the unsaturated zone by solving the 1 d richards equation in the vertical direction and therefore does not capture interflow which is defined as the lateral movement of water into the canals through the unsaturated zone carroll et al 2019 even in the cases of over irrigation the additional flow will first reach the groundwater table as recharge and then revert back to the irrigation canals as leakage as there were no overland runoff options specified in the model in our study area the irrigation system is always expected to be under water deficit and therefore cases of over irrigation are not applicable the model was simulated in transient conditions from january 2008 through august 2019 at 12 hourly temporal scale adding distinctions between days nights irrigation was added into the model starting with the 2011 2012 irrigation season october april after the start of the koga irrigation project s completion and the time before that is considered as warm up period for the model the model comprised four vertical layers aquifers the top three were specified as convertible in the model and the bottom aquifer was set as confined the horizontal spatial resolution of the model was 200 m generating 116 rows and 77 columns of model cells in each vertical layer to create the input files for the model we first used the usgs s open source gui model muse version 3 10 winston and goode 2017 afterwards we used flopy version 3 2 10 an open source python api bakker et al 2016 to update the input parameters during model simulations which include calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions we derived the initial condition of the model from a steady state simulated h profile which is a convenient approach found in literature franke et al 1987 bagtzoglou 2003a 2003b reilly and harbaugh 2004 we considered dirichlet boundary condition type i in the downstream and upstream ends of the model in the downstream end we used the h values simulated by a regional scale groundwater model developed in the gilgel abay basin khadim et al 2020b and in the upstream end we used in situ reservoir levels obtained from aba we used the time variant specified head chd package to specify this boundary condition everywhere else east and west sides of the model we considered a no flow condition the locations of the type i boundaries are shown in fig 1 a the unmarked boundaries indicate no flow conditions during the scenario of gw pumping we used the neumann boundary type ii to specify pumping rates in artificially placed wells through well package wel using the crop physiography and weather data dssat first simulated the potential transpiration for the wheat crop alternatively we simulated the root water uptake with modflow using the methodology prescribed in niswonger 2020 we then subtracted the root water uptake by modflow from the potential transpiration by dssat and the remaining balance was defined as crop water stress the pumping rates assigned in the wel package were derived from this estimated crop water stress amount with an additional 20 accounted for different types of losses we used mixed boundary conditions type iii while specifying irrigation in the main canal using the streamflow routing package sfr and then simulated the flow reaching the rest of the canal system the sfr package routs the flow in a stream instantaneously to the downstream reach while also simulating the unsaturated flow beneath the streams niswonger and prudic 2005 all the boundary conditions as well as the modflow packages used in the model are summarized in table 1 2 3 4 evaluation framework the modflow model was calibrated using a trial and error based approach with the objective of sequentially minimizing the summation of normalized root mean squared error nrmse of these three variables a modflow simulated heads with in situ gw wells from csi data five wells b modflow simulated soil moisture with in situ tdr soil moisture obtained from csi data nine locations and c modflow simulated et with crest simulated et basin averaged below we describe the calibration steps while calibrating θ we averaged the soil moisture model simulations in the top 20 cm thickness of soil which is the same depth for the tdr measurements collected as part of the csi in the case of et we considered evaluating against crest due to its fine spatiotemporal resolution 90 m hourly and improved et representation in the upper blue nile region over other models lazin et al 2020 while simulating et with the modflow uzf package the et demands were set equal to the reference et obtained from crest lazin et al 2020 which uses the penman monteith equation allen et al 1994a b scaled by a crop coefficient suitable for aerodynamically rough crops in the koga area suggested by senay et al 2013 in order to compare the two models in terms of et we removed the irrigation component from our modflow model as crest simulations do not consider any irrigation also we aggregated the crest et values into 12 hourly data and 200 m spatial resolution to match our model resolution the inclusion of et as a calibration target was important in our modeling effort as we aim to use this model to simulate the root water uptake to assess water stress which is essentially equivalent to the actual transpiration simulated by modflow niswonger 2020 the parameters we used to calibrate the modflow model are aquifer hydraulic conductivity k 1 streambed hydraulic conductivity k 2 specific storage s s specific yield s y maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the vadose zone k z max brooks corey coefficient ϵ extinction water content θ w and extinction depth d w the storage coefficients s s and s y are used for confined and unconfined aquifers respectively the definitions of these parameters are available in the modflow nwt and uzf documentation niswonger et al 2006 2011 as well as other literature lohman 1972 heath 1982 as a starting point we set the initial k 1 s y and s s values during the trial and error calibration equal to calibration values obtained in khadim et al 2020b the values are as follows k 1 as 20 m d for the top three aquifers and 0 5 m d for the bottom aquifer s y unconfined aquifers as 0 08 and s s confined aquifers as 10 6 m 1 for the other parameters we implied literature based understanding and started with the following initial values k 2 1 m d k z max 1 m d ϵ 3 5 θ w 0 3 and d w 1 m all these calibration parameters were adjusted during calibration until the best fit in terms of all calibration target variables h θ et was obtained the calibration was attempted in two different tiers first we calibrated the model for h by adjusting the parameter values of k 1 k 2 s s s y k z max and ϵ considering their increased sensitivity with h guzman et al 2015 asrie and sebhat 2016 after this first tier of calibration we fixed k 1 and s s and used the latest values of k 2 s y k z max and ϵ as initial values for next trial and error iteration second we calibrated the model for θ and et by running several iterations through adjusting values of k 2 s y k z max ϵ θ w and d w in each iteration these parameters are crucial in the vadose zone flow dynamics and significantly influence θ and et estimates at the end of calibration we performed sensitivity tests by multiplying the calibrated parameters with different multipliers typically ranging from 0 1 to 2 and re running the model we performed the sensitivity tests for four major calibration parameters e g k 1 s y k z max and d w the first three of which as per the experience we gained during this modeling endeavor substantially affect all the three calibration variables h θ et while the last parameter d w substantially affects both θ and et 2 3 5 overview of crop model dssat the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a compound crop modeling and decision making tool that simulates the growth development and yield of 42 crops under the prescribed weather soil and management information jones et al 2003 it conducts the crop simulations as a function of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics and updates the water carbon and nitrogen balance at daily step hoogenboom et al 2012 so far dssat has been applied for a wide range of research objectives consisting climate impact assessments water use management breeding selection etc at local and regional scales araya et al 2017 ramirez villegas et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2019 yang et al 2020 past studies also indicated that the combination of dssat and a variety of hydrologic and groundwater models including modflow and crest could provide a better understanding of the relationship between water and crops shelia et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 in dssat water stress is activated when potential root water uptake supply equals or is less than potential transpiration demand and is conceptualized as the ratio of the two factors bal et al 2018 when it is active plant growth and physiological processes will be impeded in this study dssat model was driven by the same climate forcing data as modflow and crest abovementioned the soil properties such as drained upper limit dul saturated soil water content sat and lower limit ll were obtained from the global high resolution soil profile database for crop modeling applications version 2 5 international research institute for climate and society iri et al 2015 derived from soilgrids and isric afsis hengl et al 2014 han et al 2015 the observational crop yield data from 2004 to 2013 with missing years of 2005 and 2006 were derived from ethiopia s annual agricultural sample survey agss we calibrated the cultivar genotype coefficients of wheat based on the observed yield aiming at minimizing the long term crop yield bias the detailed calibration process can be referred to yang et al 2020 2 4 irrigation scenarios following the calibration of the groundwater model we applied the model to simulate the spatial distribution of irrigation by considering three irrigation scenarios the scenarios are a non regulated nreg b regulated reg and c regulated and gw pumping reg gw in all these scenarios in situ data on reservoir releases q mc is specified at the start of the main canal which follows along through the different connected irrigation canals and hence flows entering each of the command areas are simulated with the modflow sfr package niswonger and prudic 2005 the nreg scenario assumes no control on gate operations i e when water is released from the reservoir it is considered that the gates controlling the secondary and tertiary canals remain open and water enters those canals without any additional control flow in each secondary and tertiary canal is restricted solely by their design capacity q sc tc max this is a scenario which does not completely represent what happens in the field however due to paucity of field scale information and the uncertainty in canal operations invoked by dependency on the operator s judgement this is a plausible scenario of resource management the reg scenario is a pseudo optimal alternative where we scaled the gate opening hours for secondary and tertiary canals to allow flow q sc tc where q sc tc q mc q mc max q sc tc max the variable q mc is the flow released from the main canal and q mc max is the peak release for that irrigation year from the field scale information obtained from the ethnographic surveys carried out as part of the project we came to know that in reality farmers and water managers do attempt to manage the gate operations of secondary and tertiary canals based on how much water is released from the source in that sense the reg scenario provides an improved understanding on field scale water management by incorporating these qualitative ethnographic details into the physical simulation of irrigation routing using modflow as such we used the reg scenario as the default field case in some of the analysis section 3 3 for example the reg gw is a hypothetical scenario we considered to envisage a system in which gw is pumped to provide supplemental irrigation in addition to the gate operated flow received through the reg scenario for this purpose we first estimated the crop water stress for wheat in each command area as the difference between dssat simulated potential transpiration and modflow simulated root water uptake or actual transpiration afterwards we placed a number of hypothetical gw wells in each of the command areas cas to carry out gw pumping at a rate that would allow the inclusion of enough water to completely alleviate crop water stress during the irrigation season the pumping rate for supplemental irrigation was considered as equal to the water deficit calculated following the above mentioned procedure plus another 20 considered to account for conveyance loss evaporation resource mismanagement structural damages etc 2 5 extreme hypothetical drought scenario analysis 2015 16 and 2009 10 to create a hydrologically extreme drought condition and assess the impacts of such sustained dry spells on the gw table and other subsurface hydrological components we used the numerical framework to investigate a hypothetical case where the 2015 16 drought year is successively followed by another drought year 2009 10 the second severe drought year 2009 10 was selected based on historical flows simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 this selection of 2009 10 as the second extreme year is also supported by recent studies viste et al 2013 for 2009 10 year we used real values of infiltration and e t demands simulated by crest just like any other year moreover the irrigation release amount for 2009 10 year was estimated based on crest simulated flow in koga and the release pattern was the same as 2015 16 year which exhibits a water management approach suitable for dry conditions the simulation for this hypothetical extreme scenario was carried out initially for the reg scenario we also assessed the effects of extensive pumping in the groundwater table gwt reg gw scenario for this hypothetical extreme scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater model performance 3 1 1 final calibration parameters following the trial and error based calibration procedure discussed in section 2 3 4 evaluation framework we fixed the values of the calibration parameters the final calibration parameter values are presented in table 2 most of the parameters were assumed to be homogeneous along the x y spatial direction which may be justified by the field scale emphasis of the model and the limitation that all calibration measurements are available in the second command area ca2 3 1 2 model evaluation the comparison of the model simulated variables h and θ against in situ citizen science data is shown in fig 3 a and b the monthly boxplots fig 3 a reveal a good agreement of model simulated h estimates with the csi data this can be affirmed by the means of the two data sets falling close except november and december and the substantial overlap in data ranges for all months the nrmse obtained for h evaluation was 0 047 p value 0 01 the θ comparisons reveal a good fit for the wet season between observed and simulated values exhibiting a cluster of outliers for the dry season especially in 2019 where the csi data was surprisingly low this maybe associated due to the uncertainties in irrigation management and without having exact information on irrigation management at hydraulic structure level the model cannot produce an impeccable match the nrmse for θ evaluation for the entire sampling period was 0 05 p value 0 01 which was about 27 of the range of tdr samples fig 3 c shows the modflow simulated et against the crest simulated et the nrmse obtained for et was 0 06 p value 0 01 the two profiles exhibit some disagreement during the dry season even though irrigation was removed from the modflow simulations while calibrating against crest et this may be attributed to the sophisticated methodology of simulating subsurface flow in modflow which better captures the subsurface flow in the dry season in the form of baseflow also the et simulation mechanisms in crest and modflow are different as crest follows an energy budget driven mechanism whereas modflow relies on a water budget based approach even though these distinctions lead to occasional differences in et patterns the cumulative profiles are in most cases in agreement the modflow simulations on the other hand indicate to be less sensitive over such forcing changes and hence mildly indicate a reduced uncertainty propagation 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis we performed a set of single parameter sensitivity tests by selecting calibration parameters e g k 1 s y k z max and d w and the results are presented in fig 4 the figure infers that the final parameters obtained after adopting the trial and error based calibration were in most cases the best fit for the model in terms of reducing nrmse in some cases not all calibration variables agree with the calibrated parameter set e g the combination shown for parameter multiplier 1 0 in fig 4 especially for fig 4 c θ profile was clearly better for parameter multiplier 0 5 however for that set of parameters the other two calibration variables were well off and because of parameter interactions adjusting one parameter would not only affect the variable of interest but the entire model therefore we had to compromise in some cases the optimal solution for one particular variable in order to get an integrated solution that represents a good fit for all variables in general the θ was found to be the most sensitive parameter during calibration 3 2 flow availability and water stress in various irrigation scenarios this section summarizes the model applications to simulate irrigation for the three irrigation scenarios the difference between nreg and reg scenarios is the distribution of irrigation flow in the nreg scenario more flow is allowed in the nearby command areas cas leaving the farther cas water deprived this situation is more pronounced during drought years fig 5 a shows the comparison of irrigation flows for the 2015 16 irrigation cycle followed by the 2015 drought entering each ca in the nreg and reg scenarios the figure depicts that in the nreg scenario a number of cas located far from the reservoir receive little to no water ca 7 12 the reg scenario compromises water availability in the nearby cas and makes sure that all cas receive substantial amount of water fig 5 b shows the annual average water deficit of potential dssat and actual modflow transpiration obtained for the three irrigation scenarios in all 12 command areas the figure highlights the contribution of distributed flow in the reg scenario over the nreg scenario the total amount of annual water deficit for 2012 19 in the nreg and reg scenarios are estimated as 0 72 and 0 63 mm3 respectively the reg gw scenario indeed results in the least water deficit totaling 0 05 mm3 yr this is understandable since in this scenario we pump gw to provide as supplemental irrigation to compensate the water deficit observed in the reg scenario in the reg gw scenario we placed a total of 22 hypothetical wells into the model and allowed pumping for four months nov feb during the regular irrigation season the number of wells 22 is based on the total pumping requirement which is 20 higher than the amount of water stress the 22 pumping wells were placed in nine command areas cas except ca1 ca8 and ca11 we inferred from our modeling attempts in the nreg and reg scenarios that wheat grown in ca1 ca8 and ca11 experience very little to no water stress and gw pumping would not be needed approximately 2 4 wells were placed in each of the cas to meet the water demands determined by the crop water stress in a way that none of the wells exhibit pumping requirements beyond 3500 m3 d 40 litre s a conventional yield for a typical 5 hp pump in the area in drought years 2015 16 irrigation cycle we suggested pumping activities to span for six months oct mar since the water deficit was higher the pumped water was added back into the system as irrigation and allowed to route through the secondary and tertiary canals and then distributed to irrigate the fields through the field canals just like the reg scenario the total rate of gw pumping during the irrigation years in each ca is shown in table 3 the table also shows the number of pumping wells n in the table header recommended for the scenario furthermore it also reports the gw supply ratio as of surface water irrigation amounts in square brackets historically in this area wells provide a maximum daily yield of about 3500 m3 d the pumping rate within each ca would be constant but they varied in different cas the table shows that in 2015 16 cycle which is following the 2015 drought year the pumping rates are significantly higher at times like this the wells were pumped for a higher amount of time six months oct mar to meet the large water deficit also it may be more feasible to construct more wells than the suggested 22 to withstand extreme drought conditions e g 2015 16 without having to stress the limits of gw pumping from individual wells the reg gw scenario affects the water content and depth of groundwater table gwt which is discussed in the next section 3 3 irrigation effects on subsurface components one of the major significances of the model is its simulation of irrigation and the interactions in the vadose zone understandably the dry season irrigation is expected to increase recharge r decrease depth to gwt increase soil moisture θ and et fig 6 a and b underscores these effects for ca2 where we calibrated the model against csi and crest for the reg scenario fig 6 a indicates that irrigation slightly increases recharge from dec 2011 onward the effects on gwt are difficult to visualize on an area averaged scale but in general gwt depths peak during the jjas period and drop during the dry season ever since the launch of koga irrigation scheme in 2011 the dropping limbs for gwt depths had a slightly reduced slope meaning the drop was slower in fig 6 b we can clearly see the increase of et and θ during irrigation from dec 11 onward this highlights that the effects of irrigation are more prominent in the vadose zone hydrological processes as expected fig 6 c showcases the vertical profiles of soil moisture θ along with effects of pumping in the vadose zone during irrigation for the 2015 16 irrigation cycle averaged in ca2 the profiles with and without pumping are extracted from the reg and reg gw scenarios respectively the solid lines presented in the figure only vertically extend up to the depth of the unsaturated zone simulated by modflow therefore the w pumping profiles are shallow in comparison to the w o pumping profiles in all scenarios the θ profiles start from the left before irrigation dated 9 30 15 and tend to shift right as irrigation commences the soil moisture waves also propagate vertically starting from the near saturation profiles close to the ground surface when irrigation is applied in the beginning of the season which gradually shifts downward with time the profile for 12 31 15 for some portion of the soil layer is seen to be bounded by a θ value of 0 25 m3 m3 this value equals the extinction water content θ w which was found to dominate water content values in december as irrigation ceases by the end of march the θ values near the topsoil drop as soil dries out and the soil profiles at about 5 6 m depth exhibit high moisture content 3 4 the scenario of drought years 2015 16 and 2009 10 from the results presented above we inferred that the time at which significant water food insecurity concerns unfolded were during the drought year of 2015 16 the jjas precipitation of 2015 followed by the dry season spell of 2015 16 in reality the drought of 2015 was followed by a normal close to normal precipitation year during which the effects of reduced precipitation in 2015 on irrigation and consequent subsurface components were partially compensated however in the past this area has experienced prolonged drought spells spanning for 2 3 years e g 1981 84 and 2000 2003 viste et al 2013 we therefore simulated the effects of such an extreme hypothetical scenario by considering 2015 16 and 2009 10 drought years to occur sequentially 3 4 1 water budget components we analyzed some spatiotemporal aspects of the subsurface water budget components soil moisture θ depth of gwt and et simulated by the model we selected some representative months each year for this analysis fig 7 shows the results obtained for the reg scenario where we replaced the 2016 17 cycle with the 2009 10 drought year to underscore the impacts on the hypothetical extreme drought scenario fig 7 a depicts the θ patterns in the model domain specifically highlighting severe dry soil conditions in october 2015 and october 2009 the dry conditions improved from 2017 onward typically october exhibits the lowest soil moisture as the jjas precipitation is ended and irrigation is about to start considering these dry conditions water managers and farmers in the koga area plan for irrigation in the beginning of november fig 7 b shows a similar comparison by visualizing depth of gwt in january to focus on the effects of reduced jjas precipitation the gwt depth closer to the reservoir was more affected during the drought years which is understandable as the reservoir levels are more rapidly affected by precipitation fluctuations as compared to gwt dynamics fig 7 c shows the comparisons for et where it is evident that in 2015 16 and 2009 10 the et values dropped substantially from the analysis it may be inferred that unlike the θ and et variabilities gwt depth in the extreme dry years is impacted with less severity the results underscore the likelihood of crops to undergo critically stressed conditions during extreme dry spells the low values of θ and et will substantially affect the growth of crops and affect the socioeconomic status of local farmers therefore exploring alternative reg gw scenarios for such extreme conditions is of particular interest moreover the subsurface water budget estimates fig 7 provide an interesting insight on the model s ability to replicate hydrologically extreme conditions and their impacts on subsurface water budget components 3 4 2 effects of pumping on gwt from fig 7 we inferred that the effects of drought are locally more severe on θ and et than it is for gwt dynamics as it typically expected in subsurface systems and were able to quantify these effects during such dry spells it is expected that crops would experience significant water stress which would affect their yield furthermore since the gwt depths were still within 10 m range during the extreme scenario we attempted to assess the hydrological feasibility of gw pumping to supplement irrigation nreg gw scenario in order to substantially alleviate water stress fig 8 presents such a comparison showing the gwt dynamics without pumping reg scenario versus with pumping reg gw scenario the figure does not include cas 01 08 and 11 where gw pumping has not been recommended under this scenario discussed in section 3 2 the gw pumping requirement for 2009 10 was calculated in the same way namely estimating water deficit for wheat crop and then adding 20 more that amount through gw pumping the pumping estimate is highly correlated with the potential et for wheat and the irrigation amount the variation of potential et for wheat and the estimated irrigation especially at the canal level did not vary significantly in 2009 10 from 2015 to 16 which is why the calculated gw pumping rates for 2009 10 were almost the same as 2015 16 we implemented extensive gw pumping so that it completely alleviates crop water stress which indicates that it may be hydrologically feasible to withstand such extreme drought conditions by incorporating supplemental irrigation through gw pumping more research is needed to assess the socioeconomic feasibility of such interventions which is beyond the scope of this research fig 8 showcases how gw pumping activity affects the gwt dynamics the change in gwt depth varies for each command area but in general lies within 2 3 m during normal years and 6 7 m during extreme drought years the extreme drought scenario does not substantially affect the gwt depth when there is no pumping activity taking place similar inference was reached from fig 7 b understandably the gwt drops substantially during pumping interestingly however the gwt profiles restore back to normal or close to normal conditions when a normal year commences indicated by 2017 in fig 8 to account for the uncertainty of simulating gwt depths with pumping for this analysis which may depend on the head values specified in the boundaries e g koga reservoir levels and gilgel abay model simulated heads we re produced this analysis by reducing the boundary head values by 2 5 m and 5 m respectively in both scenarios we did not find any noticeable change in gwt depths meaning that the restoration of gwt dynamics back to normal from 2017 onward could indeed be a plausible scenario attributed to increased recharge by precipitation and subsurface leakage from the koga reservoir having said that this phenomenon of gwt restoring back to normal could also be associated with the aquifer properties in the area mostly basaltic with some alluvial and more importantly practicing a sustainable extraction of groundwater in some cases even temporary over abstractions could be a risk for example continuous hydraulic pressure is needed to maintain hydrogeological stability in a dolomite aquifer where unsustainable gw extraction may as well lead to the formation of sink holes nevertheless gw pumping within certain thresholds which are to be designed following a comprehensive study of the underlying aquifer type are always recommended 4 conclusions challenges and future work in this study we implemented a numerical framework to study irrigation management effects on food and water security during hydrologic extremes the framework is based on a local scale gw flow model for the koga irrigation project area specifically focusing on the vadose zone processes we considered three irrigation management scenarios to highlight the viability and effect of different irrigation approaches we also considered an extreme drought scenario by considering that two extreme drought years 2015 16 and 2009 10 occur sequentially for this extreme scenario we analyzed the effects on subsurface water budget components and gwt dynamics for the reg scenario carrying out additional investigation to determine and quantify the effects of extensive pumping during such dry spells this was one of the major findings of the study highlighting the hydrological feasibility of adopting extensive gw pumping to alleviate water food insecurity conditions the socio economic feasibility of the examined extensive pumping prospects was out of scope of the herein study and will be the subject of a future research evaluation of the model against ground observations indicates good model performance at the local scale the simulated h values indicate a substantial physical availability of gw resources which provides water managers with the option to invest in groundwater based irrigation to locally mitigate the effects of extreme drought years with the three irrigation scenarios the availability of irrigation in the remote cas is explored thoroughly for the more realistic irrigation scenario reg discussions presented on θ and et variabilities underscore important aspects of water food insecurity in the area which are functions of wet season jun july august september precipitation induced koga flows and reservoir levels these multifaceted insights of the study could potentially benefit the decision makers efforts for establishing continuous gw monitoring at regional scale llamas and martínez santos 2005 giordano 2009 shah 2010 nelson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 in this research we evaluated three irrigation scenarios based on water stress for wheat which is the principal dry season cereal grown in the area the framework could be used for other crops as well i e wheat maize potatoes cabbages tomatoes peppers etc as long as the suitable crop model dssat can successfully estimate the water requirements for those crops the framework can also be used to estimate crop yields however selecting the optimum irrigation scenario based on crop yield estimates would require more field specific information on fertilizer use crop management labor inputs etc emmanouil et al 2021 yang et al 2021 which were beyond the scope of this research however using the framework in other data scarce areas would require some local field level soil information and crop management guidance the scope of this study also excludes design and implementation details of the gw wells under the reg gw scenario we simply approximated a 20 conveyance loss while estimating gw pumping requirements for all command areas in reality the successful implementation of any scenario would need a comprehensive socio economic analysis on design costs and benefits the numerical framework we used in this study includes one way coupling of crest hydrological model with modflow groundwater model and then of modflow with dssat crop model the framework is solely based on physically based models of which the groundwater model connects the other two there are many other similar models that could be used instead of crest e g swat modflow e g feflow hydrus etc and dssat aquacrop apsim etc however successful use of other models requires calibration with field data and at the same time the models of use should be able to produce the correct output variables both in terms of variable itself and the data format that would be required to force the other models also the groundwater model to be used needs to entail modules packages to simulate vadose zone hydrological processes as modflow uses the 1 d richards equation to simulate vadose zone components niswonger et al 2006 the framework can also be applied to other catchments however the hydrogeological formation of the said catchment needs to be properly investigated and represented into the groundwater model through proper set of parameters for example groundwater modeling in a karst aquifer system would entail calibration of hydraulic parameters by taking into account of the groundwater flow phenomenon through preferential pathways wong et al 2014 in any other irrigated area where the irrigation layout and structural interventions are not well defined application of this framework would be challenging the quality of irrigation water is another attribute that could be significant if the numerical framework is to be deployed in a coastal system where saltwater intrusion in the groundwater is a common issue in such cases use of variable density flow and transport models i e seawat sànchez et al 2015 may be recommended unsustainable extraction of groundwater is another challenge that could be of importance if the method is to be deployed in an urban area where over extraction frequently causes groundwater table to drop too low use of hydrological crest and crop dssat models in other catchments would also need to consider other local conditions that might affect the hydrological and crop processes shen et al 2016 lazin et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the future we plan to apply this model to other interdisciplinary research initiatives at present a water energy food wef nexus based research to design a renewable power microgrid solution for the local area is being carried out in the research we will estimate the electricity demands for the gw pumping for six different crops wheat maize potatoes cabbages tomatoes and peppers based on actual planting data and then will attempt to feed that electricity demand based on a combined solar dry season and river runoff wet season based power generation the growth of avocado is also common in the study area and in the future we may study how the avocado growth can impact the groundwater table in the long run in the current situation groundwater pumping within certain thresholds within 10 m from surface maybe permitted as model simulations suggest in another study we plan to compare the modflow model findings on local water availability and soil moisture with local farmers perspectives on water availability the ethnographic surveys carried out within the framework of a research project in the area provided insight into the social viewpoint of local farmers on what they consider as fair enough water during irrigation managed by water managers such

10029,agriculture in ethiopia has a historical dependency on rainfed wet season and surface water based dry season irrigation projects the performances of which rely heavily on jjas precipitation this is more sensitive in the upper blue nile ubn basin where precipitation uncertainty and hydrological droughts often overshadow the effectiveness of these irrigation schemes challenging the water food security efforts in general to explore this issue we developed a numerical framework based on a groundwater model using modflow nwt coupled with the outputs of the crop model dssat the framework was implemented in an irrigated site namely the koga irrigation scheme located within in the ubn basin ethiopia the coupling of groundwater modelling with crop water modelling in data scarce environments is a key contribution of this work the groundwater model was calibrated with in situ data collected via a citizen science initiative csi for hydraulic head h and soil moisture θ and against a distributed hydrological model crest simulated evapotranspiration et normalized root mean squared error nrmse values of 0 047 0 05 and 0 06 were obtained through calibration for h θ and et respectively the model was specifically used to simulate the vadose zone water availability due to irrigation and water food security aspects associated with extremely dry years we investigated the

introduction food production in africa is highly dependent on rainfed agriculture where the role of irrigation is increasing gradually both at policy and application level you et al 2011 yang et al 2020 ethiopia the second most populous country in africa similarly has a traditionally rainfed dominated agriculture which affects the livelihood of 85 of its population haile and kasa 2015 who may further be adversely affected by seasonal precipitation reductions christensen et al 2007 mohamed 2017 at present there is little to no rainfall during the dry season feb may which may be further exacerbated by climatic uncertainties in the future awulachew et al 2008 mccartney and girma 2012 the country s irrigation potential is estimated at 3 7 million ha of which only about 190 thousand ha is irrigated tesfaye et al 2008 haile and kasa 2015 this pushed the country s interest towards harnessing the potential of local irrigation schemes mostly surface water based to increase dry season crop growth bceom 1999 kebede et al 2006 chebud and melesse 2009 nigussie et al 2019 however droughts in recent years have challenged the upshots of these irrigation schemes which not only affected local water food security but also per capita water availability in general viste et al 2013 funk et al 2016 philip et al 2018 studies suggest that gw in ethiopia with purportedly about 3 6 billion m3 exploitable estimates annually has the potential to substantially address the water and food security issues that are driven by precipitation and climate uncertainties chebud and melesse 2009 kebede 2012 haile and kasa 2015 and at the same time foster human development linked to the water food and energy wfe nexus gaye and tindimugaya 2012 in this study we deployed a numerical framework to assess the potential of gw based irrigation to address water shortages through a better understanding of the vadose zone water availability in irrigated areas we implemented and calibrated a modflow model specifically focusing on an irrigated site named the koga irrigation scheme located within the ubn region of ethiopia we used the modular 3 d finite difference modflow model with nwt solver modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 and the unsaturated zone package the model was forced with daily distributed hydrological variables infiltration and evapotranspiration demand simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model recently developed for the upper blue nile basin lazin et al 2020 previous modeling studies indicated a substantial amount of physical availability of gw resources in the ubn region khadim et al 2020b khadim et al 2020b assessed shallow gw availability in the koga area our study area which has potential to aid in supplementing irrigation during periods of low rainfall driven by this this research focuses on the assessment of vadose zone water availability following irrigation and compares with a process based model dssat simulated crop water requirement the calibrated modflow model is used in this study to investigate different irrigation scenarios aimed at improving water food security by reducing crop water stress through adequate water use this numerical investigation also evaluated the prospects of using gw to supplement surface water based irrigation during extreme drought years water stress can be defined as a situation in which plant s normal functions are interfered by the shortage of water transported and distributed through transpiration bal et al 2018 improving water productivity in the dry season by alleviating crop water stress is a major concern in the study area alemayehu 2014 to overcome such challenge understanding the relationship between water deficit and yield of certain crops is the key to increase food production with limited water resources howell 2001 lavergne et al 2019 process based gw and crop yield models can aid decision making for achieving enhanced water use efficiency especially in semiarid regions like ethiopia xiang et al 2020 studies have showcased applications of numerical models to support decision making pertaining to improved water food security one approach is to infer decision making strategies solely from a gw simulation perspective often neglecting crop specific water demands ebraheem et al 2003 dawoud et al 2005 mao et al 2005 mylopoulos et al 2007 hanson et al 2010 wada et al 2012 there exist agronomic model based approaches that simulate interactions between crop physiology weather and management on one dimensional soil profiles but do not consider dynamic gw processes yang et al 2006 wu et al 2015 even though approaches that employ coupled gw and crop models to improve water food security have been applied before bulatewicz et al 2010 varela ortega et al 2011 xu et al 2012 hadded et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 these approaches had focused on large scale processes not field scale crop physiology based interactions with dynamic gw conditions in a recent study xiang et al 2020 demonstrated advanced field scale coupling of modflow dssat where the two models are linked interchangeably by exchanging interdependent crop and dynamic gw specific information and simulating the models separately the coupling mechanism of modflow with dssat in our research is similar to some extent to this research xiang et al 2020 however in our study we initially forced the modflow model with more realistic infiltration values comprising actual in situ irrigation during dry season combined with the jjas precipitation induced infiltration simulated by another hydrological model crest lazin et al 2020 this way the modeling approach presented in this research is more integrated and links a land surface hydrological model crest with a physically based groundwater model that is driven by in situ irrigation data with a process based crop model with crop specific physiographic details the calibration approach we attempted in this study i e calibrating an unsaturated gw flow model against three distinctive but hydrologically connected variables namely hydraulic head h soil moisture θ and evapotranspiration et adds substantial complexity in our model this is also a scientific challenge as to the timeline of this research we did not find any literature attempting the same more specifically the scientific contributions of this research are the following a novel numerical framework integrating multiple models to aid farm scale decision making on irrigation management b extensive calibration of the modflow model through fine tuning a set of hydrogeological parameters using data collected from a local citizen science initiative as well as estimates simulated from fine resolution hydrological models crest which itself brings robustness in the model performance to represent reality and c conceptualizing irrigation scenarios by considering the qualitative ethnographic information on local irrigation management the numerical framework adopted in this study has the potential to be implemented in other economically sensitive surface water based irrigated areas where existing practices to achieve sustainable water food security are often challenged with growing hydroclimatic uncertainties the approach to couple different sectoral models in this study can also be carried out in other data scarce developing countries with some field specific soil and crop management inputs the broader aim of this numerical framework is to benefit farmers agronomists and water managers who constitute the principal user group the understanding of soil wetness and crop water stress for the three different scenarios in each command area would essentially help the farmers to make decisions on crop types and planting dates furthermore this information would allow water managers to foresee the broader food security impacts and release irrigation water in a timely manner whereas it would help the agronomists to convey accurate estimates on dry season crop water requirements it is noteworthy that the numerical framework presented here is already being used to benefit the aforementioned user groups from ethiopia by providing seasonal water and crop forecasts from 2018 under an nsf water and food security initiative nsf pire 2020 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area this numerical framework was implemented in the koga irrigation scheme ethiopia 11 37 n and 37 12 e coordinates it is one of the biggest irrigation schemes in north central ethiopia designed to irrigate approximately 7000 ha of agriculture land by releasing water during dry season from the koga reservoir mott macdonald 2008 the irrigation scheme completed in 2011 lijalem 2018 mulugeta 2019 is operated through non optimized guiding curves based on reservoir water level volume and irrigable lands where the end decision heavily depends on the operator s judgment mott macdonald 2008 birhanu et al 2014 with about a decade of operations the irrigation scheme either due to management or water availability issues typically reaches less than 73 5 of design capacity birhanu et al 2014 this limitation on water availability along with crop water stress have often led to local food insecurity alemayehu 2014 the koga reservoir is created through a dam across the koga river which is one of the major tributaries of the gilgel abay river the gilgel abay river eventually discharges into lake tana a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake at the source of the upper blue nile river wood and talling 1988 the horizontal spatial domain of the model comprises 9000 ha of which 7000 ha is the design irrigation coverage area lijalem 2018 spreading through 12 command areas one for each secondary canal fig 1 a shows the location of the project area the irrigation structures used in the model existing geological landforms kebede 2012 and the locations of gw wells and soil moisture data used in model calibration topography of the area was found to vary from 1829 to 2278 m amsl about 70 90 of the annual rainfall occurs in the jjas months abdo et al 2009 abiyu and alamirew 2015 the historical annual rainfall variations along with the crest lazin et al 2020 simulated flow in the koga area are shown in fig 1 b the flow simulations indicate that the area suffered from two severe droughts in 2009 and 2015 the first one before the construction of koga project in 2011 2 2 data the study domain topography was generated from the 90 m dem yamazaki et al 2017 information on hydrogeology is conceptualized based on literature review hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 khadim et al 2020b discussed in section 2 3 1 the modflow model was forced with 12 years 2008 2019 of daily infiltration and et demands simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 crest model itself is forced with seven meteorological variables precipitation air temperature air pressure longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity and wind speed which are obtained from different reanalysis and satellite data sources e g mswep v1 and nasa s imerg for precipitation and ecmwf era interim and noaa s gdas for the other variables specific details on crest model performance parameters and other technicalities are available in lazin et al 2020 gwt depths at five shallow gw wells located in the command area 2 ca02 in fig 1 were monitored at weekly intervals from june 2017 to august 2019 as part of a citizen science initiative csi jointly operated by the university of connecticut uconn and bahir dar university bu dokou et al 2018 khadim et al 2020b the csi also entails tdr soil moisture measurements at nine different locations from october 2017 to august 2019 these data are used to calibrate the groundwater model for hydraulic head h and soil moisture θ we collected borehole log data from abay basin authority aba for one well situated in the downstream of the koga irrigation scheme we also obtained daily dry season reservoir levels starting july 2012 to august 2019 reservoir releases irrigation canal types and layout canal geometry design flow capacity along with some general guidance pertaining to field scale practices on koga reservoir and structural operations from the aba in may 2018 and june 2019 the research team carried out a couple of weeklong field investigations at the study area which along with qualitative ethnographic information collected as part of nsf pire water and food security project nsf pire 2020 helped conceptualizing a set of irrigation scenarios considered during the groundwater model application 2 3 numerical framework details the numerical framework comprises three major components first the field scale calibration of a modflow model forced with in situ irrigation information and crest simulated land surface variables infiltration and et demand second the consideration of three irrigation scenarios to analyze irrigation estimates third to estimate crop water stress by comparing the modflow model simulated root water uptake with dssat simulated potential transpiration using a major cereal crop wheat cultivated in the dry season dssat estimates crop specific potential transpiration based on crop type growth management input as well as climate data on the other hand modflow simulates 3 d root water uptake considering more irrigation details which includes canal layout canal geometry daily irrigation releases canal operations etc it is noteworthy that the root water uptake could also be simulated by dssat but considering modflow s better representation of local details irrigation structures and mechanism as well as the grid based 3 d spatial outputs the latter was used to compensate the effects of crop specific details in modflow we used the crop extinction water content and extinction depth as calibration parameters which were adjusted during calibration the irrigation scenarios we considered in this study are a non regulated nreg where we consider the gates of all irrigation canals to stay open during the entire irrigation season b regulated reg where we considered a pseudo optimized alternative for the frequency of the irrigation canal operations which takes into account ethnographic input from the field and c regulated with groundwater pumping reg gw which is the reg scenario with added gw pumping to supplement irrigation we focused on the understanding of water stress for these three scenarios and specifically assessed for the reg gw scenario a hypothetical consecutive occurrence of two extreme drought years 2015 and 2009 this scenario was chosen to explore whether it would be hydrologically sustainable to alleviate the effects of severe droughts on water food security by harnessing gw for supplemental irrigation the modflow model used in this study was based on a 200 m horizontal grid and a 12 hourly temporal resolution fig 2 shows a process diagram that highlights key activities of this research 2 3 1 conceptual model the conceptual model is inspired from khadim et al 2020b in terms of aquifers and boundaries enhanced by the inclusion of a thin layer on top to add more details while simulating the vadose zone the vertical discretization used in the model is as follows from top a topsoil thickness of 6 m a gravel fractured basalt layer of 15 m followed by a fractured basalt layer of 200 m and a sedimentary formation of about 4 km thickness the topsoil and basalt sequence thicknesses are derived based on the bore log information provided by aba for that area overall the stratigraphic assembly considered in this groundwater model is consistent with available literature hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 fig 1 c showed the vertical discretization considered in the model the koga irrigation scheme allows water from the reservoir to be conveyed through a 19 7 km main canal 12 lined secondary canals 52 km supported by 11 night storage reservoirs nsrs 156 km of tertiary canals 905 km of quaternary canals followed by field canals lijalem 2018 in our model we incorporated the structures up to the tertiary canals and simulated flows entering each secondary canal based on in situ reservoir release information to implement field scale irrigation we then converted these flows m3 d into vertical infiltration m d by dividing the estimates by their respective command areas and a 20 conveyance loss in irrigation canals which is consistent with local literature aseres et al 2019 then we combined this irrigation driven infiltration dry season with crest simulated infiltration to force the groundwater model we applied the irrigation for 12 hour spans representing daytime irrigation in our model we did not include the nsrs to avoid computational complexities since their exact hydrological interaction with the rest of the structures is very much dependent on operative judgments which are difficult to incorporate into the model in addition to the irrigation we specified in situ koga reservoir levels as boundaries along the south east border of the model domain which allowed a one way exchange of subsurface flow into the aquifer system the conceptual model of fig 1 c shows the major recharge discharge processes considered in the model 2 3 2 numerical model modflow nwt a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow was applied using the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 coupled with unsaturated flow using the modflow uzf package niswonger et al 2006 the uzf package uses the method of characteristics to solve a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation to simulate vertical 1d unsaturated flow we used the uzf package to simulate recharge using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1966 in the uppermost active cell based on specified maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone this process routes infiltrated water through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table of the uppermost active cell niswonger et al 2006 the uzf package was also used to simulate evapotranspiration et in the unsaturated zone the evapotranspiration rate depends on the amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone above a specified depth extinction depth and the specified et demand based on the uzf package formulation et can also be supplied by gw when the water table is above the specified extinction depth niswonger et al 2006 the model s consideration for irrigation return flow occurs both in terms of surface and groundwater flow the provided irrigation amount is used to meet the specified et demand and to retain soil moisture in the vadose zone while the remainder eventually reaches the groundwater table as recharge niswonger et al 2006 in case the groundwater table rises above the irrigation canal bed water will be available for the irrigation canals as leakage which is more prominent in the earthen tertiary canals due to their permeable bed material niswonger and prudic 2005 the model simulates the flow in the unsaturated zone by solving the 1 d richards equation in the vertical direction and therefore does not capture interflow which is defined as the lateral movement of water into the canals through the unsaturated zone carroll et al 2019 even in the cases of over irrigation the additional flow will first reach the groundwater table as recharge and then revert back to the irrigation canals as leakage as there were no overland runoff options specified in the model in our study area the irrigation system is always expected to be under water deficit and therefore cases of over irrigation are not applicable the model was simulated in transient conditions from january 2008 through august 2019 at 12 hourly temporal scale adding distinctions between days nights irrigation was added into the model starting with the 2011 2012 irrigation season october april after the start of the koga irrigation project s completion and the time before that is considered as warm up period for the model the model comprised four vertical layers aquifers the top three were specified as convertible in the model and the bottom aquifer was set as confined the horizontal spatial resolution of the model was 200 m generating 116 rows and 77 columns of model cells in each vertical layer to create the input files for the model we first used the usgs s open source gui model muse version 3 10 winston and goode 2017 afterwards we used flopy version 3 2 10 an open source python api bakker et al 2016 to update the input parameters during model simulations which include calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions we derived the initial condition of the model from a steady state simulated h profile which is a convenient approach found in literature franke et al 1987 bagtzoglou 2003a 2003b reilly and harbaugh 2004 we considered dirichlet boundary condition type i in the downstream and upstream ends of the model in the downstream end we used the h values simulated by a regional scale groundwater model developed in the gilgel abay basin khadim et al 2020b and in the upstream end we used in situ reservoir levels obtained from aba we used the time variant specified head chd package to specify this boundary condition everywhere else east and west sides of the model we considered a no flow condition the locations of the type i boundaries are shown in fig 1 a the unmarked boundaries indicate no flow conditions during the scenario of gw pumping we used the neumann boundary type ii to specify pumping rates in artificially placed wells through well package wel using the crop physiography and weather data dssat first simulated the potential transpiration for the wheat crop alternatively we simulated the root water uptake with modflow using the methodology prescribed in niswonger 2020 we then subtracted the root water uptake by modflow from the potential transpiration by dssat and the remaining balance was defined as crop water stress the pumping rates assigned in the wel package were derived from this estimated crop water stress amount with an additional 20 accounted for different types of losses we used mixed boundary conditions type iii while specifying irrigation in the main canal using the streamflow routing package sfr and then simulated the flow reaching the rest of the canal system the sfr package routs the flow in a stream instantaneously to the downstream reach while also simulating the unsaturated flow beneath the streams niswonger and prudic 2005 all the boundary conditions as well as the modflow packages used in the model are summarized in table 1 2 3 4 evaluation framework the modflow model was calibrated using a trial and error based approach with the objective of sequentially minimizing the summation of normalized root mean squared error nrmse of these three variables a modflow simulated heads with in situ gw wells from csi data five wells b modflow simulated soil moisture with in situ tdr soil moisture obtained from csi data nine locations and c modflow simulated et with crest simulated et basin averaged below we describe the calibration steps while calibrating θ we averaged the soil moisture model simulations in the top 20 cm thickness of soil which is the same depth for the tdr measurements collected as part of the csi in the case of et we considered evaluating against crest due to its fine spatiotemporal resolution 90 m hourly and improved et representation in the upper blue nile region over other models lazin et al 2020 while simulating et with the modflow uzf package the et demands were set equal to the reference et obtained from crest lazin et al 2020 which uses the penman monteith equation allen et al 1994a b scaled by a crop coefficient suitable for aerodynamically rough crops in the koga area suggested by senay et al 2013 in order to compare the two models in terms of et we removed the irrigation component from our modflow model as crest simulations do not consider any irrigation also we aggregated the crest et values into 12 hourly data and 200 m spatial resolution to match our model resolution the inclusion of et as a calibration target was important in our modeling effort as we aim to use this model to simulate the root water uptake to assess water stress which is essentially equivalent to the actual transpiration simulated by modflow niswonger 2020 the parameters we used to calibrate the modflow model are aquifer hydraulic conductivity k 1 streambed hydraulic conductivity k 2 specific storage s s specific yield s y maximum vertical hydraulic conductivity in the vadose zone k z max brooks corey coefficient ϵ extinction water content θ w and extinction depth d w the storage coefficients s s and s y are used for confined and unconfined aquifers respectively the definitions of these parameters are available in the modflow nwt and uzf documentation niswonger et al 2006 2011 as well as other literature lohman 1972 heath 1982 as a starting point we set the initial k 1 s y and s s values during the trial and error calibration equal to calibration values obtained in khadim et al 2020b the values are as follows k 1 as 20 m d for the top three aquifers and 0 5 m d for the bottom aquifer s y unconfined aquifers as 0 08 and s s confined aquifers as 10 6 m 1 for the other parameters we implied literature based understanding and started with the following initial values k 2 1 m d k z max 1 m d ϵ 3 5 θ w 0 3 and d w 1 m all these calibration parameters were adjusted during calibration until the best fit in terms of all calibration target variables h θ et was obtained the calibration was attempted in two different tiers first we calibrated the model for h by adjusting the parameter values of k 1 k 2 s s s y k z max and ϵ considering their increased sensitivity with h guzman et al 2015 asrie and sebhat 2016 after this first tier of calibration we fixed k 1 and s s and used the latest values of k 2 s y k z max and ϵ as initial values for next trial and error iteration second we calibrated the model for θ and et by running several iterations through adjusting values of k 2 s y k z max ϵ θ w and d w in each iteration these parameters are crucial in the vadose zone flow dynamics and significantly influence θ and et estimates at the end of calibration we performed sensitivity tests by multiplying the calibrated parameters with different multipliers typically ranging from 0 1 to 2 and re running the model we performed the sensitivity tests for four major calibration parameters e g k 1 s y k z max and d w the first three of which as per the experience we gained during this modeling endeavor substantially affect all the three calibration variables h θ et while the last parameter d w substantially affects both θ and et 2 3 5 overview of crop model dssat the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a compound crop modeling and decision making tool that simulates the growth development and yield of 42 crops under the prescribed weather soil and management information jones et al 2003 it conducts the crop simulations as a function of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics and updates the water carbon and nitrogen balance at daily step hoogenboom et al 2012 so far dssat has been applied for a wide range of research objectives consisting climate impact assessments water use management breeding selection etc at local and regional scales araya et al 2017 ramirez villegas et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2019 yang et al 2020 past studies also indicated that the combination of dssat and a variety of hydrologic and groundwater models including modflow and crest could provide a better understanding of the relationship between water and crops shelia et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 in dssat water stress is activated when potential root water uptake supply equals or is less than potential transpiration demand and is conceptualized as the ratio of the two factors bal et al 2018 when it is active plant growth and physiological processes will be impeded in this study dssat model was driven by the same climate forcing data as modflow and crest abovementioned the soil properties such as drained upper limit dul saturated soil water content sat and lower limit ll were obtained from the global high resolution soil profile database for crop modeling applications version 2 5 international research institute for climate and society iri et al 2015 derived from soilgrids and isric afsis hengl et al 2014 han et al 2015 the observational crop yield data from 2004 to 2013 with missing years of 2005 and 2006 were derived from ethiopia s annual agricultural sample survey agss we calibrated the cultivar genotype coefficients of wheat based on the observed yield aiming at minimizing the long term crop yield bias the detailed calibration process can be referred to yang et al 2020 2 4 irrigation scenarios following the calibration of the groundwater model we applied the model to simulate the spatial distribution of irrigation by considering three irrigation scenarios the scenarios are a non regulated nreg b regulated reg and c regulated and gw pumping reg gw in all these scenarios in situ data on reservoir releases q mc is specified at the start of the main canal which follows along through the different connected irrigation canals and hence flows entering each of the command areas are simulated with the modflow sfr package niswonger and prudic 2005 the nreg scenario assumes no control on gate operations i e when water is released from the reservoir it is considered that the gates controlling the secondary and tertiary canals remain open and water enters those canals without any additional control flow in each secondary and tertiary canal is restricted solely by their design capacity q sc tc max this is a scenario which does not completely represent what happens in the field however due to paucity of field scale information and the uncertainty in canal operations invoked by dependency on the operator s judgement this is a plausible scenario of resource management the reg scenario is a pseudo optimal alternative where we scaled the gate opening hours for secondary and tertiary canals to allow flow q sc tc where q sc tc q mc q mc max q sc tc max the variable q mc is the flow released from the main canal and q mc max is the peak release for that irrigation year from the field scale information obtained from the ethnographic surveys carried out as part of the project we came to know that in reality farmers and water managers do attempt to manage the gate operations of secondary and tertiary canals based on how much water is released from the source in that sense the reg scenario provides an improved understanding on field scale water management by incorporating these qualitative ethnographic details into the physical simulation of irrigation routing using modflow as such we used the reg scenario as the default field case in some of the analysis section 3 3 for example the reg gw is a hypothetical scenario we considered to envisage a system in which gw is pumped to provide supplemental irrigation in addition to the gate operated flow received through the reg scenario for this purpose we first estimated the crop water stress for wheat in each command area as the difference between dssat simulated potential transpiration and modflow simulated root water uptake or actual transpiration afterwards we placed a number of hypothetical gw wells in each of the command areas cas to carry out gw pumping at a rate that would allow the inclusion of enough water to completely alleviate crop water stress during the irrigation season the pumping rate for supplemental irrigation was considered as equal to the water deficit calculated following the above mentioned procedure plus another 20 considered to account for conveyance loss evaporation resource mismanagement structural damages etc 2 5 extreme hypothetical drought scenario analysis 2015 16 and 2009 10 to create a hydrologically extreme drought condition and assess the impacts of such sustained dry spells on the gw table and other subsurface hydrological components we used the numerical framework to investigate a hypothetical case where the 2015 16 drought year is successively followed by another drought year 2009 10 the second severe drought year 2009 10 was selected based on historical flows simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 this selection of 2009 10 as the second extreme year is also supported by recent studies viste et al 2013 for 2009 10 year we used real values of infiltration and e t demands simulated by crest just like any other year moreover the irrigation release amount for 2009 10 year was estimated based on crest simulated flow in koga and the release pattern was the same as 2015 16 year which exhibits a water management approach suitable for dry conditions the simulation for this hypothetical extreme scenario was carried out initially for the reg scenario we also assessed the effects of extensive pumping in the groundwater table gwt reg gw scenario for this hypothetical extreme scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater model performance 3 1 1 final calibration parameters following the trial and error based calibration procedure discussed in section 2 3 4 evaluation framework we fixed the values of the calibration parameters the final calibration parameter values are presented in table 2 most of the parameters were assumed to be homogeneous along the x y spatial direction which may be justified by the field scale emphasis of the model and the limitation that all calibration measurements are available in the second command area ca2 3 1 2 model evaluation the comparison of the model simulated variables h and θ against in situ citizen science data is shown in fig 3 a and b the monthly boxplots fig 3 a reveal a good agreement of model simulated h estimates with the csi data this can be affirmed by the means of the two data sets falling close except november and december and the substantial overlap in data ranges for all months the nrmse obtained for h evaluation was 0 047 p value 0 01 the θ comparisons reveal a good fit for the wet season between observed and simulated values exhibiting a cluster of outliers for the dry season especially in 2019 where the csi data was surprisingly low this maybe associated due to the uncertainties in irrigation management and without having exact information on irrigation management at hydraulic structure level the model cannot produce an impeccable match the nrmse for θ evaluation for the entire sampling period was 0 05 p value 0 01 which was about 27 of the range of tdr samples fig 3 c shows the modflow simulated et against the crest simulated et the nrmse obtained for et was 0 06 p value 0 01 the two profiles exhibit some disagreement during the dry season even though irrigation was removed from the modflow simulations while calibrating against crest et this may be attributed to the sophisticated methodology of simulating subsurface flow in modflow which better captures the subsurface flow in the dry season in the form of baseflow also the et simulation mechanisms in crest and modflow are different as crest follows an energy budget driven mechanism whereas modflow relies on a water budget based approach even though these distinctions lead to occasional differences in et patterns the cumulative profiles are in most cases in agreement the modflow simulations on the other hand indicate to be less sensitive over such forcing changes and hence mildly indicate a reduced uncertainty propagation 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis we performed a set of single parameter sensitivity tests by selecting calibration parameters e g k 1 s y k z max and d w and the results are presented in fig 4 the figure infers that the final parameters obtained after adopting the trial and error based calibration were in most cases the best fit for the model in terms of reducing nrmse in some cases not all calibration variables agree with the calibrated parameter set e g the combination shown for parameter multiplier 1 0 in fig 4 especially for fig 4 c θ profile was clearly better for parameter multiplier 0 5 however for that set of parameters the other two calibration variables were well off and because of parameter interactions adjusting one parameter would not only affect the variable of interest but the entire model therefore we had to compromise in some cases the optimal solution for one particular variable in order to get an integrated solution that represents a good fit for all variables in general the θ was found to be the most sensitive parameter during calibration 3 2 flow availability and water stress in various irrigation scenarios this section summarizes the model applications to simulate irrigation for the three irrigation scenarios the difference between nreg and reg scenarios is the distribution of irrigation flow in the nreg scenario more flow is allowed in the nearby command areas cas leaving the farther cas water deprived this situation is more pronounced during drought years fig 5 a shows the comparison of irrigation flows for the 2015 16 irrigation cycle followed by the 2015 drought entering each ca in the nreg and reg scenarios the figure depicts that in the nreg scenario a number of cas located far from the reservoir receive little to no water ca 7 12 the reg scenario compromises water availability in the nearby cas and makes sure that all cas receive substantial amount of water fig 5 b shows the annual average water deficit of potential dssat and actual modflow transpiration obtained for the three irrigation scenarios in all 12 command areas the figure highlights the contribution of distributed flow in the reg scenario over the nreg scenario the total amount of annual water deficit for 2012 19 in the nreg and reg scenarios are estimated as 0 72 and 0 63 mm3 respectively the reg gw scenario indeed results in the least water deficit totaling 0 05 mm3 yr this is understandable since in this scenario we pump gw to provide as supplemental irrigation to compensate the water deficit observed in the reg scenario in the reg gw scenario we placed a total of 22 hypothetical wells into the model and allowed pumping for four months nov feb during the regular irrigation season the number of wells 22 is based on the total pumping requirement which is 20 higher than the amount of water stress the 22 pumping wells were placed in nine command areas cas except ca1 ca8 and ca11 we inferred from our modeling attempts in the nreg and reg scenarios that wheat grown in ca1 ca8 and ca11 experience very little to no water stress and gw pumping would not be needed approximately 2 4 wells were placed in each of the cas to meet the water demands determined by the crop water stress in a way that none of the wells exhibit pumping requirements beyond 3500 m3 d 40 litre s a conventional yield for a typical 5 hp pump in the area in drought years 2015 16 irrigation cycle we suggested pumping activities to span for six months oct mar since the water deficit was higher the pumped water was added back into the system as irrigation and allowed to route through the secondary and tertiary canals and then distributed to irrigate the fields through the field canals just like the reg scenario the total rate of gw pumping during the irrigation years in each ca is shown in table 3 the table also shows the number of pumping wells n in the table header recommended for the scenario furthermore it also reports the gw supply ratio as of surface water irrigation amounts in square brackets historically in this area wells provide a maximum daily yield of about 3500 m3 d the pumping rate within each ca would be constant but they varied in different cas the table shows that in 2015 16 cycle which is following the 2015 drought year the pumping rates are significantly higher at times like this the wells were pumped for a higher amount of time six months oct mar to meet the large water deficit also it may be more feasible to construct more wells than the suggested 22 to withstand extreme drought conditions e g 2015 16 without having to stress the limits of gw pumping from individual wells the reg gw scenario affects the water content and depth of groundwater table gwt which is discussed in the next section 3 3 irrigation effects on subsurface components one of the major significances of the model is its simulation of irrigation and the interactions in the vadose zone understandably the dry season irrigation is expected to increase recharge r decrease depth to gwt increase soil moisture θ and et fig 6 a and b underscores these effects for ca2 where we calibrated the model against csi and crest for the reg scenario fig 6 a indicates that irrigation slightly increases recharge from dec 2011 onward the effects on gwt are difficult to visualize on an area averaged scale but in general gwt depths peak during the jjas period and drop during the dry season ever since the launch of koga irrigation scheme in 2011 the dropping limbs for gwt depths had a slightly reduced slope meaning the drop was slower in fig 6 b we can clearly see the increase of et and θ during irrigation from dec 11 onward this highlights that the effects of irrigation are more prominent in the vadose zone hydrological processes as expected fig 6 c showcases the vertical profiles of soil moisture θ along with effects of pumping in the vadose zone during irrigation for the 2015 16 irrigation cycle averaged in ca2 the profiles with and without pumping are extracted from the reg and reg gw scenarios respectively the solid lines presented in the figure only vertically extend up to the depth of the unsaturated zone simulated by modflow therefore the w pumping profiles are shallow in comparison to the w o pumping profiles in all scenarios the θ profiles start from the left before irrigation dated 9 30 15 and tend to shift right as irrigation commences the soil moisture waves also propagate vertically starting from the near saturation profiles close to the ground surface when irrigation is applied in the beginning of the season which gradually shifts downward with time the profile for 12 31 15 for some portion of the soil layer is seen to be bounded by a θ value of 0 25 m3 m3 this value equals the extinction water content θ w which was found to dominate water content values in december as irrigation ceases by the end of march the θ values near the topsoil drop as soil dries out and the soil profiles at about 5 6 m depth exhibit high moisture content 3 4 the scenario of drought years 2015 16 and 2009 10 from the results presented above we inferred that the time at which significant water food insecurity concerns unfolded were during the drought year of 2015 16 the jjas precipitation of 2015 followed by the dry season spell of 2015 16 in reality the drought of 2015 was followed by a normal close to normal precipitation year during which the effects of reduced precipitation in 2015 on irrigation and consequent subsurface components were partially compensated however in the past this area has experienced prolonged drought spells spanning for 2 3 years e g 1981 84 and 2000 2003 viste et al 2013 we therefore simulated the effects of such an extreme hypothetical scenario by considering 2015 16 and 2009 10 drought years to occur sequentially 3 4 1 water budget components we analyzed some spatiotemporal aspects of the subsurface water budget components soil moisture θ depth of gwt and et simulated by the model we selected some representative months each year for this analysis fig 7 shows the results obtained for the reg scenario where we replaced the 2016 17 cycle with the 2009 10 drought year to underscore the impacts on the hypothetical extreme drought scenario fig 7 a depicts the θ patterns in the model domain specifically highlighting severe dry soil conditions in october 2015 and october 2009 the dry conditions improved from 2017 onward typically october exhibits the lowest soil moisture as the jjas precipitation is ended and irrigation is about to start considering these dry conditions water managers and farmers in the koga area plan for irrigation in the beginning of november fig 7 b shows a similar comparison by visualizing depth of gwt in january to focus on the effects of reduced jjas precipitation the gwt depth closer to the reservoir was more affected during the drought years which is understandable as the reservoir levels are more rapidly affected by precipitation fluctuations as compared to gwt dynamics fig 7 c shows the comparisons for et where it is evident that in 2015 16 and 2009 10 the et values dropped substantially from the analysis it may be inferred that unlike the θ and et variabilities gwt depth in the extreme dry years is impacted with less severity the results underscore the likelihood of crops to undergo critically stressed conditions during extreme dry spells the low values of θ and et will substantially affect the growth of crops and affect the socioeconomic status of local farmers therefore exploring alternative reg gw scenarios for such extreme conditions is of particular interest moreover the subsurface water budget estimates fig 7 provide an interesting insight on the model s ability to replicate hydrologically extreme conditions and their impacts on subsurface water budget components 3 4 2 effects of pumping on gwt from fig 7 we inferred that the effects of drought are locally more severe on θ and et than it is for gwt dynamics as it typically expected in subsurface systems and were able to quantify these effects during such dry spells it is expected that crops would experience significant water stress which would affect their yield furthermore since the gwt depths were still within 10 m range during the extreme scenario we attempted to assess the hydrological feasibility of gw pumping to supplement irrigation nreg gw scenario in order to substantially alleviate water stress fig 8 presents such a comparison showing the gwt dynamics without pumping reg scenario versus with pumping reg gw scenario the figure does not include cas 01 08 and 11 where gw pumping has not been recommended under this scenario discussed in section 3 2 the gw pumping requirement for 2009 10 was calculated in the same way namely estimating water deficit for wheat crop and then adding 20 more that amount through gw pumping the pumping estimate is highly correlated with the potential et for wheat and the irrigation amount the variation of potential et for wheat and the estimated irrigation especially at the canal level did not vary significantly in 2009 10 from 2015 to 16 which is why the calculated gw pumping rates for 2009 10 were almost the same as 2015 16 we implemented extensive gw pumping so that it completely alleviates crop water stress which indicates that it may be hydrologically feasible to withstand such extreme drought conditions by incorporating supplemental irrigation through gw pumping more research is needed to assess the socioeconomic feasibility of such interventions which is beyond the scope of this research fig 8 showcases how gw pumping activity affects the gwt dynamics the change in gwt depth varies for each command area but in general lies within 2 3 m during normal years and 6 7 m during extreme drought years the extreme drought scenario does not substantially affect the gwt depth when there is no pumping activity taking place similar inference was reached from fig 7 b understandably the gwt drops substantially during pumping interestingly however the gwt profiles restore back to normal or close to normal conditions when a normal year commences indicated by 2017 in fig 8 to account for the uncertainty of simulating gwt depths with pumping for this analysis which may depend on the head values specified in the boundaries e g koga reservoir levels and gilgel abay model simulated heads we re produced this analysis by reducing the boundary head values by 2 5 m and 5 m respectively in both scenarios we did not find any noticeable change in gwt depths meaning that the restoration of gwt dynamics back to normal from 2017 onward could indeed be a plausible scenario attributed to increased recharge by precipitation and subsurface leakage from the koga reservoir having said that this phenomenon of gwt restoring back to normal could also be associated with the aquifer properties in the area mostly basaltic with some alluvial and more importantly practicing a sustainable extraction of groundwater in some cases even temporary over abstractions could be a risk for example continuous hydraulic pressure is needed to maintain hydrogeological stability in a dolomite aquifer where unsustainable gw extraction may as well lead to the formation of sink holes nevertheless gw pumping within certain thresholds which are to be designed following a comprehensive study of the underlying aquifer type are always recommended 4 conclusions challenges and future work in this study we implemented a numerical framework to study irrigation management effects on food and water security during hydrologic extremes the framework is based on a local scale gw flow model for the koga irrigation project area specifically focusing on the vadose zone processes we considered three irrigation management scenarios to highlight the viability and effect of different irrigation approaches we also considered an extreme drought scenario by considering that two extreme drought years 2015 16 and 2009 10 occur sequentially for this extreme scenario we analyzed the effects on subsurface water budget components and gwt dynamics for the reg scenario carrying out additional investigation to determine and quantify the effects of extensive pumping during such dry spells this was one of the major findings of the study highlighting the hydrological feasibility of adopting extensive gw pumping to alleviate water food insecurity conditions the socio economic feasibility of the examined extensive pumping prospects was out of scope of the herein study and will be the subject of a future research evaluation of the model against ground observations indicates good model performance at the local scale the simulated h values indicate a substantial physical availability of gw resources which provides water managers with the option to invest in groundwater based irrigation to locally mitigate the effects of extreme drought years with the three irrigation scenarios the availability of irrigation in the remote cas is explored thoroughly for the more realistic irrigation scenario reg discussions presented on θ and et variabilities underscore important aspects of water food insecurity in the area which are functions of wet season jun july august september precipitation induced koga flows and reservoir levels these multifaceted insights of the study could potentially benefit the decision makers efforts for establishing continuous gw monitoring at regional scale llamas and martínez santos 2005 giordano 2009 shah 2010 nelson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 in this research we evaluated three irrigation scenarios based on water stress for wheat which is the principal dry season cereal grown in the area the framework could be used for other crops as well i e wheat maize potatoes cabbages tomatoes peppers etc as long as the suitable crop model dssat can successfully estimate the water requirements for those crops the framework can also be used to estimate crop yields however selecting the optimum irrigation scenario based on crop yield estimates would require more field specific information on fertilizer use crop management labor inputs etc emmanouil et al 2021 yang et al 2021 which were beyond the scope of this research however using the framework in other data scarce areas would require some local field level soil information and crop management guidance the scope of this study also excludes design and implementation details of the gw wells under the reg gw scenario we simply approximated a 20 conveyance loss while estimating gw pumping requirements for all command areas in reality the successful implementation of any scenario would need a comprehensive socio economic analysis on design costs and benefits the numerical framework we used in this study includes one way coupling of crest hydrological model with modflow groundwater model and then of modflow with dssat crop model the framework is solely based on physically based models of which the groundwater model connects the other two there are many other similar models that could be used instead of crest e g swat modflow e g feflow hydrus etc and dssat aquacrop apsim etc however successful use of other models requires calibration with field data and at the same time the models of use should be able to produce the correct output variables both in terms of variable itself and the data format that would be required to force the other models also the groundwater model to be used needs to entail modules packages to simulate vadose zone hydrological processes as modflow uses the 1 d richards equation to simulate vadose zone components niswonger et al 2006 the framework can also be applied to other catchments however the hydrogeological formation of the said catchment needs to be properly investigated and represented into the groundwater model through proper set of parameters for example groundwater modeling in a karst aquifer system would entail calibration of hydraulic parameters by taking into account of the groundwater flow phenomenon through preferential pathways wong et al 2014 in any other irrigated area where the irrigation layout and structural interventions are not well defined application of this framework would be challenging the quality of irrigation water is another attribute that could be significant if the numerical framework is to be deployed in a coastal system where saltwater intrusion in the groundwater is a common issue in such cases use of variable density flow and transport models i e seawat sànchez et al 2015 may be recommended unsustainable extraction of groundwater is another challenge that could be of importance if the method is to be deployed in an urban area where over extraction frequently causes groundwater table to drop too low use of hydrological crest and crop dssat models in other catchments would also need to consider other local conditions that might affect the hydrological and crop processes shen et al 2016 lazin et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the future we plan to apply this model to other interdisciplinary research initiatives at present a water energy food wef nexus based research to design a renewable power microgrid solution for the local area is being carried out in the research we will estimate the electricity demands for the gw pumping for six different crops wheat maize potatoes cabbages tomatoes and peppers based on actual planting data and then will attempt to feed that electricity demand based on a combined solar dry season and river runoff wet season based power generation the growth of avocado is also common in the study area and in the future we may study how the avocado growth can impact the groundwater table in the long run in the current situation groundwater pumping within certain thresholds within 10 m from surface maybe permitted as model simulations suggest in another study we plan to compare the modflow model findings on local water availability and soil moisture with local farmers perspectives on water availability the ethnographic surveys carried out within the framework of a research project in the area provided insight into the social viewpoint of local farmers on what they consider as fair enough water during irrigation managed by water managers such
