21995,the propagation of bound and free infragravity wave energy under short wave breaking conditions induced by a longshore bar is investigated through field observations near bottom pressure records deployed in a cross shore array at s jacinto barred beach portugal were analysed in these observations short wave breaking induced by the longshore bar occurred mainly in intermediate water depths the ratio between bound and total bound plus free infragravity wave energy was estimated with the methodology of herbers et al 1994 this ratio had a maximum value of 0 6 at the breaking onset which is consistent with values presented elsewhere a decrease of the bound infragravity wave energy was observed after short wave breaking near the bar crest this is in part due to nonlinear energy transfers from infragravity to short wave frequencies as detected on the imaginary part of the bispectrum in a weakly dispersive boussinesq approximation the other part is due to the process of release transform bound into free infragravity wave energy that was assessed with a simplified energy balance equation a conceptual model for the exchange of bound infragravity wave energy during short wave breaking in intermediate water depths is proposed this conceptual model involves both the kh and the ga c 2 generalized nonlinearity parameter keywords bound wave field observations bispectrum wave breaking near resonant triad interactions conceptual model 1 introduction the energy associated with wind generated short waves sw typically with frequencies between 0 04 hz and 0 5 hz is often lost near the shoreline mainly due to the depth induced breaking process and subsequently feeds small scale turbulence low frequency oscillations and steady flows battjes 1988 during the shoreward sw propagation two approximations can be distinguished based on the asymptotic behaviour of the dispersion relationship of linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1984 in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π sw are weakly dispersive and their celerity is a function of the sw wavenumber k and of the water depth h in the shallow water limit kh π 10 sw behave non dispersively and the wave number dependency is negligible leaving the water depth as the only independent variable the depth induced breaking process can occur in both water depths low frequency oscillations with periods between 25 s and 250 s 0 004 0 04 hz are commonly referred to as infragravity waves igw or surf beat in the literature a thorough review of igw has been recently provided by bertin et al 2018 these authors addressed the generation propagation and transformation of igw as well as their impact on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in several coastal environments such as sandy beaches coral reefs rocky shore platforms semi enclosed basins and harbours two main mechanisms have been proposed for the generation of igw and are now widely accepted bertin et al 2018 the generation of energy at igw frequencies can be explained by nonlinear interactions between wave triads composed by two closely spaced sw frequencies and one igw frequency this is known as the bound wave mechanism bwm longuet higgins and stewart 1962 since it generates a forced igw that propagates with the group velocity of the sw group the breakpoint mechanism bkm was attributed to the time varying displacement of the breakpoint location which induces a dynamic setup propagating both offshore and onshore from the breakpoint symonds et al 1982 both seaward and shoreward igw generated by the bkm propagate with their own celerity given by the dispersion relationship and therefore can be considered free igw as opposed to the ones that are forced or bound bertin et al 2018 referred a third mechanism of igw generation the bore merging this mechanism is associated with amplitude dispersion and its relevance is thought to be restricted to the inner surf zone bertin et al 2018 at the shoreline the swash excursions associated with the intermittent fluid motion constitute an important forcing factor for coastal risk assessment the results obtained by guza and thornton 1982 from an analysis of field data collected on a mild sloping beach indicate that while the igw swash height increases with the offshore significant wave height the sw swash height remains unchanged stockdon et al 2006 developed an empirical parameterization for the igw swash height s igw 0 06 h 0 l 0 0 5 that depends on sw parameters h 0 is the offshore significant wave height and l 0 is the offshore wavelength associated with the peak period the comparison between this parameterization and field observations of s igw displayed a correlation coefficient of 0 65 stockdon et al 2006 this relatively small value suggests that the physical processes governing igw in the nearshore are not fully understood and there is room to improve this kind of parameterizations with new interpretations and conceptualizations of such physical processes on sandy beaches initial field observations indicated igw energy to be mostly reflected at the shoreline sometimes creating a standing wave pattern guza and thornton 1985 more recently evidences of a reduction of igw energy were found this reduction has been mainly attributed to igw depth induced breaking losses e g van dongeren et al 2007 or to nonlinear interactions between wave triads that transfer energy from igw back to sw frequencies e g henderson et al 2006 thomson et al 2006 numerical simulations indicated that nonlinear energy transfers from igw to sw frequencies depend on the beach slope de bakker et al 2016 moreover these nonlinear energy transfers can occur on both planar ruju et al 2012 and barred beaches rijnsdorp et al 2015 mendes et al 2018 in general bound igw propagate shoreward and can be released transformed as free igw after sw depth induced breaking however if sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π bound igw energy decreases after sw depth induced breaking baldock 2012 based on a re analysis of several previously published laboratory datasets this author proposed a connection between this reduction and the sw parameter kh to which extent the bound igw reduction after sw depth induced breaking in intermediate water depths can be associated with the generalized nonlinearity parameter ga c 2 should also be investigated beji 1995 introduced the parameter ga c 2 for a monochromatic wave where a is the wave amplitude c is the wave phase speed and g is the gravitational acceleration the parameter ga c 2 asymptotically tends to a h in shallow water depths and will be used hereafter both kh and ga c 2 parameters can be associated with several physical processes occurring in the nearshore zone following young and eldeberky 1998 the nonlinear rate of energy transfer across the spectrum depends essentially on the nonlinearity characterized by ga c 2 and on the dispersion represented by kh of the wave field more specifically field observations indicated that the values of the bicoherence for self interactions involving the spectral peak frequency increase for smaller values of k p h see fig 6 of young and eldeberky 1998 this study develops a conceptual model for bound igw energy reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths that depends on the scale of kh and of ga c 2 parameters this conceptual model is an extension of the re analysis performed by baldock 2012 this re analysis indicated a link between bound igw reduction after sw breaking and kh parameter the present study shows that the bound igw energy reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π is associated with nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies the magnitude of these nonlinear energy transfers depends on the scale of ga c 2 parameter therefore an interpretation and a conceptualization of the bound igw reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths based on field observations and on previous studies is proposed this conceptual model is expected to provide a framework to better understand this phenomenology this paper is structured as follows after this introductory section the field experiment is presented in section 2 together with the environmental offshore wave conditions section 3 outlines the spectral techniques and the methodology used in this study to quantify the relative contribution of bound to total bound plus free igw energy section 4 shows and discusses the results regarding the sw and igw propagation on the bar trough profile and proposes a conceptual model for the exchange of bound igw energy in the surf zone conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 field experiment the s jacinto beach is a wnw facing sandy beach located on the portuguese west coast fig 1 it is approximately 10 km long and it is bounded to the south by the aveiro inlet northern jetty the bottom sediments are mainly sand with a d 50 of approximately 0 5 mm the beach profile is typically composed by a longshore submerged bar fig 2 the concave up beach face leads to reflective conditions during high tide and dissipative conditions during low tide therefore in agreement with an intermediate beach type following the classification of wright and short 1984 the north part of the portuguese west coast experiences a meso tidal regime with a tidal range between 0 6 m and 3 9 m guerreiro et al 2015 the wave climate is characterized by an average significant sw height of 1 9 m during the summer increasing to 3 7 m during the winter and by an average peak sw period of 9 s during the summer increasing to 12 s during the winter dodet et al 2010 the field experiment was performed at the s jacinto beach between 18 and 19 june 2015 offshore wave conditions were recorded through the alfredo ramalho deep water buoy operated by the portuguese hydrographic institute located 87 km north west of s jacinto beach and moored at a water depth of approximately 1600 m fig 1 local wave conditions were obtained with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp located 1700 m from the coastline and deployed at a water depth of approximately 14 m during the field experiment the tidal range was approximately 2 7 m fig 3 d the offshore significant wave height ranged from 1 4 m to 2 2 m between 18 and 19 june fig 3a the significant wave height at the adcp location was smaller than that at the buoy fig 3a due to wave refraction fig 3c and possibly due to bottom friction dissipation over the continental shelf on 17 june a rapid increase of the peak wave period from 6 s to 14 s was observed fig 3b this was a new wave system that can be associated with a swell dominated wave condition and was also accompanied by an increase of h m0 from 1 m to 2 m at the offshore buoy during the observational period between 18 and 19 june the sw peak period varied from 12 s to 10 s and h m0 between 1 5 m and 2 m at the offshore buoy fig 3a and b this study was based on 8 near bottom pressure transducers pt all synchronized each provided a near bottom raw pressure time series with a sampling frequency of 2 hz collected during approximately 18 h between 8 a m of june 18 and 2 a m of june 19 2015 the pt were attached to steel tubes fixed to a concrete block and carefully moored by scuba divers the horizontal position of each pt was obtained by a centimetre accuracy portable gps system the pt were deployed on a 260 m cross shore transect over a longshore bar almost perpendicular to the coastline the spacing between pts varied between 60 m and 25 m and the range of water depths was between 8 5 m and 5 m relative to mean sea level fig 2b 3 data analysis the mean water depth h was calculated as a time average value of a near bottom filtered pressure record the filtering procedure was performed with a 3rd order butterworth low pass filter without phase lag and with a cut off frequency of 0 004 hz the cut off frequency was chosen based on herbers et al 1995 which showed that the lower bound for the igw time scale is f 0 004 hz see fig 3b of herbers et al 1995 the time series of the difference between the near bottom raw pressure record and the filtered one was used to estimate a near bottom pressure spectrum subsequently the latter was transformed into a sea surface spectrum with linear wave theory the analysis presented was based on 3 blocks of 8192 s 6h50min out of 18h for each of the 8 pressure transducers pt and around high and two successive low tides the limits of integration of the spectral moments were defined between 0 004 hz and f s for the igw band h m0 ig and between f s and 0 3 hz for the sw band h m0 sw f s is the frequency associated with the spectral valley at the most offshore pt its value was f s 0 04 hz for lt1 and f s 0 05 hz for ht1 and lt2 see fig 5 the zero and first order spectral moments m0 and m1 were used to calculate the mean period in either of the spectral bands defined above t m01 ig t m01 sw the bandwidth parameter ν proposed by longuet higgins 1975 was calculated using 1 to characterize the wave conditions at the study site the values of ν ranged between 0 30 and 0 35 at the most offshore pt these values of ν smaller than 0 5 are typically associated with a narrow banded spectrum 1 ν m 0 s w m 2 s w m 1 s w 2 1 the bispectral analysis has been used by many researchers since its introduction by hasselmann et al 1963 in the field of ocean waves for a short review on practical applications of bispectral analysis to nonlinear wave interactions between sw and igw the reader is referred to bertin et al 2018 in a weakly nonlinear non gaussian wave field the third order statistics are described by the bispectrum which is crucial in detecting the nonlinearities in ocean waves specially the phase lock bound wave herbers and burton 1997 derived an evolution equation for the variance spectrum as a sum of a linear shoaling term and a nonlinear triad interaction term which is proportional to the imaginary part of the bispectrum equation 14 in herbers and burton 1997 norheim et al 1998 herbers et al 2000 thomson et al 2006 de bakker et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 used the imaginary part of the bispectrum to determine the direction of nonlinear energy transfers between wave frequencies in this study bispectral estimates be were obtained for each block with 15 50 overlapped segments with 2048 samples each be were further averaged over five adjacent frequencies to improve statistical stability and thereby increasing the number of degrees of freedom to 150 this procedure yielded a frequency resolution of 0 0049 hz the bicoherence was computed following ruessink 1998 and the 80 confidence level for non bicoherence was 0 146 elgar and guza 1988 herbers et al 1994 developed a methodology to estimate the ratio between bound and total igw energy using sea surface elevation data this ratio was estimated as 2 e b e t α b 2 where e b is the bound igw energy and e t is the total bound plus free igw energy b is the bispectrum integration over all interacting pairs of difference frequencies 3 b 2 δ f m i n δ f m a x δ f f m a x b f δ f d f d δ f 2 δ f m i n δ f m a x δ f f m a x e f δ f e f d f d δ f δ f m i n δ f m a x e δ f d δ f 1 2 the values for δf min δf max and f max were set to 0 004 hz 0 04 hz and 0 3 hz respectively in general the parameter α is calculated knowing the characteristics of the sw directional spectrum herbers et al 1994 the field data described above do not include that kind of information therefore the value of α was set to 1 as proposed by herbers et al 1994 in such circumstances this methodology has been used by a number of authors to analyse field observations collected across the surf zone under breaking and non breaking conditions e g ruessink 1998 sheremet et al 2002 like sheremet et al 2002 both real and imaginary parts of the bispectrum were used to compute b note that e t is equal to m 0 ig with the pertinent igw integration limits e b is estimated with the ratio 2 and the free igw energy e f is the difference between e t and e b the steady state conservation of energy flux for long waves neglecting alongshore variations and dissipation e g dean and dalrymple 1984 a special case of green s law was evaluated as 4 e f g h x 0 the offshore boundary condition for 4 the free igw energy e f at pt 8 was estimated with herbers et al 1994 methodology as described above 4 results and discussion 4 1 short wave propagation the cross shore changes of h m0 sw normalized by the value of h m0 sw at the adcp location along the transect are displayed in fig 4 a c during both low tides lt1 and lt2 h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp is approximately constant until the bar crest x 60 m and decreases shoreward a reduction in h m0 sw of 21 and 15 for lt1 and lt2 respectively then the slightly higher water depth at the bar trough allows the value of h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp to stay approximately constant for x 140 m the changes in h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp over the cross shore profile for lt1 and lt2 are consistent with the position of the bar and sw depth induced breaking during high tide ht1 the changes of h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp are rather small over the cross shore profile fig 4b suggesting that non breaking sw were propagating over the bar the cross shore variation of the relative sw number k p h is shown in fig 4g i where k p is the sw wavenumber associated with the peak frequency the value of k p h is larger than π 10 at x 60 m for the three conditions the comparison between fig 4a c and fig 4g i shows that sw breaking occurred in intermediate water depths for lt1 and lt2 the decrease of t m01 sw after the bar crest was larger for lt1 and lt2 than for ht1 fig 4d f this decrease is associated to the generation of super harmonics of the sw peak frequency fig 5 displays the wave spectrum at four locations across the bar during lt1 the sw peak frequency is approximately 0 08 hz at x 0 m fig 5a the energy associated to the first super harmonic of the sw peak frequency f 0 16 hz increased between x 0 m and x 180 m fig 5a j this process redistributes the energy among the sw frequency spectrum and consequently decreases t m01 sw a similar behaviour is obtained for ht1 and for lt2 but the magnitude of the near resonant triad interactions is weaker than for lt1 fig 5 beji and battjes 1993 performed laboratory experiments of wave propagation under breaking and non breaking conditions over a submerged bar generally the observations at the s jacinto beach agree with those of beji and battjes 1993 namely the sw dissipation due to depth induced breaking induced by the bar and the effect of the energy redistribution to sw frequencies that are multiples of the sw peak frequency in addition this redistribution occurs both under breaking lt1 and lt2 and non breaking ht1 conditions over the bar as in beji and battjes 1993 which means that sw depth induced breaking does not disable near resonant triad interactions 4 2 infragravity wave propagation 4 2 1 first low tide lt1 during lt1 the ratio between bound and total igw energy reached a maximum value of approximately 0 6 near the onset of sw breaking fig 6 a and b bound igw energy decreased shoreward along the cross shore transect x 60 m representing only 10 of the total igw energy at x 240 m fig 6a ruessink 1998 and sheremet et al 2002 investigated the ratio e b e t with field observations obtained under breaking and non breaking conditions those authors have also reported a maximum value of e b e t at the sw breaking onset and a shoreward reduction after sw breaking as referred above baldock 2012 indicated that bound igw energy decays after sw breaking in intermediate water depths there was an overall reduction of e b along the cross shore transect 60 m x 270 m of 0 0015 m2 fig 6a but the excess of e f calculated with the methodology of herbers et al 1994 circles in fig 6b in relation to the predictions following green s law triangles in fig 6b along the cross shore transect was of 0 0010 m2 fig 6b the difference suggests that not all bound igw energy is transformed released into free igw energy therefore other physical processes can play a role in reducing bound igw energy looking at the imaginary part of the bispectrum a positive value with an 80 significant level can be observed near the sw breaking point fig 6e this is associated with a wave triad of an igw frequency 0 01 hz and a sw frequency 0 08 hz which is promoting energy transfer back from igw to sw frequencies hence the observed reduction of e b for lt1 can be explained by two processes the transformation release of bound into free igw energy and nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies 4 2 2 first high tide ht1 the value of bound igw energy for the non breaking sw case ht1 is small for the deep water depths and only represents less than 20 of the total igw energy for x 150 m fig 7 a e b increases shoreward for water depths smaller than 6 m the maximum value of the ratio between e b and e t 0 5 was reached at the most shoreward position x 270 m the cross shore variation of free igw energy is aligned with green s law fig 7b as in the case of free shoaling waves 4 2 3 second low tide lt2 the cross shore variation of bound igw energy for lt2 is similar to lt1 compare figs 6a and 8 a the ratio between e b and e t for lt2 reached a maximum of 0 6 at the bar crest and decayed shoreward up to a value of 0 2 at x 270 m differences arise on the relative value because e b near the bar crest for lt2 is half of lt1 additionally the imaginary part of the bispectrum is smaller in magnitude for lt2 when compared with lt1 this suggests weaker nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies for lt2 when compared with lt1 the cross shore value of e f increases for x 120 m and it is well above the value predicted by green s law fig 8b this might be an indication of a standing igw which does not necessarily follow green s law in relation the mean igw period t m01 ig at the most offshore pt was calculated t m01 ig took a value of 50 s for lt2 adopting the shallow water limit for the dispersion relationship l ig t m01 ig gh 1 2 with a mean igw wave period of 50 s and a water depth of 5 m a value of l ig 350 m is obtained the distance between x 120 m and x 300 m is 180 m which is approximately half of the wavelength of 350 m so the interaction between an incident and an outgoing igw might have originated a standing igw 4 3 bound infragravity wave energy exchange in the surf zone 4 3 1 relationship between eb and the short wave parameters ga c2 and kh under non breaking conditions following longuet higgins and stewart 1962 the steady state equilibrium solution for the average value of the sea surface elevation over one wave cycle ξ b valid for uniform water depth and when the sw group length is much longer than the water depth reads 5 ξ b s x x ρ g h c g 2 c o n s t where s xx is the radiation stress in the direction of wave propagation c g is the wave group velocity and ρ is the fluid density c g can be expanded as c g 2 gh 1 kh 2 o kh 4 e g battjes et al 2004 when kh 1 substitution of previous expansion in 5 and neglecting higher order terms becomes 6 ξ b s x x ρ g h k h 2 with const can take an arbitrarily value without loss of generality in shallow water depths s xx 3ρgh 2 16 and further substitution in 6 leads to 7 ξ b 3 h 2 16 h k h 2 3 16 h h h 1 k h 2 equation 7 exhibits a relationship between ξ b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters as e b depends on ξ b 2 e g elgar et al 1992 e b is also related with both ga c 2 and kh parameters under non breaking sw conditions besides s jacinto field data shows that an empirical relationship between e b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters exists fig 9 in random wave conditions the parameters a and c were calculated with a 0 5h m0 sw and c c g p the correlation coefficient r 2 between e b and ga c 2 was 0 85 fig 9a the correlation between e b and kh had a r 2 0 81 fig 9b these relatively high values of r 2 provide some confidence in a relationship between e b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters 4 3 2 relationship between eb and the short wave parameters ga c2 and kh under breaking conditions the following analysis provides some insight on the relationships between the reduction of e b and the parameters ga c 2 and kh the depth integrated igw energy equation under steady state conditions neglecting dissipative processes and alongshore variations reads 8 f x u s x x x 0 where f is the igw energy flux u is the time averaged and depth integrated flow velocity and the second term in the l h s of 8 is the work done by the radiation stress in a sloping beach u is usually directed seaward due to the shoreward mass flux induced by sw between the wave through and crest i e the stokes drift e g garcez faria et al 2000 an analytical expression for u can be obtained by considering the water discharge q associated with the stokes drift fredsoe and deigaard 1992 9 u q h π h 2 4 h t t a n h k h substitution of 9 into 8 and using tanh kh kh leads to 10 f x π h 2 4 h t k h s x x x by assuming f e b c g 10 becomes 11 e b c g x π 4 h t h h 1 k h s x x x equation 11 indicates that the cross shore gradient of f depends on the signal of the cross shore gradient of the radiation stress ds xx dx ds xx dx is positive in the shoaling zone of a plane beach profile and negative in the surf zone due to sw energy dissipation by depth induced breaking therefore and according with 11 e b increases decreases in the shoaling surf zone and these changes depend on ga c 2 and on kh fig 10 depicts the cross shore variation of the ga c 2 parameter and of e b e b x 60 m values e b x 60 m is the value of e b at the breaking point for two cases lt1 and lt2 the values of e b e b x 60 m decrease after the sw breaking point in both cases but this reduction is larger for lt1 circles in fig 10b than for lt2 squares in fig 10b this larger reduction for lt1 is linked to a larger value of the ga c 2 parameter at the sw breaking point for case lt1 than for lt2 fig 10a a larger reduction of e b in the surf zone can be expected for a larger value of the ga c 2 parameter at the sw breaking point 4 3 3 conceptual model this conceptual model is a refinement of the ideas put forward by baldock 2012 this author argued that bound igw energy will decrease if sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π thus an association of the bound igw energy reduction and the short wave parameter kh was made as an extension it is proposed here that the bound igw energy reduction can be associated with both kh and ga c 2 parameters the scale of the latter will set the level of e b reduction in intermediate water depths the rationale for the choice of ga c 2 is that nonlinearity will control the rate of energy transfer from igw back to sw frequencies and therefore should be relevant in the interpretation of igw energy transformations in the nearshore the developments of the conceptual model are based on s jacinto s field observations and first and high order spectral analysis additionally and to strengthen the developments of the conceptual model presented herein case b1045a of baldock et al 2000 and case 1c of battjes et al 2004 were chosen they are good examples of a strong igw reduction intermediate water depths and an almost unchanged igw shallow water depths after sw breaking respectively since moura and baldock 2018 used the same data set of baldock et al 2000 it is possible to estimate the short wave parameters ga c 2 and kh using the information presented in their fig 4 near the sw breaking point the values are a 0 05 m c g p 0 81 m s ga c g p 2 0 75 and k p h 0 68 for case 1c the short wave parameters were obtained from figs 1 and 2 of battjes et al 2004 and gave c g p 1 35 m s ga c g p 2 0 29 and k p h 0 26 case a of fig 11 is representative of the shallow water situation as in the case 1c of battjes et al 2004 in this case sw breaking occurs in shallow water depths and the bound igw energy is totally released transformed into free igw energy in case b of fig 11 sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths then two situations can occur with different levels of e b reduction the extent of bound igw energy decrease is modulated by the value of ga c 2 if the value of ga c 2 is small blue lines similar to our lt1 condition above described part of the bound igw energy is transferred back to sw frequencies if the value of ga c 2 is large red lines as in case b1045a of baldock et al 2000 this back transfer is enhanced 5 conclusions bound and free infragravity wave energy transformations were analysed using field observations collected over a barred beach the separation of total infragravity wave energy into bound and free contributions was calculated with the methodology presented by herbers et al 1994 in our set of observations from a relatively high resolution cross shore transect of 8 pressure transducers short wave breaking induced by the longshore bar occurred mainly in intermediate water depths the ratio between bound and total infragravity wave energy was maximum at the short wave breaking onset in these intermediate water depths shoreward a reduction of bound infragravity wave energy was observed this reduction was due to nonlinear energy transfers from infragravity to short wave frequencies and release transformation of bound into infragravity wave energy in this work we propose that the dynamics of igw approaching the coast can be understood in terms of the magnitude of the nondimensional parameters kh and ga c 2 based on empirical relationships established with field data between the bound infragravity wave energy and the short wave parameters kh and ga c 2 a conceptual model for the bound infragravity wave energy exchange during sw breaking conditions in intermediate water depths was proposed this conceptual model links a larger reduction of bound infragravity wave energy for a larger value of ga c 2 at the breakpoint if short wave breaking occurs in intermediate water depths the proposed conceptual model provides a new perspective to improve the infragravity wave swash height parameterizations e g stockdon et al 2006 due to the link between bound infragravity wave energy reduction in the surf zone and the ga c 2 parameter at the breaking point similarly runup parameterizations can equally benefit because they include the infragravity swash height in their formulations authors contributions the conception data analysis and writing of

can be explained by nonlinear interactions between wave triads composed by two closely spaced sw frequencies and one igw frequency this is known as the bound wave mechanism bwm longuet higgins and stewart 1962 since it generates a forced igw that propagates with the group velocity of the sw group the breakpoint mechanism bkm was attributed to the time varying displacement of the breakpoint location which induces a dynamic setup propagating both offshore and onshore from the breakpoint symonds et al 1982 both seaward and shoreward igw generated by the bkm propagate with their own celerity given by the dispersion relationship and therefore can be considered free igw as opposed to the ones that are forced or bound bertin et al 2018 referred a third mechanism of igw generation the bore merging this mechanism is associated with amplitude dispersion and its relevance is thought to be restricted to the inner surf zone bertin et al 2018 at the shoreline the swash excursions associated with the intermittent fluid motion constitute an important forcing factor for coastal risk assessment the results obtained by guza and thornton 1982 from an analysis of field data collected on a mild sloping beach indicate that while the igw swash height increases with the offshore significant wave height the sw swash height remains unchanged stockdon et al 2006 developed an empirical parameterization for the igw swash height s igw 0 06 h 0 l 0 0 5 that depends on sw parameters h 0 is the offshore significant wave height and l 0 is the offshore wavelength associated with the peak period the comparison between this parameterization and field observations of s igw displayed a correlation coefficient of 0 65 stockdon et al 2006 this relatively small value suggests that the physical processes governing igw in the nearshore are not fully understood and there is room to improve this kind of parameterizations with new interpretations and conceptualizations of such physical processes on sandy beaches initial field observations indicated igw energy to be mostly reflected at the shoreline sometimes creating a standing wave pattern guza and thornton 1985 more recently evidences of a reduction of igw energy were found this reduction has been mainly attributed to igw depth induced breaking losses e g van dongeren et al 2007 or to nonlinear interactions between wave triads that transfer energy from igw back to sw frequencies e g henderson et al 2006 thomson et al 2006 numerical simulations indicated that nonlinear energy transfers from igw to sw frequencies depend on the beach slope de bakker et al 2016 moreover these nonlinear energy transfers can occur on both planar ruju et al 2012 and barred beaches rijnsdorp et al 2015 mendes et al 2018 in general bound igw propagate shoreward and can be released transformed as free igw after sw depth induced breaking however if sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π bound igw energy decreases after sw depth induced breaking baldock 2012 based on a re analysis of several previously published laboratory datasets this author proposed a connection between this reduction and the sw parameter kh to which extent the bound igw reduction after sw depth induced breaking in intermediate water depths can be associated with the generalized nonlinearity parameter ga c 2 should also be investigated beji 1995 introduced the parameter ga c 2 for a monochromatic wave where a is the wave amplitude c is the wave phase speed and g is the gravitational acceleration the parameter ga c 2 asymptotically tends to a h in shallow water depths and will be used hereafter both kh and ga c 2 parameters can be associated with several physical processes occurring in the nearshore zone following young and eldeberky 1998 the nonlinear rate of energy transfer across the spectrum depends essentially on the nonlinearity characterized by ga c 2 and on the dispersion represented by kh of the wave field more specifically field observations indicated that the values of the bicoherence for self interactions involving the spectral peak frequency increase for smaller values of k p h see fig 6 of young and eldeberky 1998 this study develops a conceptual model for bound igw energy reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths that depends on the scale of kh and of ga c 2 parameters this conceptual model is an extension of the re analysis performed by baldock 2012 this re analysis indicated a link between bound igw reduction after sw breaking and kh parameter the present study shows that the bound igw energy reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π is associated with nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies the magnitude of these nonlinear energy transfers depends on the scale of ga c 2 parameter therefore an interpretation and a conceptualization of the bound igw reduction after sw breaking in intermediate water depths based on field observations and on previous studies is proposed this conceptual model is expected to provide a framework to better understand this phenomenology this paper is structured as follows after this introductory section the field experiment is presented in section 2 together with the environmental offshore wave conditions section 3 outlines the spectral techniques and the methodology used in this study to quantify the relative contribution of bound to total bound plus free igw energy section 4 shows and discusses the results regarding the sw and igw propagation on the bar trough profile and proposes a conceptual model for the exchange of bound igw energy in the surf zone conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 field experiment the s jacinto beach is a wnw facing sandy beach located on the portuguese west coast fig 1 it is approximately 10 km long and it is bounded to the south by the aveiro inlet northern jetty the bottom sediments are mainly sand with a d 50 of approximately 0 5 mm the beach profile is typically composed by a longshore submerged bar fig 2 the concave up beach face leads to reflective conditions during high tide and dissipative conditions during low tide therefore in agreement with an intermediate beach type following the classification of wright and short 1984 the north part of the portuguese west coast experiences a meso tidal regime with a tidal range between 0 6 m and 3 9 m guerreiro et al 2015 the wave climate is characterized by an average significant sw height of 1 9 m during the summer increasing to 3 7 m during the winter and by an average peak sw period of 9 s during the summer increasing to 12 s during the winter dodet et al 2010 the field experiment was performed at the s jacinto beach between 18 and 19 june 2015 offshore wave conditions were recorded through the alfredo ramalho deep water buoy operated by the portuguese hydrographic institute located 87 km north west of s jacinto beach and moored at a water depth of approximately 1600 m fig 1 local wave conditions were obtained with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp located 1700 m from the coastline and deployed at a water depth of approximately 14 m during the field experiment the tidal range was approximately 2 7 m fig 3 d the offshore significant wave height ranged from 1 4 m to 2 2 m between 18 and 19 june fig 3a the significant wave height at the adcp location was smaller than that at the buoy fig 3a due to wave refraction fig 3c and possibly due to bottom friction dissipation over the continental shelf on 17 june a rapid increase of the peak wave period from 6 s to 14 s was observed fig 3b this was a new wave system that can be associated with a swell dominated wave condition and was also accompanied by an increase of h m0 from 1 m to 2 m at the offshore buoy during the observational period between 18 and 19 june the sw peak period varied from 12 s to 10 s and h m0 between 1 5 m and 2 m at the offshore buoy fig 3a and b this study was based on 8 near bottom pressure transducers pt all synchronized each provided a near bottom raw pressure time series with a sampling frequency of 2 hz collected during approximately 18 h between 8 a m of june 18 and 2 a m of june 19 2015 the pt were attached to steel tubes fixed to a concrete block and carefully moored by scuba divers the horizontal position of each pt was obtained by a centimetre accuracy portable gps system the pt were deployed on a 260 m cross shore transect over a longshore bar almost perpendicular to the coastline the spacing between pts varied between 60 m and 25 m and the range of water depths was between 8 5 m and 5 m relative to mean sea level fig 2b 3 data analysis the mean water depth h was calculated as a time average value of a near bottom filtered pressure record the filtering procedure was performed with a 3rd order butterworth low pass filter without phase lag and with a cut off frequency of 0 004 hz the cut off frequency was chosen based on herbers et al 1995 which showed that the lower bound for the igw time scale is f 0 004 hz see fig 3b of herbers et al 1995 the time series of the difference between the near bottom raw pressure record and the filtered one was used to estimate a near bottom pressure spectrum subsequently the latter was transformed into a sea surface spectrum with linear wave theory the analysis presented was based on 3 blocks of 8192 s 6h50min out of 18h for each of the 8 pressure transducers pt and around high and two successive low tides the limits of integration of the spectral moments were defined between 0 004 hz and f s for the igw band h m0 ig and between f s and 0 3 hz for the sw band h m0 sw f s is the frequency associated with the spectral valley at the most offshore pt its value was f s 0 04 hz for lt1 and f s 0 05 hz for ht1 and lt2 see fig 5 the zero and first order spectral moments m0 and m1 were used to calculate the mean period in either of the spectral bands defined above t m01 ig t m01 sw the bandwidth parameter ν proposed by longuet higgins 1975 was calculated using 1 to characterize the wave conditions at the study site the values of ν ranged between 0 30 and 0 35 at the most offshore pt these values of ν smaller than 0 5 are typically associated with a narrow banded spectrum 1 ν m 0 s w m 2 s w m 1 s w 2 1 the bispectral analysis has been used by many researchers since its introduction by hasselmann et al 1963 in the field of ocean waves for a short review on practical applications of bispectral analysis to nonlinear wave interactions between sw and igw the reader is referred to bertin et al 2018 in a weakly nonlinear non gaussian wave field the third order statistics are described by the bispectrum which is crucial in detecting the nonlinearities in ocean waves specially the phase lock bound wave herbers and burton 1997 derived an evolution equation for the variance spectrum as a sum of a linear shoaling term and a nonlinear triad interaction term which is proportional to the imaginary part of the bispectrum equation 14 in herbers and burton 1997 norheim et al 1998 herbers et al 2000 thomson et al 2006 de bakker et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 used the imaginary part of the bispectrum to determine the direction of nonlinear energy transfers between wave frequencies in this study bispectral estimates be were obtained for each block with 15 50 overlapped segments with 2048 samples each be were further averaged over five adjacent frequencies to improve statistical stability and thereby increasing the number of degrees of freedom to 150 this procedure yielded a frequency resolution of 0 0049 hz the bicoherence was computed following ruessink 1998 and the 80 confidence level for non bicoherence was 0 146 elgar and guza 1988 herbers et al 1994 developed a methodology to estimate the ratio between bound and total igw energy using sea surface elevation data this ratio was estimated as 2 e b e t α b 2 where e b is the bound igw energy and e t is the total bound plus free igw energy b is the bispectrum integration over all interacting pairs of difference frequencies 3 b 2 δ f m i n δ f m a x δ f f m a x b f δ f d f d δ f 2 δ f m i n δ f m a x δ f f m a x e f δ f e f d f d δ f δ f m i n δ f m a x e δ f d δ f 1 2 the values for δf min δf max and f max were set to 0 004 hz 0 04 hz and 0 3 hz respectively in general the parameter α is calculated knowing the characteristics of the sw directional spectrum herbers et al 1994 the field data described above do not include that kind of information therefore the value of α was set to 1 as proposed by herbers et al 1994 in such circumstances this methodology has been used by a number of authors to analyse field observations collected across the surf zone under breaking and non breaking conditions e g ruessink 1998 sheremet et al 2002 like sheremet et al 2002 both real and imaginary parts of the bispectrum were used to compute b note that e t is equal to m 0 ig with the pertinent igw integration limits e b is estimated with the ratio 2 and the free igw energy e f is the difference between e t and e b the steady state conservation of energy flux for long waves neglecting alongshore variations and dissipation e g dean and dalrymple 1984 a special case of green s law was evaluated as 4 e f g h x 0 the offshore boundary condition for 4 the free igw energy e f at pt 8 was estimated with herbers et al 1994 methodology as described above 4 results and discussion 4 1 short wave propagation the cross shore changes of h m0 sw normalized by the value of h m0 sw at the adcp location along the transect are displayed in fig 4 a c during both low tides lt1 and lt2 h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp is approximately constant until the bar crest x 60 m and decreases shoreward a reduction in h m0 sw of 21 and 15 for lt1 and lt2 respectively then the slightly higher water depth at the bar trough allows the value of h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp to stay approximately constant for x 140 m the changes in h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp over the cross shore profile for lt1 and lt2 are consistent with the position of the bar and sw depth induced breaking during high tide ht1 the changes of h m0 sw h m0 sw adcp are rather small over the cross shore profile fig 4b suggesting that non breaking sw were propagating over the bar the cross shore variation of the relative sw number k p h is shown in fig 4g i where k p is the sw wavenumber associated with the peak frequency the value of k p h is larger than π 10 at x 60 m for the three conditions the comparison between fig 4a c and fig 4g i shows that sw breaking occurred in intermediate water depths for lt1 and lt2 the decrease of t m01 sw after the bar crest was larger for lt1 and lt2 than for ht1 fig 4d f this decrease is associated to the generation of super harmonics of the sw peak frequency fig 5 displays the wave spectrum at four locations across the bar during lt1 the sw peak frequency is approximately 0 08 hz at x 0 m fig 5a the energy associated to the first super harmonic of the sw peak frequency f 0 16 hz increased between x 0 m and x 180 m fig 5a j this process redistributes the energy among the sw frequency spectrum and consequently decreases t m01 sw a similar behaviour is obtained for ht1 and for lt2 but the magnitude of the near resonant triad interactions is weaker than for lt1 fig 5 beji and battjes 1993 performed laboratory experiments of wave propagation under breaking and non breaking conditions over a submerged bar generally the observations at the s jacinto beach agree with those of beji and battjes 1993 namely the sw dissipation due to depth induced breaking induced by the bar and the effect of the energy redistribution to sw frequencies that are multiples of the sw peak frequency in addition this redistribution occurs both under breaking lt1 and lt2 and non breaking ht1 conditions over the bar as in beji and battjes 1993 which means that sw depth induced breaking does not disable near resonant triad interactions 4 2 infragravity wave propagation 4 2 1 first low tide lt1 during lt1 the ratio between bound and total igw energy reached a maximum value of approximately 0 6 near the onset of sw breaking fig 6 a and b bound igw energy decreased shoreward along the cross shore transect x 60 m representing only 10 of the total igw energy at x 240 m fig 6a ruessink 1998 and sheremet et al 2002 investigated the ratio e b e t with field observations obtained under breaking and non breaking conditions those authors have also reported a maximum value of e b e t at the sw breaking onset and a shoreward reduction after sw breaking as referred above baldock 2012 indicated that bound igw energy decays after sw breaking in intermediate water depths there was an overall reduction of e b along the cross shore transect 60 m x 270 m of 0 0015 m2 fig 6a but the excess of e f calculated with the methodology of herbers et al 1994 circles in fig 6b in relation to the predictions following green s law triangles in fig 6b along the cross shore transect was of 0 0010 m2 fig 6b the difference suggests that not all bound igw energy is transformed released into free igw energy therefore other physical processes can play a role in reducing bound igw energy looking at the imaginary part of the bispectrum a positive value with an 80 significant level can be observed near the sw breaking point fig 6e this is associated with a wave triad of an igw frequency 0 01 hz and a sw frequency 0 08 hz which is promoting energy transfer back from igw to sw frequencies hence the observed reduction of e b for lt1 can be explained by two processes the transformation release of bound into free igw energy and nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies 4 2 2 first high tide ht1 the value of bound igw energy for the non breaking sw case ht1 is small for the deep water depths and only represents less than 20 of the total igw energy for x 150 m fig 7 a e b increases shoreward for water depths smaller than 6 m the maximum value of the ratio between e b and e t 0 5 was reached at the most shoreward position x 270 m the cross shore variation of free igw energy is aligned with green s law fig 7b as in the case of free shoaling waves 4 2 3 second low tide lt2 the cross shore variation of bound igw energy for lt2 is similar to lt1 compare figs 6a and 8 a the ratio between e b and e t for lt2 reached a maximum of 0 6 at the bar crest and decayed shoreward up to a value of 0 2 at x 270 m differences arise on the relative value because e b near the bar crest for lt2 is half of lt1 additionally the imaginary part of the bispectrum is smaller in magnitude for lt2 when compared with lt1 this suggests weaker nonlinear energy transfers from igw back to sw frequencies for lt2 when compared with lt1 the cross shore value of e f increases for x 120 m and it is well above the value predicted by green s law fig 8b this might be an indication of a standing igw which does not necessarily follow green s law in relation the mean igw period t m01 ig at the most offshore pt was calculated t m01 ig took a value of 50 s for lt2 adopting the shallow water limit for the dispersion relationship l ig t m01 ig gh 1 2 with a mean igw wave period of 50 s and a water depth of 5 m a value of l ig 350 m is obtained the distance between x 120 m and x 300 m is 180 m which is approximately half of the wavelength of 350 m so the interaction between an incident and an outgoing igw might have originated a standing igw 4 3 bound infragravity wave energy exchange in the surf zone 4 3 1 relationship between eb and the short wave parameters ga c2 and kh under non breaking conditions following longuet higgins and stewart 1962 the steady state equilibrium solution for the average value of the sea surface elevation over one wave cycle ξ b valid for uniform water depth and when the sw group length is much longer than the water depth reads 5 ξ b s x x ρ g h c g 2 c o n s t where s xx is the radiation stress in the direction of wave propagation c g is the wave group velocity and ρ is the fluid density c g can be expanded as c g 2 gh 1 kh 2 o kh 4 e g battjes et al 2004 when kh 1 substitution of previous expansion in 5 and neglecting higher order terms becomes 6 ξ b s x x ρ g h k h 2 with const can take an arbitrarily value without loss of generality in shallow water depths s xx 3ρgh 2 16 and further substitution in 6 leads to 7 ξ b 3 h 2 16 h k h 2 3 16 h h h 1 k h 2 equation 7 exhibits a relationship between ξ b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters as e b depends on ξ b 2 e g elgar et al 1992 e b is also related with both ga c 2 and kh parameters under non breaking sw conditions besides s jacinto field data shows that an empirical relationship between e b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters exists fig 9 in random wave conditions the parameters a and c were calculated with a 0 5h m0 sw and c c g p the correlation coefficient r 2 between e b and ga c 2 was 0 85 fig 9a the correlation between e b and kh had a r 2 0 81 fig 9b these relatively high values of r 2 provide some confidence in a relationship between e b and both ga c 2 and kh parameters 4 3 2 relationship between eb and the short wave parameters ga c2 and kh under breaking conditions the following analysis provides some insight on the relationships between the reduction of e b and the parameters ga c 2 and kh the depth integrated igw energy equation under steady state conditions neglecting dissipative processes and alongshore variations reads 8 f x u s x x x 0 where f is the igw energy flux u is the time averaged and depth integrated flow velocity and the second term in the l h s of 8 is the work done by the radiation stress in a sloping beach u is usually directed seaward due to the shoreward mass flux induced by sw between the wave through and crest i e the stokes drift e g garcez faria et al 2000 an analytical expression for u can be obtained by considering the water discharge q associated with the stokes drift fredsoe and deigaard 1992 9 u q h π h 2 4 h t t a n h k h substitution of 9 into 8 and using tanh kh kh leads to 10 f x π h 2 4 h t k h s x x x by assuming f e b c g 10 becomes 11 e b c g x π 4 h t h h 1 k h s x x x equation 11 indicates that the cross shore gradient of f depends on the signal of the cross shore gradient of the radiation stress ds xx dx ds xx dx is positive in the shoaling zone of a plane beach profile and negative in the surf zone due to sw energy dissipation by depth induced breaking therefore and according with 11 e b increases decreases in the shoaling surf zone and these changes depend on ga c 2 and on kh fig 10 depicts the cross shore variation of the ga c 2 parameter and of e b e b x 60 m values e b x 60 m is the value of e b at the breaking point for two cases lt1 and lt2 the values of e b e b x 60 m decrease after the sw breaking point in both cases but this reduction is larger for lt1 circles in fig 10b than for lt2 squares in fig 10b this larger reduction for lt1 is linked to a larger value of the ga c 2 parameter at the sw breaking point for case lt1 than for lt2 fig 10a a larger reduction of e b in the surf zone can be expected for a larger value of the ga c 2 parameter at the sw breaking point 4 3 3 conceptual model this conceptual model is a refinement of the ideas put forward by baldock 2012 this author argued that bound igw energy will decrease if sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths π 10 kh π thus an association of the bound igw energy reduction and the short wave parameter kh was made as an extension it is proposed here that the bound igw energy reduction can be associated with both kh and ga c 2 parameters the scale of the latter will set the level of e b reduction in intermediate water depths the rationale for the choice of ga c 2 is that nonlinearity will control the rate of energy transfer from igw back to sw frequencies and therefore should be relevant in the interpretation of igw energy transformations in the nearshore the developments of the conceptual model are based on s jacinto s field observations and first and high order spectral analysis additionally and to strengthen the developments of the conceptual model presented herein case b1045a of baldock et al 2000 and case 1c of battjes et al 2004 were chosen they are good examples of a strong igw reduction intermediate water depths and an almost unchanged igw shallow water depths after sw breaking respectively since moura and baldock 2018 used the same data set of baldock et al 2000 it is possible to estimate the short wave parameters ga c 2 and kh using the information presented in their fig 4 near the sw breaking point the values are a 0 05 m c g p 0 81 m s ga c g p 2 0 75 and k p h 0 68 for case 1c the short wave parameters were obtained from figs 1 and 2 of battjes et al 2004 and gave c g p 1 35 m s ga c g p 2 0 29 and k p h 0 26 case a of fig 11 is representative of the shallow water situation as in the case 1c of battjes et al 2004 in this case sw breaking occurs in shallow water depths and the bound igw energy is totally released transformed into free igw energy in case b of fig 11 sw breaking occurs in intermediate water depths then two situations can occur with different levels of e b reduction the extent of bound igw energy decrease is modulated by the value of ga c 2 if the value of ga c 2 is small blue lines similar to our lt1 condition above described part of the bound igw energy is transferred back to sw frequencies if the value of ga c 2 is large red lines as in case b1045a of baldock et al 2000 this back transfer is enhanced 5 conclusions bound and free infragravity wave energy transformations were analysed using field observations collected over a barred beach the separation of total infragravity wave energy into bound and free contributions was calculated with the methodology presented by herbers et al 1994 in our set of observations from a relatively high resolution cross shore transect of 8 pressure transducers short wave breaking induced by the longshore bar occurred mainly in intermediate water depths the ratio between bound and total infragravity wave energy was maximum at the short wave breaking onset in these intermediate water depths shoreward a reduction of bound infragravity wave energy was observed this reduction was due to nonlinear energy transfers from infragravity to short wave frequencies and release transformation of bound into infragravity wave energy in this work we propose that the dynamics of igw approaching the coast can be understood in terms of the magnitude of the nondimensional parameters kh and ga c 2 based on empirical relationships established with field data between the bound infragravity wave energy and the short wave parameters kh and ga c 2 a conceptual model for the bound infragravity wave energy exchange during sw breaking conditions in intermediate water depths was proposed this conceptual model links a larger reduction of bound infragravity wave energy for a larger value of ga c 2 at the breakpoint if short wave breaking occurs in intermediate water depths the proposed conceptual model provides a new perspective to improve the infragravity wave swash height parameterizations e g stockdon et al 2006 due to the link between bound infragravity wave energy reduction in the surf zone and the ga c 2 parameter at the breaking point similarly runup parameterizations can equally benefit because they include the infragravity swash height in their formulations authors contributions the conception data analysis and writing of

21996,the wide range use of marine equipment has greatly increased the underwater radiated noise urn level creating more threat to marine life autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the solutions to reduce the use of large marine equipment and then decrease the noise aiming at the noise control of auv this study conducted a far field noise measurement experiment on an auv working on 10 different conditions which is rarely measured the hybrid method predicting the noise with lighthill equation based on unsteady flow field data from cfd calculation is adopted the results from experiment and simulation indicates that the simulative results are in good agreements with experimental results and the propeller will still generate noise due to the irregular vibration of the propeller which is about 3 5 db with the occurrence of cavitation the sound pressure level spl increases sharply and there will be a wide gap between experimental and simulative noise data owing to the single phase considered in the lighthill equation the analysis of the experimental and simulative results highlights the existence of structure excitation noise ranging from 300 to 500 hz and the shortcoming of noise prediction of the hybrid method under cavitation stage keywords auv lighthill equation propeller cfd underwater radiated noise 1 introduction the increasing scale of general shipping activities and one of the emissions underwater radiated noise urn have been under the spotlight hildebrand 2009 due to the increasing scale of marine equipment noise level in seas especially near harbors has increased constantly and interfered with the daily life of mammals including the communication hunting and breeding merchant et al 2014 madsen 2005 recent studies have shown that noise also influences fish and invertebrates when courting and laying eggs julia et al 2016 matthew et al 2013 in addition to the protection of marine life marine equipment used in military itself has stricter requirements for noise control classifying the sonar target based on its acoustic signal characteristics is considered to be an effective sonar application method on the one hand oceanography carral et al 2018 martinelli et al 2016 sonar modeling and engineering mohammad and hassan 2019 abraham 2008 and also statistical processing hurtós et al 2017 miles et al 2006 are taken into account to improve the accuracy of classification on the other hand random methods including artificial intelligence ai methods najafzadeh et al 2016a najafzadeh et al 2016b najafzadeh and sarkamaryan 2018 have resulted in significant improvements in classification efficiency more and more advanced sonar technology poses a more serious challenge to the survivability of autonomous underwater vehicles in the execution of missions therefore the urn control for marine equipment should be put on the agenda as soon as possible considering both military and ecological aspects the noise measurement of ship propeller as an indicator of noise prediction accuracy is the basis of noise analysis there has been a field noise measurement to an lng carrier under the speed of 9 and 19knots kellett et al 2013 the comparison between experimental and simulative results revealed that while providing more generally accurate results the rotating mesh didn t provide the same realistic details of the spectral levels as the moving frame of reference method although the field noise test can capture the real noise of ship the test costs a lot and there have been many interference factors in order to provide invaluable underwater radiated noise urn data of a full scale vessel extrapolated urn data based on the tunnel tests was compared with the data obtained from the full scale trials with the princess royal batuhan et al 2016 the research proves that the medium size facilities using dummy hull models with wake screens can still provide a very useful means for the urn investigations the noise of ship is made up of structural noise hydrodynamic noise and propeller noise as for auv motor drivers and relatively low speeds makes that propeller noise has a higher proportion the noise measurement especially for propeller usually take place in cavitation tunnel in order to investigate its performance there have been many experiments on the standard propellers under non cavitation and cavitation condition the meridian standard propeller was tested in the emerson cavitation tunnel and the flow field was filmed with high speed cameras acquiring obvious cavitation photos batuhan et al 2018 the recorded data revealed the importance of the observed instantaneous cavitation dynamics on the time pressure signals and their consequent impact in the frequency domain with the model and prototype noise data provide by samsung heavy industries shi the novel scaling law has better agreement with the prototype tvc noise measurement than the prototype tvc noise level predicted by the modified ittc noise estimation rule jisoo and seong 2017 in addition to the noise measurement on propellers the comparison between ect emerson cavitation tunnel and unige university of genoa cavitation tunnel was conducted firstly by university of genoa in terms of measured sound pressure levels propeller open water performance cavitation observations and cavitation inception characteristics giorgio et al 2017 in the area of noise prediction of ship and propeller a significant amount of recent work in this field has been focused on the application of acoustic analogy theory the acoustic analogy theory was originally developed by lighthill in 1952 which is called lighthill s acoustic analogy using to predict the aerodynamic noise generated by rotating bodies such as helicopter rotors and fan blades the lighthill equation was proceeded by ffowcs williams and hawkings and developed the ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation which considered moving boundary influence in the flow field and extend it to hydroacoustic problems the accuracy of noise prediction of ship and propeller lays on the flow field simulation the simulation combining reynolds average navier stokes rans turbulence model with the turbulence viscosity correction and the zwart cavitation model captured periodic cavitation development wu et al 2018 there has also been the simulation using des simulation and fw h equation on a normal pumpjet propulsor pjp model and a pjp model with the sawtooth duct denghui et al 2019 the research predicted the spectrum form 10 hz 5000 hz the hybrid method of noise prediction has been adopted in this study to enable the numerical prediction of radiated underwater noise from the auv under investigation as stated above existing simulation and experiment tend to measure and predict the noise of ship and propeller separately in terms of high cost and model size at present there is no scientific prediction method for auv underwater noise that has considered the influence of hull and there is no corresponding experiment to provide reference the study aims to design a numerical noise prediction model for an auv in design stage and conducted an open water test in a comprehensive test pool for reference applying the field noise measurement equipment 10 rotational speed conditions were tested and recorded for the noise data which were also simulated through acoustic analogy theory since numerical investigations on high frequency continuous spectrum are not taken into account only low frequency spectrum will be analyzed this paper intends to demonstrate results from field test and simulation 2 experiment validation data the noise measurements in this study was carried out in a comprehensive test pool 30 m 50 m 11 m of the key laboratory of underwater robotics in harbin engineering university heu the measured acoustic spectra were then used for validating the numerically predicted values as well as to indicate the relative accuracy of different rotational speeds the large scale comprehensive test pool was design for model test research on ship wave resistance and maneuverability maneuverability in waves marine engineering the test pool was upgraded for the noise measurements maintaining the ability of wave elimination as shown in fig 1 the test area is rectangular and spans a small crane above the hydrophone bruel and kjaer type 8100 was installed in the far field of the pool 20 m away from the auv and 5 m away from the pool wall and the pool bottom the hydrophone is tied by a rope and immersed in water virtual receivers are located in the numerical model to correspond with the closest point of approach cpa locations seen in the field trials the water temperature and speed of sound values used within the model is an average taken from the measured values the field acoustic spectra were then used for validating the numerically predicted values as well as to indicate the relative accuracy of different modelling variations the auv and propeller are made up of carbon fiber which aims to work under water 2000m the main design data is summarized in table 1 and shape of propeller is shown in fig 2 the two ends of the auv parallel middle body are equipped with two hooks for crane lifting the auv combined with the propeller is located in the center of the pool with a depth of 5 m the background noise was recorded at first in order to compare the exact noise while auv is working both the background noise and signal from working auv were processed using the fast fourier transform fft technique and then the signal amplitudes on corresponding frequencies were derived this experiment is different from previous experiments using similar laws and an auv with a depth of 2000m was tested for the experiment performed in cavitation tunnel or circulating water channel the background noise includes environmental and electrical signal noise machine noise noise caused by impellers driving water noise from power meters and shafting noise from the flow field and noise caused by back pressure changing in this experiment no inflow was set and rotation speeds for the propeller were controlled by electronic motor to get as much data as possible the rotational speed of propeller varies from 100 to 1000rpm at the step of 100rpm making it 10 working conditions the acquisition of background noise should be started one month before experiment it is worth noting that when measuring the noise of ten working conditions they are also in different time periods so after determining the half hour test window period of one working condition the background noise must be in the same test window period after the noise measurement experiment is over firstly average the background noise measurement results during the experiment window period next subtract the background noise from the noise measurement results measured in the experiment the result is the true propeller radiated noise the photos taken during the test are shown in the fig 3 3 methodology the radiated noise is analyzed in three main steps and the flow diagram is shown in fig 4 in the first step the flow field information such as velocity and pressure fluctuations are obtained through k ω sst model shear stress transfer with the cfd mesh then noise sources are computed from the flow field information with the interpolation between the cfd mesh and the acoustic mesh the last step includes the simulation of the acoustic wave propagation using the lighthill s acoustic analogy theory with commercial software actran that has been used in acoustic simulation sandboge

employed to simulate a strong adverse pressure gradient flow field by considering the effect of wall shear in the prediction of the rotate flow this model combines the advantages of the k and ω models and can be used to compute the flow separation region it is one of the most advanced two equation turbulence models and is superior in its calculation of the viscous ambient flow field it has also been suggested that the accuracy of results in such work might benefit form coupling with a more complex hydrodynamic solver such as the direct numerical simulation dns or large eddy simulation les solvers as opposed to a rans based solver nevertheless providing promising results investigation into coupling des les models with the acoustic analogy equation requires finer grid and computational time in this study a pressure based coupled solver is used for the governing equations of the numerical computation spatial discretization of the convection term is performed using a second order upwind scheme and discretization of the dissipative term is performed using a second order central difference scheme weiss and smith 1995 in solving the governing equation of turbulence model above prism layer will significantly affect the accuracy of hydrodynamic results therefore for the purposes of this work where accuracy must be balanced against run time and complexity the k ω based sst model is adopted and a resolution of the boundary layer of over 10 points is required in order to estimate the grid convergence three grid levels including coarse medium and fine grids validate the mesh independence the dimensionless torque coefficient and thrust coefficient of the propeller are chosen as convergence criterion for the reason that the tested propeller is low skew the propeller au5 50 is selected to perform the study of grid convergence the comparison of cfd results between open water characteristics of propeller au5 50 calculated by three grids are shown in fig 5 the results of open water characteristics calculated by the grids for propeller au5 50 at j 0 4 is shown in fig 6 it can be observed from the figure that the difference between computational and standard values is small in the whole simulation range overall the solution with medium grids shows best convergence 3 2 governing equation the sst k ω turbulence model solves two transport equations one for the turbulent kinetic energy k and one for the turbulent frequency ω the stress tensor is computed from the eddy viscosity concept the corresponding equations of k the turbulence kinetic energy and ω the specific dissipation rate are 1 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j 2 ρ ω t ρ u j ω x j ρ γ μ t p k β ρ ω 2 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j x j μ σ k μ t k x j where f1 is a harmonic

computed by 5 μ t ρ a 1 k max a 1 ω ω f 2 6 f 2 tanh max 2 k β ω d 500 v d 2 ω where d is the distance to the nearest wall and ω is the vorticity magnitude the default values of the constants in the eq 5 and eq 6 are usually defined as follows σk 1 0 σω2 0 85616 β 0 09 a1 0 31 3 3 lighthill s acoustic analogy theory the sound features of the flow field is acquired through lighthill s acoustic analogy theory which is derived from n s equations navier stokes equations due to the nonlinearity and the coupling of flow and acoustics the sound field is divided into near field and far field the near field is the source area and the far field is the radiation area this study assumes that flow in the radiation area has no effect on the sound feature in this assumption the continuity equation and the momentum equation are simplified and used to get the lighthill s acoustic analogy equation 7 ρ t 2 c 0 2 2 ρ t i j x i x j where is the lighthill s stress tensor which can be written as 8 t i j ρ v i v j τ i j δ i j p p 0 c 0 2 ρ ρ 0 in resolving the equation some assumptions are made on the one hand the small stress tensor is ignored according to the actual flow conditions on the other hand the interaction between flow and sound is ignored so that there is no interaction between them in this paper ignoring the fluctuation of fluid density and pressure the lighthill s stress tensor is simplified as t i j ρ v i v j 4 numerical modelling set up 4 1 cfd model setup the cfd simulation for the auv and its underwater noise is carried out in full scale an approach which is rarely taken the enclosing rectangular domain of size 30 50 10 m3 surrounds the 5 235 m hull and propeller the centroid of the auv coincides with that of the domain the stationary region included all elements except the propeller and enclosing cylinder which were included in the rotating region the forward and aft faces of the enclosing cylinder as well as its circumference are selected as the fluid fluid interface which located between stationary and rotating region the surrounding and under surfaces are set to wall condition and up surface is set to opening condition mesh generation was carried out using the automatic meshing tool in icem cfd resulting in a computation mesh of approximately 6 4 million cells in total a typical medium density grid there is a gradually encryption of grid in the area around the hull and propeller especially the region where the complex flow properties are appropriately captured the grid in the aft section of the auv and the propeller is shown in fig 7 the frequency ranges from 80 to 1200hz is the focus of this study in order to ensure that results up to this value are obtained with a sufficient level of accuracy a time step of 0 0004 is used throughout the maximum run time is set to 5s and the number iteration of inner iterations per each full iteration is limited to 10 it equates to around 125000 iterations in per simulation a 2nd order implicit unsteady simulation has been used with a k ω sst turbulence model thrust and torque values are also monitored for comparison once the unsteady calculation is over flow field value is export for acoustic analogy calculation 4 2 acoustic analogy model setup the acoustic calculation region is the same size as stated in section 2 in this study a permeable source surface which encloses the auv is placed within the flow and is used as the radiating surface for the acoustic model rather than the propeller and hull surfaces used previously the permeable surface is selected as surface source and the region surrounded by it is selected as volume source this surface will then allow for the monopole and dipole sources from the hull and propeller surfaces to be captured as well as the quadrupole sources within the flow such as those arising from turbulence the permeable surface takes the form of a cuboid which encloses the entirety of the auv and part of the flow previous study on the optimum location of the surface reveals that the location and size will not affect the results significantly the far field of the acoustic calculation region is selected as the radiation area the frequency range is as follows 9 f max 1 2 δ t 10 f min δ f 1 n δ t this study focuses on the range of 80 1200 hz according to the time step as stated in section 4 1 the maximum frequency can be predicted is 1250 hz in actran the element of acoustic grid needs to satisfy the requirement that there should be at least 6 nodes in each acoustic wavelength making the maximum size of the acoustic grid element 200 mm the surrounding and down boundaries are selected as wall boundary and up boundary is selected as acoustic infinite boundary condition the condition setting is shown in fig 8 in the noise simulation the boundary has been as concrete material aiming at the simulation of reverberation 5 results and discussion the following sections outline the acoustic results achieved from the simulations and experiment based on different rotational speeds and discuss the significance of these results in the context of general recommendations for hydroacoustic modelling the machinery noise contribution is also not accounted for in these results 5 1 flow filed discussion fig 9 above only intercepts the stable part of the thrust curve which includes at least 2 pulsating thrust cycle it should be noted that there are 2 similar pulsating curves in each cycle of the thrust curve one of which has a peak value greater than the other this phenomenon differs from the feature of open water simulation of propeller as the research before it indicates that there will be irregular vibration noise of propeller in the field test and simulation it can be seen form table 2 that with rotational speed rising to 700 rpm cavitation occurs due to the large size of the test pool the speed of the propeller was not clearly observed it is foreseeable that when the speed reached 700 rpm the feature of the spectra from experiment will be different 5 2 narrowband spectral noise in fig 10 the blue characteristics correspond to the simulative results and the orange characteristics correspond to the experimental results experimental and numerical results are comparable from 80 to 1200 hz the results in fig 9 above show that the spectral curves are close to each other between simulative and experimental results between 100 600rpm rotational speeds at the lower frequencies from 300 to 500 hz curves from experiment gives higher noise results this may due to that low frequencies noise produced from propeller and hull vibration looking more specifically at the variations for simulation and experiment results between 100 600rpm rotational speeds although on the frequency band the results agree well it can be seen that there are no tonal peaks which is present in experiment results shown in simulation results and do not replicate the spectra seen in the fields measurements as accurately with the rotational speed rise to 700rpm the discrepancy between simulative and experimental results increase this gap in results between field and modelled data can be contributed to lack of representation of cavitation noise as well as difficulties in recreating an accurate representation of real conditions in a mathematical model when the governing equations switched into the governing equations for multi phase mixture and applying cavitation model the volume fraction of vapor rises while that of liquid drops while there is single one fluid medium considered in the calculation of the acoustic equation which is the reason for 20 25 db gap in the four examples where the rotation speed is higher than 700 rpm at higher frequencies the spectrum curve of numerical simulation has a downward trend but the measurement curves do not in addition to the effects of cavitation noise the effects of the acoustic grid scale as introduced in section 4 2 should also be considered noise measurement experiments are performed under reverberation conditions so the acoustic grid requirements for numerical simulations under the same boundary conditions are more stringent than cfd grids from an engineering perspective it is necessary and economical to use the infinite element method to reduce the size of the computational domain for numerical simulation of noise however in this paper the method of reducing the calculation domain is not adopted which also brings a compromise on the size of the grid that is in the numerical simulation the length of the grid is slightly increased to reduce the requirements for computer performance 5 3 1 3 octave noise in fig 11 the blue characteristics correspond to the simulative results and the orange characteristics correspond to the experimental results experimental and numerical results are comparable up to the central frequency of 1000 hz with overall sound pressure level ospl listed and compared both the shape of hydroacoustic curves is similar between the rotational speed in 100 600rpm the trend of simulation results is close to experiment results in the range of center frequency from 250 to 500hz experiment results are larger than simulation results clearly the gap as mentioned indicates the influence of structure noise when the cavitation occurs the sound pressure level rises from high frequency to low frequency the trend indicates that cavitation noise affects largely in high frequency and with cavitation growing cavitation contributes largely to low frequency noise above a frequency of about 100 hz the discrepancy of both results is significant higher frequency value higher discrepancy 6 conclusion this study conducts a constrain model test of auv to measure the far field noise meanwhile a cfd simulation and acoustic analogy simulation on the model of auv under the same boundary condition is carried out the hydrodynamic performance of auv and the diversity between simulative and experimental results is discussed the spectrum curve is the focus of the study the thrust curve is selected as the main reference index of the flow field in cfd calculation there are two thrust fluctuation curves in each cycle of the propeller and the peak of one cycle is larger the irregular small peaks present in each cycle mean that the propeller thus generates vibration a noise prediction of the auv was performed using a hybrid approach and the noise data was included in the spectrogram including a 1 3 octave transform the comparison between the results of experiment and simulation under no cavitation conditions indicates that there is vibration noise rising from propeller and hull irregular vibration the hybrid method shows less accuracy when the cavitation occurs resulting from the single medium in lighthill s equation further investigation is recommended to predict the vibration noise of propeller and hull other than the vibration noise the

21996,the wide range use of marine equipment has greatly increased the underwater radiated noise urn level creating more threat to marine life autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the solutions to reduce the use of large marine equipment and then decrease the noise aiming at the noise control of auv this study conducted a far field noise measurement experiment on an auv working on 10 different conditions which is rarely measured the hybrid method predicting the noise with lighthill equation based on unsteady flow field data from cfd calculation is adopted the results from experiment and simulation indicates that the simulative results are in good agreements with experimental results and the propeller will still generate noise due to the irregular vibration of the propeller which is about 3 5 db with the occurrence of cavitation the sound pressure level spl increases sharply and there will be a wide gap between experimental and simulative noise data owing to the single phase considered in the lighthill equation the analysis of the experimental and simulative results highlights the existence of structure excitation noise ranging from 300 to 500 hz and the shortcoming of noise prediction of the hybrid method under cavitation stage keywords auv lighthill equation propeller cfd underwater radiated noise 1 introduction the increasing scale of general shipping activities and one of the emissions underwater radiated noise urn have been under the spotlight hildebrand 2009 due to the increasing scale of marine equipment noise level in seas especially near harbors has increased constantly and interfered with the daily life of mammals including the communication hunting and breeding merchant et al 2014 madsen 2005 recent studies have shown that noise also influences fish and invertebrates when courting and laying eggs julia et al 2016 matthew et al 2013 in addition to the protection of marine life marine equipment used in military itself has stricter requirements for noise control classifying the sonar target based on its acoustic signal characteristics is considered to be an effective sonar application method on the one hand oceanography carral et al 2018 martinelli et al 2016 sonar modeling and engineering mohammad and hassan 2019 abraham 2008 and also statistical processing hurtós et al 2017 miles et al 2006 are taken into account to improve the accuracy of classification on the other hand random methods including artificial intelligence ai methods najafzadeh et al 2016a najafzadeh et al 2016b najafzadeh and sarkamaryan 2018 have resulted in significant improvements in classification efficiency more and more advanced sonar technology poses a more serious challenge to the survivability of autonomous underwater vehicles in the execution of missions therefore the urn control for marine equipment should be put on the agenda as soon as possible considering both military and ecological aspects the noise measurement of ship propeller as an indicator of noise prediction accuracy is the basis of noise analysis there has been a field noise measurement to an lng carrier under the speed of 9 and 19knots kellett et al 2013 the comparison between experimental and simulative results revealed that while providing more generally accurate results the rotating mesh didn t provide the same realistic details of the spectral levels as the moving frame of reference method although the field noise test can capture the real noise of ship the test costs a lot and there have been many interference factors in order to provide invaluable underwater radiated noise urn data of a full scale vessel extrapolated urn data based on the tunnel tests was compared with the data obtained from the full scale trials with the princess royal batuhan et al 2016 the research proves that the medium size facilities using dummy hull models with wake screens can still provide a very useful means for the urn investigations the noise of ship is made up of structural noise hydrodynamic noise and propeller noise as for auv motor drivers and relatively low speeds makes that propeller noise has a higher proportion the noise measurement especially for propeller usually take place in cavitation tunnel in order to investigate its performance there have been many experiments on the standard propellers under non cavitation and cavitation condition the meridian standard propeller was tested in the emerson cavitation tunnel and the flow field was filmed with high speed cameras acquiring obvious cavitation photos batuhan et al 2018 the recorded data

sources within the flow such as those arising from turbulence the permeable surface takes the form of a cuboid which encloses the entirety of the auv and part of the flow previous study on the optimum location of the surface reveals that the location and size will not affect the results significantly the far field of the acoustic calculation region is selected as the radiation area the frequency range is as follows 9 f max 1 2 δ t 10 f min δ f 1 n δ t this study focuses on the range of 80 1200 hz according to the time step as stated in section 4 1 the maximum frequency can be predicted is 1250 hz in actran the element of acoustic grid needs to satisfy the requirement that there should be at least 6 nodes in each acoustic wavelength making the maximum size of the acoustic grid element 200 mm the surrounding and down boundaries are selected as wall boundary and up boundary is selected as acoustic infinite boundary condition the condition setting is shown in fig 8 in the noise simulation the boundary has been as concrete material aiming at the simulation of reverberation 5 results and discussion the following sections outline the acoustic results achieved from the simulations and experiment based on different rotational speeds and discuss the significance of these results in the context of general recommendations for hydroacoustic modelling the machinery noise contribution is also not accounted for in these results 5 1 flow filed discussion fig 9 above only intercepts the stable part of the thrust curve which includes at least 2 pulsating thrust cycle it should be noted that there are 2 similar pulsating curves in each cycle of the thrust curve one of which has a peak value greater than the other this phenomenon differs from the feature of open water simulation of propeller as the research before it indicates that there will be irregular vibration noise of propeller in the field test and simulation it can be seen form table 2 that with rotational speed rising to 700 rpm cavitation occurs due to the large size of the test pool the speed of the propeller was not clearly observed it is foreseeable that when the speed reached 700 rpm the feature of the spectra from experiment will be different 5 2 narrowband spectral noise in fig 10 the blue characteristics correspond to the simulative results and the orange characteristics correspond to the experimental results experimental and numerical results are comparable from 80 to 1200 hz the results in fig 9 above show that the spectral curves are close to each other between simulative and experimental results between 100 600rpm rotational speeds at the lower frequencies from 300 to 500 hz curves from experiment gives higher noise results this may due to that low frequencies noise produced from propeller and hull vibration looking more specifically at the variations for simulation and experiment results between 100 600rpm rotational speeds although on the frequency band the results agree well it can be seen that there are no tonal peaks which is present in experiment results shown in simulation results and do not replicate the spectra seen in the fields measurements as accurately with the rotational speed rise to 700rpm the discrepancy between simulative and experimental results increase this gap in results between field and modelled data can be contributed to lack of representation of cavitation noise as well as difficulties in recreating an accurate representation of real conditions in a mathematical model when the governing equations switched into the governing equations for multi phase mixture and applying cavitation model the volume fraction of vapor rises while that of liquid drops while there is single one fluid medium considered in the calculation of the acoustic equation which is the reason for 20 25 db gap in the four examples where the rotation speed is higher than 700 rpm at higher frequencies the spectrum curve of numerical simulation has a downward trend but the measurement curves do not in addition to the effects of cavitation noise the effects of the acoustic grid scale as introduced in section 4 2 should also be considered noise measurement experiments are performed under reverberation conditions so the acoustic grid requirements for numerical simulations under the same boundary conditions are more stringent than cfd grids from an engineering perspective it is necessary and economical to use the infinite element method to reduce the size of the computational domain for numerical simulation of noise however in this paper the method of reducing the calculation domain is not adopted which also brings a compromise on the size of the grid that is in the numerical simulation the length of the grid is slightly increased to reduce the requirements for computer performance 5 3 1 3 octave noise in fig 11 the blue characteristics correspond to the simulative results and the orange characteristics correspond to the experimental results experimental and numerical results are comparable up to the central frequency of 1000 hz with overall sound pressure level ospl listed and compared both the shape of hydroacoustic curves is similar between the rotational speed in 100 600rpm the trend of simulation results is close to experiment results in the range of center frequency from 250 to 500hz experiment results are larger than simulation results clearly the gap as mentioned indicates the influence of structure noise when the cavitation occurs the sound pressure level rises from high frequency to low frequency the trend indicates that cavitation noise affects largely in high frequency and with cavitation growing cavitation contributes largely to low frequency noise above a frequency of about 100 hz the discrepancy of both results is significant higher frequency value higher discrepancy 6 conclusion this study conducts a constrain model test of auv to measure the far field noise meanwhile a cfd simulation and acoustic analogy simulation on the model of auv under the same boundary condition is carried out the hydrodynamic performance of auv and the diversity between simulative and experimental results is discussed the spectrum curve is the focus of the study the thrust curve is selected as the main reference index of the flow field in cfd calculation there are two thrust fluctuation curves in each cycle of the propeller and the peak of one cycle is larger the irregular small peaks present in each cycle mean that the propeller thus generates vibration a noise prediction of the auv was performed using a hybrid approach and the noise data was included in the spectrogram including a 1 3 octave transform the comparison between the results of experiment and simulation under no cavitation conditions indicates that there is vibration noise rising from propeller and hull irregular vibration the hybrid method shows less accuracy when the cavitation occurs resulting from the single medium in lighthill s equation further investigation is recommended to predict the vibration noise of propeller and hull other than the vibration noise the cavitation noise need to be paid more attention in the future credit author statement changli yu conceptualization writing review editing supervision funding acquisition renzhi wang methodology

21997,this work presents a comprehensive numerical study of the impact of aeration and hydroelasticity on slamming loads and structural response of elastic plates during a water entry event a numerical tool is developed with openfoam and validated against experimental data from available benchmark tests an extensive parameter investigation revealed that the structural flexibility of a plate exerts a noticeable effect on slamming loads for pure water entry cases which almost completely disappears when the water is aerated the effect of aeration on slamming loads is quite significant with only 0 5 air fraction aeration can reduce substantially the peak slamming forces but as the load duration increases at the same time the force impulse remains almost constant the structural response in terms of strain rates reacts directly on the hydrodynamic loads for stiff plates and exhibits resonating effects and less influence on aeration levels at higher flexibilities this suggests that the structural performance in a slamming event must be carefully considered and is only directly related to loads for very stiff structures for this purpose a new functional relation between peak impact forces pressures and impact velocity in the presence of aeration is suggested within the present study keywords fluid structure interaction aeration water entry hydroelasticity slamming 1 introduction despite the significant number of studies performed over nearly the past 90 years water impact problems which in marine technology literature are referred to as slamming dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 sun 2007 in general and wave slamming in particular remain a main source of uncertainty in the design and operation of marine vessels and structures dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 kapsenberg 2011 shams et al 2017 slamming occurs in a broad range of problems such as bow flare slamming wet deck slamming green water impact and sloshing in the ship industry and breaking wave slamming on marine and coastal structures dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 kapsenberg 2011 two major interconnected phenomena may be acknowledged as primary causes of current knowledge limitations concerning the slamming problem 1 the slamming phenomenon is an outcome of strongly coupled interactions between fluid and structure therefore the elastic interaction of fluid and structure may significantly affect wave impact loads and the response of the structure hildebrandt and schlurmann 2012 ibrahimbegovic et al 2012 kapsenberg 2011 2 in violent impact incidents which may occur in a breaking wave impact water entry or sloshing the existence of air in water as dispersed air bubbles or entrapped air packets will influence the temporal and local distribution of the impact pressure which in turn affects the response of the structure bredmose et al 2009 faltinsen et al 2004 hildebrandt 2012 kapsenberg 2011 korobkin et al 2011 ma et al 2016 simulating such a complex problem in a controlled environment with key processes such as aeration flow separation structural vibrations local cavitation etc in a physical model experiment is rarely achieved the highly complex nature of this phenomenon was first addressed by von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 who approached the problem by means of studying the vertical entry of simple shaped objects i e a flat plate a wedge and a cylinder into calm water which can be analytically solved with certain simplifying assumptions such as rigid body symmetric impact incompressible fluid irrotational flow neglection of gravity and no flow separation the case of a flat plate slamming onto a calm water surface is interesting largely because it resembles special cases in which the solid body and the water surface are nearly parallel to each other prior to the impact in such cases experimental observations have demonstrated that the so called cushioning effect of the air layer trapped between the water surface and the solid body plays an important role in the evolution of impact pressures on the solid body huera huarte et al 2011 ma et al 2016 van nuffel 2014 several researchers have investigated the role and effect of the entrapped air layer on a rigid plate at the instant of water entry including chuang 1970 ermanyuk and ohkusu 2005 lin and shieh 1997 van nuffel 2014 and verhagen 1967 based on experimental observations simplified analytical models which take the air cushion effect into account were developed by verhagen 1967 yamamoto et al 1983 korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 wilson 1991 and howison et al 1991 inclusion of the fluid structure interaction the so called hydroelasticity bereznitski 2001 chen et al 2006 faltinsen 2000 kapsenberg 2011 in water entry studies began with shibue et al 1993 who experimentally examined the water entry of a cylindrical shell only a few researches exist on vertical slamming of an elastic plate the first of which was implemented by faltinsen et al 1997 and followed by okada and sumi 2000 and van nuffel 2014 the role of entrained air bubbles in the water which in recent literature is termed aeration e g bredmose et al 2015 ma et al 2016 plumerault et al 2012a has been investigated reasonably well in the studies on breaking wave impact on rigid vertical walls i e bagnold 1939 oumeraci et al 1993 hattori et al 1994 wood et al 2000 bullock et al 2007 bredmose et al 2009 plumerault et al 2012a and bredmose et al 2015 they all agree that the breaker characteristics along with the air entrapment and air entrainment processes are among the most influential phenomena determining the magnitude and time history of the impact the existence of a mixture of air and water produced within the process of wave breaking and the impact itself has also been associated with the cushioning effect which refers to a reduction effect due to compressibility of the entrapped air in contrast in some cases the existence of entrained and entrapped air has been demonstrated to exert a resonating effect on the impact force on vertical walls however fewer investigations have addressed the role and effects of aeration before and during the instants of water entry two studies can be referred to in this respect zhang et al 2015 numerically examined the effect of fluid compressibility on peak slamming pressures during water entry of a rigid wedge and ma et al 2016 studied the entry of a rigid square flat plate into pure and aerated water applying the results of experimental and numerical modeling both researches demonstrated that the introduction and numerical representation of aeration can significantly reduce local pressure and total forces all of the above mentioned studies considered the phenomena of aeration and hydroelasticity separately and ignored the possible interaction and feedback mechanism of both phenomena in affecting the characteristics of slamming evolution and structural responses to the best of the authors knowledge no research has yet been performed to comprehensively elucidate the effects and feedback mechanisms of aeration and hydroelasticity with a focus on the characteristics of slamming evolution and structural response at the instant of water entry of a flat plate indeed understanding of such processes and interactions is still lacking and it remains unclear how and when complex processes such as aeration compressibility or hydroelasticity in slamming problems have to be taken into consideration for practical applications and design studies concerning the above points the main objectives of the present paper are i to develop and validate a numerical model capable of simulating the strongly coupled interaction of a flexible solid body and compressible fluid flow with a free surface and ii to apply the developed numerical model to investigate the interconnected effects of hydroelasticity and aeration on the characteristics of impact pressures and forces as well as the response of a flat plate during pure and aerated water entry slamming events focal points of the study are to analyze the characteristics of slamming loads in terms of the temporal and local evolution of slamming pressures and forces as well as the plate response defined by the bending strain in the plate during entry into water with different vertical velocities the remainder of this paper is structured as follows the theory and background of the numerical model developed within this study on the openfoam platform jasak et al 2007 weller et al 1998 by modifying existing flow solvers and combining them together in a modified fsi fluid structure interaction package are briefly discussed in section 2 then the model is tested and validated against available experimental data in section 3 in section 4 the set up of a systematic parameter study is presented and the results of the performed simulations and following data analysis are discussed in section 5 finally the main conclusions from the study are drawn in section 6 2 problem description and numerical methodology the considered problem consists of an elastic flat plate with an initial velocity and zero deadrize angle entering an initially calm water tank fig 1 the water may be pure or aerated the whole process of slamming occurs in a relatively short duration on the order of milliseconds at such a time scale certain processes such as bubble coalescence and bubble rising may be neglected the assumption in this study is that the air bubbles in an aerated water body are distributed homogeneously and aeration is quantified by a specified uniform air fraction β v b v f where v b is the volume of bubbles dispersed in the aerated fluid volume v f this simplified model constitutes a proper approach for describing the mixture in a slamming simulation which is a very short duration process and has been effectively applied in recent similar studies such as wood et al 2000 bullock et al 2007 bredmose et al 2009 and plumerault et al 2012b in this way modeling bubbly water is performed by changing the physical properties of the water phase the compressibility of aerated water compared to pure water might constitute the most influential physical parameter when the effect of aeration on the dynamic characteristics of impact is under consideration compressibility may be characterized by the speed of sound in the water air mixture plumerault et al 2012b which is calculated by the wallis equation as follows murrone and guillard 2005 1 1 ρ c 2 β ρ a c a 2 1 β ρ w c w 2 where c c a and c w are the speed of sound in the mixture pure air and pure water respectively the two phase fluid domain is assumed to consist of two immiscible phases aerated pure water and air with no slip between phases hence it is suitable to treat both phases as one aggregated fluid with a single velocity field and therefore to solve one single momentum equation for the whole domain which is numerically much less expensive and simpler than the two fluid approach in this approach the properties of the fluid like density will be defined as an averaged quantity 2 ρ α 1 ρ 1 α 2 ρ 2 where α 1 α 2 ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the volume fractions and densities of phase 1 and phase 2 namely the liquid phase and the gas phase such averaging scheme is also conducted on other varying properties like viscosity molar weight thermal conductivity etc the fluid solid interaction problem in this study is a two field problem with a solid field plate and a fluid field water and air sharing a common interface at the interface γ the following conditions should be satisfied 3 u f u s 4 u f u s 5 τ f τ s 0 where u u and τ are the displacements velocities and traction forces on the interface respectively with subscripts f and s denoting the attribution of the variable to fluid and structure in a fsi problem three interrelating fundamental questions about the approach toward the solution should be answered felippa et al 2001 which are 1 what kinematic description system is chosen for the domains 2 which coupling strategy is to be applied and 3 how are the domains and equations discretized answering the above questions is strongly related to the specific type of the problem to be solved and numerous combinations of choices can be found in literature in the following the choices and assumptions are explained which have been made for the development of the numerical model in the current study 2 1 kinematical description of the domains there are 3 major types of methods for the kinematical description of fsi problems immersed boundary ib methods peskin 2002 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale methods donea et al 2004 and fully lagrangian particle methods monaghan 1985 regarding the need for accurate calculation of pressure field and free surface the ale methods still have higher performance than the other two methods and therefore an ale framework is applied for the current study the drawbacks of the other two approaches in this respect are explained for example in hou et al 2012 and wall et al 2006 for ib methods and in liu and liu 2010 graham and hughes 2008 and nguyen et al 2008 for fully lagrangian particle methods 2 2 coupling strategy in this work the partitioned approach deparis et al 2006b felippa et al 2001 matthies and steindorf 2002 is favored over the monolithic approach bazilevs et al 2013 hübner et al 2004 as it provides modularity felippa et al 2001 which means one can choose separate formulations for each domain as well as discretization meshing and solving techniques that fit best to each domain the classic direct force motion transfer dfmt method with an implicit block gauss seidel bgs fixed point algorithm kassiotis et al 2011 is utilized here for the interfacing process the solving process for each time step aims to find the interface displacement which satisfies 5 the other two interface conditions 3 and 4 are enforced by the no slip boundary condition in the fluid domain each domain solver regardless of its details can be associated with a steklov poincaré operator deparis et al 2006a such that 6 s f λ τ f 7 s s λ τ s each of the above operators also has an inverse so that any given traction force is associated with an interface displacement this description of inverse operator is associated with the solid domain solver in which the traction forces are the boundary conditions and the outputs are the displacements using the above formulation we can rewrite the condition 5 as follows 8 s s 1 s f λ λ eq 8 is solved here by applying the bgs algorithm with the following iteration 9 λ k 1 λ k ω k λ λ k where 10 λ s s 1 s f λ k and ω k is a relaxation parameter calculated for each iteration step with aitken s method which is proven to be an effective scheme in accelerating the convergence küttler and wall 2008 2 3 domain governing equations discretization and solving algorithms 2 3 1 fluid domain the integral form of the mass equation may be written as 11 t v ρ d v v ρ v v ˆ ds 0 where v ˆ is the mesh velocity and ρ is defined as in 2 the integral form of the fluid momentum equations is 12 t v ρ v d v v ρ v v v ˆ ds v t b d v where the stress tensor t is a linear function of the strain rate and is given by 13 t μ v v t 2 3 μ v p i and b is the volumetric force source term 14 b ρ g σ κ α where the first term is the gravity force and the second term is the volumetric force representing the surface tension acting near the interface zone brackbill et al 1992 the fsi interaction term in the fluid domain equations is actualized by the mesh velocity in the solid fluid interface boundary in the present paper we focus on investigating the aeration induced compressibility effect on hydrodynamic impact loading and the corresponding structure responses therefore we assume that the fluid flow undergoes an isothermal process for which the equation of state is given by 15 ρ i ψ i p ρ i 0 ψ i 1 c i 2 where c is the speed of sound inside of the fluid ψ is the compressibility parameter and subscript i denotes each phase the speed of sound in the air phase is 340 m s in pure water is 1490 m s and in the aerated water is calculated by 1 the free surface is modeled using the volume of fluid vof method for compressible flow solving the following transport equation 16 t v α 1 d v v α 1 v v ˆ ds v α 1 1 α 1 v c v ˆ ds v s α α 1 d v where the source term s α is 17 s α 1 α 1 ψ 2 ρ 2 ψ 1 ρ 1 p t v p v the third term on the left hand side of 16 is called the interface compression term added as an anti diffusion term to the equation in order to increase the interface resolution by steepening the gradient of the volume fraction for details see rusche 2003 weller 2008 eqs 11 12 and 16 i e mass momentum and volume fraction respectively are reformulated linearized and discretized in to three sets of equations by applying the finite volume methods on a moving collocated mesh details of the procedure can be found in miller et al 2013 jasak 1996 rusche 2003 and jasak and tukovic 2006 the solution algorithm for each time step involves an outer momentum predictor loop which estimates the velocity field and an inner corrector loop based on the piso issa 1986 method 2 3 2 solid domain the solid domain is described in lagrangian configuration in which the balance of linear momentum for an elastic solid can be expressed as follows 18 v 0 ρ s 0 t u t d v v 0 n s f t d s v 0 ρ s 0 f d v where f is the solid body force s is the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor f 0 u i t is the deformation gradient u is the solid displacement vector and subscript 0 indicates that the quantities are with respect to the reference configuration the st venant kirchhoff constitutive law relating the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor to the green strain tensor 19 s λ s t r e i 2 μ s e closes the system of equations where λ s and μ s are the lamé coefficients and the green strain tensor e is related to the displacement vector by 20 e 1 2 0 u 0 u t 0 u 0 u t in order to avoid complications when using different discretization techniques in two domains the solid domain equations are also discretized with a cell centered finite volume method which has been shown to be both effective and accurate fallah 2004 jasak and weller 2000 slone et al 2003 tsui et al 2013 tuković et al 2015 the details of the procedure are not discussed here but can be found in tuković et al 2015 and jasak and weller 2000 2 3 3 mesh motion the mesh deformation should follow the movement of the fluid solid interface to address this the laplace smoothing equations löhner and yang 1998 which have been demonstrated to be robust in large deformations and computationally efficient kassiotis 2008 were chosen to solve the mesh motion in this study the laplace smoothing equations to be solved along with the fluid and solid equations are defined as follows 21 γ v ˆ 0 where v ˆ is the grid velocity field and γ is a mesh diffusion coefficient in order to maintain the mesh quality and prevent mesh distortion and deterioration due to large displacements particularly near the moving boundary the following variable mesh diffusion coefficient is applied 22 γ r 1 r 2 where r is the distance to the nearest interface point 2 3 4 boundary conditions in order to reduce the computational time a symmetry plane boundary condition was applied in all of the simulations cf fig 1 the boundary conditions for all variables are summarized in table 1 2 3 5 numerical flowchart the procedure for solving the coupled system as a partitioned approach for strong coupling between two domains is a fixed point gauss seidel algorithm with dynamic relaxation the algorithm can be explained as follows 1 if we consider each time step of the coupling counted by n and the iteration steps counted by i then in the first iteration step of each new time step the interface is predicted by a second order predictor 23 λ n 1 1 λ n δ t 2 3 λ n λ n 1 2 the mesh motion solver moves the mesh using the predicted interface displacement as a boundary condition and the new mesh motion velocity is obtained and transferred to the fluid solver 3 the fluid flow problem is solved in the ale formulation using the piso algorithm for pressure velocity coupling and the pressure and viscous stresses are computed and transferred to the solid solver as neumann boundary conditions the exchange of information in the fluid solid interface is conducted by using a linear point to point interpolation 4 the solid iteration solver with the updated boundary conditions provides a new predicted interface displacement λ n 1 i 1 5 the interface displacement residual is calculated as 24 r γ n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 6 if the interface residual is not less than the tolerance criterion an iteration correction is used 25 λ n 1 i 1 1 ω n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i ω n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 1 where ω n 1 i 1 is the dynamic relaxation parameter which is calculated in every iteration step by using the aitken δ 2 method based on this method the dynamic relaxation parameter for each iteration step is calculated as 26 ω n 1 i 1 ω n 1 i r γ n 1 i t r γ n 1 i 1 r γ n 1 i r γ n 1 i 1 r γ n 1 i 2 the iteration continues until the residual becomes less than the convergence criterion which has been set for the present study as 1 0 6 m 3 implementation and validation the numerical methodology summarized above has been implemented on the open source numerical coding platform openfoam the existing two phase flow solver package compressibleinterfoam has been modified to be added as a flow solver class to the fsi package fsifoam cardiff et al 2018 tuković et al 2018 the fsifoam package was also modified to handle the case of a moving solid with initial velocity and automatic time stepping based on the courant number first a mesh sensitivity study was performed for a typical water entry simulation case which showed that the impact pressure peak becomes insensitive to the mesh fineness when the near wall cell dimensions are less than 0 4 mm fig 2 for such a fine mesh the total number of grid cells in the present two dimensional 2d fluid domain is close to 150000 simulating a fsi water entry case in which both fluid phases air and water are compressible for an impact duration of 0 03 s costs 63 h of computation time using 12 xeon x5670 2 93 ghz cpus accordingly the current parameter study with nearly 120 simulation cases would not have been feasible to be done in full three dimensional 3d form and therefore all of the simulation cases including the validation tests were carried out in 2d form for the validation of the present numerical model no experimental data which simultaneously include both phenomena of aeration and hydroelastic interaction are available therefore two different datasets have been utilized to assess the performance of the numerical model the first dataset reported in faltinsen et al 1997 involves the hydroelastic interaction of deformable square plates with pure water in drop impacts and the second one presented by ma et al 2016 considers entry of rigid square plates into aerated and pure water a brief description of validation tests applying the mentioned references is presented in the following 3 1 deformable plate water entry tests in their physical experiments faltinsen et al 1997 investigated the free fall water entry of a flat rectangular steel plate with dimensions of 1000 mm 500 mm 8 mm the plate was attached at the two ends of its 500 mm span to ballast weight plates the end connections had a controlled rotating stiffness the total mass of the drop rig including the plate and attached mass was 500 kg the plate was dropped against calm water as well as regular wave crests with a variant curvature radius from 1 5 m to 21 m the only available measurement data are from drop tests against wave crests with a 10 2 m curvature radius however as faltinsen et al 1997 reported the measurement results of drop tests against a water surface with such a large curvature radius were significantly close to those of the ones carried out against calm water nevertheless in order to optimally approximate the experimental conditions in the numerical simulation the initial water surface was set to a curvature with 10 2 m radius while the initial velocity within the entire fluid domain was set to zero since the numerical simulation covers only a very short time span of nearly 0 03 s the changing of the initial water surface curvature due to gravity prior to the impact is negligible the 2d numerical model of the dropping rig is depicted in fig 3 one numerical pressure probe and one numerical strain gauge were placed in the middle of the plate bottom recording the evolution of the time dependent pressure and strain like in the physical model the two ends of the plate are connected to a stiff plate at the top and are also used as an attached mass to set the total mass of the dropping rig model per unit area to 1000 kg m 2 which is the same as in the experiment the thickness and length of the connecting plates were determined in a way to provide similar end conditions to those in the experiment the impact velocity of the dropping simulation was 3 m s fig 4 illustrates a comparison of the results from the experimental data and the present numerical simulation the pressure evolution at the middle of the plate bottom is depicted in the left plot and the bending strain time series is drawn in the right plot in the pressure time series of the experiment a very sharp peak can be obviously observed which has a very short duration of 0 2 ms the numerical model did not capture this sharp peak however faltinsen et al 1997 found a very large scatter in the measured peak pressures from the entry tests for a given impact velocity while they observed no meaningful difference in strain values reflecting the scatter in peak pressures these very sharp pressure peaks were highly sensitive to local details of the water surface and as faltinsen et al 1997 concluded they cannot be treated deterministically apart from this sharp peak the numerical model has generally fair agreement with the experimental data and overall duration and values of impact load and the subsequent negative pressure loading are reasonably similar concerning the strain time series the values within the first half period are also in good agreement and the numerically predicted maximum strain value is close to the experimental data the second half period of the numerical strain lasts approximately 4 ms longer than that of the experiment and has two close troughs this behavior can be explained by the fact that due to the 2d set up of the present numerical model a relatively large volume of air is trapped underneath the plate at the time of plate touchdown see fig 5 which is compressed in the first 10 ms of the impact and expands in the second half period of plate oscillation and does not allow the plate to oscillate in its own natural period in the experimental condition in which the trapped air has a smaller volume and ventilation is much faster and easier such interaction is much weaker therefore the second positive peak of numerical strain occurs approximately 7 ms later than that of the experimental strain 3 2 aerated and pure water entry of a rigid flat plate the second validation case considers aerated water for which the numerical results are compared to the physical model experiments of ma et al 2016 in their set up a mass composed of a rigid flat plate and two driver plates is dropped freely into a water tank fig 6 five miniature pressure transducers on the impact plate one in the center and four at 15 mm distance from the middle of the plate sides measured the pressure values during impact incidents in the numerical simulation the set up is two dimensional 2d and the mass of the impactor per unit area is set to 512 kg m 2 corresponding to the impactor mass of 32 kg in the experiment the impact velocity is set to 5 5 m s at the bottom of the experimental tank a bubble generator was installed under the dropping area to produce homogeneously aerated water with predetermined air fraction values for the validation of the numerical model two cases were simulated and compared to the experiments the pure water case and an aerated water case with an air fraction of β 0 8 first the case of plate entry into pure water shall be considered fig 7 presents the pressure time series at the middle and the side probes comparing the numerical model with the experimental data ma et al 2016 observed that in the impact pressure evolution three stages can be noticed particularly in the middle of the plate i a shock loading ii fluid expansion induced low sub atmospheric pressure and iii a weaker secondary loading this entire process occurs in a very short time span of less than 10 ms and is remarkably well simulated by the numerical model at the middle probe the numerical pressure starts to rise earlier and reaches a plateau of approximately 0 55 bar for nearly 0 5 ms before the actual shock loading takes place this primary loading occurs because the plate is initially positioned at the lowest possible elevation near the still water surface d i 1 cm in order to lower the effects of mesh deterioration due to the movement of the plate and subsequent mesh deformation however this artifact is tolerable as it has not influenced the actual shock loading process after the shock loading the compressed trapped air starts to expand which causes a sub atmospheric pressure underneath the plate this low pressure loading at the middle probe lasts for 3 5 ms 3 7 ms in the experiments and 5 5 ms in the numerical simulation the duration of fluid expansion loading at the side probes was 3 7 ms in the experiment and 3 2 ms in the numerical simulation table 2 summarizes the results for the high pressure shock loading which is very well simulated by the numerical model with peak values significantly close to the experimental results at both the middle and the side probes it should be noted that for the experiments the average peak pressures of the four side probes are shown in the table the same applies to the lifespan of the shock loading which is nearly 20 wider in the numerical model in fig 8 the numerical results with aerated water of 0 8 air fraction are compared to the experimental data at the middle probe the peak pressure values are very close but the rising time in the numerical simulation is significantly higher this can be attributed to the fact that due to the 2d set up of the present model the air layer between the plate bottom and the water surface has a much smaller escape route before the touchdown compared to real 3d conditions therefore the cushioning effect of the trapped air in the present model is significantly higher than the experiment which in turn reduces the peak pressure and increases the rising time the values of peak impact pressures and their time spans for the aerated water entry case are listed in table 3 an important point is that the time series of the side probes in the experiments are not synchronous and exhibited different variations which might be ascribed to water surface disturbances and other practical issues in the physical model experiments however the average peaks and the duration have a fair agreement with the experimental data another important point to be noted is that the sub atmospheric pressure loading is much weaker in the aerated water entry experiment and this trend is also captured by the numerical model 3 3 conclusion on validation in the first validation case the ability of the numerical model to capture the physics of hydroelasticity during a water entry simulation was investigated the numerical model has shown reasonable agreement with the experimental data on important trends of the evolution of strain and pressure during the impact time with some negligible differences occurring in the second half period for the strain time series which can mostly be attributed to the 2d set up of the simulation in the second water entry case the numerical model successfully showed the three stages of impact loading in the case of pure water entry shock load sub atmospheric loading and second pressure peak and the overall capability of the numerical tool to capture the effect of aeration on the fluid solid interaction problem seems acceptable 4 numerical simulation set up in order to elucidate the interactive effects of hydroelasticity and aeration on the impact loading and structural responses of flat plates during a water entry incident a comprehensive set of numerical simulations was designed and implemented the simulations were configured in five series s1 5 with individual impact velocity v i length of impact plate l and mass per unit area m a for each series as listed in table 4 within each series four different aeration ratios β 0 0 0 5 5 0 and 10 0 and six plates with 1st dry eigenfrequencies of the order of 152 hz 202 hz 254 hz 300 hz 502 hz and 3100 hz were investigated the eigenfrequency was varied by changing the thickness of the plate representing the degree of plate flexibility and the plate with the highest eigenfrequency can be assumed as a semi rigid plate all of the plates had the same material properties of steel modulus of elasticity e 2 1 1 0 11 pa poisson s ratio ν s 0 3 the end conditions of the plates were free as the results of the first validation case revealed that the pinned end condition significantly increases the volume of entrapped air and the resulting cushioning effect might overshadow the effect of aeration 5 results and discussion in this section the results of the numerical investigation are described first a thorough analysis of the impact loading in terms of impact force per unit width of the plate f and impact pressure p and its relation to aeration and hydroelasticity is presented subsequently the response of the plates to the impact in terms of the bending strain ε in the middle of the plate is analyzed and discussed 5 1 impact loads fig 9 presents the time histories of pressure at the middle of the plates during the impact incident each plot illustrates the time histories for three plates with different natural frequencies i e the most flexible plate f 152 hz the semi rigid plate f 3100 hz and one plate with a medium eigenfrequency f 300 hz the left plots are the results from pure water entry simulations while the right plots are the results of aerated water entry cases with 0 5 aeration level results are provided for series s1 s3 and s4 in order to analyze the effect of impact velocity s1 and s3 and plate length s3 and s4 the pressure time histories resemble those of the experiments of ma et al 2016 showing a single peak followed by a sub atmospheric loading and a secondary minor peak it can be noticed that only a small amount of aeration 0 5 causes a significant drop up to 73 in peak pressure for all cases the mean peak impact pressure in non aerated cases of series s3 is 25 times higher than that in series s1 while this ratio is considerably lower 9 8 in the aerated cases this finding will be discussed further in this section another important point is the effect of the plate flexibility on the peak pressure to achieve a clearer understanding of this the relative peak pressure normalized with the corresponding semi rigid case is drawn against the plate eigenfrequency for all cases with β 0 β 0 5 and β 5 in fig 10 one major point seen in fig 10 is that with the involvement of aeration the effect of plate flexibility on peak pressure declines significantly to the degree that with β 5 fig 10 right the difference between ratios becomes negligible considering the results of the pure water entry fig 10 left in all series except for series s5 the peak pressures generally increase with decreasing flexibility and a linear trend seems to exist in the relation between peak pressure and the logarithm of the natural frequency in series s5 the impact velocity of plates v i 7 5 m s is considerably higher than for the other series and it seems that in high speed vertical entry slamming the flexibility of the plate is relatively insignificant for the impact peak pressures the variability of the peak pressure due to variation of plate stiffness is considerably higher in simulation series s4 in which the length of plates was 60 larger than in the other series this implies that the plate length plays a key role in determining the share of hydroelasticity in water entry impact loads in fig 9 further points of interest are the duration and magnitude of negative pressure and the secondary pressure peak which could affect the response of plates after the first period of vibration as will be discussed later in section 5 2 the negative pressure duration in pure water entry cases varies considerably with the plate stiffness and generally with decreasing stiffness the negative pressure time increases it should be mentioned in this context that for the sake of numerical stability the minimum absolute fluid pressure had to be limited to 1 0 4 pa i e 0 9 bar relative to atmospheric pressure which can be observed in the plots particularly for the pure water entry in series s4 where the pressure does not go beneath this value in series s4 the variation of secondary pressure peak due to the variation of eigenfrequencies is significant while it is trivial in the s3 series since plate length is the only parameter that varies between the two series it could be assumed that this higher variation of the second pressure peak results from the increasing plate length another important aspect of water entry of a horizontal flat plate in the presence of aeration and hydroelasticity is the dependence of peak pressures and forces on impact velocity which can be seen in fig 11 in the left graph the peak pressure values of all simulations with pure water as well as aerated water are plotted against impact velocity some variations are noticeable for the same impact velocities due to the different plate flexibilities as discussed above despite these variations a clear trend of increasing peak pressure with increasing impact velocity can be observed for all aeration levels indicating a functional relationship between them this is determined by an interestingly simple power law function taking the compressibility parameter and the speed of sound into account in order to consider the effect of aeration 27 p m a x k p ρ v i 1 3 ln c where c is the speed of sound inside the aerated water eq 1 ρ is the water air mixture density and k p is a coefficient defined by 28 k p 21 27 12 46 e 32 098 β as the same trend can also be observed for the peak slamming forces per unit area which are shown in the right graph of fig 11 a similar power law function can be defined here 29 f m a x k f ρ v i 1 3 ln c where f m a x is the maximum value of the impact force per unit area and the coefficient k f depends on the aeration level in the following form 30 k f 24 3 45 7 β since certain parameters such as plate length mass etc are excluded here the above expressions may not be regarded as a general relationship for plates and additional investigation is necessary to reach a comprehensive conclusion the evolution of the impact pressure distribution along the half length of the plate is examined next which is plotted in fig 12 for series s1 and s3 low and medium impact velocity with the same aeration rates β 0 and β 0 5 and the same flexibilities f 150 hz 300 hz and 3000 hz as shown in fig 9 the plots in the odd columns of fig 12 represent the non aerated cases while the plots in the even columns are the results of simulations with aerated water β 0 5 for all cases the high slamming pressures in the shock loading are very concentrated in a time span of approximately 1 to 2 ms and in pure water cases the maximum pressure occurs at virtually all points simultaneously along the length of the plate while the contours are less symmetric in the aerated cases another noteworthy difference between the results of series s1 and s3 is the effect of aeration on the rising time and drop time of the peak pressure for series s1 practically no difference in rising time and drop time between the aerated and non aerated cases can be discerned from the plots in fig 12 whereas for series s3 both rising and drop time exhibit a significant increase when the water is aerated one can also see that the expansion of the drop time due to aeration is much larger than the rate of increase in rising time the mean rising time in series s3 for instance increases by 28 from 0 64 ms to 0 82 ms while the drop time increases by 56 from 0 9 ms to 1 38 ms fig 13 depicts the distribution of dimensionless pressure p ρ v i 2 along the half length of the plate at the time near to the peak slamming load for all five series with pure water entries left and aerated water entries right of plates with low medium and high eigenfrequency the figure shows that in pure water cases the gradient of the pressure along the half length of the plate is much steeper than in the aerated cases the trend that was observed in fig 9 is also noticeable here as in aerated cases the pressure curves of different plates are almost indistinguishable which implies that the impact forces in the aerated water entry cases are insensitive to the elasticity of the plate in order to examine this further the maximum values of the dimensionless slamming forces c s f m a x ρ v i 2 are plotted against the first eigenfrequencies in fig 14 from the plot it is obvious that in the aerated cases the variation of c s is very small and negligible on the other hand for the pure water cases the smaller eigenfrequencies show higher variation of c s and this effect increases with the plate length as seen by the results of series s4 the peak dimensionless slamming force and the force durations at high pressure and low pressure loading intervals for all considered tests cases are summarized in tables 5 and 6 respectively from table 5 it is obvious that the variation of the peak c s values due to the different plate flexibilities is greatly reduced in the aerated cases which follows the same pattern as that observed for the pressure values above the maximum c s values are also reduced on average by 59 when a small aeration of 0 5 is added to the pure water however as shown in table 6 at the same time the durations of the impact loads t h significantly increase between 32 and 54 this implies that the force impulse defined as the time integral of the force over the impact duration t h f d t is probably less affected by the aeration fig 15 confirms this assumption presenting the relative force impulse values force impulse value i f mean corresponding non aerated water entry force impulse i f β 0 together with the relative slamming coefficients c s c s β 0 for the simulation series s1 3 the large reduction of the slamming coefficient occurring at the lowest aeration level is significantly less for the force impulse values 13 25 table 6 also summarizes the ranges of the post impact low pressure phase lifespans within each simulation series for all of the performed simulations the duration of the low pressure phase lasts 1 28 1 49 ms in the s1 series while it increases to 6 73 11 21 ms in the s5 series in which the slamming pressure is 57 times higher on average than that in the s1 series this higher pressure leads to greater contraction of trapped air which increases the expansion time and makes it more intense 5 2 response strain the discussion in this section concerning plate responses is focused on the bending strain in the middle of the plate where the maximum response of the plate during the entry incident occurs in fig 16 the time series of the bending strain for different aeration levels and different eigenfrequencies are plotted exemplarily for series s3 results for the other series are not presented here as they show exactly the same trends and do not add anything to the following discussion in all cases the oscillation period does not change by adding aeration but a phase shift delay is observable in aerated cases which increases with higher values of air fraction it is noteworthy that the maximum absolute strain in pure water cases does not occur necessarily in the first oscillation period this could be explained by the effect of after shock pressure oscillations occurring due to the oscillation of trapped air beneath the plate and its interaction with the plate aerated water has expectedly a damping effect on the plate oscillation which increases with increasing level of aeration this causes the strain oscillations to dissipate faster than in pure water cases and also reduces the maximum strain amplitude however in less aerated cases the maximum strain values are still very close to those in pure water cases in contrast to the ratio of the slamming forces examined above for instance the average maximum slamming force for series s3 is reduced by 68 7 at only 0 5 aeration cf figs 14 and 15 while the average maximum strain is reduced by only 37 5 this phenomenon becomes more pronounced with increasing plate flexibility to achieve a better representation of this the ratio of the maximum absolute strain in aerated cases to that in pure water cases is plotted as function of plate eigenfrequency in fig 17 the highly aerated water entry cases β 10 have been omitted as the strain and slamming force ratios are substantially small in those cases the important point revealed in fig 17 is that in low aerated cases the aeration may not necessarily cause a reduction in structural responses of plates and other structural forms in general the main reason for this may be due to the fact that although the maximum values of the slamming force reduces significantly in an aerated water entry the duration of the impact load is longer at the same time this implies that the impact energy may not be reduced as much as the peak pressures and forces in a water entry event 6 conclusions in the present study a numerical model has been developed to investigate the combined effects and feedback mechanism of aeration and hydroelasticity on slamming evolution and structural responses of flat plates hitting a water surface for the first time after the model was validated against available experimental data a comprehensive numerical parameter study was conducted to investigate the interlinked effects of water aeration and hydroelasticity on hydrodynamic impact loading and structural response regarding hydrodynamic loading the analysis revealed that plate flexibility exerts an effect on slamming loads which is not large but noticeable and increases with increasing plate length aeration was demonstrated to affect impact loading in two different ways 1 only a slight amount of aeration in water reduces the maximum slamming forces significantly but also elongates the duration of loading which implies that the impact force impulse may not be affected as much as the maximum forces 2 the effect of plate flexibility on slamming loads significantly reduces in aerated water and almost vanishes for aeration levels over 5 this may have important implications for modeling as it seems in such situations in which water is aerated e g in breaking wave load impact that there may be no need to use a strong coupling for accurate assessments of hydrodynamic loads the peak impact forces pressures depend on the impact velocity but also on the compressibility of water which changes significantly with aeration level consequently a new functional relation in terms of a rather simple power law approximation has been derived which fits very well to the present data the structural response of a plate in terms of bending strain in the middle of the plate expectedly reacts directly to hydrodynamic loads for stiff structures with increasing flexibility resonating effects occur with increasing strain rates and less influence of aeration this suggests that the significant computational effort of using a strongly coupled numerical model such as the one proposed here is also not required for assessments of structural response if the structure is rather rigid a deficiency of the present work is the isothermal assumption which does not consider the change of temperature of fluid especially the air trapped by the plate in the near future we will carry out further detailed simulations to investigate more realistic thermodynamic processes accompanying water entry and their

21997,this work presents a comprehensive numerical study of the impact of aeration and hydroelasticity on slamming loads and structural response of elastic plates during a water entry event a numerical tool is developed with openfoam and validated against experimental data from available benchmark tests an extensive parameter investigation revealed that the structural flexibility of a plate exerts a noticeable effect on slamming loads for pure water entry cases which almost completely disappears when the water is aerated the effect of aeration on slamming loads is quite significant with only 0 5 air fraction aeration can reduce substantially the peak slamming forces but as the load duration increases at the same time the force impulse remains almost constant the structural response in terms of strain rates reacts directly on the hydrodynamic loads for stiff plates and exhibits resonating effects and less influence on aeration levels at higher flexibilities this suggests that the structural performance in a slamming event must be carefully considered and is only directly related to loads for very stiff structures for this purpose a new functional relation between peak impact forces pressures and impact velocity in the presence of aeration is suggested within the present study keywords fluid structure interaction aeration water entry hydroelasticity slamming 1 introduction despite the significant number of studies performed over nearly the past 90 years water impact problems which in marine technology literature are referred to as slamming dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 sun 2007 in general and wave slamming in particular remain a main source of uncertainty in the design and operation of marine vessels and structures dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 kapsenberg 2011 shams et al 2017 slamming occurs in a broad range of problems such as bow flare slamming wet deck slamming green water impact and sloshing in the ship industry and breaking wave slamming on marine and coastal structures dias and ghidaglia 2018 faltinsen et al 2004 kapsenberg 2011 two major interconnected phenomena may be acknowledged as primary causes of current knowledge limitations concerning the slamming problem 1 the slamming phenomenon is an outcome of strongly coupled interactions between fluid and structure therefore the elastic interaction of fluid and structure may significantly affect wave impact loads and the response of the structure hildebrandt and schlurmann 2012 ibrahimbegovic et al 2012 kapsenberg 2011 2 in violent impact incidents which may occur in a breaking wave impact water entry or sloshing the existence of air in water as dispersed air bubbles or entrapped air packets will influence the temporal and local distribution of the impact pressure which in turn affects the response of the structure bredmose et al 2009 faltinsen et al 2004 hildebrandt 2012 kapsenberg 2011 korobkin et al 2011 ma et al 2016 simulating such a complex problem in a controlled environment with key processes such as aeration flow separation structural vibrations local cavitation etc in a physical model experiment is rarely achieved the highly complex nature of this phenomenon was first addressed by von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 who approached the problem by means of studying the vertical entry of simple shaped objects i e a flat plate a wedge and a cylinder into calm water which can be analytically solved with certain simplifying assumptions such as rigid body symmetric impact incompressible fluid irrotational flow neglection of gravity and no flow separation the case of a flat plate slamming onto a calm water surface is interesting largely because it resembles special cases in which the solid body and the water surface are nearly parallel to each other prior to the impact in such cases experimental observations have demonstrated that the so called cushioning effect of the air layer trapped between the water surface and the solid body plays an important role in the evolution of impact pressures on the solid body huera huarte et al 2011 ma et al 2016 van nuffel 2014 several researchers have investigated the role and effect of the entrapped air layer on a rigid plate at the instant of water entry including chuang 1970 ermanyuk and ohkusu 2005 lin and shieh 1997 van nuffel 2014 and verhagen 1967 based on experimental observations simplified analytical models which take the air cushion effect into account were developed by verhagen 1967 yamamoto et al 1983 korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 wilson 1991 and howison et al 1991 inclusion of the fluid structure interaction the so called hydroelasticity bereznitski 2001 chen et al 2006 faltinsen 2000 kapsenberg 2011 in water entry studies began with shibue et al 1993 who experimentally examined the water entry of a cylindrical shell only a few researches exist on vertical slamming of an elastic plate the first of which was implemented by faltinsen et al 1997 and followed by okada and sumi 2000 and van nuffel 2014 the role of entrained air bubbles in the water which in recent literature is termed aeration e g bredmose et al 2015 ma et al 2016 plumerault et al 2012a has been investigated reasonably well in the studies on breaking wave impact on rigid vertical walls i e bagnold 1939 oumeraci et al 1993 hattori et al 1994 wood et al 2000 bullock et al 2007 bredmose et al 2009 plumerault et al 2012a and bredmose et al 2015 they all agree that the breaker characteristics along with the air entrapment and air entrainment processes are among the most influential phenomena determining the magnitude and time history of the impact the existence of a mixture of air and water produced within the process of wave breaking and the impact itself has also been associated with the cushioning effect which refers to a reduction effect due to compressibility of the entrapped air in contrast in some cases the existence of entrained and entrapped air has been demonstrated to exert a resonating effect on the impact force on vertical walls however fewer investigations have addressed the role and effects of aeration before and during the instants of water entry two studies can be referred to in this respect zhang et al 2015 numerically examined the effect of fluid compressibility on peak slamming pressures during water entry of a rigid wedge and ma et al 2016 studied the entry of a rigid square flat plate into pure and aerated water applying the results of experimental and numerical modeling both researches demonstrated that the introduction and numerical representation of aeration can significantly reduce local pressure and total forces all of the above mentioned studies considered the phenomena of aeration and hydroelasticity separately and ignored the possible interaction and feedback mechanism of both phenomena in affecting the characteristics of slamming evolution and structural responses to the best of the authors knowledge no research has yet been performed to comprehensively elucidate the effects and feedback mechanisms of aeration and hydroelasticity with a focus on the characteristics of slamming evolution and structural response at the instant of water entry of a flat plate indeed understanding of such processes and interactions is still lacking and it remains unclear how and when complex processes such as aeration compressibility or hydroelasticity in slamming problems have to be taken into consideration for practical applications and design studies concerning the above points the main objectives of the present paper are i to develop and validate a numerical model capable of simulating the strongly coupled interaction of a flexible solid body and compressible fluid flow with a free surface and ii to apply the developed numerical model to investigate the interconnected effects of hydroelasticity and aeration on the characteristics of impact pressures and forces as well as the response of a flat plate during pure and aerated water entry slamming events focal points of the study are to analyze the characteristics of slamming loads in terms of the temporal and local evolution of slamming pressures and forces as well as the plate response defined by the bending strain in the plate during entry into water with different vertical velocities the remainder of this paper is structured as follows the theory and background of the numerical model developed within this study on the openfoam platform jasak et al 2007 weller et al 1998 by modifying existing flow solvers and combining them together in a modified fsi fluid structure interaction package are briefly discussed in section 2 then the model is tested and validated against available experimental data in section 3 in section 4 the set up of a systematic parameter study is presented and the results of the performed simulations and following data analysis are discussed in section 5 finally the main conclusions from the study are drawn in section 6 2 problem description and numerical methodology the considered problem consists of an elastic flat plate with an initial velocity and zero deadrize angle entering an initially calm water tank fig 1 the water may be pure or aerated the whole process of slamming occurs in a relatively short duration on the order of milliseconds at such a time scale certain processes such as bubble coalescence and bubble rising may be neglected the assumption in this study is that the air bubbles in an aerated water body are distributed homogeneously and aeration is quantified by a specified uniform air fraction β v b v f where v b is the volume of bubbles dispersed in the aerated fluid volume v f this simplified model constitutes a proper approach for describing the mixture in a slamming simulation which is a very short duration process and has been effectively applied in recent similar studies such as wood et al 2000 bullock et al 2007 bredmose et al 2009 and plumerault et al 2012b in this way modeling bubbly water is performed by changing the physical properties of the water phase the compressibility of aerated water compared to pure water might constitute the most influential physical parameter when the effect of aeration on the dynamic characteristics of impact is under consideration compressibility may be characterized by the speed of sound in the water air mixture plumerault et al 2012b which is calculated by the wallis equation as follows murrone and guillard 2005 1 1 ρ c 2 β ρ a c a 2 1 β ρ w c w 2 where c c a and c w are the speed of sound in the mixture pure air and pure water respectively the two phase fluid domain is assumed to consist of two immiscible phases aerated pure water and air with no slip between phases hence it is suitable to treat both phases as one aggregated fluid with a single velocity field and therefore to solve one single momentum equation for the whole domain which is numerically much less expensive and simpler than the two fluid approach in this approach the properties of the fluid like density will be defined as an averaged quantity 2 ρ α 1 ρ 1 α 2 ρ 2 where α 1 α 2 ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the volume fractions and densities of phase 1 and phase 2 namely the liquid phase and the gas phase such averaging scheme is also conducted on other varying properties like viscosity molar weight thermal conductivity etc the fluid solid interaction problem in this study is a two field problem with a solid field plate and a fluid field water and air sharing a common interface at the interface γ the following conditions should be satisfied 3 u f u s 4 u f u s 5 τ f τ s 0 where u u and τ are the displacements velocities and traction forces on the interface respectively with subscripts f and s denoting the attribution of the variable to fluid and structure in a fsi problem three interrelating fundamental questions about the approach toward the solution should be answered felippa et al 2001 which are 1 what kinematic description system is chosen for the domains 2 which coupling strategy is to be applied and 3 how are the domains and equations discretized answering the above questions is strongly related to the specific type of the problem to be solved and numerous combinations of choices can be found in literature in the following the choices and assumptions are explained which have been made for the development of the numerical model in the current study 2 1 kinematical description of the domains there are 3 major types of methods for the kinematical description of fsi problems immersed boundary ib methods peskin 2002 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale methods donea et al 2004 and fully lagrangian particle methods monaghan 1985 regarding the need for accurate calculation of pressure field and free surface the ale methods still have higher performance than the other two methods and therefore an ale framework is applied for the current study the drawbacks of the other two approaches in this respect are explained for example in hou et al 2012 and wall et al 2006 for ib methods and in liu and liu 2010 graham and hughes 2008 and nguyen et al 2008 for fully lagrangian particle methods 2 2 coupling strategy in this work the partitioned approach deparis et al 2006b felippa et al 2001 matthies and steindorf 2002 is favored over the monolithic approach bazilevs et al 2013 hübner et al 2004 as it provides modularity felippa et al 2001 which means one can choose separate formulations for each domain as well as discretization meshing and solving techniques that fit best to each domain the classic direct force motion transfer dfmt method with an implicit block gauss seidel bgs fixed point algorithm kassiotis et al 2011 is utilized here for the interfacing process the solving process for each time step aims to find the interface displacement which satisfies 5 the other two interface conditions 3 and 4 are enforced by the no slip boundary condition in the fluid domain each domain solver regardless of its details can be associated with a steklov poincaré operator deparis et al 2006a such that 6 s f λ τ f 7 s s λ τ s each of the above operators also has an inverse so that any given traction force is associated with an interface displacement this description of inverse operator is associated with the solid domain solver in which the traction forces are the boundary conditions and the outputs are the displacements using the above formulation we can rewrite the condition 5 as follows 8 s s 1 s f λ λ eq 8 is solved here by applying the bgs algorithm with the following iteration 9 λ k 1 λ k ω k λ λ k where 10 λ s s 1 s f λ k and ω k is a relaxation parameter calculated for each iteration step with aitken s method which is proven to be an effective scheme in accelerating the convergence küttler and wall 2008 2 3 domain governing equations discretization and solving algorithms 2 3 1 fluid domain the integral form of the mass equation may be written as 11 t v ρ d v v ρ v v ˆ ds 0 where v ˆ is the mesh velocity and ρ is defined as in 2 the integral form of the fluid momentum equations is 12 t v ρ v d v v ρ v v v ˆ ds v t b d v where the stress tensor t is a linear function of the strain rate and is given by 13 t μ v v t 2 3 μ v p i and b is the volumetric force source term 14 b ρ g σ κ α where the first term is the gravity force and the second term is the volumetric force representing the surface tension acting near the interface zone brackbill et al 1992 the fsi interaction term in the fluid domain equations is actualized by the mesh velocity in the solid fluid interface boundary in the present paper we focus on investigating the aeration induced compressibility effect on hydrodynamic impact loading and the corresponding structure responses therefore we assume that the fluid flow undergoes an isothermal process for which the equation of state is given by 15 ρ i ψ i p ρ i 0 ψ i 1 c i 2 where c is the speed of sound inside of the fluid ψ is the compressibility parameter and subscript i denotes each phase the speed of sound in the air phase is 340 m s in pure water is 1490 m s and in the aerated water is calculated by 1 the free surface is modeled using the volume of fluid vof method for compressible flow solving the following transport equation 16 t v α 1 d v v α 1 v v ˆ ds v α 1 1 α 1 v c v ˆ ds v s α α 1 d v where the source term s α is 17 s α 1 α 1 ψ 2 ρ 2 ψ 1 ρ 1 p t v p v the third term on the left hand side of 16 is called the interface compression term added as an anti diffusion term to the equation in order to increase the interface resolution by steepening the gradient of the volume fraction for details see rusche 2003 weller 2008 eqs 11 12 and 16 i e mass momentum and volume fraction respectively are reformulated linearized and discretized in to three sets of equations by applying the finite volume methods on a moving collocated mesh details of the procedure can be found in miller et al 2013 jasak 1996 rusche 2003 and jasak and tukovic 2006 the solution algorithm for each time step involves an outer momentum predictor loop which estimates the velocity field and an inner corrector loop based on the piso issa 1986 method 2 3 2 solid domain the solid domain is described in lagrangian configuration in which the balance of linear momentum for an elastic solid can be expressed as follows 18 v 0 ρ s 0 t u t d v v 0 n s f t d s v 0 ρ s 0 f d v where f is the solid body force s is the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor f 0 u i t is the deformation gradient u is the solid displacement vector and subscript 0 indicates that the quantities are with respect to the reference configuration the st venant kirchhoff constitutive law relating the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor to the green strain tensor 19 s λ s t r e i 2 μ s e closes the system of equations where λ s and μ s are the lamé coefficients and the green strain tensor e is related to the displacement vector by 20 e 1 2 0 u 0 u t 0 u 0 u t in order to avoid complications when using different discretization techniques in two domains the solid domain equations are also discretized with a cell centered finite volume method which has been shown to be both effective and accurate fallah 2004 jasak and weller 2000 slone et al 2003 tsui et al 2013 tuković et al 2015 the details of the procedure are not discussed here but can be found in tuković et al 2015 and jasak and weller 2000 2 3 3 mesh motion the mesh deformation should follow the movement of the fluid solid interface to address this the laplace smoothing equations löhner and yang 1998 which have been demonstrated to be robust in large deformations and computationally efficient kassiotis 2008 were chosen to solve the mesh motion in this study the laplace smoothing equations to be solved along with the fluid and solid equations are defined as follows 21 γ v ˆ 0 where v ˆ is the grid velocity field and γ is a mesh diffusion coefficient in order to maintain the mesh quality and prevent mesh distortion and deterioration due to large displacements particularly near the moving boundary the following variable mesh diffusion coefficient is applied 22 γ r 1 r 2 where r is the distance to the nearest interface point 2 3 4 boundary conditions in order to reduce the computational time a symmetry plane boundary condition was applied in all of the simulations cf fig 1 the boundary conditions for all variables are summarized in table 1 2 3 5 numerical flowchart the procedure for solving the coupled system as a partitioned approach for strong coupling between two domains is a fixed point gauss seidel algorithm with dynamic relaxation the algorithm can be explained as follows 1 if we consider each time step of the coupling counted by n and the iteration steps counted by i then in the first iteration step of each new time step the interface is predicted by a second order predictor 23 λ n 1 1 λ n δ t 2 3 λ n λ n 1 2 the mesh motion solver moves the mesh using the predicted interface displacement as a boundary condition and the new mesh motion velocity is obtained and transferred to the fluid solver 3 the fluid flow problem is solved in the ale formulation using the piso algorithm for pressure velocity coupling and the pressure and viscous stresses are computed and transferred to the solid solver as neumann boundary conditions the exchange of information in the fluid solid interface is conducted by using a linear point to point interpolation 4 the solid iteration solver with the updated boundary conditions provides a new predicted interface displacement λ n 1 i 1 5 the interface displacement residual is calculated as 24 r γ n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 6 if the interface residual is not less than the tolerance criterion an iteration correction is used 25 λ n 1 i 1 1 ω n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i ω n 1 i 1 λ n 1 i 1 where ω n 1 i 1 is the dynamic relaxation parameter which is calculated in every iteration step by using the aitken δ 2 method based on this method the dynamic relaxation parameter for each iteration step is calculated as 26 ω n 1 i 1 ω n 1 i r γ n 1 i t r γ n 1 i 1 r γ n 1 i r γ n 1 i 1 r γ n 1 i 2 the iteration continues until the residual becomes less than the convergence criterion which has been set for the present study as 1 0 6 m 3 implementation and validation the numerical methodology summarized above has been implemented on the open source numerical coding platform openfoam the existing two phase flow solver package compressibleinterfoam has been modified to be added as a flow solver class to the fsi package fsifoam cardiff et al 2018 tuković et al 2018 the fsifoam package was also modified to handle the case of a moving solid with initial velocity and automatic time stepping based on the courant number first a mesh sensitivity study was performed for a typical water entry simulation case which showed that the impact pressure peak becomes insensitive to the mesh fineness when the near wall cell dimensions are less than 0 4 mm fig 2 for such a fine mesh the total number of grid cells in the present two dimensional 2d fluid domain is close to 150000 simulating a fsi water entry case in which both fluid phases air and water are compressible for an impact duration of 0 03 s costs 63 h of computation time using 12 xeon x5670 2 93 ghz cpus accordingly the current parameter study with nearly 120 simulation cases would not have been feasible to be done in full three dimensional 3d form and therefore all of the simulation cases including the validation tests were carried out in 2d form for the validation of the present numerical model no experimental data which simultaneously include both phenomena of aeration and hydroelastic interaction are available therefore two different datasets have been utilized to assess the performance of the numerical model the first dataset reported in faltinsen et al 1997 involves the hydroelastic interaction of deformable square plates with pure water in drop impacts and the second one presented by ma et al 2016 considers entry of rigid square plates into aerated and pure water a brief description of validation tests applying the mentioned references is presented in the following 3 1 deformable plate water entry tests in their physical experiments faltinsen et al 1997 investigated the free fall water entry of a flat rectangular steel plate with dimensions of 1000 mm 500 mm 8 mm the plate was attached at the two ends of its 500 mm span to ballast weight plates the end connections had a controlled rotating stiffness the total mass of the drop rig including the plate and attached mass was 500 kg the plate was dropped against calm water as well as regular wave crests with a variant curvature radius from 1 5 m to 21 m the only available measurement data are from drop tests against wave crests with a 10 2 m curvature radius however as faltinsen et al 1997 reported the measurement results of drop tests against a water surface with such a large curvature radius were significantly close to those of the ones carried out against calm water nevertheless in order to optimally approximate the experimental conditions in the numerical simulation the initial water surface was set to a curvature with 10 2 m radius while the initial velocity within the entire fluid domain was set to zero since the numerical simulation covers only a very short time span of nearly 0 03 s the changing of the initial water surface curvature due to gravity prior to the impact is negligible the 2d numerical model of the dropping rig is depicted in fig 3 one numerical pressure probe and one numerical strain gauge were placed in the middle of the plate bottom recording the evolution of the time dependent pressure and strain like in the physical model the two ends of the plate are connected to a stiff plate at the top and are also used as an attached mass to set the total mass of the dropping rig model per unit area to 1000 kg m 2 which is the same as in the experiment the thickness and length of the connecting plates were determined in a way to provide similar end conditions to those in the experiment the impact velocity of the dropping simulation was 3 m s fig 4 illustrates a comparison of the results from the experimental data and the present numerical simulation the pressure evolution at the middle of the plate bottom is depicted in the left plot and the bending strain time series is drawn in the right plot in the pressure time series of the experiment a very sharp peak can be obviously observed which has a very short duration of 0 2 ms the numerical model did not capture this sharp peak however faltinsen et al 1997 found a very large scatter in the measured peak pressures from the entry tests for a given impact velocity while they observed no meaningful difference in strain values reflecting the scatter in peak pressures these very sharp pressure peaks were highly sensitive to local details of the water surface and as faltinsen et al 1997 concluded they cannot be treated deterministically apart from this sharp peak the numerical model has generally fair agreement with the experimental data and overall duration and values of impact load and the subsequent negative pressure loading are reasonably similar concerning the strain time series the values within the first half period are also in good agreement and the numerically predicted maximum strain value is close to the experimental data the second half period of the numerical strain lasts approximately 4 ms longer than that of the experiment and has two close troughs this behavior can be explained by the fact that due to the 2d set up of the present numerical model a relatively large volume of air is trapped underneath the plate at the time of plate touchdown see fig 5 which is compressed in the first 10 ms of the impact and expands in the second half period of plate oscillation and does not allow the plate to oscillate in its own natural period in the experimental condition in which the trapped air has a smaller volume and ventilation is much faster and easier such interaction is much weaker therefore the second positive peak of numerical strain occurs approximately 7 ms later than that of the experimental strain 3 2 aerated and pure water entry of a rigid flat plate the second validation case considers aerated water for which the numerical results are compared to the physical model experiments of ma et al 2016 in their set up a mass composed of a rigid flat plate and two driver plates is dropped freely into a water tank fig 6 five miniature pressure transducers on the impact plate one in the center and four at 15 mm distance from the middle of the plate sides measured the pressure values during impact incidents in the numerical simulation the set up is two dimensional 2d and the mass of the impactor per unit area is set to 512 kg m 2 corresponding to the impactor mass of 32 kg in the experiment the impact velocity is set to 5 5 m s at the bottom of the experimental tank a bubble generator was installed under the dropping area to produce homogeneously aerated water with predetermined air fraction values for the validation of the numerical model two cases were simulated and compared to the experiments the pure water case and an aerated water case with an air fraction of β 0 8 first the case of plate entry into pure water shall be considered fig 7 presents the pressure time series at the middle and the side probes comparing the numerical model with the experimental data ma et al 2016 observed that in the impact pressure evolution three stages can be noticed particularly in the middle of the plate i a shock loading ii fluid expansion induced low sub atmospheric pressure and iii a weaker secondary loading this entire process occurs in a very short time span of less than 10 ms and is remarkably well simulated by the numerical model at the middle probe the numerical pressure starts to rise earlier and reaches a plateau of approximately 0 55 bar for nearly 0 5 ms before the actual shock loading takes place this primary loading occurs because the plate is initially positioned at the lowest possible elevation near the still water surface d i 1 cm in order to lower the effects of mesh deterioration due to the movement of the plate and subsequent mesh deformation however this artifact is tolerable as it has not influenced the actual shock loading process after the shock loading the compressed trapped air starts to expand which causes a sub atmospheric pressure underneath the plate this low pressure loading at the middle probe lasts for 3 5 ms 3 7 ms in the experiments and 5 5 ms in the numerical simulation the duration of fluid expansion loading at the side probes was 3 7 ms in the experiment and 3 2 ms in the numerical simulation table 2 summarizes the results for the high pressure shock loading which is very well simulated by the numerical model with peak values significantly close to the experimental results at both the middle and the side probes it should be noted that for the experiments the average peak pressures of the four side probes are shown in the table the same applies to the lifespan of the shock loading which is nearly 20 wider in the numerical model in fig 8 the numerical results with aerated water of 0 8 air fraction are compared to the experimental data at the middle probe the peak pressure values are very close but the rising time in the numerical simulation is significantly higher this can be attributed to the fact that due to the 2d set up of the present model the air layer between the plate bottom and the water surface has a much smaller escape route before the touchdown compared to real 3d conditions therefore the cushioning effect of the trapped air in the present model is significantly higher than the experiment which in turn reduces the peak pressure and increases the rising time the values of peak impact pressures and their time spans for the aerated water entry case are listed in table 3 an important point is that the time series of the side probes in the experiments are not synchronous and exhibited different variations which might be ascribed to water surface disturbances and other practical issues in the physical model experiments however the average peaks and the duration have a fair agreement with the experimental data another important point to be noted is that the sub atmospheric pressure loading is much weaker in the aerated water entry experiment and this trend is also captured by the numerical model 3 3 conclusion on validation in the first validation case the ability of the numerical model to capture the physics of hydroelasticity during a water entry simulation was investigated the numerical model has shown reasonable agreement with the experimental data on important trends of the evolution of strain and pressure during the impact time with some negligible differences occurring in the second half period for the strain time series which can mostly be attributed to the 2d set up of the simulation in the second water entry case the numerical model successfully showed the three stages of impact loading in the case of pure water entry shock load sub atmospheric loading and second pressure peak and the overall capability of the numerical tool to capture the effect of aeration on the fluid solid interaction problem seems acceptable 4 numerical simulation set up in order to elucidate the interactive effects of hydroelasticity and aeration on the impact loading and structural responses of flat plates during a water entry incident a comprehensive set of numerical simulations was designed and implemented the simulations were configured in five series s1 5 with individual impact velocity v i length of impact plate l and mass per unit area m a for each series as listed in table 4 within each series four different aeration ratios β 0 0 0 5 5 0 and 10 0 and six plates with 1st dry eigenfrequencies of the order of 152 hz 202 hz 254 hz 300 hz 502 hz and 3100 hz were investigated the eigenfrequency was varied by changing the thickness of the plate representing the degree of plate flexibility and the plate with the highest eigenfrequency can be assumed as a semi rigid plate all of the plates had the same material properties of steel modulus of elasticity e 2 1 1 0 11 pa poisson s ratio ν s 0 3 the end conditions of the plates were free as the results of the first validation case revealed that the pinned end condition significantly increases the volume of entrapped air and the resulting cushioning effect might overshadow the effect of aeration 5 results and discussion in this section the results of the numerical investigation are described first a thorough analysis of the impact loading in terms of impact force per unit width of the plate f and impact pressure p and its relation to aeration and hydroelasticity is presented subsequently the response of the plates to the impact in terms of the bending strain ε in the middle of the plate is analyzed and discussed 5 1 impact loads fig 9 presents the time histories of pressure at the middle of the plates during the impact incident each plot illustrates the time histories for three plates with different natural frequencies i e the most flexible plate f 152 hz the semi rigid plate f 3100 hz and one plate with a medium eigenfrequency f 300 hz the left plots are the results from pure water entry simulations while the right plots are the results of aerated water entry cases with 0 5 aeration level results are provided for series s1 s3 and s4 in order to analyze the effect of impact velocity s1 and s3 and plate length s3 and s4 the pressure time histories resemble those of the experiments of ma et al 2016 showing a single peak followed by a sub atmospheric loading and a secondary minor peak it can be noticed that only a small amount of aeration 0 5 causes a significant drop up to 73 in peak pressure for all cases the mean peak impact pressure in non aerated cases of series s3 is 25 times higher than that in series s1 while this ratio is considerably lower 9 8 in the aerated cases this finding will be discussed further in this section another important point is the effect of the plate flexibility on the peak pressure to achieve a clearer understanding of this the relative peak pressure normalized with the corresponding semi rigid case is drawn against the plate eigenfrequency for all cases with β 0 β 0 5 and β 5 in fig 10 one major point seen in fig 10 is that with the involvement of aeration the effect of plate flexibility on peak pressure declines significantly to the degree that with β 5 fig 10 right the difference between ratios becomes negligible considering the results of the pure water entry fig 10 left in all series except for series s5 the peak pressures generally increase with decreasing flexibility and a linear trend seems to exist in the relation between peak pressure and the logarithm of the natural frequency in series s5 the impact velocity of plates v i 7 5 m s is considerably higher than for the other series and it seems that in high speed vertical entry slamming the flexibility of the plate is relatively insignificant for the impact peak pressures the variability of the peak pressure due to variation of plate stiffness is considerably higher in simulation series s4 in which the length of plates was 60 larger than in the other series this implies that the plate length plays a key role in determining the share of hydroelasticity in water entry impact loads in fig 9 further points of interest are the duration and magnitude of negative pressure and the secondary pressure peak which could affect the response of plates after the first period of vibration as will be discussed later in section 5 2 the negative pressure duration in pure water entry cases varies considerably with the plate stiffness and generally with decreasing stiffness the negative pressure time increases it should be mentioned in this context that for the sake of numerical stability the minimum absolute fluid pressure had to be limited to 1 0 4 pa i e 0 9 bar relative to atmospheric pressure which can be observed in the plots particularly for the pure water entry in series s4 where the pressure does not go beneath this value in series s4 the variation of secondary pressure peak due to the variation of eigenfrequencies is significant while it is trivial in the s3 series since plate length is the only parameter that varies between the two series it could be assumed that this higher variation of the second pressure peak results from the increasing plate length another important aspect of water entry of a horizontal flat plate in the presence of aeration and hydroelasticity is the dependence of peak pressures and forces on impact velocity which can be seen in fig 11 in the left graph the peak pressure values of all simulations with pure water as well as aerated water are plotted against impact velocity some variations are noticeable for the same impact velocities due to the different plate flexibilities as discussed above despite these variations a clear trend of increasing peak pressure with increasing impact velocity can be observed for all aeration levels indicating a functional relationship between them this is determined by an interestingly simple power law function taking the compressibility parameter and the speed of sound into account in order to consider the effect of aeration 27 p m a x k p ρ v i 1 3 ln c where c is the speed of sound inside the aerated water eq 1 ρ is the water air mixture density and k p is a coefficient defined by 28 k p 21 27 12 46 e 32 098 β as the same trend can also be observed for the peak slamming forces per unit area which are shown in the right graph of fig 11 a similar power law function can be defined here 29 f m a x k f ρ v i 1 3 ln c where f m a x is the maximum value of the impact force per unit area and the coefficient k f depends on the aeration level in the following form 30 k f 24 3 45 7 β since certain parameters such as plate length mass etc are excluded here the above expressions may not be regarded as a general relationship for plates and additional investigation is necessary to reach a comprehensive conclusion the evolution of the impact pressure distribution along the half length of the plate is examined next which is plotted in fig 12 for series s1 and s3 low and medium impact velocity with the same aeration rates β 0 and β 0 5 and the same flexibilities f 150 hz 300 hz and 3000 hz as shown in fig 9 the plots in the odd columns of fig 12 represent the non aerated cases while the plots in the even columns are the results of simulations with aerated water β 0 5 for all cases the high slamming pressures in the shock loading are very concentrated in a time span of approximately 1 to 2 ms and in pure water cases the maximum pressure occurs at virtually all points simultaneously along the length of the plate while the contours are less symmetric in the aerated cases another noteworthy difference between the results of series s1 and s3 is the effect of aeration on the rising time and drop time of the peak pressure for series s1 practically no difference in rising time and drop time between the aerated and non aerated cases can be discerned from the plots in fig 12 whereas for series s3 both rising and drop time exhibit a significant increase when the water is aerated one can also see that the expansion of the drop time due to aeration is much larger than the rate of increase in rising time the mean rising time in series s3 for instance increases by 28 from 0 64 ms to 0 82 ms while the drop time increases by 56 from 0 9 ms to 1 38 ms fig 13 depicts the distribution of dimensionless pressure p ρ v i 2 along the half length of the plate at the time near to the peak slamming load for all five series with pure water entries left and aerated water entries right of plates with low medium and high eigenfrequency the figure shows that in pure water cases the gradient of the pressure along the half length of the plate is much steeper than in the aerated cases the trend that was observed in fig 9 is also noticeable here as in aerated cases the pressure curves of different plates are almost indistinguishable which implies that the impact forces in the aerated water entry cases are insensitive to the elasticity of the plate in order to examine this further the maximum values of the dimensionless slamming forces c s f m a x ρ v i 2 are plotted against the first eigenfrequencies in fig 14 from the plot it is obvious that in the aerated cases the variation of c s is very small and negligible on the other hand for the pure water cases the smaller eigenfrequencies show higher variation of c s and this effect increases with the plate length as seen by the results of series s4 the peak dimensionless slamming force and the force durations at high pressure and low pressure loading intervals for all considered tests cases are summarized in tables 5 and 6 respectively from table 5 it is obvious that the variation of the peak c s values due to the different plate flexibilities is greatly reduced in the aerated cases which follows the same pattern as that observed for the pressure values above the maximum c s values are also reduced on average by 59 when a small aeration of 0 5 is added to the pure water however as shown in table 6 at the same time the durations of the impact loads t h significantly increase between 32 and 54 this implies that the force impulse defined as the time integral of the force over the impact duration t h f d t is probably less affected by the aeration fig 15 confirms this assumption presenting the relative force impulse values force impulse value i f mean corresponding non aerated water entry force impulse i f β 0 together with the relative slamming coefficients c s c s β 0 for the simulation series s1 3 the large reduction of the slamming coefficient occurring at the lowest aeration level is significantly less for the force impulse values 13 25 table 6 also summarizes the ranges of the post impact low pressure phase lifespans within each simulation series for all of the performed simulations the duration of the low pressure phase lasts 1 28 1 49 ms in the s1 series while it increases to 6 73 11 21 ms in the s5 series in which the slamming pressure is 57 times higher on average than that in the s1 series this higher pressure leads to greater contraction of trapped air which increases the expansion time and makes it more intense 5 2 response strain the discussion in this section concerning plate responses is focused on the bending strain in the middle of the plate where the maximum response of the plate during the entry incident occurs in fig 16 the time series of the bending strain for different aeration levels and different eigenfrequencies are plotted exemplarily for series s3 results for the other series are not presented here as they show exactly the same trends and do not add anything to the following discussion in all cases the oscillation period does not change by adding aeration but a phase shift delay is observable in aerated cases which increases with higher values of air fraction it is noteworthy that the maximum absolute strain in pure water cases does not occur necessarily in the first oscillation period this could be explained by the effect of after shock pressure oscillations occurring due to the oscillation of trapped air beneath the plate and its interaction with the plate aerated water has expectedly a damping effect on the plate oscillation which increases with increasing level of aeration this causes the strain oscillations to dissipate faster than in pure water cases and also reduces the maximum strain amplitude however in less aerated cases the maximum strain values are still very close to those in pure water cases in contrast to the ratio of the slamming forces examined above for instance the average maximum slamming force for series s3 is reduced by 68 7 at only 0 5 aeration cf figs 14 and 15 while the average maximum strain is reduced by only 37 5 this phenomenon becomes more pronounced with increasing plate flexibility to achieve a better representation of this the ratio of the maximum absolute strain in aerated cases to that in pure water cases is plotted as function of plate eigenfrequency in fig 17 the highly aerated water entry cases β 10 have been omitted as the strain and slamming force ratios are substantially small in those cases the important point revealed in fig 17 is that in low aerated cases the aeration may not necessarily cause a reduction in structural responses of plates and other structural forms in general the main reason for this may be due to the fact that although the maximum values of the slamming force reduces significantly in an aerated water entry the duration of the impact load is longer at the same time this implies that the impact energy may not be reduced as much as the peak pressures and forces in a water entry event 6 conclusions in the present study a numerical model has been developed to investigate the combined effects and feedback mechanism of aeration and hydroelasticity on slamming evolution and structural responses of flat plates hitting a water surface for the first time after the model was validated against available experimental data a comprehensive numerical parameter study was conducted to investigate the interlinked effects of water aeration and hydroelasticity on hydrodynamic impact loading and structural response regarding hydrodynamic loading the analysis revealed that plate flexibility exerts an effect on slamming loads which is not large but noticeable and increases with increasing plate length aeration was demonstrated to affect impact loading in two different ways 1 only a slight amount of aeration in water reduces the maximum slamming forces significantly but also elongates the duration of loading which implies that the impact force impulse may not be affected as much as the maximum forces 2 the effect of plate flexibility on slamming loads significantly reduces in aerated water and almost vanishes for aeration levels over 5 this may have important implications for modeling as it seems in such situations in which water is aerated e g in breaking wave load impact that there may be no need to use a strong coupling for accurate assessments of hydrodynamic loads the peak impact forces pressures depend on the impact velocity but also on the compressibility of water which changes significantly with aeration level consequently a new functional relation in terms of a rather simple power law approximation has been derived which fits very well to the present data the structural response of a plate in terms of bending strain in the middle of the plate expectedly reacts directly to hydrodynamic loads for stiff structures with increasing flexibility resonating effects occur with increasing strain rates and less influence of aeration this suggests that the significant computational effort of using a strongly coupled numerical model such as the one proposed here is also not required for assessments of structural response if the structure is rather rigid a deficiency of the present work is the isothermal assumption which does not consider the change of temperature of fluid especially the air trapped by the plate in the near future we will carry out further detailed simulations to investigate more realistic thermodynamic processes accompanying water entry and their

21998,service life extension through proactive maintenance has become increasingly important for ships due to significant cost associated with new ship acquisition and adequate remaining load carrying capacity while continuous operation beyond design service life can offer economic profits to ship owners it may also incur significant costs associated with maintenance and operation as well as higher failure risk additionally decisions for life extension can be complicated by the uncertainties associated with structural performance under deteriorating stressors such as corrosion and fatigue therefore service life extension of ships should be planned in a cost effective and reliable manner this paper proposes a risk informed framework that determines the optimal end of life strategies for ships service life extension or ship decommissioning and replacement a cost benefit analysis is integrated into the framework to account for deteriorating ship performance life cycle risk loss of service maintenance costs and net operating profits the proposed framework is applied to two categories of oil tankers to highlight the effect of ship size on the cost effectiveness and net benefit of different end of life strategies a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the critical factors in the decision making process keywords service life extension cost benefit analysis corrosion fatigue maintenance 1 introduction continuation of ship operation beyond the design service life is becoming more prevalent due to significant cost associated with new ship acquisition and adequate remaining load carrying capacity in the united states more than 40 of ships are operating beyond their initial design service life abs 2012 for ships in need of extending service life prudent maintenance actions are vital in order to ensure safe operation boulares et al 2017 while longer operational life can be beneficial for ship owners different end of life eol strategies e g service life extension or ship decommissioning and replacement may result in different structural capacities and total life cycle costs of ships the decisions on eol strategies should be made to ensure ship safety margin in design and extended service life considering the limited financial resources for service life extension it is also necessary to identify the management strategies that can deliver the best return on life extension investment this paper proposes a management framework that determines the optimal eol strategies service life extension as an additional option to the conventional eol strategy i e decommissioning and replacement is gaining momentum across different industry sectors shafiee and animah 2017 in the maritime industry service life extension means that the service life of a ship is extended beyond its design service life by applying maintenance or modification on ship details abs 2017 to ensure no compromise on safe operation service life extension can avoid the costly investment in new ship acquisition and harness the benefits from prolonged ship operation by planning and implementing preventative and essential maintenance actions failure risk in the extended operational service life can also be taken under control kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 herein preventative maintenance actions refer to proactive actions before any critical performance level is reached frangopol et al 2001 van noortwijk and frangopol 2004 while essential maintenance actions are reactive actions when critical performance levels relevant to ship safety are reached for structural components or the entire ship structure das 1999 frangopol and das 1999 for ship structures several studies have been performed to extend their service life in the preliminary design phase knight et al 2015 and in the in service phase kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 soliman et al 2016 for instance soliman et al 2016 developed a probabilistic maintenance planning framework based on multi objective optimization maximizing the service life while minimizing the total life cycle cost liu et al 2019 compared the benefits of maintenance actions for ship structures considering two preassigned spans of extended service life nevertheless none of the previous studies investigated the preference of different eol management strategies in the decision making process the cost benefit consideration has been one of the major components in the decision making process for setting target safety level guia et al 2018 evaluating the safety of ship structures garbatov and guedes soares 2008 imo 2018 paik et al 2006 planning ship maintenance abbott et al 2000 li et al 2005 xiang et al 2012 and ship recycling at the end of service life choi et al 2016 for instance cost benefit analysis has been implemented in the past to determine or prioritize maintenance actions for deteriorating ship structures especially when maintenance actions require various costs and have different effects on structures abbott et al 2000 li et al 2005 xiang et al 2012 choi et al 2016 promoted the use of cost benefit analysis in eol management by appraising recycling methods in different standards however past studies were conducted to ensure structure performance within the initial design service life without considering potential service life extension or new ship acquisition there is a lack of decision support frameworks for determining the optimal eol management strategy with respect to cost effectiveness and net benefit while satisfying the extra service life specified by decision makers when selecting eol strategies structural deterioration must be properly considered fatigue and corrosion are the most significant and pervasive deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures akpan et al 2002 guedes soares and garbatov 1996 furthermore considerable uncertainties are involved in both deterioration processes the presence of these uncertainties necessitates the use of probabilistic approaches for structural performance assessment and the determination of maintenance actions reliability and risk based indicators have been extensively used to assess performance of deteriorating structures due to corrosion fatigue and their interacting effects han et al 2019 moan and ayala uraga 2008 souza and ayyub 2009 stambaugh et al 2014 based on these indicators optimal life cycle maintenance plans can be determined frangopol 2011 dong and frangopol 2015 garbatov and guedes soares 2001 lazakis et al 2010 guedes soares and garbatov 1996 in this paper a novel framework is proposed to determine the optimal eol strategy based on the cost effectiveness or net benefit both reliability and failure risk are considered based on probabilistic life cycle assessment of structural performance the proposed framework considers the effects of both corrosion and fatigue the cost benefit analysis for different eol strategies includes net operating profit cost associated with ship failure maintenance cost and loss of service due to maintenance the cost effectiveness and net benefit associated with different eol strategies are assessed in terms of benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv respectively the optimal eol strategies are determined for different spans of extra service life the proposed framework is applied to two oil tankers of different categories in order to highlight the effect of ship size on service life extension 2 reliability analysis of deteriorating ship hull structures due to structural deterioration life cycle structural performance should be assessed to determine optimal eol strategies ship hull performance against flexural failure is considered as a major factor for ship safety assessment paik and frieze 2001 guedes soares and teixeira 2001 fatigue and corrosion are the most significant and pervasive deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures guedes soares and garbatov 1999 the reduction in ship cross section due to corrosion and fatigue can compromise the load carrying capacity i e structural resistance of ships and potentially endanger ship safety therefore reliability of deteriorating ship hull structures against flexural failure is analyzed 2 1 ultimate limit state the performance function associated with the flexural failure of ship hull structures can be expressed as liu et al 2019 paik and frieze 2001 1 g t x u σ y z x s w m s w t x w x d m w t where σ y material yield strength z vertical elastic section modulus with respect to the neutral axis of the hull section m s w still water bending moment and m w wave induced bending moment x d dynamic effect of wave induced bending moment x u x s w and x w model errors associated with ultimate flexural

wave coefficient specific definitions of l b and c b can be found in dnv 2009 the wave coefficient c w can be expressed as 4 c w 10 75 300 l 100 1 5 f o r 150 l 300 m 10 75 f o r 300 l 350 m 10 75 l 350 150 1 5 f o r 350 l 500 m wave induced vertical bending moment is related to operating conditions such as heading angle navigation speed and wave height in this paper the frequency based method in hughes 1983 is utilized to determine wave induced bending moments based on sea states ship dimensions and ship operation conditions the essential steps of this method are hughes 1983 a quantifying wave conditions in the form of wave spectrum s ζ ω herein the modified pierson moskowitz wave spectrum is used and shown as follows faltinsen 1993 5 s ζ ω 0 11 h s 2 t 1 2 π ω t 1 2 π 5 e x p 0 44 ω t

deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures akpan et al 2002 proposed the following model to compute thickness loss of a corroded plate 10 d t c 1 t t 0 c o r r c 2 where d t thickness loss mm t time in service years t 0 c o r r corrosion initiation time c 1 and c 2 parameters associated with corrosion rate past studies indicate that the value of c 2 varies in the range of 0 3 1 5 kondo 1987 melchers 1999 paik et al 2003 values lower than 1 as proposed by kondo 1987 and melchers 1999 indicate that corrosion may stabilize over time which may not be appropriate for ships that are constantly exposed to corrosive environments paik et al 2003 compared corrosion models with different c 2 values of 1 0 1 2 and 1 5 based on experimental data in exposure tests they concluded that c 2 approximately equals to 1 after a relatively short initial period therefore c 2 1 is used in this paper and c 1 becomes the annual corrosion rate mm year another major deterioration mechanism is fatigue under repetitive wave loads herein paris law is used to predict crack propagation paris and erdogan 1963 11 d a d n c δ k m 12 δ k δ σ g π a where a crack size mm n number of cycles c and m material parameters δ k stress intensity factor mpa mm1 2 g geometry constant and δ σ stress range mpa based on eqs 11 and 12 the time dependent crack size can be estimated as 13 a t 1 m 2 c δ σ m n a

c t o p e r annual ship operation rate and n d a i l y average daily number of load cycles structural resistance of ship hull structures in eq 1 can be updated to reflect the effects of corrosion and fatigue the interaction between corrosion and fatigue is considered based on the fact that both can reduce the effective area of a ship cross section leading to lower structural resistance against flexure failure there may also exist second order interactions such as fatigue crack nucleation at corrosion pits and the effect of corrosive environments on fatigue crack growth however they are not addressed in this paper the detailed analysis regarding this aspect can be found in bastidas arteaga et al 2009 and han et al 2019 a ship structural detail subjected to both corrosion and fatigue is shown in fig 1 taking into account the fatigue crack size a t and the corrosion induced thickness loss d t the time variant geometric properties of envelop plates and hull stiffeners can be computed as dong and frangopol 2015 15 b p t b p 0 d t 16 w f i t w f 0 i a t 17 h w i t h w 0 i a t where b p 0 initial thickness of the envelop plate w f 0 i and h w 0 i initial flange width and web height of the i th stiffener respectively a t crack length within the stiffener and d t corrosion depth of the envelop plate based on eqs 15 17 the time variant elastic section modulus in eq 1 can be calculated to determine the time variant failure probability of ship hull structures in flexure 3 decision support framework for eol management typically ship maintenance can be planned based on minimization of maintenance costs under reliability or risk constraints minimization of risk or failure probability under cost constraints or multi objective optimization considering reliability risk maintenance costs and such as damage detection delay frangopol and kim 2019 frangopol and liu 2007 soliman et al 2016 besides risk and maintenance cost eol management should also consider the benefit within the service life herein cost benefit analysis is conducted to determine optimal eol strategies under different spans of service life for a ship structure under consideration cost is generated from the time of decision to the end of the initial design service life i e the remaining design service life herein referred to as phase i and in the desired extra service life herein referred to as phase ii the extra service life can be achieved either by additional proactive maintenance in the extended service life or by ship replacement near the end of the initial design service life it is herein assumed that service life extension requires proactive maintenance including preventative and essential maintenance actions while only essential maintenance actions are considered if ship replacement is used as the eol strategy this paper aims to determine major maintenance actions to ensure the safety margin of ships during extra service life it is assumed that routine maintenance such as repairing hatch coaming and maintaining ship engines stopford 2009 does not drastically affect the ship reliability under the ultimate limit state analyzed in this paper additionally the periodic regular maintenance may not deliver the minimum life cycle cost garbatov and guedes soares 2001 therefore the total cost includes the total failure risk in phases i and ii maintenance cost and replacement cost if available for benefits in phases i and ii annual net profit e g total revenue minus operational and miscellaneous costs can be used to calculate total benefits in phases i and ii cost and benefit models used herein are described in the following subsections 3 1 failure risk failure risk considers both failure probability and failure consequences of ship structures the total failure risk in phases i and ii can be expressed as 18 r f t 1 t e x t c f c l c s p i l l p f t 1 r t where t lead time since the time of eol decision year p f t annual probability of flexural failure defined in eq 1 at year t t e x t duration of phases i and ii years c f c l and c s p i l l monetary loss associated with structural failure cost fatality cost and environmental cost and r discount rate the failure consequences due to flexural failure can be estimated by the structural cost as follows miroyannis 2006 19 c f 5747 19 s t f d i s p 0 3792 w g t 100 0 862 800 w g t 100 where c f monetary loss usd w g t 100 the weight of structural system in ship work breakdown system long ton s t f ship type factor and d i s p full load displacement of a ship long ton due to deterioration annual failure risk may increase over time the cost associated with fatalities can be estimated as guia et al 2018 20 c l n c r e w p c r e w l f where n c r e w number of crew members p c r e w probability of a fatality given ship failure l f losses associated with a fatality the average number of crew members on oil tankers can be obtained through surveys the probability of a fatality is estimated to be between 0 01 cowi 2008 and 0 16 dnv 2001 depending on the occurrence of fire l f in this paper can be represented by either the statistical value of a human life estimated at 300 000 usd kunreuther 1974 or the cost of averting a fatality estimated at 3 000 000 usd guia et al 2018 imo 2018 given the large range of the fatality probability and the loss associated with a fatality their corresponding average values are used in the analysis to compute fatality cost the environmental impact associated with the failure of oil tankers is attributed to oil spills on the surrounding water an oil spill can incur clean up expenses and fishery related costs both can be related to the volume of spilt oil various models have been proposed to quantify the associated cost imo 2018 psarros et al 2011 ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 yamada 2009 among these models yamada 2009 yields the lowest oil spill cost due to excluding factors such as tourism related damages and environmental damage while ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 produces the highest cost due to a more comprehensive oil spill database in this paper the median cost model among the surveyed models proposed by imo 2018 is selected for analysis based on this model the oil spill cost can be expressed as imo 2018 21 c s p i l l 42301 v 0 7233 where v volume of oil spilt that requires clean ups liu and frangopol 2018 estimated the volume of an oil spill based on the number and the capacity of damaged tanks in this paper the case where oil spills from the two adjacent tanks at midship is assumed for the analysis it should be noted that the failure cost components mentioned above involve considerable uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis should be conducted 3 2 maintenance cost maintenance actions may vary depending on the deterioration mechanism corrosion or fatigue deterioration extent and locations and the feasibility of dry docking for fatigue commonly used maintenance actions include cropping and renewing gouge and re weld hole drilling and design modifications e g enhance thickness or grade of steel and add brackets iacs 2007 for corrosion coating double plates and inserting plates are widely used for repair abs 2012 since this paper aims to determine the maintenance actions for service life extension temporary repairs such as hole drilling coating and gouge and re welding are not considered instead only permanent repairs are investigated specifically the repair action for fatigue damage is to a crop the cracked plate stiffener b insert a new plate and c add soft toe bracket when necessary see fig 2 for illustration the repair action for corrosion damage is to replace the corroded envelop plates the corresponding repair cost of one maintenance campaign is estimated as turan et al 2009 22 c r e p a i r d e t a i l c m a t e r i a l d e t a i l c c o n s d e t a i l c w e l d d e t a i l 23 c m a t e r i a l d e t a i l c m a t e r i a l ρ s

c r e p a i r i cost of the i th repair action n total number of maintenance actions including both preventative and essential actions and t r e p a i r i application time of the i th repair action since the eol decision year in addition to repair costs the cost associated with loss of service termed herein as unavailability cost is also considered this cost is defined as the revenue loss of ships during repair it can be expressed as turan et al 2009 27 c u n a i 1 n r a d e t w e l d a d e t a i l i h w o r k 1 r t r e p a i r i where c u n a unavailability cost r a d e average daily

represented by the welding time h w o r k work hour per day at shipyard assumed herein to be 8 h 3 3 net operating profit net operating profit is the difference between operating revenue and operating

cost of ship operation involves various components such as crew expenses and fuel consumable supplies schultz et al 2011 in this paper crew expenses are disregarded since these expenses such as salaries and pensions vary significantly among ship owners fuel consumption on the other hand is related to cargo carrying capacity engine type and voyage duration turan et al 2009 it accounts for a great portion of the total operating cost nikolaisen 2014 therefore the operating cost is expressed herein by the cost of fuel consumption as turan et al 2009 30 c o p t 1 t e x t 365 p c t o p e r d

present value npv both bcr and npv have been used in the life cycle management of civil structures mondoro et al 2018 padgett et al 2010 van der pol et al 2017 bcr herein is defined as the ratio of the discounted benefit i e net profit stemming from operation in phases i and ii to the discounted total life cycle cost i e failure risk maintenance cost and loss of service in the same period npv is the difference between the discounted benefit and the discounted cost both indicators can determine the financial feasibility of different management strategies i e bcr 1 and npv 0 however when used to compare different strategies they are based on different rationales bcr can reflect the cost effectiveness of different strategies namely the amount of return for every dollar invested nonetheless it does not provide any indication of the magnitude of the total net benefit khurshid et al 2009 npv on the other hand does provide this magnitude but it is difficult to solely rely on npv for strategy comparison when candidate strategies require drastically different investments remer and nieto 1995 therefore both bcr and npv have been used to form decision support for eol management decision makers can select the most appropriate strategy based on their own investment goals and financial constraints for service life extension the associated bcr b c r s l e with a desired duration of life extension t e x t can be expressed as 32 b c r s l e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a c m a i n for ship replacement the associated bcr b c r r e p l a c e can be expressed as 33 b c r r e p l a c

discounted unavailability and maintenance costs associated with only essential maintenance actions respectively t r e p l a c e time of replacement year since the time of decision the salvage value for a decommissioned ship is neglected since it is small compared to the total replacement cost kaplan 1974 similar to eqs 32 and 33 the npv associated with service life extension and ship replacement can be expressed as 34 n p v s l e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a c m a i n 35 n p v r e p l a c e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a e s s c m a i n e s s c r e p l a c e 1 r t r e p l a c e it should be noted that compared to ship replacement service life extension may have many other benefits e g the reduced environmental impacts regarding decommissioning and disposal of structures shafiee and animah 2017 nevertheless these additional benefits are not considered in this paper since they only account for around 2 of the total life cycle revenue ko and gantner 2016 turan et al 2009 3 5 optimal eol management this paper aims to determine the optimal eol management strategy fulfilling the financial needs of ship owners to this end this paper divides the total service life of a ship into two phases the initial design service life i e phase i which is regulated by existing design standards and the extended service life i e phase ii which is specified by decision makers given the desired extended service life the optimization is conducted to determine a management strategy that can yield the highest financial performance while maintaining an adequate safety margin the proposed decision support framework uses bcr or npv as an indicator to a plan the proactive maintenance actions for service life extension and b to select the optimal eol strategy between service life extension and ship replacement the location of maintained structural details and the type of maintenance can affect the structural performance and the associated life cycle cost therefore they are considered as design variables of the optimization problem fig 3 illustrates the two eol strategies considered in this study i e service life extension and ship replacement for service life extension the following optimization problem is formulated and solved to obtain the maintenance plan given parameters associated with ship configuration including ship type and dimension l s h i p t y p e b s h

metaheuristic procedure is used to determine the optimal management plans ga is computationally suitable for the optimization problem given all the design variables are integers however the slow convergence rate of ga may make the optimization process a time consuming task rao and xiong 2005 ga has been successfully implemented to obtain optimal life cycle management plans for ships dong and frangopol 2015 soliman et al 2016 fig 4 summarizes the aforementioned optimization process to determine the optimal maintenance plan for service life extension the chromosome representing the design variables of ga is shown in fig 5 the associated maximum bcr or npv associated with service life extension can be obtained for ship replacement strategy a new ship is acquired and placed in service at or near the end of the initial design service life essential maintenance actions are implemented whenever the annual target reliability index is reached the associated bcr or npv can be calculated with eqs 33 and 35 respectively the parameters and the constraints remain the same as those in the optimization problem associated with service life extension the optimization variables during dl and rl include the location of structural details that need essential maintenance and the type of maintenance actions performed on structural details the obtained bcrs or npvs associated with service life extension and ship replacement are compared to select the optimal eol strategy it should be noted that the quantification of various cost components can be challenging and highly uncertain due to external circumstances such as ship types voyage duration maintenance resources and profitability of the shipping market historic cost data can help the cost benefit analysis but cannot entirely reflect the uncertainties in order to quantify these exogenous uncertainties a sensitivity analysis should be conducted to investigate the criticality of different factors in affecting bcrs and npvs of different eol strategies 4 illustrative example the proposed framework is applied to two oil tankers of different categories oil tankers are typically divided into six categories based on their deadweight tonnage abs 2012 in an increasing order they are handy panamax aframax suezmax very large crude carrier vlcc and ultra large crude carrier ulcc aframax and vlcc are selected due to their high structural failure rates eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 and widespread use in the oil transportation industry clarksons 2015 they can also highlight the effect of ship size on eol management the ship hull structures are analyzed in this paper for flexural failure mentioned previously the mid ship sections of the two ship hull structures are considered these mid ship sections are shown in figs 6 and 7 the mid ship sections are divided into three segments the deck side shell and ship bottom as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 with respect to random variables in corrosion and fatigue models full correlation is assumed for stiffeners within the same segment while these random variables are considered to be statistically independent for stiffeners from different segments since the vertical bending moment still water and wave induced are imposed on the entire hull section the loading effect is fully correlated across the cross section dimensions of stiffeners and plates across the mid ship section are detailed in akpan et al 2002 for aframax and in khan et al 2006 for vlcc other ship parameters are summarized in table 1 since these two studies do not provide all data needed for cost benefit analysis other data are collected from existing studies the assumptions adopted to justify the selected studies are that a the two ships operate in the same region thus subject to the same environmental stressors and sea load conditions b the chemical composition of steel is similar for both ships c the same type of fuel is used in both ships and d the size and the orientation of the initial crack size is similar for stiffeners in both ships structural safety is assessed based on the performance function in eq 1 when assessing loading effects still water bending moment is assessed based on eqs 2 and 3 while wave induced bending moment is estimated according to ship operation conditions and eqs 8 and 9 full knowledge of operation conditions over the entire service life is difficult to obtain herein wave induced loads are estimated based on the extreme wave condition that may be encountered in the service life dnv 2009 in particular sea state 7 world meteorological organization 2017 is used to characterize the extreme wave condition and the design operating speed in man diesel 2008 is used for computing wave induced bending moment when determining the stress range for fatigue analysis a probabilistic ship operating profile i e sea states ship speeds and heading angles is considered the wave scatter diagram of north atlantic and the probability distributions of ship speeds and heading angles are obtained based on dnv 2014 and the actual ship operation data in sikora et al 2002 respectively an equivalent stress range is calculated based on the occurrence probabilities of different ship operating conditions and the crack growth coefficient m as follows kwon et al 2013 36 s r e i 1 s s j 1 s p k 1 w h p s s i p s p j p w h k s r e i j k m 1 m where p s s i p s p j p w h k probability of occurrence of the i th sea state j th ship speed and k th heading angle respectively m crack growth coefficient s r e effective stress range the initial design service life of both ships is considered to be 20 years the yield strength of structural steel is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution devine 2009 for aframax the mean value of the yield strength is 280 mpa for the entire mid ship cross section with a coefficient of variation of 0 1 akpan et al 2002 for vlcc the mean value of the yield strength is 269 mpa with a coefficient of variation of 0 08 for the side shell and 348 mpa for the ship deck and bottom with a coefficient of variation of 0 06 iacs 2006 khan et al 2006 both corrosion and fatigue are responsible for the reduction in flexural strength of ship hull structures corrosion effects are computed using eq 10 in this paper uniform corrosion which is the most common form of corrosion guedes soares et al 2009 moan and ayala uraga 2008 is considered though other types of corrosion e g pitting corrosion can also be incorporated into the assessment han et al 2019 variations in corrosion rates are considered for different segments of hull structures i e side shells ship deck and ship bottom these probabilistic parameters related to corrosion are summarized in table 2 for fatigue assessment fatigue cracks may initiate and propagate at the connections between stiffeners and transverse frames bulkheads abs 2012 sumi 1998 the time dependent fatigue crack size is predicted using eq 13 the uncertainties related to the loading effects and material properties are incorporated into fatigue modeling using random variables in table 3 it should be noted that the two ships are assumed to be made of the same type of steel and to operate in the same region therefore the values in tables 2 and 3 are applicable to both ships epistemic uncertainties are also considered using model errors listed in table 4 akpan et al 2002 these parameters are widely used and have been successfully applied to aframax and vlcc class oil tankers akpan et al 2002 teixeira 1997 to reflect corrosion and fatigue effects the dimensions of the section can be updated based on the results from deterioration modeling in eqs 10 17 once the loading effects and the time dependent structural capacity are determined the annual probability of flexural failure can be obtained using monte carlo simulation with 1 000 000 samples the sample size is determined to ensure that the estimated failure probability is converged fig 8 shows the time variant reliability indices and annual risks of the two ship cross sections the fluctuation in the reliability index curve results from the variation in the estimated failure probability when using monte carlo simulation since the fluctuation is concentrated mainly in the high reliability region it is not important to the determination of life cycle failure risk used in cost benefit analysis it can be seen that the reliability index profile exhibits clearly two stages with a transition point around year 17 the reliability index profiles subjected to corrosion alone fatigue alone and corrosion and fatigue combined are presented in fig 8 a this figure indicates that the decreasing reliability in the early stage of the service life is primarily attributed to corrosion by contrast fatigue is responsible for the dramatic drop of safety margin in the later stage of service life dictating structural safety represented by the lowest annual reliability in the ship service life due to the more severe failure consequences the life cycle risk of vlcc is much higher than that of aframax ship size can also affect other aspects of cost benefit analysis for instance larger ships may generate larger revenue but they may also have larger failure risk consume more fuel and have more details susceptible to deterioration on average it is assumed that the numbers of crew members on the aframax and vlcc are 24 4 and 25 0 respectively winchester et al 2006 the typical size of one tank for aframax and vlcc is 8145 8 metric tons and 18 106 5 metric tons respectively imo 2008 parameters associated with the net operating profits are summarized in table 5 based on turan et al 2009 eq 30 can relate the operating expenditure to the engine power the design speed of oil tankers and the fuel price given the engine power and design speed listed in table 1 and the assumption that both ships use the same type of fuel the parameters listed in table 5 are applicable to both aframax and vlcc the maintenance cost parameters from rigterink et al 2013 are selected and applied to both ships in this paper these cost parameters are estimated based on the material used and the weld length and are thus applicable to both oil tankers the discount rate of money is assumed to be 2 as stated previously these cost data may be subject to considerable exogenous uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis frangopol 1985 is conducted to investigate the effects of net operating profit maintenance cost and failure cost on bcrs and npvs of different eol strategies 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimal eol strategy the maintenance plan associated with an eol strategy i e service life extension or ship replacement includes the repair techniques the locations of repaired details and the times for implementing these actions as mentioned previously the differences between the two strategies are as follows a service life extension considers both preventative and essential maintenance actions while ship replacement considers only essential maintenance actions b ship replacement involves an overall renewal of structural performance at or near the end of the initial design service life the time of eol decision is assumed in year 10 the mid design life of a ship the annual target reliability index that will trigger essential maintenance actions is 2 5 based on paik and frieze 2001 for service life extension bcr and npv in eqs 32 and 34 are used as objective functions to optimize maintenance plans respectively for ship replacement essential maintenance actions are planned to maximize bcr and npv in eqs 33 and 35 genetic algorithm ga in matlab s global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015 is employed ga with a population size of 500 is used to guarantee diversity and a stall criterion of 100 generations is adopted to ensure the convergence of the optimal maintenance plan the selected parameters have been proven to yield convergent results for problems of a similar scale li et al 2018 nguyen 2017 oluleye et al 2014 an elite group consisting of 25 individuals i e 0 05 times population size is used to store optimal solutions throughout the evolution the laplace crossover strategy with a crossover probability of 0 8 and the adaptive mutation strategy are implemented in each generation mathworks 2015 different time spans of desired extra service life i e durations of phase ii are investigated for instance fig 9 shows the reliability index profiles of both ships with 15 year extra service life under service life extension and ship replacement strategies for service life extension one preventative and one essential maintenance action are needed while ship replacement itself without any additional essential maintenance actions can ensure the reliability index is higher than the target reliability the total costs of two ships are broken down to compare different cost components including life cycle failure risk maintenance cost the pie charts of different cost components in us dollars are shown in fig 10 for aframax and vlcc when the desired extra service life is a 5 years and b 15 years the bcr and npv profiles of the two eol strategies for both ships are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively in terms of both bcr and npv the financial performance of ship replacement gradually improves as the desired extra service life increases while that of service life extension peaks at the desired extra service life of around 15 years for the aframax ship both service life extension and ship replacement are financially feasible i e bcr 1 and npv 0 within the time span under consideration for the vlcc ship service life extension is always financially feasible while ship replacement only becomes feasible if the desired extra service life is longer than 2 years results in figs 11 and 12 can also be used to determine the optimal eol strategy based on different decision making rationales i e maximizing cost effectiveness as quantified by bcr or maximizing net benefit as quantified by npv fig 11 indicates that due to the significant newbuilding cost service life extension is preferred under shorter extra service life when the desired extra life is over 10 years bcr associated with ship replacement is higher than that associated with service life extension making ship replacement the preferred option if npv is used for decision making ship replacement quickly surpasses service life extension as the preferred eol management strategy regardless of the length of extra service life one specific time span of the desired extra service life is of particular interest this is the time span where the two strategies deliver the same financial performance in terms of bcr or npv this time span is referred to herein as the breakeven extra service life with respect to bcr this breakeven extra service life is 11 4 years for the aframax ship and 13 7 years for the vlcc ship as for npv the breakeven extra service life is 1 6 years for the aframax ship and 2 5 years for the vlcc ship this significant discrepancy of breakeven extra service life with respect to different financial indicators implies that if ship replacement is within the budget limit this strategy can usually bring in more profit in the long run however service life extension is more cost effective and appropriate when the available budget is low 5 2 sensitivity analysis the results presented previously hinge on various parameters such as failure cost target reliability index maintenance cost and net profit as stated previously various exogenous uncertainties are involved in these parameters for instance cost and profit of ship operation can fluctuate considerably during a long time span the annual target reliability index can vary depending on the operation environment moan 2005 therefore the breakeven extra service lives obtained previously are subject to a sensitivity analysis due to large uncertainties in the fatality and environmental costs sensitivity analysis of failure consequences is needed based on the data and various cost models presented in the previous section the total failure cost considering all three components ranges from 1 2 to 2 times the structural failure cost in the benchmark case the average value i e 1 6 times the structural failure cost is used to quantify failure risk its upper 1 2 times and lower 2 times bounds are investigated in the sensitivity analysis accordingly the corresponding relative change 25 to the benchmark value is also applied to other economic variables specifically the increase and decrease in net profit n p o p i e 25 and maintenance cost c m a i n i e 25 are considered in the sensitivity analysis for the target reliability index 0 5 to its benchmark value β 2 and 3 are investigated herein one factor at a time ofat method is used for sensitivity analysis namely change is only applied to one input parameter while other parameters remain the same as those described in the previous example the breakeven extra service life is determined based on bcr and npv respectively fig 13 shows the changes in the bcr based breakeven extra service life for the aframax and vlcc ships respectively it can be seen that failure cost is the most important factor for selecting between ship life extension and ship replacement for npv based decision making shown in fig 14 failure cost and annual net profit can significantly affect the breakeven extra service life complicating the selection of the optimal eol strategy it should be noted that the breakeven extra service life is very sensitive to the uncertainties of input parameters regardless of bcr or npv 6 conclusions this paper proposes a risk informed framework to determine the optimal end of life eol strategies for ships i e service life extension and ship replacement the flexural failure of the mid ship section is considered as the primary failure mode uncertainties associated with the joint corrosion fatigue process are considered through structural reliability analysis the proposed framework takes into account the time variant reliability of deteriorating ships failure risk annual net operating profit and maintenance cost benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv are used as financial performance indicators to reflect respectively the cost effectiveness and net benefit of different eol strategies maintenance actions are planned using metaheuristic optimization to maximize the financial performance of deteriorating structures the proposed framework is applied to the mid ship sections of aframax and vlcc class oil tankers a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of exogenous uncertainties from costs profits and safety requirements on the optimal eol strategies the following conclusions are drawn 1 the proposed framework is able to deliver the optimal end of life eol management strategy for different sizes of oil tankers given the extra service life specified by decision makers it can devise repair actions that ensure the safety margin of ships and examine the financial feasibility of repair actions and eol decisions 2 as typical eol decisions service life extension and ship replacement are investigated in this paper both can achieve continuous ship operation at the end of the initial design service life of ships for service life extension of old ships the safety margin can be preserved through proactive intervention including both preventative and essential maintenance actions for ship replacement only essential maintenance needs to be considered cost benefit analysis based on either bcr or npv indicates that both strategies are financially feasible in a wide variety of cases e g under different desired service life extensions and for ships of different sizes 3 bcr and npv can be used as financial performance indicators to determine the optimal eol strategy bcr focuses on the cost effectiveness of a strategy while npv evaluates the net benefit associated with a strategy due to the significant newbuilding cost bcr based decision making prefers service life extension of old ships over ship replacement under shorter extra service life however service life extension is outweighed by ship replacement when the desired extra life is over 10 years or npv is used for decision making 4 during eol decision making if ship replacement is within the budget limit this eol strategy can usually bring in more profit in the long run however service life extension is more cost effective and therefore advantageous in the cases where the available budget is limited 5 the sensitivity analysis conducted reveals that breakeven extra service life is sensitive to the exogenous uncertainties arising from cost profits and safety requirements it is found that failure risk is the most important factor in the bcr based eol decision making process for npv based decision making failure cost and net profit can both significantly affect the breakeven time complicating the selection of the optimal eol strategy 6 it should be noted that the time variant reliability of ship structure is dominated by the underlying deteriorating process the reliability profile will ultimately affect the optimal maintenance actions the second order interactions between corrosion and fatigue such as fatigue crack nucleation at corrosion pits and the effect of corrosive environments on fatigue crack growth are not addressed in this paper therefore more accurate deterioration models can benefit the application of the proposed framework and deserve future studies credit authorship contribution statement liang liu methodology software formal

21998,service life extension through proactive maintenance has become increasingly important for ships due to significant cost associated with new ship acquisition and adequate remaining load carrying capacity while continuous operation beyond design service life can offer economic profits to ship owners it may also incur significant costs associated with maintenance and operation as well as higher failure risk additionally decisions for life extension can be complicated by the uncertainties associated with structural performance under deteriorating stressors such as corrosion and fatigue therefore service life extension of ships should be planned in a cost effective and reliable manner this paper proposes a risk informed framework that determines the optimal end of life strategies for ships service life extension or ship decommissioning and replacement a cost benefit analysis is integrated into the framework to account for deteriorating ship performance life cycle risk loss of service maintenance costs and net operating profits the proposed framework is applied to two categories of oil tankers to highlight the effect of ship size on the cost effectiveness and net benefit of different end of life strategies a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the critical factors in the decision making process keywords service life extension cost benefit analysis corrosion fatigue maintenance 1 introduction continuation of ship operation beyond the design service life is becoming more prevalent due to significant cost associated with new ship acquisition and adequate remaining load carrying capacity in the united states more than 40 of ships are operating beyond their initial design service life abs 2012 for ships in need of extending service life prudent maintenance actions are vital in order to ensure safe operation boulares et al 2017 while longer operational life can be beneficial for ship owners different end of life eol strategies e g service life extension or ship decommissioning and replacement may result in different structural capacities and total life cycle costs of ships the decisions on eol strategies should be made to ensure ship safety margin in design and extended service life considering the limited financial resources for service life extension it is also necessary to identify the management strategies that can deliver the best return on life extension investment this paper proposes a management framework that determines the optimal eol strategies service life extension as an additional option to the conventional eol strategy i e decommissioning and replacement is gaining momentum across different industry sectors shafiee and animah 2017 in the maritime industry service life extension means that the service life of a ship is extended beyond its design service life by applying maintenance or modification on ship details abs 2017 to ensure no compromise on safe operation service life extension can avoid the costly investment in new ship acquisition and harness the benefits from prolonged ship operation by planning and implementing preventative and essential maintenance actions failure risk in the extended operational service life can also be taken under control kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 herein preventative maintenance actions refer to proactive actions before any critical performance level is reached frangopol et al 2001 van noortwijk and frangopol 2004 while essential maintenance actions are reactive actions when critical performance levels relevant to ship safety are reached for structural components or the entire ship structure das 1999 frangopol and das 1999 for ship structures several studies have been performed to extend their service life in the preliminary design phase knight et al 2015 and in the in service phase kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 soliman et al 2016 for instance soliman et al 2016 developed a probabilistic maintenance planning framework based on multi objective optimization maximizing the service life while minimizing the total life cycle cost liu et al 2019 compared the benefits of maintenance actions for ship structures considering two preassigned spans of extended service life nevertheless none of the previous studies investigated the preference of different eol management strategies in the decision making process the cost benefit consideration has been one of the major components in the decision making process for setting target safety level guia et al 2018 evaluating the safety of ship structures garbatov and guedes soares 2008 imo 2018 paik et al 2006 planning ship maintenance abbott et al 2000 li et al 2005 xiang et al 2012 and ship recycling at the end of service life choi et al 2016 for instance cost benefit analysis has been implemented in the past to determine or prioritize maintenance actions for deteriorating ship structures especially when maintenance actions require various costs and have different effects on structures abbott et al 2000 li et al 2005 xiang et al 2012 choi et al 2016 promoted the use of cost benefit analysis in eol management by appraising recycling methods in different standards however past studies were conducted to ensure structure performance within the initial design service life without considering potential service life extension or new ship acquisition there is a lack of decision support frameworks for determining the optimal eol management strategy with respect to cost effectiveness and net benefit while satisfying the extra service life specified by decision makers when selecting eol strategies structural deterioration must be properly considered fatigue and corrosion are the most significant and pervasive deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures akpan et al 2002 guedes soares and garbatov 1996 furthermore considerable uncertainties are involved in both deterioration processes the presence of these uncertainties necessitates the use of probabilistic approaches for structural performance assessment and the determination of maintenance actions reliability and risk based indicators have been extensively used to assess performance of deteriorating structures due to corrosion fatigue and their interacting effects han et al 2019 moan and ayala uraga 2008 souza and ayyub 2009 stambaugh et al 2014 based on these indicators optimal life cycle maintenance plans can be determined frangopol 2011 dong and frangopol 2015 garbatov and guedes soares 2001 lazakis et al 2010 guedes soares and garbatov 1996 in this paper a novel framework is proposed to determine the optimal eol strategy based on the cost effectiveness or net benefit both reliability and failure risk are considered based on probabilistic life cycle assessment of structural performance the proposed framework considers the effects of both corrosion and fatigue the cost benefit analysis for different eol strategies includes net operating profit cost associated with ship failure maintenance cost and loss of service due to maintenance the cost effectiveness and net benefit associated with different eol strategies are assessed in terms of benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv respectively the optimal eol strategies are determined for different spans of extra service life the proposed framework is applied to two oil tankers of different categories in order to highlight the effect of ship size on service life extension 2 reliability analysis of deteriorating ship hull structures due to structural deterioration life cycle structural performance should be assessed to determine optimal eol strategies ship hull performance against flexural failure is considered as a major factor for ship safety assessment paik and frieze 2001 guedes soares and teixeira 2001 fatigue and corrosion are the most significant and pervasive deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures guedes soares and garbatov 1999 the reduction in ship cross section due to corrosion and fatigue can compromise the load carrying capacity i e structural resistance of ships and potentially endanger ship safety therefore reliability of deteriorating ship hull structures against flexural failure is analyzed 2 1 ultimate limit state the performance function associated with the flexural failure of ship hull structures can be

deterioration mechanisms associated with ship structures akpan et al 2002 proposed the following model to compute thickness loss of a corroded plate 10 d t c 1 t t 0 c o r r c 2 where d t thickness loss mm t time in service years t 0 c o r r corrosion initiation time c 1 and c 2 parameters associated with corrosion rate past studies indicate that the value of c 2 varies in the range of 0 3 1 5 kondo 1987 melchers 1999 paik et al 2003 values lower than 1 as proposed by kondo 1987 and melchers 1999 indicate that corrosion may stabilize over time which may not be appropriate for ships that are constantly exposed to corrosive environments paik et al 2003 compared corrosion models with different c 2 values of 1 0 1 2 and 1 5 based on experimental data in exposure tests they concluded that c 2 approximately equals to 1 after a relatively short initial period therefore c 2 1 is used in this paper and c 1 becomes the annual corrosion rate mm year another major deterioration mechanism is

fatigue the interaction between corrosion and fatigue is considered based on the fact that both can reduce the effective area of a ship cross section leading to lower structural resistance against flexure failure there may also exist second order interactions such as fatigue crack nucleation at corrosion pits and the effect of corrosive environments on fatigue crack growth however they are not addressed in this paper the detailed analysis regarding this aspect can be found in bastidas arteaga et al 2009 and han et al 2019 a ship structural detail subjected to both corrosion and fatigue is shown in fig 1 taking into account the fatigue crack size a t and the corrosion induced thickness loss d t the time variant geometric properties of envelop plates and hull stiffeners can be computed as dong and frangopol 2015 15 b p t b p 0 d t 16 w f i t w f 0 i a t 17 h w i t h w 0 i a t where b p 0 initial thickness of the envelop plate w f 0 i and h w 0 i initial flange width and web height of the i th stiffener respectively a t crack length within the stiffener and d t corrosion depth of the envelop plate based on eqs 15 17 the time variant elastic section modulus in eq 1 can be calculated to determine the time variant failure probability of ship hull structures in flexure 3 decision support framework for eol management typically ship maintenance can be planned based on minimization of maintenance costs under reliability or risk constraints minimization of risk or failure probability under cost constraints or multi objective optimization considering reliability risk maintenance costs and such as damage detection delay frangopol and kim 2019 frangopol and liu 2007 soliman et al 2016 besides risk and maintenance cost eol management should also consider the benefit within the service life herein cost benefit analysis is conducted to determine optimal eol strategies under different spans of service life for a ship structure under consideration cost is generated from the time of decision to the end of the initial design service life i e the remaining design service life herein referred to as phase i and in the desired extra service life herein referred to as phase ii the extra service life can be achieved either by additional proactive maintenance in the extended service life or by ship replacement near the end of the initial design service life it is herein assumed that service life extension requires proactive maintenance including preventative and essential maintenance actions while only essential maintenance actions are considered if ship replacement is used as the eol strategy this paper aims to determine major maintenance actions to ensure the safety margin of ships during extra service life it is assumed that routine maintenance such as repairing hatch coaming and maintaining ship engines stopford 2009 does not drastically affect the ship reliability under the ultimate limit state analyzed in this paper additionally the periodic regular maintenance may not deliver the minimum life cycle cost garbatov and guedes soares 2001 therefore the total cost includes the total failure risk in phases i and ii maintenance cost and replacement cost if available for benefits in phases i and ii annual net profit e g total revenue minus operational and miscellaneous costs can be used to calculate total benefits in phases i and ii cost and benefit models used herein are described in the following subsections 3 1 failure risk failure risk considers both failure probability and failure consequences of ship structures the total failure risk in phases i and ii can be expressed as 18 r f t 1 t e x t c f c l c s p i l l p f t 1 r t where t lead time since the time of eol decision year p f t annual probability of flexural failure defined in eq 1 at year t t e x t duration of phases i and ii years c f c l and c s p i l l monetary loss associated with structural failure cost fatality cost and environmental cost and r discount rate the failure consequences due to flexural failure can be estimated by the structural cost as follows miroyannis 2006 19 c f 5747 19 s t f d i s p 0 3792 w g t 100 0 862 800 w g t 100 where c f monetary loss usd w g t 100 the weight of structural system in ship work breakdown system long ton s t f ship type factor and d i s p full load displacement of a ship long ton due to

c r e w probability of a fatality given ship failure l f losses associated with a fatality the average number of crew members on oil tankers can be obtained through surveys the probability of a

at 300 000 usd kunreuther 1974 or the cost of averting a fatality estimated at 3 000 000 usd guia et al 2018 imo 2018 given the large range of the fatality probability and the loss associated with a fatality their corresponding average values are used in the analysis to compute fatality cost the environmental impact associated with the failure of oil tankers is attributed to oil spills on the surrounding water an oil spill can incur clean up expenses and fishery related costs both can be related to the volume of spilt oil various models have been proposed to quantify the associated cost imo 2018 psarros et al 2011 ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 yamada 2009 among these models yamada 2009 yields the lowest oil spill cost due to excluding factors such as tourism related damages and environmental damage while ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 produces the highest cost due to a more comprehensive oil spill database in this paper the median cost model among the surveyed models proposed by imo 2018 is selected for analysis based on this model the oil spill cost can be expressed as imo 2018 21 c s p i l l 42301 v 0 7233 where v volume of oil spilt that requires clean ups liu and frangopol 2018 estimated the volume of an oil spill based on the number and the capacity of damaged tanks in this paper the case where oil spills from the two adjacent tanks at midship is assumed for the analysis it should be noted that the failure cost components mentioned above involve considerable uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis should be conducted 3 2 maintenance cost maintenance actions may vary depending on the deterioration mechanism corrosion or fatigue deterioration extent and locations and the feasibility of dry docking for fatigue commonly used maintenance actions include cropping and renewing gouge and re weld hole drilling and design modifications e g enhance thickness or grade of steel and add brackets iacs 2007 for corrosion coating double plates and inserting plates are widely used for repair abs 2012 since this paper aims to determine the maintenance actions for service life extension temporary repairs such as hole drilling coating and gouge and re welding are not considered instead only permanent repairs are investigated specifically the repair action for fatigue damage is to a crop the cracked plate stiffener b insert a new plate and c add soft toe bracket when necessary see fig 2 for illustration the repair action for corrosion damage is to replace the corroded envelop plates the corresponding repair cost of one maintenance campaign is estimated as turan et al 2009 22 c r e p a i r d e t a i l c m a t e r i a l d e t a i l c c o n s d e t a i l c w e l d d e t a i l 23 c m a t e r i a l d e t a i l c m a t e r i a l ρ s

c r e p a i r i cost of the i th repair action n total number of maintenance actions including both preventative and essential actions and t r e p a i r i application time of the i th repair action since the eol decision year in addition to repair costs the cost associated with loss of service termed herein as unavailability cost is also considered this cost is defined as the revenue loss of ships during repair it can be expressed as turan et al 2009 27 c u n a i 1 n r a d e t w e l d a d e t a i l i h w o r k 1 r t r e p a i r i where c u n a unavailability cost r a d e average daily

salaries and pensions vary significantly among ship owners fuel consumption on the other hand is related to cargo carrying capacity engine type and voyage duration turan et al 2009 it accounts for a great portion of the total operating cost nikolaisen 2014 therefore the operating cost is expressed herein by the cost of fuel consumption as turan et al 2009 30 c o p t 1 t e x t 365 p c t o p e r d

present value npv both bcr and npv have been used in the life cycle management of civil structures mondoro et al 2018 padgett et al 2010 van der pol et al 2017 bcr herein is defined as the ratio of the discounted benefit i e net profit stemming from operation in phases i and ii to the discounted total life cycle cost i e failure risk maintenance cost and loss of service in the same period npv is the difference between the discounted benefit and the discounted cost both indicators can determine the financial feasibility of different management strategies i e bcr 1 and npv 0 however when used to compare different strategies they are based on different rationales bcr can reflect the cost effectiveness of different strategies namely the amount of return for every dollar invested nonetheless it does not provide any indication of the magnitude of the total net benefit khurshid et al 2009 npv on the other hand does provide this magnitude but it is difficult to solely rely on npv for strategy comparison when candidate strategies require drastically different investments remer and nieto 1995 therefore both bcr and npv have been used to form decision support for eol management decision makers can select the most appropriate strategy based on their own investment goals and financial constraints for service life extension the associated bcr b c r s l e with a desired duration of life extension t e x t can be expressed as 32 b c r s l e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a c m a i n for ship replacement the associated bcr b c r r e p l a c e can be expressed as 33 b c r r e p l a c e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a e s s c m a i n e s s c r e p l a c e 1 r t r e p l a c e where c r e p l a c e the replacement cost of a new ship as defined in eq 19 c u n a e s s and c m a i n e s s discounted unavailability and maintenance costs associated with only essential maintenance actions respectively t r e p l a c e time of replacement year since the time of decision the salvage value for a decommissioned ship is neglected since it is small compared to the total replacement cost kaplan 1974 similar to eqs 32 and 33 the npv associated with service life extension and ship replacement can be expressed as 34 n p v s l e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a c m a i n 35 n p v r e p l a c e t e x t n p o p r f c u n a e s s c m a i n e s s c r e p l a c e 1 r t r e p l a c e it should be noted that compared to ship replacement service life extension may have many other benefits e g the reduced environmental impacts regarding decommissioning and disposal of structures shafiee and animah 2017 nevertheless these additional benefits are not considered in this paper since they only account for around 2 of the total life cycle revenue ko and gantner 2016 turan et al 2009 3 5 optimal eol management this paper aims to determine the optimal eol management strategy fulfilling the financial needs of ship owners to this end this paper divides the total service life of a ship into two phases the initial design service life i e phase i which is regulated by existing design standards and the extended service life i e phase ii which is specified by decision makers given the desired extended service life the optimization is conducted to determine a management strategy that can yield the highest financial performance while maintaining an adequate safety margin the proposed decision support framework uses bcr or npv as an indicator to a plan the proactive maintenance actions for service life extension and b to select the optimal eol strategy between service life extension and ship replacement the location of maintained structural details and the type of maintenance can affect the structural performance and the associated life cycle cost therefore they are considered as design variables of the optimization problem fig 3 illustrates the two eol strategies considered in this study i e service life extension and ship replacement for service life extension the following optimization problem is formulated and solved to obtain the maintenance plan given parameters associated with ship configuration including ship type and dimension l s h i p t y p e b s h i p t y p e and c b s h i p t y p e where s h i p t y p e can be aframax or vlcc fatigue and corrosion models as well as their associated parameters a 0 c m g c 1 c 1 a n d t 0 c o r r in eqs 10 and

and stiffeners subjected to corrosion and fatigue respectively maintenance costs 0 c m 1 c m 2 c m 3 where c m 1 cost associated with maintenance option 1 c m 2 cost associated with maintenance option

metaheuristic procedure is used to determine the optimal management plans ga is computationally suitable for the optimization problem given all the design variables are integers however the slow convergence rate of ga may make the optimization process a time consuming task rao and xiong 2005 ga has been successfully implemented to obtain optimal life cycle management plans for ships dong and frangopol 2015 soliman et al 2016 fig 4 summarizes the aforementioned optimization process to determine the optimal maintenance plan for service life extension the chromosome representing the design variables of ga is shown in fig 5 the associated maximum bcr or npv associated with service life extension can be obtained for ship replacement strategy a new ship is acquired and placed in service at or near the end of the initial design service life essential maintenance actions are implemented whenever the annual target reliability index is reached the associated bcr or npv can be calculated with eqs 33 and 35 respectively the parameters and the constraints remain the same as those in the optimization problem associated with service life extension the optimization variables during dl and rl include the location of structural details that need essential maintenance and the type of maintenance actions performed on structural details the obtained bcrs or npvs associated with service life extension and ship replacement are compared to select the optimal eol strategy it should be noted that the quantification of various cost components can be challenging and highly uncertain due to external circumstances such as ship types voyage duration maintenance resources and profitability of the shipping market historic cost data can help the cost benefit analysis but cannot entirely reflect the uncertainties in order to quantify these exogenous uncertainties a sensitivity analysis should be conducted to investigate the criticality of different factors in affecting bcrs and npvs of different eol strategies 4 illustrative example the proposed framework is applied to two oil tankers of different categories oil tankers are typically divided into six categories based on their deadweight tonnage abs 2012 in an increasing order they are handy panamax aframax suezmax very large crude carrier vlcc and ultra large crude carrier ulcc aframax and vlcc are selected due to their high structural failure rates eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 and widespread use in the oil transportation industry clarksons 2015 they can also highlight the effect of ship size on eol management the ship hull structures are analyzed in this paper for flexural failure mentioned previously the mid ship sections of the two ship hull structures are considered these mid ship sections are shown in figs 6 and 7 the mid ship sections are divided into three segments the deck side shell and ship bottom as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 with respect to random variables in corrosion and fatigue models full correlation is assumed for stiffeners within the same segment while these random variables are considered to be statistically independent for stiffeners from different segments since the vertical bending moment still water and wave induced are imposed on the entire hull section the loading effect is fully correlated across the cross section dimensions of stiffeners and plates across the mid ship section are detailed in akpan et al 2002 for aframax and in khan et al 2006 for vlcc other ship parameters are summarized in table 1 since these two studies do not provide all data needed for cost benefit analysis other data are collected from existing studies the assumptions adopted to justify the selected studies are that a the two ships operate in the same region thus subject to the same environmental stressors and sea load conditions b the chemical composition of steel is similar for both ships c the same type of fuel is used in both ships and d the size and the orientation of the initial crack size is similar for stiffeners in both ships structural safety is assessed based on the performance function in eq 1 when assessing loading effects still water bending moment is assessed based on eqs 2 and 3 while wave induced bending moment is estimated according to ship operation conditions and eqs 8 and 9 full knowledge of operation conditions over the entire service life is difficult to obtain herein wave induced loads are estimated based on the extreme wave condition that may be encountered in the service life dnv 2009 in particular sea state 7 world meteorological organization 2017 is used to characterize the extreme wave condition and the design operating speed in man diesel 2008 is used for computing wave induced bending moment when determining the stress range for fatigue analysis a probabilistic ship operating profile i e sea states ship speeds and heading angles is considered the wave scatter diagram of north atlantic and the probability distributions of ship speeds and heading angles are obtained based on dnv 2014 and the actual ship operation data in sikora et al 2002 respectively an equivalent stress range is calculated based on the occurrence probabilities of different ship operating conditions and the crack growth coefficient m as follows kwon et al 2013 36 s r e i 1 s s j 1 s p k 1 w h p s s i p s p j p w h k s r e i j k m 1 m where p s s i p s p j p w h k probability of occurrence of the i th sea state j th ship speed and k th heading angle respectively m crack growth coefficient s r e effective stress range the initial design service life of both ships is considered to be 20 years the yield strength of structural steel is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution devine 2009 for aframax the mean value of the yield strength is 280 mpa for the entire mid ship cross section with a coefficient of variation of 0 1 akpan et al 2002 for vlcc the mean value of the yield strength is 269 mpa with a coefficient of variation of 0 08 for the side shell and 348 mpa for the ship deck and bottom with a coefficient of variation of 0 06 iacs 2006 khan et al 2006 both corrosion and fatigue are responsible for the reduction in flexural strength of ship hull structures corrosion effects are computed using eq 10 in this paper uniform corrosion which is the most common form of corrosion guedes soares et al 2009 moan and ayala uraga 2008 is considered though other types of corrosion e g pitting corrosion can also be incorporated into the assessment han et al 2019 variations in corrosion rates are considered for different segments of hull structures i e side shells ship deck and ship bottom these probabilistic parameters related to corrosion are summarized in table 2 for fatigue assessment fatigue cracks may initiate and propagate at the connections between stiffeners and transverse frames bulkheads abs 2012 sumi 1998 the time dependent fatigue crack size is predicted using eq 13 the uncertainties related to the loading effects and material properties are incorporated into fatigue modeling using random variables in table 3 it should be noted that the two ships are assumed to be made of the same type of steel and to operate in the same region therefore the values in tables 2 and 3 are applicable to both ships epistemic uncertainties are also considered using model errors listed in table 4 akpan et al 2002 these parameters are widely used and have been successfully applied to aframax and vlcc class oil tankers akpan et al 2002 teixeira 1997 to reflect corrosion and fatigue effects the dimensions of the section can be updated based on the results from deterioration modeling in eqs 10 17 once the loading effects and the time dependent structural capacity are determined the annual probability of flexural failure can be obtained using monte carlo simulation with 1 000 000 samples the sample size is determined to ensure that the estimated failure probability is converged fig 8 shows the time variant reliability indices and annual risks of the two ship cross sections the fluctuation in the reliability index curve results from the variation in the estimated failure probability when using monte carlo simulation since the fluctuation is concentrated mainly in the high reliability region it is not important to the determination of life cycle failure risk used in cost benefit analysis it can be seen that the reliability index profile exhibits clearly two stages with a transition point around year 17 the reliability index profiles subjected to corrosion alone fatigue alone and corrosion and fatigue combined are presented in fig 8 a this figure indicates that the decreasing reliability in the early stage of the service life is primarily attributed to corrosion by contrast fatigue is responsible for the dramatic drop of safety margin in the later stage of service life dictating structural safety represented by the lowest annual reliability in the ship service life due to the more severe failure consequences the life cycle risk of vlcc is much higher than that of aframax ship size can also affect other aspects of cost benefit analysis for instance larger ships may generate larger revenue but they may also have larger failure risk consume more fuel and have more details susceptible to deterioration on average it is assumed that the numbers of crew members on the aframax and vlcc are 24 4 and 25 0 respectively winchester et al 2006 the typical size of one tank for aframax and vlcc is 8145 8 metric tons and 18 106 5 metric tons respectively imo 2008 parameters associated with the net operating profits are summarized in table 5 based on turan et al 2009 eq 30 can relate the operating expenditure to the engine power the design speed of oil tankers and the fuel price given the engine power and design speed listed in table 1 and the assumption that both ships use the same type of fuel the parameters listed in table 5 are applicable to both aframax and vlcc the maintenance cost parameters from rigterink et al 2013 are selected and applied to both ships in this paper these cost parameters are estimated based on the material used and the weld length and are thus applicable to both oil tankers the discount rate of money is assumed to be 2 as stated previously these cost data may be subject to considerable exogenous uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis frangopol 1985 is conducted to investigate the effects of net operating profit maintenance cost and failure cost on bcrs and npvs of different eol strategies 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimal eol strategy the maintenance plan associated with an eol strategy i e service life extension or ship replacement includes the repair techniques the locations of repaired details and the times for implementing these actions as mentioned previously the differences between the two strategies are as follows a service life extension considers both preventative and essential maintenance actions while ship replacement considers only essential maintenance actions b ship replacement involves an overall renewal of structural performance at or near the end of the initial design service life the time of eol decision is assumed in year 10 the mid design life of a ship the annual target reliability index that will trigger essential maintenance actions is 2 5 based on paik and frieze 2001 for service life extension bcr and npv in eqs 32 and 34 are used as objective functions to optimize maintenance plans respectively for ship replacement essential maintenance actions are planned to maximize bcr and npv in eqs 33 and 35 genetic algorithm ga in matlab s global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015 is employed ga with a population size of 500 is used to guarantee diversity and a stall criterion of 100 generations is adopted to ensure the convergence of the optimal maintenance plan the selected parameters have been proven to yield convergent results for problems of a similar scale li et al 2018 nguyen 2017 oluleye et al 2014 an elite group consisting of 25 individuals i e 0 05 times population size is used to store optimal solutions throughout the evolution the laplace crossover strategy with a crossover probability of 0 8 and the adaptive mutation strategy are implemented in each generation mathworks 2015 different time spans of desired extra service life i e durations of phase ii are investigated for instance fig 9 shows the reliability index profiles of both ships with 15 year extra service life under service life extension and ship replacement strategies for service life extension one preventative and one essential maintenance action are needed while ship replacement itself without any additional essential maintenance actions can ensure the reliability index is higher than the target reliability the total costs of two ships are broken down to compare different cost components including life cycle failure risk maintenance cost the pie charts of different cost components in us dollars are shown in fig 10 for aframax and vlcc when the desired extra service life is a 5 years and b 15 years the bcr and npv profiles of the two eol strategies for both ships are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively in terms of both bcr and npv the financial performance of ship replacement gradually improves as the desired extra service life increases while that of service life extension peaks at the desired extra service life of around 15 years for the aframax ship both service life extension and ship replacement are financially feasible i e bcr 1 and npv 0 within the time span under consideration for the vlcc ship service life extension is always financially feasible while ship replacement only becomes feasible if the desired extra service life is longer than 2 years results in figs 11 and 12 can also be used to determine the optimal eol strategy based on different decision making rationales i e maximizing cost effectiveness as quantified by bcr or maximizing net benefit as quantified by npv fig 11 indicates that due to the significant newbuilding cost service life extension is preferred under shorter extra service life when the desired extra life is over 10 years bcr associated with ship replacement is higher than that associated with service life extension making ship replacement the preferred option if npv is used for decision making ship replacement quickly surpasses service life extension as the preferred eol management strategy regardless of the length of extra service life one specific time span of the desired extra service life is of particular interest this is the time span where the two strategies deliver the same financial performance in terms of bcr or npv this time span is referred to herein as the breakeven extra service life with respect to bcr this breakeven extra service life is 11 4 years for the aframax ship and 13 7 years for the vlcc ship as for npv the breakeven extra service life is 1 6 years for the aframax ship and 2 5 years for the vlcc ship this significant discrepancy of breakeven extra service life with respect to different financial indicators implies that if ship replacement is within the budget limit this strategy can usually bring in more profit in the long run however service life extension is more cost effective and appropriate when the available budget is low 5 2 sensitivity analysis the results presented previously hinge on various parameters such as failure cost target reliability index maintenance cost and net profit as stated previously various exogenous uncertainties are involved in these parameters for instance cost and profit of ship operation can fluctuate considerably during a long time span the annual target reliability index can vary depending on the operation environment moan 2005 therefore the breakeven extra service lives obtained previously are subject to a sensitivity analysis due to large uncertainties in the fatality and environmental costs sensitivity analysis of failure consequences is needed based on the data and various cost models presented in the previous section the total failure cost considering all three components ranges from 1 2 to 2 times the structural failure cost in the benchmark case the average value i e 1 6 times the structural failure cost is used to quantify failure risk its upper 1 2 times and lower 2 times bounds are investigated in the sensitivity analysis accordingly the corresponding relative change 25 to the benchmark value is also applied to other economic variables specifically the increase and decrease in net profit n p o p i e 25 and maintenance cost c m a i n i e 25 are considered in the sensitivity analysis for the target reliability index 0 5 to its benchmark value β 2 and 3 are investigated herein one factor at a time ofat method is used for sensitivity analysis namely change is only applied to one input parameter while other parameters remain the same as those described in the previous example the breakeven extra service life is determined based on bcr and npv respectively fig 13 shows the changes in the bcr based breakeven extra service life for the aframax and vlcc ships respectively it can be seen that failure cost is the most important factor for selecting between ship life extension and ship replacement for npv based decision making shown in fig 14 failure cost and annual net profit can significantly affect the breakeven extra service life complicating the selection of the optimal eol strategy it should be noted that the breakeven extra service life is very sensitive to the uncertainties of input parameters regardless of bcr or npv 6 conclusions this paper proposes a risk informed framework to determine the optimal end of life eol strategies for ships i e service life extension and ship replacement the flexural failure of the mid ship section is considered as the primary failure mode uncertainties associated with the joint corrosion fatigue process are considered through structural reliability analysis the proposed framework takes into account the time variant reliability of deteriorating ships failure risk annual net operating profit and maintenance cost benefit cost ratio bcr and net present value npv are used as financial performance indicators to reflect respectively the cost effectiveness and net benefit of different eol strategies maintenance actions are planned using metaheuristic optimization to maximize the financial performance of deteriorating structures the proposed framework is applied to the mid ship sections of aframax and vlcc class oil tankers a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of exogenous uncertainties from costs profits and safety requirements on the optimal eol strategies the following conclusions are drawn 1 the proposed framework is able to deliver the optimal end of life eol management strategy for different sizes of oil tankers given the extra service life specified by decision makers it can devise repair actions that ensure the safety margin of ships and examine the financial feasibility of repair actions and eol decisions 2 as typical eol decisions service life extension and ship replacement are investigated in this paper both can achieve continuous ship operation at the end of the initial design service life of ships for service life extension of old ships the safety margin can be preserved through proactive intervention including both preventative and essential maintenance actions for ship replacement only essential maintenance needs to be considered cost benefit analysis based on either bcr or npv indicates that both strategies are financially feasible in a wide variety of cases e g under different desired service life extensions and for ships of different sizes 3 bcr and npv can be used as financial performance indicators to determine the optimal eol strategy bcr focuses on the cost effectiveness of a strategy while npv evaluates the net benefit associated with a strategy due to the significant newbuilding cost bcr based decision making prefers service life extension of old ships over ship replacement under shorter extra service life however service life extension is outweighed by ship replacement when the desired extra life is over 10 years or npv is used for decision making 4 during eol decision making if ship replacement is within the budget limit this eol strategy can usually bring in more profit in the long run however service life extension is more cost effective and therefore advantageous in the cases where the available budget is limited 5 the sensitivity analysis conducted reveals that breakeven extra service life is sensitive to the exogenous uncertainties arising from cost profits and safety requirements it is found that failure risk is the most important factor in the bcr based eol decision making process for npv based decision making failure cost and net profit can both significantly affect the breakeven time complicating the selection of the optimal eol strategy 6 it should be noted that the time variant reliability of ship structure is dominated by the underlying deteriorating process the reliability profile will ultimately affect the optimal maintenance actions the second order interactions between corrosion and fatigue such as fatigue crack nucleation at corrosion pits and the effect of corrosive environments on fatigue crack growth are not addressed in this paper therefore more accurate deterioration models can benefit the application of the proposed framework and deserve future studies credit authorship contribution statement liang liu methodology software formal

21999,due to the strong interaction between the bridges and the extreme waves generated by hurricanes and tsunamis many coastal bridges were damaged in the past few decades in this study in order to investigate the effect of the extreme wave on a bridge tsunami like wave generated based on record in the iwate station during 2011 japan tsunami event instead of solitary wave is employed to impinge on the bridge with or without air vent according to the computational fluid dynamics cfd theory with a volume of fluid vof interface tracking approach a numerical wave tank nwt is developed in which the immersed boundary ib method is referred to simulate fluid and structure interaction the model is calibrated with the experiment in this numerical tank the effects of tsunami like waves with different prominent conditions including wave height and submersion depth on the bridges are studied besides the efficiency of air vent in reducing the hydrodynamic load is also discussed the results indicate that when the tsunami like wave overtops the bridges a noticeable overtopping where the flow injects into the water fiercely and the whole flow field is very chaotic is observed the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces leading to many decks to collapse between two piers with small lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the load oscillation of the bridge the position of the bridge relative to the initial sea level has a serious impact on the forces on the bridge when the tsunami like wave passes through it with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge also increase but the effect duration reduces after the air vent is installed air vent can reduce the forces on the bridge and improve the efficiency of the bridge protection keywords tsunami like wave solitary wave bridge air vent vof hydrodynamic loads 1 introduction coastal bridge as an important tool connecting to lands can be satisfied with the complex coastal transport however the bridge structures are very vulnerable to the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces especially in the extreme waves during the tsunami and hurricane events as the sea level increases the bridge may be partially and fully inundated and air can be trapped causing the external additional force once the combined forces exceed the structural bearing capacity of the bridges the bridges ultimately are damaged o connor and mcanany 2018 for instance the 2004 indian ocean tsunami resulted in the loss of about half of these bridges along the only road connecting the major indonesian cities of meulaboh and banda aceh similarly over 300 bridges in the region affected by the tsunami induced by the 2011 great east japan earthquake were either wiped out or damaged beyond repair winter et al 2017 according to the bridge failure reports when the tsunami impinges on the bridge the vertical liftoff or overturning of bridge occurs from their substructures to the superstructure followed by lateral displacement of the superstructure to understand the mechanism of bridge failure and evaluate potential damage under waves both physical experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out goseberg et al 2013 rossetto et al 2011 williams and fuhrman 2016 cheng et al 2018 crowley et al 2018 in some laboratory experiments the scaled bridge models under wave loads in deep or intermediate water regions were investigated seiffert et al 2015a conducted a series of laboratory experiments on a 1 35 scale model of a typical two lane coastal bridge deck using conoidal wave correspondingly the same cases are also simulated according to euler s equations it is found that the largest vertical uplift and horizontal positive forces occur on the model when the bottom of the deck is just above the water surface xiao et al 2010 investigated the lasting forces impinging on the biloxi bay bridge during hurrican katrina by numerical wave model which indicates that the uplift force on the bridge is greater about 20 30 than the weight of the bridge deck using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph method sarfaraz and pak 2017 investigate numerically derived tsunami wave solitary wave loads on bridge superstructures depending on which simple non dimensional equations are proposed for computing the tsunami induced forces and moments to the bridge superstructures in order to reduce the wave loads on the bridges the air vent technology is developed which can release the air pressure cuomo et al 2009 conducted an experimental work at a 1 10 scale physical model in the wave basin of the yokohama port and airport technical investigation office using regular waves the dynamics of wave loading of coastal bridges were investigated and ad hoc prediction method of both quasi static and impulsive wave loads was derived according to the green naghdi solution for solitary wave surface elevation seiffert et al 2015b studied wave loading on a coastal bridge deck during a storm through laboratory experiments it is found that there is a significant reduction in vertical uplift forces when air relief openings are added to the structure particularly with an ade quate percentage of air relief opening present hayatdavoodi et al 2014 investigated solitary wave induced forces on a two dimensional model of a coastal bridge by conducting laboratory experiments and performing a numerical simulation the effect of formation of entrapped air pockets on the wave forces is analyzed by considering air pressure relief openings on the deck of the model as a result the vertical uplift force is higher than that in the model where wave can push the air out of the chamber the air pockets have less influence on the horizontal forces as discussed in the previous research to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different bridges subjected to extreme waves most research uses the solitary or regular wave instead of the real extreme wave for numerical investigations and experimental work which provides very valuable information about the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridges liang et al 2013 2017 wu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 liang et al 2017 goring 1979 pointed out that if the propagation distance of tsunami wave is sufficient the extreme wave may break up into a series of solitary waves theoretically besides solitary wave can propagate with a steady form in deep water these are why solitary waves have been used in more studies zhao et al 2007 you et al 2019 however solitary wave can not evolve into the real world tsunami wave due to the limitation of the geophysical scale there are some huge differences between tsunami wave and solitary wave madsen et al 2008 indicated that when the tsunami propagates from the deep ocean to coast if the front of the tsunami becomes sufficiently steep the front turns into an undular bore without solitary wave as the wavelength period and waveform of solitary wave and tsunami wave are almost completely different so solitary wave cannot replace tsunami wave to study the effect of tsunami wave on structures in summary present studies manifest that there are still some deficiencies in the research of bridge damage mechanisms under the action of tsunami wave firstly solitary waves are frequently employed instead of tsunami waves to analyze the effects of the tsunami wave on the bridges fang et al 2018 qu et al 2017a and zhao et al 2019a studied the influence of tsunami like wave and solitary wave on a tiled or suspended marine pipelines which shows that the hydrodynamic strength of the tsunami like wave on the pipeline is larger than that under the solitary wave and the flow fields under the tsunami like wave are more complex zhao et al 2019b used a numerical model based on the vof method to simulate the tsunami like wave exerting on a seawall which was more severely damaged by the tsunami like wave than by the solitary wave secondly when the tsunami wave passes over the bridge whether the air vent can effectively reduce the damage of bridges caused by tsunami waves needs to be verified in order to fully study bridges under extreme waves this paper investigates tsunami like wave impacts on different coastal bridges the prototype of which is recorded in the iwate station during the 2011 japan tsunami event this paper is mainly divided into five parts the second part mainly introduces the generation of tsunami like wave and wave formulas in the third part the numerical models are displayed the accuracy of the model is verified by the comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation data in the fourth part the systematic numerical simulations are carried out in the fifth part in this part firstly we compare the different effects of the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave on the bridges secondly the influences of different tsunami like waves on the various bridges are analyzed the sixth part makes a summary of this work and prospects for the future 2 generation of tsunami like wave when the solitary wave propagates in the constant depth water the waveform remains unchanged due to two reasons firstly the balance between the dispersion and non linear solitary wave secondly the small loss of the wave energy in the simulation synolakis 1987 as similar to the characteristics of the solitary wave the energy attenuation of tsunami wave is very small and its waveform is basically unchanged after the tsunami wave propagates across the ocean although solitary wave can not replace tsunami wave the waveform characteristics and stability of solitary and tsunami like waves are similar in order to derive the theoretical equation of tsunami wave the solitary wave of the korteweg de vries kdv equation is used as the basic wave for the superposition of tsunami wave with a still water depth h the surface profile of the solitary wave can be expressed as 1 η x t h 0 sech 2 k 0 x x 0 c 0 t where h 0 is the wave height of solitary wave k 0 3h 0 4h 3 1 2 denotes the effective wave number x 0 is the location of wave crest at t 0 c 0 g h 0 h 1 2 is the wave velocity with the gravitational acceleration value g the angular velocity and wave period are ω 0 k 0 c 0 and t 0 2π ω 0 the surface profile also can be written as 2 η x t h 0 sech 2 ω 0 x c 0 x 0 c 0 t based on the concept of n shaped wave the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave recorded at iwate south station during the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami is composed of superposition of positive and negative different single solitary waves which is referred to tsunami like wave the parametric control for the superposition of the solitary wave determines whether the tsunami like wave is in good agreement with the real world tsunami wave the wave superposition formula is expressed as 3 η x t i i 1 n ε i h 0 sech 2 α i ω 0 x c 0 x 0 c 0 t i where n is the number of basic waves ε i and α i are the scaling factors for every wave corresponding to the basic solitary wave which reflects the selected wave height frequency and period t i β i t 0 denotes the beginning time of different waves the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave can be approximated using eq 3 with three sech2 profiles with ε 1 h 0 ε 2 h 0 ε 3 h 0 0 8 2 2 5 85 m α 1 ω 0 α 2 ω 0 α 3 ω 0 0 179 0 198 0 653 min 1 and β 1 t 0 β 2 t 0 β 3 t 0 9 67 16 33 21 63 min here h 0 6 7 m and t 0 17 min are measured at the gps based station iwate south where the still wave depth is 204 m chan and liu 2012 qu et al 2017b it is hard to solve the fine cfd model with dense mesh next to bridges using this real case so under the condition that the characteristics of tsunami wave remain unchanged tsunami like waves are used in this study depending on the scaling principle as follow 4 ε 1 α 1 β 1 ε 2 α 2 β 2 ε 3 α 3 β 3 0 119 0 0856 6 556 0 328 0 0947 8 776 0 873 0 31244 10 54 in the simulation the piston type wavemaker method is used at the inlet

rectangular cells according to the immersed boundary ib method the numerical wavemaker and bridge are fully coupled in the fluid domain by defining the fractional volumes of the objects to cells hirt

demonstrate diffusion terms and c 1ε c 2ε and c 3ε are constant values respectively the rng κ ε turbulence model has been successfully employed to investigate the hydrodynamics and loads on different marine structures zhao et al 2018 2019c in this study the flow characteristics are simulated using the incompressible flow solver with immersed boundary ifs ib which we recently developed to solve the governing equations the numerical solutions and control methods considered in this study are listed in table 1 at the bottom of the simulation domain and bridge surface the nonslip wall conditions are imposed on roughness coefficients atmospheric pressure is applied on the top boundary and symmetric boundaries are used at two sides of the simulation domain wave absorbing boundary with neumann conditions is used on the outlet 4 model verification before the investigation of tsunami like wave impacts on the bridges this numerical model needs to be verified to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results two verification cases have been implemented including the wave profile and hydrodynamic loads on the bridges under solitary wave 4 1 wave elevation profile the wave generation is a key technology for this study to ensure this model can generate the wave accurately and stably the wave profiles of both solitary wave and tsunami like wave are verified between the simulation results and the analytical solutions in the simulation the length and height of the numerical calculation domain are 1500 m and 20 m respectively the still water depth h and wave height h of both waves are 8 m and 2 m respectively in the vertical region from 8 m to 10 m where the wave propagates 50 mesh layers are used in the whole calculation domain about 385000 grids are distributed due to the movement of the wave generation boundary the wave level rises and the wave propagates in the numerical wave tank nwt the flow field of tsunami like wave generation is shown in fig 1 after the simulation the comparisons between numerical results and analytical solutions of tsunami like and solitary waves are shown in fig 2 which indicates that the numerical results match the analytical solutions well on both waves besides the duration of the tsunami like wave is longer than solitary wave and the energy of the tsunami like wave is more than solitary wave the effects of two type waves on the bridges are also different completely which will be discussed in detail in a word this model can generate different waves accurately 4 2 hydrodynamic load except for the verification of the wave profile whether this model can predict the hydrodynamic loads on the bridges accurately is also very important to this study in this section based on the experiments conducted by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 the numerical simulations about solitary wave impinging on the bridges are carried out the results of which are compared with the experimental data to ensure the computing capability of this model the experimental layout and the bridge configuration are shown in fig 3 the experimental bridge is a miniature of the typical coastal bridge after a 1 35 scale the whole simulation domain is 10 m in length and 0 26 m in height with three wave elevation gauges g1 g2 and g3 the wave height and still water depth are 0 0258 m and 0 086 m respectively the distance h of the upper surface of the deck below the still water level is 0 0172 m besides in order to verify the mesh accuracy of the simulation three different meshes are used with dense medium and coarse meshes consisting of 453 452 152 482 and 42 156 grids respectively when the solitary waves impinge on the submerged bridges the flow fields and comparisons of wave elevations and hydrodynamic loads on the bridges are shown in figs 4 and 5 in every figure about the vorticity or velocity contour of flow field in the following study the upper figure is a local flow field around the bridge deck and the lower figure is about a whole flow field that shows the wave propagation position in the figures the components fx and fz of the hydrodynamic forces in horizontal and vertical directions consist of pressure on the bridge and shear stress along the bridge surface caused by the wave and flow when the wave approaches and impinges on the bridge both the horizontal and vertical forces increase to the peak values after the wave overtopping and leaving the forces begin to decline and oscillate due to the complex interaction between the wave and bridge which induces that there is a certain discrepancy between numerical results and experimental measurements depending on the hydrodynamic load and wave elevation comparisons in fig 5 it is found that the simulation results agree with experimental data well for the dense mesh which will be used for the next simulations depending on the scaling principle this model can generate the wave and calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the bridges accurately 5 results and discussion in this section the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads on the full scale bridges fig 6 which scales 35 1 to the model of fig 3 under different environmental conditions are investigated and analyzed s denotes the height from the toe of girder to the still water surface the positive and negative values of which represent the bridge locations corresponding to the still water surface the length and height of the calculation domain are 800 m and 20 m respectively a velocity sensor is located at the point of x 41 6 m and z 2 57 m the bridge deck is set at 50 m downstream from the wave generation boundary the hydrodynamic forces and velocities are normalized as follows 14 f x n f z n f x f z ρ g a h a v l 10 3 15 u n w n u w g a v 1 2 where u and w are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively a h a v and l are the horizontal length vertical height from the deck surface to the toe of girder and unit width of the deck respectively g is the gravity acceleration magnitude 5 1 comparison between solitary and tsunami like waves except for the wave profiles of solitary and tsunami like waves are different the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads under two type waves are also investigated and discussed in detail in this section to reveal the essential distinctions of effects of two waves on marine structures the distance s is 1 33 m the still water depth and wave height of solitary and tsunami like waves are 8 m and 2 m respectively figs 7 and 8 show the flow fields of solitary and tsunami like waves at different moments when the solitary wave approaches the bridge deck the water level rises along the front of the deck and the speed of water head increases then the water flows on the top of the deck with the maximum velocity and interlinks with the rising part of rear water at t 17 10 s besides because of the bypass of the bridges the flow intensity under the girder is also very strong with high flow speed as shown in fig 7c and d after the wave leaves the bridge deck the residual water in the deck still flows along the deck due to the inertia effect and drops off the deck behind the bridge at t 20 10 s and 25 50 s fig 7e and d compared with the solitary wave the duration of tsunami like wave is much longer and the impact of this wave is even more serious when the tsunami like wave overtops the bridges a noticeable overtopping where the flow injects into the water fiercely and the whole flow field is very chaotic is observed the velocities of these two type waves are recorded at the velocity sensor as depicted in fig 9 the title vn represents the dimensionless velocity including the velocity component fig 9a and the velocity magnitude fig 9b the horizontal velocity of the tsunami like wave is larger than that of solitary wave however the vertical velocity of solitary wave is larger because the vertical velocity is much less than horizontal velocity which plays a leading role in the whole flow field the velocity magnitude of the tsunami like wave is larger than that of solitary wave fig 9b leading to the stronger flow under tsunami like wave furthermore the velocity duration under tsunami like wave is longer than that under solitary wave which means that the effective duration of tsunami like wave on the bridge is much longer the temporal evolutions of hydrodynamic loads are displayed in fig 10 before t 38 5 s the force components of tsunami like wave decrease to negative because the leading depression portion of tsunami like wave causes the decrease of the water level the velocity direction reverses to the positive direction of wave propagation when the preceding elevated portion of tsunami like wave approaches the bridge deck the water level and hydrodynamic forces increase and the direction of the horizontal force is consistent with the wave propagation direction when the secondary elevated portion of tsunami like wave overtops the deck the wave is broken due to the blocking effect of bridge and much energy contained in the wave releases leading to a great impact on the bridge the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces which is attributed to two reasons firstly when the wave broke the huge water body in wave portion above the deck with high speed quickly fell on the deck causing the large vertical force secondly the horizontal surface area of the deck is much larger than the vertical area and the action area of hydrodynamic vertical force is also much larger than that of hydrodynamic horizontal force these reasons also can explain why many decks collapsed between two piers without lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the force oscillation of the bridge compared with the solitary wave the effect duration of the tsunami like wave is much longer and the maximum force is also much larger fig 10b the bridge will absorb more energy and are more vulnerable to breakage under tsunami like wave therefore when studying the interaction between bridge and tsunami wave tsunami wave cannot be simply simplified as solitary wave 5 2 effect of submersion depth before the tsunami wave approaches the bridge the locations of the different parts of the bridge deck relative to the free surface are various along bridge span and in time the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridge deck in three different initial states under tsunami like wave are investigated in this section the first state is no submersion of the deck where the bottom of girder is above the free surface and the submersion ratios α of submersion depth s to wave height h h 2 m are 0 50 0 25 and 0 00 respectively the partial submersion state is that the free surface is between the top of the deck and the bottom of the girder with the submersion ratios α of 0 25 0 50 0 67 and 0 75 respectively the total submersion is with the submersion ratios α of 1 00 and 1 25 respectively the still water depth h is 8 m 5 2 1 no submersion the velocity contours of flow fields when the wave impinges on the bridge deck at the time of t 122 s and 128 s are shown in fig 11 when the tsunami like wave reaches the bridge deck at the same time with the decrease of the bridge deck position the intensity of water burst increases and flow velocity gradually decreases when the wave peak passes over the bridge deck with the submersion ratios of 0 50 and 0 25 the wave head is blocked completely and the wave passes below the bridge the flow velocity at the bottom of the front girder is the maximum in the whole flow field the lower the bridge deck the higher the flow velocity the minimum velocity of the flow field happens behind the bridge due to the obstruction and bypass effect of the bridge when the submersion ratio is 0 00 and wave peak is around the bridge deck some water has passed above the deck surface the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces on the whole bridge deck are displayed in fig 12 the higher the bridge deck the shorter the duration affected by the wave because only the water at wave crest can affect the bridge with the decrease of the bridge deck both the horizontal and vertical forces on the bridge increase and the duration of the wave effect also extends 5 2 2 partial submersion when a part of the bridge deck is under the free surface at the initial state the velocity contours of the flow fields around the bridge deck are shown in fig 13 when the wave reaches the bridge deck at the time of 122 s the velocity around the bridge is smaller than that of other parts in the flow field because of the bridge barrier when the wave peak arrives at the bridges some water overtops the bridge deck with high speed and connects with the rising water behind the bridge deck the flow below the bridge deck also crosses the bridge deck with high speed however the velocity of flow among the girders is very small due to the shelter of these girders and some air is trapped in these spaces causing the extra air pressure on the bridge the hydrodynamic forces on the bridges are drawn in fig 14 the horizontal forces on the bridges are similar to each other after the wave passes over the bridge the horizontal forces oscillate violently there are three reasons causing the phenomena firstly when the wave passes through the bridge the water around the bridge has inertial property and still keeps moving forward interacting with the bridge secondly in the process of water level falling the flow velocity decreases due to the significant change of the flow velocity the turbulence effect on the bridge is enhanced at the same time considering the inertial motion of the water the action directions and magnitudes of different parts of the water on the bridge vary greatly the effect of flow on the bridge becomes chaotic leading to a serious oscillation of the horizontal force on the whole bridge thirdly compared with the vertical force the horizontal force is smaller the oscillating effect of horizontal force is more serious than that of vertical force for the vertical forces with the increase of the submersion depth the forces decrease because the forces caused by the water above and below the bridge cancel each other out when the wave passes the deeper the bridge is immersed the more serious the force offset and the smaller the vertical force on the bridge deck 5 2 3 total submersion when all the bridge deck has been immersed in the water before the tsunami like wave peak arrives at the bridge deck the spaces between the girders are filled by the water and the velocity contour of flow field at the submersion ratio of 1 00 is shown in fig 15 the flow velocity above the bridge deck is larger than below the bridge deck because when the wave passes over the bridge the wave breaks and the velocity of upside water of wave is larger than the downside water due to the obstruction of the girders the flow velocity among the girders is much small when the submersion ratio is 1 25 the vorticity contour of the flow field is displayed in fig 16 when the leading depression portion of the tsunami like wave approaches the bridge the water level decreases and the flow direction is toward wave inlet so there are some vortices in front of girders and deck when the preceding elevated portion arrives at the bridge deck the water elevation increases and the fluid flows downstream inducing that the vortices around the bridge shed downstream with the increase of the water level the fluid velocity increases and the vortexes behind the bridge also gradually increase the water in the spaces among the girder also is disturbed by the bottom flow and some vortices are generated along the surfaces of the girders then some vortices shed behind the bridge when the wave peak reaches the bridge the bridge looks like a whole barrier to block the flow the bigger vortices are generated and shed behind the bridge the hydrodynamic forces on the bridge are shown in fig 17 with the increase of submersion depth both the horizontal and vertical forces decrease because the upper velocity of the tsunami like wave is larger than the lower velocity the temporal evolutions of the horizontal forces are basically consistent with the waveform the oscillations of the vertical forces are more serious than that of the horizontal forces because the length of the whole bridge is much longer than the height the vertical forces on the horizontal surface of the bridge are much larger than the horizontal forces on the vertical surface so the influence of flow on vertical force is more serious than that on the horizontal force when the wave passes through the bridge the interaction between the wave and bridge causes the water to oscillate and the forces on the bridges also vibrate the more serious the oscillation of flow is the more severe the oscillation of vertical force is therefore the oscillations of forces in the vertical direction are much stronger than that in the horizontal direction the maximum and minimum hydrodynamic forces at three different states on the bridges are depicted in fig 18 here as noted above a negative horizontal force means the force in the opposite direction of the wave propagation and a negative vertical force implies a downward force for the horizontal hydrodynamic force in the state of no submersion with the increase of the submersion depth the maximum forces increase and minimum forces decrease which means that the horizontal force magnitude increase due to the increase of the action area of wave on the bridge in the state of partial submersion when the submersion ratio is less than 0 5 with the increase of the submersion depth the hydrodynamic force still increases because the turbulent flow caused by the wave breaking is strengthened leading to a great impact on the bridge however when the submersion ratio is larger than 0 5 the force decreases because the velocity at the bottom of the wave is smaller than that at the top the deeper the immersion depth the smaller the wave influence with the weakening of the interaction between waves and bridges the horizontal forces reduce similar to the horizontal forces in the state of no submersion with the increase of the submersion depth the magnitude of vertical hydrodynamic forces increase when the toe of the bridge deck is lower than the still water level the vertical forces decrease with the increment of the submersion depth it is deduced from the results that if the bridge has been immersed below the water level before the wave crest reaches the bridge the damage to bridge will be greatly reduced with the increase of immersion depth 5 3 effect of wave height in this section the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the bridge are investigated to real the hydrodynamics around the bridge under the various marine conditions the still water depth is 8 m and seven wave heights with h 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 and 2 6 m are considered in the simulations the distance from the still water surface to the toe of the girder is 1 m although only the change of wave height it is actually the relative change of the wave height h to the still water depth h in the governing equations of wave generation and propagation such as the effective wave number and wave propagation velocity and the wave height of the tsunami like wave is coupled with the water depth the ratio β of wave height h to the still water depth h represents the relative position between the bridge and the shore the still water depth does not change but the ratio β is always changing indicating that the location of the bridge and terrain are constantly changing for example both wave length and duration of tsunami like wave at β 0 2 with wave height of 1 6 m are longer than that at β 0 325 with the wave height of 2 6 m which conforms to the law of the wave propagation in deep water in deep water the tsunami wave height is smaller but the wavelength and duration are longer when the tsunami wave propagates to the offshore area the shoaling effect on the wave is significant at β 0 325 the wave energy gathers the wave height becomes higher and the wavelength and duration become shorter the higher the ratio β the closer the wave is to the shore which means the bridge is close to the shore the wave profiles with different wave heights recorded in the x 10 m are shown in fig 19 the lower the wave height the longer the wave duration which follows the law of wave propagation from deep water to shallow water when different tsunami like waves reach the bridge the velocity contours of flow fields at three moments are shown in fig 20 when the crests of the preceding elevated and the secondary elevated wave portions reach the bridge the velocity contours of flow fields are recorded at the first and second moments and after the tsunami like wave leaves the velocity contour is recorded at the third moment at the first moment with the increase of wave height the velocity in the whole flow field increases and the maximum speed is about 1 2 m s due to the wave height is less than the bridge height the wave rises along the bridge and maximum flow velocity appears at the toe of the first girder the flow velocity below the bridge is larger than other parts of the flow fields because at a certain water volume the cross sectional area of the flow decreases inducing that the velocity of fluid increases when the crest of secondary elevated wave portion reaches the bridge at the second moment the wave overtops the bridge with high speed the higher the wave height the larger the speed and more water flows above the bridge surface after the water body above the bridge passes through the bridge surface it connects and injects into the rising water causing the intense water fluctuation some water in the spaces among the girders oscillates with the low speed because of the shelter of the girders besides it is noted that with the increase of the wave height the flow velocity increases obviously after the crest of the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge there are some vortices around the bridge due to the interaction between the water and the bridge the flow velocity is also much lower than that at the second moment in conclusion with the increase of the wave height the flow velocity increases and the interaction intensity between the flow and bridge also increases which causes the bridge to be damaged easily the temporal elevations of the hydrodynamic forces on the bridges in horizontal and vertical directions are drawn in fig 21 with the propagation of the wave the horizontal hydrodynamic forces increase to the maximum then the forces decrease after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge at the leading depression portion of tsunami like wave some water refluxes causing the horizontal hydrodynamic force is in the negative direction and the force value is less than zero besides the pattern of the horizontal force matches the wave profile well with the increase of the wave height the horizontal forces increase but the action duration of the forces on the bridge reduces which is related to the wave period in fig 21b when the leading depression portion approaches the bridge the water level decreases inducing the decrease of the vertical hydrodynamic force the lower the wave height the smaller the vertical force magnitude at this stage with the wave propagating the vertical forces increase following the preceding elevated portion of tsunami like wave it is noted that the temporal evolutions of vertical force and preceding elevated wave portion coincide with each other which means that the bridge can not change the waveform at this stage when the secondary elevated wave portion reaches the bridge the wave is broken by the interference of bridge which has been immersed in the water completely the vertical force caused by the bottom water under the bridge is larger than that caused by the top water due to the shelter of the girders the flow in the spaces among the girders is very weak and similar to each other under different wave heights causing that the vertical forces on the bridges are similar the maximum and minimum forces on the bridges are recorded and displayed in fig 22 with the increase of the wave height the horizontal force magnitude including the positive and negative forces increases which basically shows a linear growth the magnitude of the positive force is much larger than that of the negative force when the ratio β is larger than the 0 275 with the increase of the wave height the raise gradient of horizontal forces decreases as for the vertical forces with the increase of the wave height the maximum force on the bridge increases slowly in total with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge increase but the effect duration reduces the higher the wave height the easier the bridge will be damaged 5 4 effect of air vent in order to reduce the pressure of air tracked among the girders on the bridge air vent as a good method has been adopted in some bridges fig 23 in this section the influence of the solitary and tsunami like waves on the bridges with or without air vent is investigated the still water depth and wave height are 8 m and 2 m respectively the schematic of the bridge deck with the air vents simplified as straight passages is shown in fig 24 the size g s of the air vent is calculated as 16 g s ε a s m where ε is the influence factor for the air exchange rate defined as 0 2 m is the number of the chambers among the girders 5 4 1 comparisons under solitary and tsunami like waves in this section the simulations of solitary wave and tsunami like wave on the bridges with the air vent are conducted and the comparisons of the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads under two waves are analyzed the submersion depth from the toe of the girder to the still water surface is 0 5 m the velocity contours of the flow fields under solitary and tsunami like waves are shown in figs 25 and 26 when the wave approaches the bridge the water level increases and the air in the chamber is compelled to the atmosphere the velocity around the bridge also increases to the maximum when the wave crest arrives after the wave leaves the bridges the flow velocity decreases and the water in the chamber falls off inducing the oscillation of the flow field the interaction between the water and the bridge becomes chaotic compared with the solitary wave the volume of high velocity fluid under tsunami like wave is much larger which means that the tsunami like wave has a serious effect on bridges as shown in figs 25c and 26c when the wave leaves it can be seen that the bridge has a significant blocking effect on solitary wave and the water levels in front of and behind the bridge drop obviously fig 25d but the propagation of tsunami like wave is relatively less affected by the bridge meanwhile the flow on the bridge deck drops through the air vent and due to the closure of the chamber the water inside flows slowly when the wave passes through the bridge the temporal evolutions of forces on the bridges are shown in fig 27 the horizontal force under the tsunami like wave is similar to that under the solitary wave but the effect duration of tsunami like wave is much longer after the wave passes the oscillation of the water leads to the strengthening of the interaction between the water and the bridge the forces vibrate violently as shown in fig 27a the vertical force is larger than the horizontal force for both solitary and tsunami like waves the maximum vertical force under the tsunami like wave is also larger than that under the solitary wave because the tsunami wave is with a higher velocity and more water fig 27b the total force magnitudes under two waves are compared in fig 27c which shows that the force under the tsunami like wave on the bridge with the air vent is still larger than that under the solitary wave even if the air vent exists in the bridge 5 4 2 comparisons with and without air vent due to the existence of the air vent the air can be discharged from the chamber the effects of the tsunami like waves on the bridge with and without air vent are investigated to real the influence of the air vent on the bridge the submersion depth from the toe of the girder to the still water surface is 0 5 m the vorticity contours of flow fields at four moments for two cases with and without air vent are depicted in figs 28 and 29 when the preceding elevated wave portion arrives figs 28b and 29b the air in the chamber without the air vent is compressed and the water level difference exists inside and outside of the chamber when the bridge is with the air vent the air is ejected to the atmosphere through the air vent with the increase of the water level the flow passes through the bridge deck the above air is always trapped in the chamber of the bridge without air vent and some below flow in the chamber is whirling however for the bridge with the air vent the water fills the chamber after the air is evacuated at the junction of water bodies around the air vent some pairs of vortices roll in the chambers the intensity of which decreases from the first air vent to the last air vent because both the water volume and velocity decrease after the wave leaves there are some vortices shedding behind the bridge deck but the whirling intensity of the flow around the bridge with air vent is much stronger than that of the bridge without air vent due to the existence of the air vent the flow change is much different from that without air vent the temporal evolutions of forces on the bridges with and without air vent are shown in fig 30 the horizontal forces on the bridges with and without air vent are similar to each other indicating that the air vent has a weak effect on the horizontal forces however the vertical force on the bridge with air vent is much less than that on the bridge without air vent because the vent can release the additional air pressure on the bridge with air vent which means that the air vent plays a significant role on the protection of the bridge since the vertical force is much larger than the horizontal force the vertical force dominates the overall force on the bridge 5 4 3 comparisons under different locations the effects of air vent on the bridges at different locations are investigated in this section the submersion depths from the toe of the girder to the still water depth are considered as 0 0 0 5 and 1 0 m respectively the vorticity contours at four moments are shown in figs 31 and 32 when the peaks of the leading depression the preceding elevated and the secondary elevated wave portions reach the bridge deck and the tsunami like wave leaves the bridge deck when the submersion depth is 0 0 m at the initial stage the toe of the girder touches the still water surface when the leading depression wave portion reaches the bridge deck the water level reduces and the water in the interface between the bottom of girders and water drops from the bridge deck causing some weak vortices fig 31a at the second moment some vortices are generated behind every girder and the maximum vorticity occurs at the last girder with the propagation of the wave the water level increases and the air is expelled from the chambers through the air vent when the peak of the secondary elevated wave portion is around the bridge at the third moment some water flows along the bridge surface and when the water passes through the air vent a part of it flows or drops into the vent connecting with the elevated water level clearly the biggest vortices happen behind the bridge deck after the wave leaves the water level decreases and some water in charmers drops due to the atmospheric connectivity through the air vent there is still strong turbulence in the water compared with the submersion depth of 0 0 m with the increase of the submersion depth the intensity of vortices increases fig 32 in the third moment more water passes over the bridge surface vortex separation appears at the bridge surface and the air vent a pair of big vortices shed from the bridge as shown in fig 32c when the wave leaves there are still some vortices shedding from the bridge leading to the oscillation of the water although the water in the chambers oscillates strongly wave propagation plays a dominant role in the change of the water level among girders the deeper the immersion depth the more obvious the turbulence phenomenon the temporal changes of horizontal and vertical forces on the bridges are recorded in fig 33 with the increase of submersion depth both the maximum horizontal and vertical forces on the bridges decrease slightly because when the bridge immerses in the water both the velocity around the bridge and the air pressure on the bridge decrease and the amount of water passing through the gap also greatly reduces when the water flows in the air vent due to the mutual collision and water friction both the flow energy and the overall flow velocity reduce which weakens the force oscillation of bridges after the wave leaves the forces gradually reduce to the minimum however it is found that the submersion depth has a weak effect on the bridge with air vent 5 4 4 the efficiency of air vent through the comparisons of hydrodynamic forces on the bridges with and without air vent the efficiency of air vent on reducing the forces is investigated in this section the force comparisons on different bridges with and without air vent are shown in fig 34 although the locations of the bridges are different the forces on the bridge without air vent are larger than that with air vent due to two reasons firstly if the air vent exists the extra air pressure caused by the trapped air can be released through the air vent secondly around the air vent the interaction between the rising water and flowing water on the bridge deck can reduce the wave energy and vertical force depending on the maximum and minimum forces on the different bridges with and without air vent the efficiency of the air vent is assessed using the comparison formula as 17 ν f p n f q n f p n where ν is the efficiency coefficient f p n and f q n represent the extreme values of forces on the bridge without and with air vent respectively the efficiency coefficients in different cases are shown in fig 35 it is found that the values of the efficiency coefficients about the horizontal forces are very small which means that the effect of the air vent on the horizontal hydrodynamic forces is very weak compared with the horizontal efficiency coefficients vertical coefficients are much larger because if the bridge does not have the air vent when the wave approaches the bridge the air in the chamber is compressed and additional air pressure is generated to the bridge deck the air pressure magnitudes on the front and rear surfaces of chamber are the same but the pressure directions are opposite so air pressure has little effect on the overall horizontal force of the bridge deck but exerts the very large vertical force on the horizontal plate of the bridge deck when the air vent is in the bridge deck as the water level rises the air in the chamber is released through the air vent and the air pressure disappears the vertical force is smaller than that on the bridge deck without air vent with the increase of the submersion depth the value of the coefficient decreases indicating that the deeper the submersion depth the less the impact of air vent on the bridge the coefficients of the overall force magnitude on the bridge resemble that of maximum vertical forces because the vertical forces on the bridge account for the majority the results demonstrate that the air vent has a great influence on the forces of the bridge which can reduce the forces on the bridge to protect the bridge 6 conclusions a numerical investigation about the effects of the tsunami like wave on different bridge decks is conducted by applying incompressible flow solver with immersed boundary referred to ifs ib in the simulations the effects of submersion depth wave height and air vent on hydrodynamic loads on the bridge decks are analyzed the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 when the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces leading to many decks collapsed between two piers without lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the load oscillation of the bridge compared with the solitary wave the effect duration of tsunami like wave on the bridge is much longer and the impact of this wave is also more serious the results from comparisons between tsunami like and solitary waves indicate that when studying the interaction between bridge and tsunami wave tsunami wave cannot be simply simplified as solitary wave 2 when the toe of the girder is above the still water surface initially with the decrease of the bridge deck both the horizontal and vertical forces on the bridge increase and the effect duration of the wave also extends when a part of the bridge deck is under the free surface at the initial state the horizontal forces on the bridges are similar to each other in different cases as for the vertical forces with the increase of the submersion depth the forces decrease the deeper the bridge is immersed the smaller the vertical force on the bridge deck when all the bridge deck has been immersed in the water before the tsunami like wave peak arrives at the bridge deck the bridge looks like a whole barrier to block the flow the bigger vortices are generated and shed behind the bridge with the increase of submersion depth both the horizontal and vertical forces decrease 3 with the increase of the wave height the horizontal force magnitude increases which basically shows a linear growth the magnitude of the positive force is much larger than that of the negative force compared with the maximum horizontal forces the vertical forces are much larger because the pressure caused by the rising water in the vertical direction is larger than that in the horizontal direction in total with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge increase but the effect duration reduces the higher the wave height the easier the bridge will be damaged 4 when the bridge is with air vent it has little influence on the horizontal force magnitude after the wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the horizontal force on the bridge without air vent is more serious than that with air vent however the vertical force on the bridge with air vent is much less than that without air vent which means that the air vent has a great influence on the vertical force due to the vertical force is much larger than the horizontal force the vertical forces on the bridge account for the majority for the overall force so the air vent has a great impact on the overall force of bridge which can reduce the forces on the bridge to protect the bridge this study can provide an assessment of tsunami wave forces on the different bridges large scale physical experiments and the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridge in real marine conditions are deserved to study in the future credit authorship contribution statement enjin zhao conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft

21999,due to the strong interaction between the bridges and the extreme waves generated by hurricanes and tsunamis many coastal bridges were damaged in the past few decades in this study in order to investigate the effect of the extreme wave on a bridge tsunami like wave generated based on record in the iwate station during 2011 japan tsunami event instead of solitary wave is employed to impinge on the bridge with or without air vent according to the computational fluid dynamics cfd theory with a volume of fluid vof interface tracking approach a numerical wave tank nwt is developed in which the immersed boundary ib method is referred to simulate fluid and structure interaction the model is calibrated with the experiment in this numerical tank the effects of tsunami like waves with different prominent conditions including wave height and submersion depth on the bridges are studied besides the efficiency of air vent in reducing the hydrodynamic load is also discussed the results indicate that when the tsunami like wave overtops the bridges a noticeable overtopping where the flow injects into the water fiercely and the whole flow field is very chaotic is observed the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces leading to many decks to collapse between two piers with small lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the load oscillation of the bridge the position of the bridge relative to the initial sea level has a serious impact on the forces on the bridge when the tsunami like wave passes through it with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge also increase but the effect duration reduces after the air vent is installed air vent can reduce the forces on the bridge and improve the efficiency of the bridge protection keywords tsunami like wave solitary wave bridge air vent vof hydrodynamic loads 1 introduction coastal bridge as an important tool connecting to lands can be satisfied with the complex coastal transport however the bridge structures are very vulnerable to the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces especially in the extreme waves during the tsunami and hurricane events as the sea level increases the bridge may be partially and fully inundated and air can be trapped causing the external additional force once the combined forces exceed the structural bearing capacity of the bridges the bridges ultimately are damaged o connor and mcanany 2018 for instance the 2004 indian ocean tsunami resulted in the loss of about half of these bridges along the only road connecting the major indonesian cities of meulaboh and banda aceh similarly over 300 bridges in the region affected by the tsunami induced by the 2011 great east japan earthquake were either wiped out or damaged beyond repair winter et al 2017 according to the bridge failure reports when the tsunami impinges on the bridge the vertical liftoff or overturning of bridge occurs from their substructures to the superstructure followed by lateral displacement of the superstructure to understand the mechanism of bridge failure and evaluate potential damage under waves both physical experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out goseberg et al 2013 rossetto et al 2011 williams and fuhrman 2016 cheng et al 2018 crowley et al 2018 in some laboratory experiments the scaled bridge models under wave loads in deep or intermediate water regions were investigated seiffert et al 2015a conducted a series of laboratory experiments on a 1 35 scale model of a typical two lane coastal bridge deck using conoidal wave correspondingly the same cases are also simulated according to euler s equations it is found that the largest vertical uplift and horizontal positive forces occur on the model when the bottom of the deck is just above the water surface xiao et al 2010 investigated the lasting forces impinging on the biloxi bay bridge during hurrican katrina by numerical wave model which indicates that the uplift force on the bridge is greater about 20 30 than the weight of the bridge deck using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph method sarfaraz and pak 2017 investigate numerically derived tsunami wave solitary wave loads on bridge superstructures depending on which simple non dimensional equations are proposed for computing the tsunami induced forces and moments to the bridge superstructures in order to reduce the wave loads on the bridges the air vent technology is developed which can release the air pressure cuomo et al 2009 conducted an experimental work at a 1 10 scale physical model in the wave basin of the yokohama port and airport technical investigation office using regular waves the dynamics of wave loading of coastal bridges were investigated and ad hoc prediction method of both quasi static and impulsive wave loads was derived according to the green naghdi solution for solitary wave surface elevation seiffert et al 2015b studied wave loading on a coastal bridge deck during a storm through laboratory experiments it is found that there is a significant reduction in vertical uplift forces when air relief openings are added to the structure particularly with an ade quate percentage of air relief opening present hayatdavoodi et al 2014 investigated solitary wave induced forces on a two dimensional model of a coastal bridge by conducting laboratory experiments and performing a numerical simulation the effect of formation of entrapped air pockets on the wave forces is analyzed by considering air pressure relief openings on the deck of the model as a result the vertical uplift force is higher than that in the model where wave can push the air out of the chamber the air pockets have less influence on the horizontal forces as discussed in the previous research to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different bridges subjected to extreme waves most research uses the solitary or regular wave instead of the real extreme wave for numerical investigations and experimental work which provides very valuable information about the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridges liang et al 2013 2017 wu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 liang et al 2017 goring 1979 pointed out that if the propagation distance of tsunami wave is sufficient the extreme wave may break up into a series of solitary waves theoretically besides solitary wave can propagate with a steady form in deep water these are why solitary waves have been used in more studies zhao et al 2007 you et al 2019 however solitary wave can not evolve into the real world tsunami wave due to the limitation of the geophysical scale there are some huge differences between tsunami wave and solitary wave madsen et al 2008 indicated that when the tsunami propagates from the deep ocean to coast if the front of the tsunami becomes sufficiently steep the front turns into an undular bore without solitary wave as the wavelength period and waveform of solitary wave and tsunami wave are almost completely different so solitary wave cannot replace tsunami wave to study the effect of tsunami wave on structures in summary present studies manifest that there are still some deficiencies in the research of bridge damage mechanisms under the action of tsunami wave firstly solitary waves are frequently employed instead of tsunami waves to analyze the effects of the tsunami wave on the bridges fang et al 2018 qu et al 2017a and zhao et al 2019a studied the influence of tsunami like wave and solitary wave on a tiled or suspended marine pipelines which shows that the hydrodynamic strength of the tsunami like wave on the pipeline is larger than that under the solitary wave and the flow fields under the tsunami like wave are more complex zhao et al 2019b used a numerical model based on the vof method to simulate the tsunami like wave exerting on a seawall which was more severely damaged by the tsunami like wave than by the solitary wave secondly when the tsunami wave passes over the bridge whether the air vent can effectively reduce the damage of bridges caused by tsunami waves needs to be verified in order to fully study bridges under extreme waves this paper investigates tsunami like wave impacts on different coastal bridges the prototype of which is recorded in the iwate station during the 2011 japan tsunami event this paper is mainly divided into five parts the second part mainly introduces the generation of tsunami like wave and wave formulas in the third part the numerical models are displayed the accuracy of the model is verified by the comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation data in the fourth part the systematic numerical simulations are carried out in the fifth part in this part firstly we compare the different effects of the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave on the bridges secondly the influences of different tsunami like waves on the various bridges are analyzed the sixth part makes a summary of this work and prospects for the future 2 generation of tsunami like wave when the solitary wave propagates in the constant depth water the waveform remains unchanged due to two reasons firstly the balance between the dispersion and non linear solitary wave secondly the small loss of the wave energy in the simulation synolakis 1987 as similar to the characteristics of the solitary wave the energy attenuation of tsunami wave is very small and its waveform is basically unchanged after the tsunami wave propagates across the ocean although solitary wave can not replace tsunami wave the waveform characteristics and stability of solitary and tsunami like waves are similar in order to derive the theoretical equation of tsunami wave the solitary wave of the korteweg de vries kdv equation is used as the basic wave for the superposition of tsunami wave with a still water depth h the surface profile of the solitary wave can be expressed as 1 η x t h 0 sech 2 k 0 x x 0

gravitational acceleration value g the angular velocity and wave period are ω 0 k 0 c 0 and t 0 2π ω 0 the surface profile also can be written as 2 η x t h 0 sech 2 ω 0 x c 0 x 0 c 0 t based on the concept of n shaped wave the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave recorded at iwate south station during the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami is composed of superposition of positive and negative different single solitary waves which is referred to tsunami like wave the parametric control for the superposition of the solitary wave determines whether the tsunami like wave is in good agreement with the real world tsunami wave the wave superposition formula is expressed as 3 η x t i i 1 n ε i h 0 sech 2 α i ω 0 x c 0 x 0 c 0 t i where n is the number of basic waves ε i and α i are the scaling factors for every wave corresponding to the basic solitary wave which reflects the selected wave height frequency and period t i β i t 0 denotes the beginning time of different waves the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave can be approximated using eq 3 with three sech2 profiles with ε 1 h 0 ε 2 h 0 ε 3 h 0 0 8 2 2 5 85 m α 1 ω 0 α 2 ω 0 α 3 ω 0 0 179 0 198 0 653 min 1 and β 1 t 0 β 2 t 0 β 3 t 0 9 67 16 33 21 63 min here h 0 6 7 m and t 0 17 min are measured at the gps based station iwate south where the still wave depth is 204 m chan and liu 2012 qu et al 2017b it is hard to solve the fine cfd model with dense mesh next to bridges using this real case so under the condition that the characteristics of tsunami wave remain unchanged tsunami like waves are used in this study depending on the scaling principle as follow 4 ε 1 α 1 β 1 ε 2 α 2 β 2 ε 3 α 3 β 3 0 119 0 0856 6 556 0 328 0 0947 8 776 0 873 0 31244 10 54 in the simulation the piston type wavemaker method is used at the inlet

governing equations the numerical solutions and control methods considered in this study are listed in table 1 at the bottom of the simulation domain and bridge surface the nonslip wall conditions are imposed on roughness coefficients atmospheric pressure is applied on the top boundary and symmetric boundaries are used at two sides of the simulation domain wave absorbing boundary with neumann conditions is used on the outlet 4 model verification before the investigation of tsunami like wave impacts on the bridges this numerical model needs to be verified to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results two verification cases have been implemented including the wave profile and hydrodynamic loads on the bridges under solitary wave 4 1 wave elevation profile the wave generation is a key technology for this study to ensure this model can generate the wave accurately and stably the wave profiles of both solitary wave and tsunami like wave are verified between the simulation results and the analytical solutions in the simulation the length and height of the numerical calculation domain are 1500 m and 20 m respectively the still water depth h and wave height h of both waves are 8 m and 2 m respectively in the vertical region from 8 m to 10 m where the wave propagates 50 mesh layers are used in the whole calculation domain about 385000 grids are distributed due to the movement of the wave generation boundary the wave level rises and the wave propagates in the numerical wave tank nwt the flow field of tsunami like wave generation is shown in fig 1 after the simulation the comparisons between numerical results and analytical solutions of tsunami like and solitary waves are shown in fig 2 which indicates that the numerical results match the analytical solutions well on both waves besides the duration of the tsunami like wave is longer than solitary wave and the energy of the tsunami like wave is more than solitary wave the effects of two type waves on the bridges are also different completely which will be discussed in detail in a word this model can generate different waves accurately 4 2 hydrodynamic load except for the verification of the wave profile whether this model can predict the hydrodynamic loads on the bridges accurately is also very important to this study in this section based on the experiments conducted by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 the numerical simulations about solitary wave impinging on the bridges are carried out the results of which are compared with the experimental data to ensure the computing capability of this model the experimental layout and the bridge configuration are shown in fig 3 the experimental bridge is a miniature of the typical coastal bridge after a 1 35 scale the whole simulation domain is 10 m in length and 0 26 m in height with three wave elevation gauges g1 g2 and g3 the wave height and still water depth are 0 0258 m and 0 086 m respectively the distance h of the upper surface of the deck below the still water level is 0 0172 m besides in order to verify the mesh accuracy of the simulation three different meshes are used with dense medium and coarse meshes consisting of 453 452 152 482 and 42 156 grids respectively when the solitary waves impinge on the submerged bridges the flow fields and comparisons of wave elevations and hydrodynamic loads on the bridges are shown in figs 4 and 5 in every figure about the vorticity or velocity contour of flow field in the following study the upper figure is a local flow field around the bridge deck and the lower figure is about a whole flow field that shows the wave propagation position in the figures the components fx and fz of the hydrodynamic forces in horizontal and vertical directions consist of pressure on the bridge and shear stress along the bridge surface caused by the wave and flow when the wave approaches and impinges on the bridge both the horizontal and vertical forces increase to the peak values after the wave overtopping and leaving the forces begin to decline and oscillate due to the complex interaction between the wave and bridge which induces that there is a certain discrepancy between numerical results and experimental measurements depending on the hydrodynamic load and wave elevation comparisons in fig 5 it is found that the simulation results agree with experimental data well for the dense mesh which will be used for the next simulations depending on the scaling principle this model can generate the wave and calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the bridges accurately 5 results and discussion in this section the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads on the full scale bridges fig 6 which scales 35 1 to the model of fig 3 under different environmental conditions are investigated and analyzed s denotes the height from the toe of girder to the still water surface the positive and negative values of which represent the bridge locations corresponding to the still water surface the length and height of the calculation domain are 800 m and 20 m respectively a velocity sensor is located at the point of x 41 6 m and z 2 57 m the bridge deck is set at 50 m downstream from the wave generation boundary the hydrodynamic forces and velocities are normalized as follows 14 f x n f z n f x f z ρ g a h a v l 10 3 15 u n w n u w g a v 1 2 where u and w are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively a h a v and l are the horizontal length vertical height from the deck surface to the toe of girder and unit width of the deck respectively g is the gravity acceleration magnitude 5 1 comparison between solitary and tsunami like waves except for the wave profiles of solitary and tsunami like waves are different the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads under two type waves are also investigated and discussed in detail in this section to reveal the essential distinctions of effects of two waves on marine structures the distance s is 1 33 m the still water depth and wave height of solitary and tsunami like waves are 8 m and 2 m respectively figs 7 and 8 show the flow fields of solitary and tsunami like waves at different moments when the solitary wave approaches the bridge deck the water level rises along the front of the deck and the speed of water head increases then the water flows on the top of the deck with the maximum velocity and interlinks with the rising part of rear water at t 17 10 s besides because of the bypass of the bridges the flow intensity under the girder is also very strong with high flow speed as shown in fig 7c and d after the wave leaves the bridge deck the residual water in the deck still flows along the deck due to the inertia effect and drops off the deck behind the bridge at t 20 10 s and 25 50 s fig 7e and d compared with the solitary wave the duration of tsunami like wave is much longer and the impact of this wave is even more serious when the tsunami like wave overtops the bridges a noticeable overtopping where the flow injects into the water fiercely and the whole flow field is very chaotic is observed the velocities of these two type waves are recorded at the velocity sensor as depicted in fig 9 the title vn represents the dimensionless velocity including the velocity component fig 9a and the velocity magnitude fig 9b the horizontal velocity of the tsunami like wave is larger than that of solitary wave however the vertical velocity of solitary wave is larger because the vertical velocity is much less than horizontal velocity which plays a leading role in the whole flow field the velocity magnitude of the tsunami like wave is larger than that of solitary wave fig 9b leading to the stronger flow under tsunami like wave furthermore the velocity duration under tsunami like wave is longer than that under solitary wave which means that the effective duration of tsunami like wave on the bridge is much longer the temporal evolutions of hydrodynamic loads are displayed in fig 10 before t 38 5 s the force components of tsunami like wave decrease to negative because the leading depression portion of tsunami like wave causes the decrease of the water level the velocity direction reverses to the positive direction of wave propagation when the preceding elevated portion of tsunami like wave approaches the bridge deck the water level and hydrodynamic forces increase and the direction of the horizontal force is consistent with the wave propagation direction when the secondary elevated portion of tsunami like wave overtops the deck the wave is broken due to the blocking effect of bridge and much energy contained in the wave releases leading to a great impact on the bridge the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces which is attributed to two reasons firstly when the wave broke the huge water body in wave portion above the deck with high speed quickly fell on the deck causing the large vertical force secondly the horizontal surface area of the deck is much larger than the vertical area and the action area of hydrodynamic vertical force is also much larger than that of hydrodynamic horizontal force these reasons also can explain why many decks collapsed between two piers without lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the force oscillation of the bridge compared with the solitary wave the effect duration of the tsunami like wave is much longer and the maximum force is also much larger fig 10b the bridge will absorb more energy and are more vulnerable to breakage under tsunami like wave therefore when studying the interaction between bridge and tsunami wave tsunami wave cannot be simply simplified as solitary wave 5 2 effect of submersion depth before the tsunami wave approaches the bridge the locations of the different parts of the bridge deck relative to the free surface are various along bridge span and in time the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridge deck in three different initial states under tsunami like wave are investigated in this section the first state is no submersion of the deck where the bottom of girder is above the free surface and the submersion ratios α of submersion depth s to wave height h h 2 m are 0 50 0 25 and 0 00 respectively the partial submersion state is that the free surface is between the top of the deck and the bottom of the girder with the submersion ratios α of 0 25 0 50 0 67 and 0 75 respectively the total submersion is with the submersion ratios α of 1 00 and 1 25 respectively the still water depth h is 8 m 5 2 1 no submersion the velocity contours of flow fields when the wave impinges on the bridge deck at the time of t 122 s and 128 s are shown in fig 11 when the tsunami like wave reaches the bridge deck at the same time with the decrease of the bridge deck position the intensity of water burst increases and flow velocity gradually decreases when the wave peak passes over the bridge deck with the submersion ratios of 0 50 and 0 25 the wave head is blocked completely and the wave passes below the bridge the flow velocity at the bottom of the front girder is the maximum in the whole flow field the lower the bridge deck the higher the flow velocity the minimum velocity of the flow field happens behind the bridge due to the obstruction and bypass effect of the bridge when the submersion ratio is 0 00 and wave peak is around the bridge deck some water has passed above the deck surface the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces on the whole bridge deck are displayed in fig 12 the higher the bridge deck the shorter the duration affected by the wave because only the water at wave crest can affect the bridge with the decrease of the bridge deck both the horizontal and vertical forces on the bridge increase and the duration of the wave effect also extends 5 2 2 partial submersion when a part of the bridge deck is under the free surface at the initial state the velocity contours of the flow fields around the bridge deck are shown in fig 13 when the wave reaches the bridge deck at the time of 122 s the velocity around the bridge is smaller than that of other parts in the flow field because of the bridge barrier when the wave peak arrives at the bridges some water overtops the bridge deck with high speed and connects with the rising water behind the bridge deck the flow below the bridge deck also crosses the bridge deck with high speed however the velocity of flow among the girders is very small due to the shelter of these girders and some air is trapped in these spaces causing the extra air pressure on the bridge the hydrodynamic forces on the bridges are drawn in fig 14 the horizontal forces on the bridges are similar to each other after the wave passes over the bridge the horizontal forces oscillate violently there are three reasons causing the phenomena firstly when the wave passes through the bridge the water around the bridge has inertial property and still keeps moving forward interacting with the bridge secondly in the process of water level falling the flow velocity decreases due to the significant change of the flow velocity the turbulence effect on the bridge is enhanced at the same time considering the inertial motion of the water the action directions and magnitudes of different parts of the water on the bridge vary greatly the effect of flow on the bridge becomes chaotic leading to a serious oscillation of the horizontal force on the whole bridge thirdly compared with the vertical force the horizontal force is smaller the oscillating effect of horizontal force is more serious than that of vertical force for the vertical forces with the increase of the submersion depth the forces decrease because the forces caused by the water above and below the bridge cancel each other out when the wave passes the deeper the bridge is immersed the more serious the force offset and the smaller the vertical force on the bridge deck 5 2 3 total submersion when all the bridge deck has been immersed in the water before the tsunami like wave peak arrives at the bridge deck the spaces between the girders are filled by the water and the velocity contour of flow field at the submersion ratio of 1 00 is shown in fig 15 the flow velocity above the bridge deck is larger than below the bridge deck because when the wave passes over the bridge the wave breaks and the velocity of upside water of wave is larger than the downside water due to the obstruction of the girders the flow velocity among the girders is much small when the submersion ratio is 1 25 the vorticity contour of the flow field is displayed in fig 16 when the leading depression portion of the tsunami like wave approaches the bridge the water level decreases and the flow direction is toward wave inlet so there are some vortices in front of girders and deck when the preceding elevated portion arrives at the bridge deck the water elevation increases and the fluid flows downstream inducing that the vortices around the bridge shed downstream with the increase of the water level the fluid velocity increases and the vortexes behind the bridge also gradually increase the water in the spaces among the girder also is disturbed by the bottom flow and some vortices are generated along the surfaces of the girders then some vortices shed behind the bridge when the wave peak reaches the bridge the bridge looks like a whole barrier to block the flow the bigger vortices are generated and shed behind the bridge the hydrodynamic forces on the bridge are shown in fig 17 with the increase of submersion depth both the horizontal and vertical forces decrease because the upper velocity of the tsunami like wave is larger than the lower velocity the temporal evolutions of the horizontal forces are basically consistent with the waveform the oscillations of the vertical forces are more serious than that of the horizontal forces because the length of the whole bridge is much longer than the height the vertical forces on the horizontal surface of the bridge are much larger than the horizontal forces on the vertical surface so the influence of flow on vertical force is more serious than that on the horizontal force when the wave passes through the bridge the interaction between the wave and bridge causes the water to oscillate and the forces on the bridges also vibrate the more serious the oscillation of flow is the more severe the oscillation of vertical force is therefore the oscillations of forces in the vertical direction are much stronger than that in the horizontal direction the maximum and minimum hydrodynamic forces at three different states on the bridges are depicted in fig 18 here as noted above a negative horizontal force means the force in the opposite direction of the wave propagation and a negative vertical force implies a downward force for the horizontal hydrodynamic force in the state of no submersion with the increase of the submersion depth the maximum forces increase and minimum forces decrease which means that the horizontal force magnitude increase due to the increase of the action area of wave on the bridge in the state of partial submersion when the submersion ratio is less than 0 5 with the increase of the submersion depth the hydrodynamic force still increases because the turbulent flow caused by the wave breaking is strengthened leading to a great impact on the bridge however when the submersion ratio is larger than 0 5 the force decreases because the velocity at the bottom of the wave is smaller than that at the top the deeper the immersion depth the smaller the wave influence with the weakening of the interaction between waves and bridges the horizontal forces reduce similar to the horizontal forces in the state of no submersion with the increase of the submersion depth the magnitude of vertical hydrodynamic forces increase when the toe of the bridge deck is lower than the still water level the vertical forces decrease with the increment of the submersion depth it is deduced from the results that if the bridge has been immersed below the water level before the wave crest reaches the bridge the damage to bridge will be greatly reduced with the increase of immersion depth 5 3 effect of wave height in this section the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the bridge are investigated to real the hydrodynamics around the bridge under the various marine conditions the still water depth is 8 m and seven wave heights with h 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 and 2 6 m are considered in the simulations the distance from the still water surface to the toe of the girder is 1 m although only the change of wave height it is actually the relative change of the wave height h to the still water depth h in the governing equations of wave generation and propagation such as the effective wave number and wave propagation velocity and the wave height of the tsunami like wave is coupled with the water depth the ratio β of wave height h to the still water depth h represents the relative position between the bridge and the shore the still water depth does not change but the ratio β is always changing indicating that the location of the bridge and terrain are constantly changing for example both wave length and duration of tsunami like wave at β 0 2 with wave height of 1 6 m are longer than that at β 0 325 with the wave height of 2 6 m which conforms to the law of the wave propagation in deep water in deep water the tsunami wave height is smaller but the wavelength and duration are longer when the tsunami wave propagates to the offshore area the shoaling effect on the wave is significant at β 0 325 the wave energy gathers the wave height becomes higher and the wavelength and duration become shorter the higher the ratio β the closer the wave is to the shore which means the bridge is close to the shore the wave profiles with different wave heights recorded in the x 10 m are shown in fig 19 the lower the wave height the longer the wave duration which follows the law of wave propagation from deep water to shallow water when different tsunami like waves reach the bridge the velocity contours of flow fields at three moments are shown in fig 20 when the crests of the preceding elevated and the secondary elevated wave portions reach the bridge the velocity contours of flow fields are recorded at the first and second moments and after the tsunami like wave leaves the velocity contour is recorded at the third moment at the first moment with the increase of wave height the velocity in the whole flow field increases and the maximum speed is about 1 2 m s due to the wave height is less than the bridge height the wave rises along the bridge and maximum flow velocity appears at the toe of the first girder the flow velocity below the bridge is larger than other parts of the flow fields because at a certain water volume the cross sectional area of the flow decreases inducing that the velocity of fluid increases when the crest of secondary elevated wave portion reaches the bridge at the second moment the wave overtops the bridge with high speed the higher the wave height the larger the speed and more water flows above the bridge surface after the water body above the bridge passes through the bridge surface it connects and injects into the rising water causing the intense water fluctuation some water in the spaces among the girders oscillates with the low speed because of the shelter of the girders besides it is noted that with the increase of the wave height the flow velocity increases obviously after the crest of the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge there are some vortices around the bridge due to the interaction between the water and the bridge the flow velocity is also much lower than that at the second moment in conclusion with the increase of the wave height the flow velocity increases and the interaction intensity between the flow and bridge also increases which causes the bridge to be damaged easily the temporal elevations of the hydrodynamic forces on the bridges in horizontal and vertical directions are drawn in fig 21 with the propagation of the wave the horizontal hydrodynamic forces increase to the maximum then the forces decrease after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge at the leading depression portion of tsunami like wave some water refluxes causing the horizontal hydrodynamic force is in the negative direction and the force value is less than zero besides the pattern of the horizontal force matches the wave profile well with the increase of the wave height the horizontal forces increase but the action duration of the forces on the bridge reduces which is related to the wave period in fig 21b when the leading depression portion approaches the bridge the water level decreases inducing the decrease of the vertical hydrodynamic force the lower the wave height the smaller the vertical force magnitude at this stage with the wave propagating the vertical forces increase following the preceding elevated portion of tsunami like wave it is noted that the temporal evolutions of vertical force and preceding elevated wave portion coincide with each other which means that the bridge can not change the waveform at this stage when the secondary elevated wave portion reaches the bridge the wave is broken by the interference of bridge which has been immersed in the water completely the vertical force caused by the bottom water under the bridge is larger than that caused by the top water due to the shelter of the girders the flow in the spaces among the girders is very weak and similar to each other under different wave heights causing that the vertical forces on the bridges are similar the maximum and minimum forces on the bridges are recorded and displayed in fig 22 with the increase of the wave height the horizontal force magnitude including the positive and negative forces increases which basically shows a linear growth the magnitude of the positive force is much larger than that of the negative force when the ratio β is larger than the 0 275 with the increase of the wave height the raise gradient of horizontal forces decreases as for the vertical forces with the increase of the wave height the maximum force on the bridge increases slowly in total with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge increase but the effect duration reduces the higher the wave height the easier the bridge will be damaged 5 4 effect of air vent in order to reduce the pressure of air tracked among the girders on the bridge air vent as a good method has been adopted in some bridges fig 23 in this section the influence of the solitary and tsunami like waves on the bridges with or without air vent is investigated the still water depth and wave height are 8 m and 2 m respectively the schematic of the bridge deck with the air vents simplified as straight passages is shown in fig 24 the size g s of the air vent is calculated as 16 g s ε a s m where ε is the influence factor for the air exchange rate defined as 0 2 m is the number of the chambers among the girders 5 4 1 comparisons under solitary and tsunami like waves in this section the simulations of solitary wave and tsunami like wave on the bridges with the air vent are conducted and the comparisons of the flow fields and hydrodynamic loads under two waves are analyzed the submersion depth from the toe of the girder to the still water surface is 0 5 m the velocity contours of the flow fields under solitary and tsunami like waves are shown in figs 25 and 26 when the wave approaches the bridge the water level increases and the air in the chamber is compelled to the atmosphere the velocity around the bridge also increases to the maximum when the wave crest arrives after the wave leaves the bridges the flow velocity decreases and the water in the chamber falls off inducing the oscillation of the flow field the interaction between the water and the bridge becomes chaotic compared with the solitary wave the volume of high velocity fluid under tsunami like wave is much larger which means that the tsunami like wave has a serious effect on bridges as shown in figs 25c and 26c when the wave leaves it can be seen that the bridge has a significant blocking effect on solitary wave and the water levels in front of and behind the bridge drop obviously fig 25d but the propagation of tsunami like wave is relatively less affected by the bridge meanwhile the flow on the bridge deck drops through the air vent and due to the closure of the chamber the water inside flows slowly when the wave passes through the bridge the temporal evolutions of forces on the bridges are shown in fig 27 the horizontal force under the tsunami like wave is similar to that under the solitary wave but the effect duration of tsunami like wave is much longer after the wave passes the oscillation of the water leads to the strengthening of the interaction between the water and the bridge the forces vibrate violently as shown in fig 27a the vertical force is larger than the horizontal force for both solitary and tsunami like waves the maximum vertical force under the tsunami like wave is also larger than that under the solitary wave because the tsunami wave is with a higher velocity and more water fig 27b the total force magnitudes under two waves are compared in fig 27c which shows that the force under the tsunami like wave on the bridge with the air vent is still larger than that under the solitary wave even if the air vent exists in the bridge 5 4 2 comparisons with and without air vent due to the existence of the air vent the air can be discharged from the chamber the effects of the tsunami like waves on the bridge with and without air vent are investigated to real the influence of the air vent on the bridge the submersion depth from the toe of the girder to the still water surface is 0 5 m the vorticity contours of flow fields at four moments for two cases with and without air vent are depicted in figs 28 and 29 when the preceding elevated wave portion arrives figs 28b and 29b the air in the chamber without the air vent is compressed and the water level difference exists inside and outside of the chamber when the bridge is with the air vent the air is ejected to the atmosphere through the air vent with the increase of the water level the flow passes through the bridge deck the above air is always trapped in the chamber of the bridge without air vent and some below flow in the chamber is whirling however for the bridge with the air vent the water fills the chamber after the air is evacuated at the junction of water bodies around the air vent some pairs of vortices roll in the chambers the intensity of which decreases from the first air vent to the last air vent because both the water volume and velocity decrease after the wave leaves there are some vortices shedding behind the bridge deck but the whirling intensity of the flow around the bridge with air vent is much stronger than that of the bridge without air vent due to the existence of the air vent the flow change is much different from that without air vent the temporal evolutions of forces on the bridges with and without air vent are shown in fig 30 the horizontal forces on the bridges with and without air vent are similar to each other indicating that the air vent has a weak effect on the horizontal forces however the vertical force on the bridge with air vent is much less than that on the bridge without air vent because the vent can release the additional air pressure on the bridge with air vent which means that the air vent plays a significant role on the protection of the bridge since the vertical force is much larger than the horizontal force the vertical force dominates the overall force on the bridge 5 4 3 comparisons under different locations the effects of air vent on the bridges at different locations are investigated in this section the submersion depths from the toe of the girder to the still water depth are considered as 0 0 0 5 and 1 0 m respectively the vorticity contours at four moments are shown in figs 31 and 32 when the peaks of the leading depression the preceding elevated and the secondary elevated wave portions reach the bridge deck and the tsunami like wave leaves the bridge deck when the submersion depth is 0 0 m at the initial stage the toe of the girder touches the still water surface when the leading depression wave portion reaches the bridge deck the water level reduces and the water in the interface between the bottom of girders and water drops from the bridge deck causing some weak vortices fig 31a at the second moment some vortices are generated behind every girder and the maximum vorticity occurs at the last girder with the propagation of the wave the water level increases and the air is expelled from the chambers through the air vent when the peak of the secondary elevated wave portion is around the bridge at the third moment some water flows along the bridge surface and when the water passes through the air vent a part of it flows or drops into the vent connecting with the elevated water level clearly the biggest vortices happen behind the bridge deck after the wave leaves the water level decreases and some water in charmers drops due to the atmospheric connectivity through the air vent there is still strong turbulence in the water compared with the submersion depth of 0 0 m with the increase of the submersion depth the intensity of vortices increases fig 32 in the third moment more water passes over the bridge surface vortex separation appears at the bridge surface and the air vent a pair of big vortices shed from the bridge as shown in fig 32c when the wave leaves there are still some vortices shedding from the bridge leading to the oscillation of the water although the water in the chambers oscillates strongly wave propagation plays a dominant role in the change of the water level among girders the deeper the immersion depth the more obvious the turbulence phenomenon the temporal changes of horizontal and vertical forces on the bridges are recorded in fig 33 with the increase of submersion depth both the maximum horizontal and vertical forces on the bridges decrease slightly because when the bridge immerses in the water both the velocity around the bridge and the air pressure on the bridge decrease and the amount of water passing through the gap also greatly reduces when the water flows in the air vent due to the mutual collision and water friction both the flow energy and the overall flow velocity reduce which weakens the force oscillation of bridges after the wave leaves the forces gradually reduce to the minimum however it is found that the submersion depth has a weak effect on the bridge with air vent 5 4 4 the efficiency of air vent through the comparisons of hydrodynamic forces on the bridges with and without air vent the efficiency of air vent on reducing the forces is investigated in this section the force comparisons on different bridges with and without air vent are shown in fig 34 although the locations of the bridges are different the forces on the bridge without air vent are larger than that with air vent due to two reasons firstly if the air vent exists the extra air pressure caused by the trapped air can be released through the air vent secondly around the air vent the interaction between the rising water and flowing water on the bridge deck can reduce the wave energy and vertical force depending on the maximum and minimum forces on the different bridges with and without air vent the efficiency of the air vent is assessed using the comparison formula as 17 ν f p n f q n f p n where ν is the efficiency coefficient f p n and f q n represent the extreme values of forces on the bridge without and with air vent respectively the efficiency coefficients in different cases are shown in fig 35 it is found that the values of the efficiency coefficients about the horizontal forces are very small which means that the effect of the air vent on the horizontal hydrodynamic forces is very weak compared with the horizontal efficiency coefficients vertical coefficients are much larger because if the bridge does not have the air vent when the wave approaches the bridge the air in the chamber is compressed and additional air pressure is generated to the bridge deck the air pressure magnitudes on the front and rear surfaces of chamber are the same but the pressure directions are opposite so air pressure has little effect on the overall horizontal force of the bridge deck but exerts the very large vertical force on the horizontal plate of the bridge deck when the air vent is in the bridge deck as the water level rises the air in the chamber is released through the air vent and the air pressure disappears the vertical force is smaller than that on the bridge deck without air vent with the increase of the submersion depth the value of the coefficient decreases indicating that the deeper the submersion depth the less the impact of air vent on the bridge the coefficients of the overall force magnitude on the bridge resemble that of maximum vertical forces because the vertical forces on the bridge account for the majority the results demonstrate that the air vent has a great influence on the forces of the bridge which can reduce the forces on the bridge to protect the bridge 6 conclusions a numerical investigation about the effects of the tsunami like wave on different bridge decks is conducted by applying incompressible flow solver with immersed boundary referred to ifs ib in the simulations the effects of submersion depth wave height and air vent on hydrodynamic loads on the bridge decks are analyzed the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 when the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the vertical forces on the bridges are larger than the horizontal forces leading to many decks collapsed between two piers without lateral displacement after the hurricanes and tsunamis after the tsunami like wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the residual wave causes the load oscillation of the bridge compared with the solitary wave the effect duration of tsunami like wave on the bridge is much longer and the impact of this wave is also more serious the results from comparisons between tsunami like and solitary waves indicate that when studying the interaction between bridge and tsunami wave tsunami wave cannot be simply simplified as solitary wave 2 when the toe of the girder is above the still water surface initially with the decrease of the bridge deck both the horizontal and vertical forces on the bridge increase and the effect duration of the wave also extends when a part of the bridge deck is under the free surface at the initial state the horizontal forces on the bridges are similar to each other in different cases as for the vertical forces with the increase of the submersion depth the forces decrease the deeper the bridge is immersed the smaller the vertical force on the bridge deck when all the bridge deck has been immersed in the water before the tsunami like wave peak arrives at the bridge deck the bridge looks like a whole barrier to block the flow the bigger vortices are generated and shed behind the bridge with the increase of submersion depth both the horizontal and vertical forces decrease 3 with the increase of the wave height the horizontal force magnitude increases which basically shows a linear growth the magnitude of the positive force is much larger than that of the negative force compared with the maximum horizontal forces the vertical forces are much larger because the pressure caused by the rising water in the vertical direction is larger than that in the horizontal direction in total with the increase of the wave height the interaction intensity between the tsunami like wave and the bridge is enhanced and the forces on the bridge increase but the effect duration reduces the higher the wave height the easier the bridge will be damaged 4 when the bridge is with air vent it has little influence on the horizontal force magnitude after the wave passes over the bridge the oscillation of the horizontal force on the bridge without air vent is more serious than that with air vent however the vertical force on the bridge with air vent is much less than that without air vent which means that the air vent has a great influence on the vertical force due to the vertical force is much larger than the horizontal force the vertical forces on the bridge account for the majority for the overall force so the air vent has a great impact on the overall force of bridge which can reduce the forces on the bridge to protect the bridge this study can provide an assessment of tsunami wave forces on the different bridges large scale physical experiments and the hydrodynamic characteristics around the bridge in real marine conditions are deserved to study in the future credit authorship contribution statement enjin zhao conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft
