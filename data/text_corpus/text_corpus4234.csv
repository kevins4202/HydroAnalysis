propeller showing that the effects of hydroelasticity would be higher for the propeller with lower in plane shear modulus or higher skew profile or higher loads and the effects of fiber direction on propeller hydrodynamic performance is complicated it is also shown that the efficiency of the composite marine propeller is hard to be improved by varying material fiber orientation or skew of the propeller as well as a more complete design method is required for investigating hydroelastical benefits in propeller performance he et al 2015 results of blasques et al suggest that it is possible to design a medium sized flexible composite marine propeller that reduce fuel consumption while surviving under applied loads ghassabzadeh et al introduced a method based on hydro elastic analysis to

that as skew angle increases the maximum deflection of blade increases however thrust and torque coefficients decrease ghassabzadeh et al 2013 work of sun and xiong showed that the propulsive efficiency of propeller with optimum geometry in different operating conditions can be improved and the efficiency improves more when the propeller is at operating condition far away from design

twisting moment at various advance coefficients fig 2 below summarizes analysis steps used in this research 2 mathematical model numerical solution for equations governing fluid flow using finite volume method fvm was obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulation cfd in rotating reference frame for the absolute velocity formulation the governing equations of fluid flow in a rotating reference frame can be written using relative velocity between moving and stationary frames v r continuity equation is then represented as follow 1 ρ t ρ v r 0 the rate of change of mass in the control volume is expressed by the partial derivative ρ t the mass flow through its surface is given by the expression ρ v r conservation of momentum for steadily rotating reference frame with no external forces can be written as 2 t ρ v ρ v r v ρ ω v v t p τ where p is the static pressure τ is the stress tensor and ω is the angular velocity the momentum equation contains four additional acceleration terms the first two terms are the coriolis acceleration 2 ω v r and the centripetal acceleration ω ω r respectively terms due to the unsteady change of the rotational speed and linear

propeller designed by sva and presented as benchmark for numerical analysis test cases open water test curried out by sva on non cavitating case 2 1 barkmann 2011 the propeller is five blades right handed propeller with 0 25 m diameter d 1 635 pitch ratio at 0 7 r and design skew of 18 837 main geometric properties are shown in table 1 and fig 3 fluid flow arround the propeller modeled by one rotating domain with moving reference frame to allow solving the problem as steady state flow single blade is resolved by employing periodic boundary condition this greatly reduce mesh elements and computational capacity required skewness of the blade necessitates using corrugated boundary that follows blade curvature to represent periodic pairs fig 4 numerical unstructured grid with 512 000

pressure 4 results and discussion open water tests carried out by sva were used to validate cfd simulation analysis performed at advanced coefficients j 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 and 1 4 non dimensional forces and moments calculated according to the following equations 4 j v a n d 5 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 6 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 7 η o j 2 π k t k q with k t being the thrust coefficient k q the torque coefficient η o the propeller efficiency d the propeller diameter n the rotational speed t the thrust force and q the torque 4 1 validation of cfd simulation hydrodynamic coefficients calculated from cfd results were validated against test data measured by sva barkmann 2011 and depicted in fig 5 showing good agreement fig 6 shows pressure distribution obtained from cfd on propeller blade face and back at each advance coefficient nondimensional pressure is calculated according to the following equation 8 c p p 0 5 ρ v r 2 9 v r 2 v a 2 2 π n r 2 where r is the propeller radius v r is relative velocity and v a is advance speed while propeller operates at off design conditions low advance coefficient inflow angle deviates from optimum value and the blade is subjected to adverse pressure gradient which cause swirling flow and formulation of eddies at the tip of the blade this consequently leads to deterioration in efficiency as the curve indicates lin et al 2009 however this can be avoided by adapting pitch angle to maintain optimum angle of attack 4 2 pitch parametric study geometric pitch angle is a geometric property but the inflow angle β hydrodynamic pitch angle varies according to operating advance coefficient hydrodynamic pitch is related to the angle of attack α which is calculated according to the following equation 10 β tan 1 v a ω r 11 α θ β hydrodynamic pitch angle and attack angle at each blade section r r is shown in fig 7 investigation of effect of changing pitch distribution on hydrodynamic performance have been carried out by applying geometric twist at blade tip by angle ϕ linear equation was formulated to calculate change in pitch angle at each section from root to tip 12 δ θ r ϕ t i p r r h u b r r h u b where δ θ r is change in pitch angle at section r r ϕ tip is the twisting angle at tip r is propeller radius r is section radius and r h u b is the hub radius parametric study of pitch distribution was performed by applying different twisting angle ϕ to propeller blade new pitch distribution for each twisted model is calculated using equation 10 then each propeller section r r was twisted by angle δ θ r as demonstrated by fig 8 fig 9 shows resultant pitch distribution of three blade models with nominal positive twist of 3 3 degree and two negative twist 3 3 and 6 6 compared with original blade model value of nominal twist ϕ in fig 9 indicates the change in pitch angle at effective radius r 0 7 r because most of thrust force is generated around this section 13 ϕ δ θ 0 7 r 4 2 1 effect of blade twisting on propeller efficiency numerical simulation was performed for twisted blade models to investigate the effect of pitch change on propeller efficiency at each advance coefficient was obtained and depicted in fig 10 since original blade is designed with pitch distribution that gives maximum efficiency at design speed j 1 2 thus when propeller operate at lower j the value of optimum pitch moves to a lower value therefore decreasing blade pitch improves efficiency at low advance coefficients in contrary increasing pitch results in efficiency deterioration when propeller operates at high advance coefficients following curve of advance coefficient 0 8 on fig 10 shows that decreasing nominal pitch by 6 negative twist enhances efficiency by more than 10 the effect of decreasing pitch on pressure distribution is clarified by fig 12 as the figure indicates decreasing in pressure values that leads to reduction in forces over blades surface though propeller efficiency increased because reduction in torque is more significant than thrust reduction fig 11 pressure coefficient at each blade section is calculated according to the following equation 14 c p r p 0 5 ρ v r 2 15 v r 2 v a 2 2 π n r 2 where r is the propeller radius r is the section radius v r is relative velocity at section r r and v a is advance speed 4 2 2 twisting moment generated by hydrodynamic pressure on blade surface an important parameter in designing composite propeller but not usually discussed is the amount of twist moment generated from hydrodynamic load in this study twisting moment generated by hydrodynamic pressure is calculated from cfd results at different advance coefficients results entail that twisting moment decreases with increase of advance coefficient fig 13 de petching also found to decrease twisting moment hence at some lower values of pitch angle the twisting moment direction is reflected at high advance coefficients negative twisting moment tend to cause de pitching of propeller blade which leads to reduction in efficiency at high values of j in addition at low advance coefficient positive twist tends to increase pitch angle that is also unfavorable this behaviour adds more complications to the design process because if not taken into consideration may eventually affect the hydrodynamic performance of the composite propeller twist moment direction relies on the location of the center of pressure fig 15 the center of pressure itself depends on blade geometry but also varying location with different advance coefficients as explained in fig 14 fig 16 show interpretation for the shift in center of pressure between high and low advance coefficients values of pressure coefficient were obtained and plotted against nondimensional cord length s c at high advance coefficient j 1 4 the higher pressure occurs near trailing edge therefore results on negative twisting moment while at lower advance coefficient j 1 0 occur near leading edge causing positive de pitching moments as demonstrated by fig 15 location of center of pressure is also affected by change in pressure distribution due to blade twisting fig 17 shows alteration of pressure distribution at section 0 7r due to 6 6 degrees twist while operating at 0 8 advance coefficient as significant pressure is shifted toward the trailing edge resulting in reduction in twist moment as previously illustrated by fig 13 4 3 effect of blade skew on hydrodynamic twisting moment investigation of the effect of blade skew on the hydrodynamic twisting moment was performed by increasing skew angle of the blade as shown by fig 18 comparison of results obtained from high skew model and moderate skew model proved that skew angle has large influence on generated twisting moment highly skewed model decreased amount of twisting moment for the entire operating range though decrease at low advance coefficients was more significant skewing near tip sections away from propeller generator line increased the negative twisting moment generated by those sections and therefore decreased overall twisting moment fig 19 hydrodynamic twisting moment coefficient k ht has been obtained by nondimensionalizing twisting moment according to the following formula 16 k h t h y d r o d y n a m i c t w i s t i n g m o m e n t ρ n 2 d 5 propellers with positive twisting moment pitching moment at design j have the ability to perform better as self adapting propeller and would not require pre deformed design however negative twisting moment may cause the blade to de pitch if the composite bent twist coupling is not enough to overcome or withstand this unfavorable deformation consequently pre deformed model could be required to maintain design performance on the other hand if optimization process is concerned on improving efficiency at off design conditions then attention should be given to characteristics of k ht at low advance coefficient because in all cases twisting moment acts on unfavorable direction that tend to increase pitch and as a result decrease efficiency by this stage of the analysis the twist moment and direction are already determined but the actual response depends on the material used in fabricating the blade if isotropic material is used the response will be in the same direction indicated here however for composite material the bend twist coupling effect can be exploited to control the response direction to some extent structural response of flexible composite blade should be optimized to follow desired deformation direction by tailoring fiber orientation bearing in mind that whole operation range should be considered in optimization because hydro elastic response has different behaviour at different advance coefficients 5 conclusion this research introduced in depth numerical investigation for possible geometric factors that may determine suitability of model propeller to undergo favorable deformation and enhance efficiency the analysis was done on rigid propeller for sake of evaluating the twisting moment existing on the blade because all previous work was concerned on thrust torque and efficiency but not twisting hydrodynamic twisting moment was found to be the most important determinant of capability of propeller model to undergo passive self adaption and act as pitch adapting propeller hydrodynamic twisting moment shown to be highly affected by geometric properties especially pitch and skew hydrodynamic twisting coefficient k ht nondimensional form of hydrodynamic twisting moment introduced as elementary hydrodynamic criteria for predicting hydro elastic response of composite propeller model and comparing different geometries positive values of twisting coefficient indicate pitching moment while negative value indicates de pitching moment pitching moment tend to increase blade pitch and consequently improves efficiency when propeller operates above design advance coefficient while decreases efficiency when operating below design advance coefficient thus contradicting requirements for k ht exist for optimizing efficiency at design and off design conditions propeller pitch and skew highly affect twisting moment as increasing pitch angle increases twisting coefficient at entire range of advance coefficient linearly which is advantageous for passively adapting pitch at high j but has devastating effect at off design j on the other hand higher skew reduces twisting coefficient exponentially that is reduction at lower advance coefficients is significantly higher than design j which is beneficiary for mitigating unfavorable pitching moment at off design conditions without large discrepancies on design j efficiency however response of twisting moment under skew change is nontrivial and may differ for other propeller models depending on distribution of skew and pitch in the initial design in general twisting moment is usually unfavorable as it tends to generate unfavorable pitch though optimizing skew distribution could mitigate this unfavorable moment allowing for wisely design unbalanced laminate to undergo bend twist coupling that is capable to withstand or even overcome

bucket foundations commonly designed as the mono bucket or tripod bucket are with relatively smaller aspect ratios l d where l and d represent the length and diameter of the bucket respectively as shown in fig 1 a the applicability of bucket foundations for wind turbines has been proved by several projects including frederikshavn and horns rev 2 in denmark ibsen and brincker 2004 leblanc et al

those suggested by butterfield et al 1997 as demonstrated in fig 1 a apart from the traditional uniaxial capacities the capacities under combined loading which are widely described using failure envelopes are also with concern gourvenec and jensen 2009 for mono bucket foundations in clay the undrained capacities under uniaxial and combined loading have been studied through the limit analyses aubeny et al 2003 aubeny and murff 2005 finite element fe simulations hu and randolph 2002 bransby and yun 2009 hung and kim 2012 and centrifuge tests cassidy et al 2004 clukey et al 2004 the capacity factors under uniaxial loading depend on the aspect ratio of bucket foundation and the soil non homogeneity and soils in these studies were assumed to remain in contact with the skirt of bucket the normalized failure envelopes under combined loading are typically expressed as non regular ellipses in shape gourvenec and barnett 2011 while the installation caused reduction of shear stress along the skirt soil interface was neglected in most theoretical and numerical analyses hu and randolph 2002 aubeny et al 2003 the bucket is installed by penetration due to self weight and suction applied resulting in soil remolding around the bucket an adhesion factor of 0 65 was suggested to reflect the relationship between the shear stress along the interface and the undrained shear strength of adjacent soil supachawarote 2006 kay and palix 2010 dnv 2017 as for the capacities of tripod bucket foundations in clay there have been a limited number of studies of which most were focused on buckets with aspect ratios less than 1 kim et al 2014 hung and kim 2014 terzis et al 2014 stergiou et al 2015 petas et al 2016 however a number of tripod bucket foundations used in the north sea and the yellow sea were featured with aspect ratios of 1 2 offshorewind 2014 bae et al 2017 carbon trust 2019 also recommended multi bucket foundations with typical aspect ratios larger than 1 due to critical vertical tensile capacity it is not clear if the existing findings for aspect ratios less than 1 can be extended to those larger than 1 apart from the aspect ratio the capacities of tripod bucket foundations under combined loading are dependent on the spacing ratio s d where s is the distance between the bucket centers see fig 1 however the spacing ratio is not explicitly presented in the normalized equations of failure envelopes suggested by hung and kim 2014 instead the influence of the spacing ratio is quantified through the uniaxial capacities involved in the normalized equations kim et al 2014 in addition to the best of authors knowledge the influence of installation on the capacities of tripod bucket foundations has not been studied in this paper the uniaxial capacities and failure loci represent the most dangerous cases of tripod bucket foundations with aspect ratios of 1 2 and spacing ratios of 1 5 3 are explored using fe analyses soil remolding around the skirt that results from bucket installation is considered in the analyses the influences of dominant factors such as the soil non homogeneity and the aspect ratio and spacing ratio of buckets are investigated based on the numerical results expressions for uniaxial capacity factors and failure loci are proposed 2 methodology the interaction between the tripod bucket foundation and soil was simulated using commercial fe package abaqus dassault systèmes 2016 the foundation was assumed to be wished in place although the installation effect was considered by reducing the shear stress along the skirt soil interface the capacity factors and normalized failure loci proposed later were independent of the bucket diameter d so d 10 m was taken as an example the thickness of the skirt was taken as 0 01d to avoid boundary effect the soil bottom and circumference were 6l and 5d away from bucket tip and skirt respectively by following supachawarote 2006 shear bands were set inside and outside the skirt to represent soil disturbance occurred during installation the thickness of shear band was chosen as 0 01d which was testified as sufficiently small to avoid its effect on the capacity the buckets were simplified as rigid since their stiffness are much higher than soil three buckets with l d 1 1 5 and 2 were positioned in triangular as illustrated in fig 1 b the spacing ratio s d was varied as 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 the displacements of the three buckets were represented by those at a reference point rp i e all buckets were connected rigidly to the rp the rp was set at the centroid of the triangle linking the three centers of bucket tops see fig 1 this position is usually the joint position between the foundation and the upper structure which was also used in a number of studies such as kim et al 2014 and hung and kim 2014 the vertical force v horizontal force h and moment m were applied at the rp and the corresponding displacements rotation were w u and θ respectively the uniaxial capacities were termed v 0 h 0 and m 0 clay under undrained conditions was regarded as a tresca material the undrained shear strength s u was assumed to increase linearly with depth as 1 s u s um k z where s um is the undrained shear strength at mudline and k is the gradient of undrained strength in terms of soil depth z the undrained shear strength of soil within the shear band was taken as αs u where α was the so called adhesion factor α 0 65 suggested in supachawarote 2006 kay and palix 2010 and dnv guidelines dnv 2017 was adopted this value can be applied to most typical offshore clays with soil sensitivity ranged between 1 5 and 4 for normally consolidated clay s um was varied as 0 5 15 and 30 kpa and k 1 and 1 5 kpa m with s um kd ranged between 0 and 3 although the typical range of young s modulus is 200s u 800s u the trial simulation results showed that e has little influence on the ultimate capacities the tripod bucket foundation with d 10 m l d 1 and s d 1 5 in clay with s um 0 and k 1 kpa m is taken as an example the moment rotation curves for e s u 400 and 10 000 are illustrated in fig 2 indicating that the divergence of m 0 is less than 0 2 this phenomenon is also observed for other capacities therefore e was set artificially high as 10000s u to achieve ultimate capacities within a small displacement a similar assumption was also used in the numerical analyses of zhang et al 2011 the effective unit weight of clay was set as 6 kn m3 and poisson s ratio was taken as 0 49 to satisfy constant volume under undrained conditions the interaction between skirt and soil was set as tie and thus there was no separation between bucket and soil on the rear side during failure the whole tripod bucket foundation were modeled the cylindrical surface of soil was constrained in horizontal and the soil bottom was fixed soil was discretized with linear hexahedron elements with full integration the mesh strategy and boundary for the tripod bucket foundation with l d 1 and s d 1 5 are demonstrated as an example in fig 3 the typical element size around the bucket skirt was 0 1d which was verified as sufficiently small to get convergent results the distances between the boundaries to the foundation were 5d in horizontal and 6l in vertical fig 3 which were proved to have minimal effects on the numerical results for uniaxial loading the displacement controlled mode was used to obtain the load displacement curve at the rp for all load displacement curves the load increases with the displacement rapidly and then approaches the ultimate value which is defined as the capacity the probe tests were adopted to establish failure loci under combined loading bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec and randolph 2003 the procedure includes 1 a constant vertical load v is first applied at the rp 2 horizontal and moment displacements u and θ are then applied at a constant ratio of u θd following a loading path until failure 3 the final stages of the loading paths at various ratios of u θd are connected to obtain the hm envelope under v 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 at various v to obtain the complete vhm envelope only part of the failure envelope represents the most dangerous cases was studied as detailed in sections 4 1 3 verification the reliability of the fe model established is verified by comparison with the numerical results by kim et al 2014 and hung and kim 2014 the soil strength profile is with s um 1 25 kpa and k 1 25 kpa m and the foundation is with l d 1 and s d 1 7 2 6 for comparison purpose the adhesion factor is selected as α 1 deliberately the variations of capacity factors and failure loci are demonstrated in fig 4 the vertical horizontal and moment capacity factors are calculated as 2 n cv v 0 3 α π d l s uav a s utip 3 n ch h 0 a s utip 4 n cm m 0 a s utip d where a is the cross sectional area of three buckets a 3πd 2 4 s utip the undrained shear strength at the tip of skirt s utip s um kl and s uav the average undrained shear strength along the skirt the failure loci are plotted in dimensionless space h as utip m ads utip compared to the existing capacity factors and failure loci kim et al 2014 hung and kim 2014 the divergences are less than 5 4 discussions 4 1 loading orientation the loading orientation is defined by the intersection angle β between the load and the x direction in fig 1 b based on the asymmetry of the tripod it is adequate to determine the most dangerous orientation by studying β from 0 to 180 i e from two bucket compression to one bucket compression the capacities under h m vh and vm are compared in fig 5 h 0 and m 0 change slightly with loading orientations and the differences are less than 2 and 4 respectively it proves that uniaxial horizontal and moment capacities are not sensitive to loading orientation which is consist with the result of h 0 for tripod pile foundation by zhao et al 2017 on the contrary h and m under 0 7v 0 change significantly with loading orientations and the differences are as large as 10 and 30 respectively under 0 7v 0 h and m decrease from β 0 60 i e from two bucket compression to one bucket compression condition this changing process is reversed at 60 120 and repeated at 120 180 as a result β 60 or 180 which corresponds to one bucket compression is taken as the most dangerous cases another evidence for this result is that the fourth quadrant of envelope with both h and m β 180 is the smallest as shown in fig 6 so in the following sections only the uniaxial capacities and failure loci under one bucket compression condition are studied 4 2 vertical capacity similar to the mono bucket foundation the vertical capacity of tripod bucket foundation is composed of two parts the friction along the bucket skirts and the end bearing resistance the former is mainly limited within the outer shear bands attached to the skirt external surface while the latter is related to the soil mobilized under the bottom of each bucket the displacement contours for different s d and l d are shown in fig 7 the failure mechanisms under three buckets may overlap with each other if the spacing is not sufficiently large i e s d less than 2 there is less overlapping area with increasing s d and at s d 3 the failure mechanism of each bucket is independent suggesting that n cv in eq 2 is a function of the spacing ratio and the effect of spacing decreases with increasing s d n cv of the tripod bucket is expected to depend on the aspect ratio which can be proved by the larger degree of soil mobilization for l d 2 than for l d 1 with the same s d by following houlsby and wroth 1983 and vulpe et al 2014 the influence of undrained shear strength profile is captured through a normalized factor s um kd as such typical results from fe simulations varying s d l d and s um kd are shown in table 1 the values of n cv corresponding to s um kd 0 3 are with difference less than 8 at given values of s d and l d therefore s um kd may be neglected in the expression of n cv the effect of s d is more dominant the expansion of failure mechanism under each bucket is constrained by the other two as s d is smaller than a threshold value based on a number of 60 cases n cv is fitted as 5 n cv 0 15 tanh 0 29 s d 0 85 10 0 0 9 l d 1 where the first term refers to the effect of s d and the second term is the vertical capacity factor of mono bucket foundation the predictions by eq 5 are also included in table 1 and their differences from the fe results are less than 5 4 3 horizontal capacity the horizontal capacity is governed by a translational scoop mechanism as demonstrated in the displacement contours in fig 8 in addition to the conical wedge failures on the front and rear sides of the buckets the rotational scoops at the base of the foundations are formed due to cross coupling between the horizontal and rotational movements the conical wedge failure of each bucket is constrained by others when they are closely spaced but this constraint weakens with larger spacing the shape of rotational scoops also shrinks with larger spacing and therefore n ch is a function of s d as the aspect ratio is increased the rotational scoops are extended further as shown in fig 8 typical results from analyses with different combinations of s d l d and s um kd are shown in fig 9 it is found that a normalized factor s um s utip rather than s um kd is convenient for fitting the expression of horizontal capacity factor n ch the effect of s d on n ch gradually weakens since the conical wedge failures are separated from each other with larger spacing by considering the above key factors n ch is fitted as 6 n ch 3 7 s u m s u tip 4 6 1 6 l d 0 2 tanh s d 0 6 l d 2 0 3 l d 0 77 predictions from eq 6 are also plotted in fig 9 with the differences from fe results less than 10 kim et al 2014 reported the variation of n ch at l d 0 25 1 with the adhesion factor being selected as α 1 as shown in fig 10 the fe results from this study and kim et al 2014 both with α 1 are close to each other at l d 0 25 1 for l d 1 2 the fe data with α 0 65 are 6 9 lower than those with α 1 suggesting that the uniaxial horizontal capacity is influenced by the adhesion factor slightly it is worth noting that although it is fitted based on numerical data with l d 1 2 eq 6 can be expanded to the aspect ratio as low as 0 75 as the dash line in fig 10 4 4 moment capacity the displacement contours for different s d and l d are shown in fig 11 the moment capacity is governed by three failure mechanisms due to different spacing 1 scoop mechanism for closely spaced buckets e g s d 1 5 2 isolated soil mobilizations around each bucket as s d larger than a threshold value e g s d 3 3 a transitional mechanism in between for moderately spaced buckets the transitional mechanism is similar to the translational scoop mechanism but the conical wedge failure is mobilized within a smaller volume of soil near the surface while the rotational scoops are more significant a rotation center is formed in the soil for closely spaced buckets but will gradually disappear with increasing spacing i e n cm is a function of s d n cm may also be affected by l d since conical wedge failure will extend with larger aspect ratio shown in fig 11 n cm at different s d l d and s um kd are obtained through fe simulations and typical results are shown in fig 12 similar to n ch fe results of n cm can be better fitted by using s um s utip n cm increases with s d since a larger extent of conical wedge failures are mobilized with larger spacing n cm is fitted as 7 n cm 1 7 s u m s u tip 4 8 0 4 l d 0 3 s d the performance of the equation is shown in fig 12 generally the predictions by eq 7 achieve good agreement with the fe results with divergences less than 12 4 5 failure loci probe tests are used to form the failure loci in hm plane a foundation with s d 1 5 is taken as the example for which the load paths corresponding to different values of u θd are plotted in fig 13 as dash lines the failure loci corresponding to s d 2 2 5 and 3 are obtained in the same fashion the locus is expanded in size with increasing s d but the shapes are similar this phenomenon was also observed by hung and kim 2014 the failure loci in terms of different l d and v v 0 are compared in fig 14 for l d 2 and s d 1 5 the failure loci are similar in shape while the locus size depends on the vertical load as v v 0 increases from 0 3 to 0 5 the moment capacity reduces moderately 10 for a given horizontal capacity however this reduction becomes as large as 20 when v v 0 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 the reason is that the soil flows underneath the bucket bottoms become prominent under a vertical load close to v 0 thus relatively small horizontal forces or moments applied subsequently would form rapid approach of the load path to the ultimate failure as the aspect ratio is varied from 2 to 1 the loci change from nearly straight lines to irregular elliptic curves especially at low amplitudes of v v 0 for mono bucket foundations with l d 1 gourvenec and barnett 2011 and vulpe et al 2014 suggested to describe the failure loci in the vhm space as ellipses a similar expression is proposed to account for tripod bucket foundations with l d 1 2 and s d 1 5 3 8 h h 0 h n 1 m m 0 m n 2 n 3 h h 0 h m m 0 m 1 9 h 1 v v 0 q 10 m 1 v v 0 p where q and p are fitting parameters related to dimensionless vertical load v v 0 l d and s d n 1 n 2 and n 3 are fitting parameters related to the shape and size of ellipse based on the fe results the parameters q and p are fitted as 11 q 0 27 s d s d 2 0 81 s d l d 3 0 2 15 l d 2 5 26 l d 4 05 v v0 0 7 12 p s d 1 62 s d 1 4 0 45 l d 0 8 v v 0 0 7 n 1 n 2 2 and n 3 is found to be dependent on v v 0 and l d as 13 n 3 v v 0 0 9 0 29 l d 0 7 it is worth noting that s um kd does not appear explicitly in eq 8 however its influence has already been incorporated into uniaxial capacities v 0 h 0 and m 0 as shown in fig 15 the normalized failure loci at s um kd 0 0 5 1 5 and 3 are close to each other for the given foundation geometry and magnitude of vertical load the reliability of eq 8 is validated further by two additional cases a l d 1 2 s d 2 8 s um 15 kpa and k 1 kpa m and b l d 1 8 s d 1 8 s um 1 kpa and k 1 2 kpa m fig 16 demonstrates the loci in terms of two representative v v 0 values of 0 2 and 0 6 the predictions by eq 8 provide reasonable agreement with the fe results it is worth noting that the intercepts on h h 0 h and m m 0 m axes by fe are not exactly equal to 1 due to the fitting error in eq 8 as a result eqs 2 13 can be adopted in the capacity design of tripod bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine for foundation with a certain combination of aspect ratio spacing ratio and soil non homogeneity the failure loci can be obtained by determining the uniaxial capacities through eqs 2 7 and then substituting them into eq 8 if the design load locates within the failure loci obtained by eq 8 then the design is considered to be safe 5 conclusions the capacities of tripod bucket foundations under uniaxial and combined vertical horizontal and moment loading have been studied through finite element analyses the soil non homogeneity s um kd aspect ratio l d and bucket spacing ratio s d are varied to investigate their effects adhesion factor is adopted to incorporate the effect of soil remolding and reduced undrained shear strength of the soil adjacent to the outside of the bucket skirt simplified equations have been proposed to determine the capacities of tripod bucket foundations under uniaxial and combined loading for soil non homogeneity s um kd 0 3 aspect ratio l d 1 2 and spacing ratio s d 1 5 3 the uniaxial capacity factors are provided through eqs 5 7 as for failure loci an elliptic function with parameters related to v v 0 l d and s d is adopted through eqs 8 13 simplified equations proposed in this study may provide convenience for the capacity design of tripod bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine in normally consolidated clay credit

et al 2014 hung and kim 2014 the divergences are less than 5 4 discussions 4 1 loading orientation the loading orientation is defined by the intersection angle β between the load and the x direction in fig 1 b based on the asymmetry of the tripod it is adequate to determine the most dangerous orientation by studying β from 0 to 180 i e from two bucket compression to one bucket compression the capacities under h m vh and vm are compared in fig 5 h 0 and m 0 change slightly with loading orientations and the differences are less than 2 and 4 respectively it proves that uniaxial horizontal and moment capacities are not sensitive to loading orientation which is consist with the result of h 0 for tripod pile foundation by zhao et al 2017 on the contrary h and m under 0 7v 0 change significantly with loading orientations and the differences are as large as 10 and 30 respectively under 0 7v 0 h and m decrease from β 0 60 i e from two bucket compression to one bucket compression condition this changing process is reversed at 60 120 and repeated at 120 180 as a result β 60 or 180 which corresponds to one bucket compression is taken as the most dangerous cases another evidence for this result is that the fourth quadrant of envelope with both h and m β 180 is the smallest as shown in fig 6 so in the following sections only the uniaxial capacities and failure loci under one bucket compression condition are studied 4 2 vertical capacity similar to the mono bucket foundation the vertical capacity of tripod bucket foundation is composed of two parts the friction along the bucket skirts and the end bearing resistance the former is mainly limited within the outer shear bands attached to the skirt external surface while the latter is related to the soil mobilized under the bottom of each bucket the displacement contours for different s d and l d are shown in fig 7 the failure mechanisms under three buckets may overlap with each other if the spacing is not sufficiently large i e s d less than 2 there is less overlapping area with increasing s d and at s d 3 the failure mechanism of each bucket is independent suggesting that n cv in eq 2 is a function of the spacing ratio and the effect of spacing decreases with increasing s d n cv of the tripod bucket is expected to depend on the aspect ratio which can be proved by the larger degree of soil mobilization for l d 2 than for l d 1 with the same s d by following houlsby and wroth 1983 and vulpe et al 2014 the influence of undrained shear strength profile is captured through a normalized factor s um kd as such typical results from fe simulations varying s d l d and s um kd are shown in table 1 the values of n cv corresponding to s um kd 0 3 are with difference less than 8 at given values of s d and l d therefore s um kd may be neglected in the expression of n cv the effect of s d is more dominant the expansion of failure mechanism under each bucket is constrained by the other two as s d is smaller than a threshold value based on a number of 60 cases n cv is fitted as 5 n cv 0 15 tanh 0 29 s d 0 85 10 0 0 9 l d 1 where the first term refers to the effect of s d and the second term is the vertical capacity factor of mono bucket foundation the predictions by eq 5 are also included in table 1 and their differences from the fe results are less than 5 4 3 horizontal capacity the horizontal capacity is governed by a translational scoop mechanism as demonstrated in the displacement contours in fig 8 in addition to the conical wedge failures on the front and rear sides of the buckets the rotational scoops at the base of the foundations are formed due to cross coupling between the horizontal and rotational movements the conical wedge failure of each bucket is constrained by others when they are closely spaced but this constraint weakens with larger spacing the shape of rotational scoops also shrinks with larger spacing and therefore n ch is a function of s d as the aspect ratio is increased the rotational scoops are extended further as shown in fig 8 typical results from analyses with different combinations of s d l d and s um kd are shown in fig 9 it is found that a normalized factor s um s utip rather than s um kd is convenient for fitting the expression of horizontal capacity factor n ch the effect of s d on n ch gradually weakens since the conical wedge failures are separated from each other with larger spacing by considering the above key factors n ch is fitted as 6 n ch 3 7 s u m s u tip 4 6 1 6 l d 0 2 tanh s d 0 6 l d 2 0 3 l d 0 77 predictions from eq 6 are also plotted in fig 9 with the differences from fe results less than 10 kim et al 2014 reported the variation of n ch at l d 0 25 1 with the adhesion factor being selected as α 1 as shown in fig 10 the fe results from this study and kim et al 2014 both with α 1 are close to each other at l d 0 25 1 for l d 1 2 the fe data with α 0 65 are 6 9 lower than those with α 1 suggesting that the uniaxial horizontal capacity is influenced by the adhesion factor slightly it is worth noting that although it is fitted based on numerical data with l d 1 2 eq 6 can be expanded to the aspect ratio as low as 0 75 as the dash line in fig 10 4 4 moment capacity the displacement contours for different s d and l d are shown in fig 11 the moment capacity is governed by three failure mechanisms due to different spacing 1 scoop mechanism for closely spaced buckets e g s d 1 5 2 isolated soil mobilizations around each bucket as s d larger than a threshold value e g s d 3 3 a transitional mechanism in between for moderately spaced buckets the transitional mechanism is similar to the translational scoop mechanism but the conical wedge failure is mobilized within a smaller volume of soil near the surface while the rotational scoops are more significant a rotation center is formed in the soil for closely spaced buckets but will gradually disappear with increasing spacing i e n cm is a function of s d n cm may also be affected by l d since conical wedge failure will extend with larger aspect ratio shown in fig 11 n cm at different s d l d and s um kd are obtained through fe simulations and typical results are shown in fig 12 similar to n ch fe results of n cm can be better fitted by using s um s utip n cm increases with s d since a larger extent of conical wedge failures are mobilized with larger spacing n cm is fitted as 7 n cm 1 7 s u m s u tip 4 8 0 4 l d 0 3 s d the performance of the equation is shown in fig 12 generally the predictions by eq 7 achieve good agreement with the fe results with divergences less than 12 4 5 failure loci probe tests are used to form the failure loci in hm plane a foundation with s d 1 5 is taken as the example for which the load paths corresponding to different values of u θd are plotted in fig 13 as dash lines the failure loci corresponding to s d 2 2 5 and 3 are obtained in the same fashion the locus is expanded in size with increasing s d but the shapes are similar this phenomenon was also observed by hung and kim 2014 the failure loci in terms of different l d and v v 0 are compared in fig 14 for l d 2 and s d 1 5 the failure loci are similar in shape while the locus size depends on the vertical load as v v 0 increases from 0 3 to 0 5 the moment capacity reduces moderately 10 for a given horizontal capacity however this reduction becomes as large as 20 when v v 0 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 the reason is that the soil flows underneath the bucket bottoms become prominent under a vertical load close to v 0 thus relatively small horizontal forces or moments applied subsequently would form rapid approach of the load path to the ultimate failure as the aspect ratio is varied from 2 to 1 the loci change from nearly straight lines to irregular elliptic curves especially at low amplitudes of v v 0 for mono bucket foundations with l d 1 gourvenec and barnett 2011 and vulpe et al 2014 suggested to describe the failure loci in the vhm space as ellipses a similar expression is proposed to account for tripod bucket foundations with l d 1 2 and s d 1 5 3 8 h h 0 h n 1 m m 0 m n 2 n 3 h h 0 h m m 0 m 1 9 h 1 v v 0 q 10 m 1 v v 0 p where q and p are fitting parameters related to dimensionless vertical load v v 0 l d and s d n 1 n 2 and n 3 are fitting parameters related to the shape and size of ellipse based on the fe results the parameters q and p are fitted as 11 q 0 27 s d s d 2 0 81 s d l d 3 0 2 15 l d 2 5 26 l d 4 05 v v0 0 7 12 p s d 1 62 s d 1 4 0 45 l d 0 8 v v 0 0 7 n 1 n 2 2 and n 3 is found to be dependent on v v 0 and l d as 13 n 3 v v 0 0 9 0 29 l d 0 7 it is worth noting that s um kd does not appear explicitly in eq 8 however its influence has already been incorporated into uniaxial capacities v 0 h 0 and m 0 as shown in fig 15 the normalized failure loci at s um kd 0 0 5 1 5 and 3 are close to each other for the given foundation geometry and magnitude of vertical load the reliability of eq 8 is validated further by two additional cases a l d 1 2 s d 2 8 s um 15 kpa and k 1 kpa m and b l d 1 8 s d 1 8 s um 1 kpa and k 1 2 kpa m fig 16 demonstrates the loci in terms of two representative v v 0 values of 0 2 and 0 6 the predictions by eq 8 provide reasonable agreement with the fe results it is worth noting that the intercepts on h h 0 h and m m 0 m axes by fe are not exactly equal to 1 due to the fitting error in eq 8 as a result eqs 2 13 can be adopted in the capacity design of tripod bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine for foundation with a certain combination of aspect ratio spacing ratio and soil non homogeneity the failure loci can be obtained by determining the uniaxial capacities through eqs 2 7 and then substituting them into eq 8 if the design load locates within the failure loci obtained by eq 8 then the design is considered to be safe 5 conclusions the capacities of tripod bucket foundations under uniaxial and combined vertical horizontal and moment loading have been studied through finite element analyses the soil non homogeneity s um kd aspect ratio l d and bucket spacing ratio s d are varied to investigate their effects adhesion factor is adopted to incorporate the effect of soil remolding and reduced undrained shear strength of the soil adjacent to the outside of the bucket skirt simplified equations have been proposed to determine the capacities of tripod bucket foundations under uniaxial and combined loading for soil non homogeneity s um kd 0 3 aspect ratio l d 1 2 and spacing ratio s d 1 5 3 the uniaxial capacity factors are provided through eqs 5 7 as for failure loci an elliptic function with parameters related to v v 0 l d and s d is adopted through eqs 8 13 simplified equations proposed in this study may provide convenience for the capacity design of tripod bucket foundations supporting offshore wind turbine in normally consolidated clay credit

21172,this paper develops a safety guaranteed adaptive neural motion controller for an underactuated hovercraft in the presence of multiple constraints and model uncertainties first a surge controller is designed based on a new improved integral barrier lyapunov function iblf to guarantee that the surge speed is above the resistance hump speed to achieve better course stability second the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into one on the sway speed and then the virtual sway controller is designed to constrain the sway speed for the purpose of confining the drift angle third a time varying iblf is constructed to constrain the yaw angular velocity to inside of safety boundary relating to the surge speed to ensure a safe turning motion at high speed neural networks nns are incorporated into each controller to handle the model uncertainties it is proved that all the tracking errors are ultimately uniformly bounded finally the results from numerous simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches keywords underactuated hovercraft safety constraint improved integral barrier lyapunov function motion control 1 introduction the underactuated hovercraft shown in fig 1 can be lifted up to run above the water surface using a large enough air cushion force to obtain unique amphibious performance compared with normal displacement vessels a hovercraft is faster because its hydrodynamic resistance is very small thus hovercrafts have attracted increasingly more attention in both civil and military fields due to special performances hua 2008 it should be noted that a hovercraft has poor course stability at low speed and it easily experiences drift and heeling motion during fast turning these situations create safety problems for a hovercraft s motion control according to the theoretical studies and the testing using prototype ships the course stability of a hovercraft is poor at the speed around or below the resistance hump speed hua 2008 after a detailed review of the motion control of the hovercraft we found that a constraint on the surge speed was not considered in shojaei 2015 shojaei 2014 rigatos and raffo 2015 morales et al 2015 sira ramirez 2002 fu et al 2019 therefore we should ensure the hovercraft s speed is above the resistance hump speed to achieve ideal course stability moreover it is easy for a large roll angle and drift angle to occur when a hovercraft is turning and the roll and drift motion become increasingly more violent as the yaw angular velocity increases as the roll angle and drift angle increase one side of hovercraft s skirt will contact with water which will reduce the transverse stability cohen et al 2001 in addition turning at high speed will result in the stern kickoff phenomenon and may even cause the hovercraft to capsize hua 2008 in conclusion the surge speed drift angle and yaw angular velocity must be effectively constrained to ensure the safe navigation of a hovercraft recently through the efforts of researchers various significant achievements to address the state constraints in nonlinear systems have been proposed in particular motivated by the idea of reconstructing a control lyapunov function barrier lyapunov functions blfs such as log type blfs tee et al 2009 tee and ge 2011 liu et al 2014 li et al 2018a an et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 and tan type blfs zheng et al 2018 ni et al 2018 have been proposed to realize the safety state and output constraints of nonlinear systems in zhao et al 2014 a symmetric log type blf is used to prevent violations of the time invariant multiple output constraints when a fully actuated marine surface vessel is tracking a desired trajectory a control strategy based on an asymmetric log type blf combined with an nn was proposed to ensure that a robotic system completed the tracking of the desired positions and velocities with an ideal accuracy while the full state constraints were never violated he et al 2016 in he et al 2017 a log type blf is utilized to address the time varying asymmetric output constraints of a marine surface vessel in the presence of uncertainties a tan type blf was proposed to guarantee that the output tracking errors exponentially converge into a small range around zero without violating the time varying constraints on the system states jin 2016a a time varying tan type blf introduced in jin 2016b was incorporated with a finite time control scheme to address the line of sight range and angle constraints for a group of underactuated autonomous surface vessels in leader follower formation control unfortunately the above log type and tan type blfs are just able to constrain the error signals and then they indirectly constrain the corresponding system states hence an additional mapping to the system state space is required considering the inadequacies of the log type and tan type blfs in constraining system states iblfs which can directly constrain the system states are proposed in tee and ge 2012 kim and yoo 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 liu et al 2018b in xia et al 2019 a novel iblf is used to develop a control scheme that provides enhanced system stability and guarantees output constraints the simulation results indicate that the proposed iblf control technique avoids the existing inadequacies of the log type and tan type blfs the state and input constraints of a strict feedback nonlinear tracking system are handled by introducing an iblf into backstepping procedure and extending the system input as a system state in zhang 2018 in tang et al 2016 an adaptive nn was combined with iblf to design a tracking controller for a class of perturbed uncertain nonlinear systems the proposal effectively ensures that time invariant constraint boundaries on system states are never violated in addition to the nns an adaptive fuzzy system was also incorporated into an iblf in kong et al 2019 an iblf based adaptive fuzzy control for coordinated multiple robots to handle a time varying constraint is proposed however unfortunately there is a partial derivative of the iblf in the designed control law and thus the control law cannot be applied directly to a practical system in addition the iblf was also introduced into sliding mode control for example in wang et al 2016 a control iblf is used to develop the reaching law such that the sliding mode can be reached within finite time in addition in qin 2020 an iblf based unit sliding mode controller is designed to ensure the boundedness of the iblf in the closed loop and obtain the global constraints of the system state variables however almost all the aforementioned iblfs are only used to deal with the time invariant constraints on system states among them the iblf technique used in kong et al 2019 only dealt with the time varying constraint and it did not obtain the concrete expression of the control law this paper will improve the existing iblf to address the time varying constraint furthermore a totally new iblf is proposed to ensure that the greatest lower bound of a hovercraft s surge speed is never violated therefore the proposed iblf has a wider application range since the constraints on the states are mostly time varying in practical control systems it is well known that adaptive control techniques are a powerful tool used to approximate nonlinear functions and achieve any accuracy in control and applications for nonlinear systems a variable structure adaptive control method for a linear time invariant system with additive and multiplicative unmodeled dynamics is designed and proposed in feng and wu 1996 in this paper the unknown terms were handled by designing parameter adaptive updating rules in eq 21 in tao and kokotovic 1993 a mathematical model of the backlash inverse was developed and a parametrization of the estimated error was given then a backlash inverse controller with a parameter adaptive adjustment scheme for unknown plants was applied to update the backlash inverse estimate and to stabilize the closed loop system in ge et al 2004 an adaptive neural controller for a strict feedback nonlinear system with unknown nonlinear functions with unknown signs is proposed in it the unknown function q 1 z 1 was arbitrarily approximated by a nn with any accuracy in yousef et al 2009 a fuzzy basis function approach based adaptive robust tracking control scheme for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems with mimo subsystems was proposed to adaptively compensate for disturbances and interconnections with unknown bounds in conclusion adaptive control means that the designed controller can effectively approximate and compensate for external disturbances model uncertainties and unknown system dynamics furthermore the controller makes the corresponding adjustments according to the designed adaptive updating rules in this paper an adaptive nn will be used to approximate the model uncertainties of the hovercraft motion model inspired by the abovementioned observations this paper perfects the time varying iblf technique given in kong et al 2019 to address the time varying safety constraints on the sway speed and yaw angular velocity in particular in order to address the safety constraints on the surge speed we restructure a totally new iblf to guarantee that the surge speed is always above the resistance hump speed accordingly the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 unlike the existing iblf based state constraint method in xia et al 2019 zhang 2018 kong et al 2019 in this study the surge speed is constrained above the resistance hump speed by restructuring a totally new iblf to obtain better course stability 2 the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into the constraint on the sway speed in this study then the constraint on the drift angle is indirectly fulfilled by ensuring that the constraint converted from the drift angle on the sway speed is never violated under the action of the virtual controller designed based on the time varying iblf 3 the yaw angular velocity is constrained to inside the safety boundary related to the surge speed to guarantee a safe turning motion at high speed and prevent dangerous navigation situations such as great heeling caused by the drift angle the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are introduced in section 2 the safety guaranteed adaptive motion control design for a hovercraft with multiple constraints and model uncertainties is proposed in section 3 the simulation results that demonstrate the feasibility and universality of the proposed control approach are given in section 4 the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 time varying integral barrier lyapunov function a totally new time varying iblf which guarantees the infimum of the system states is constructed as 1 v i e x d k i t 0 e σ σ x d 2 σ x d 2 k i 2 t d σ where e x x d denotes the tracking error and x d represents a continuously differentiable desired trajectory satisfying x d k i t with k i t being a time varying positive function and σ is the integration variable representing a measure for the tracking error we know that v i is a positive definite and continuously differentiable functional when the system state x is in the set ω i x x k i t remark 1 compared with existing works tee and ge 2012 kim and yoo 2015 li et al 2016 k i t in 1 is a time varying function and denotes the greatest lower bound of constrained state x namely x k i t for t 0 given that initial value x 0 k i 0 the time varying constraint is more general and complicated than the time invariant constraint the time varying iblf based designed control algorithm has a wider application range theorem 1 the functional v i over the set ω i constructed in this paper satisfies 2 e 2 2 v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t proof first we prove that inequality e 2 2 v i is true we define the function as 3 g e 0 e σ σ x d 2 σ x d 2 k i 2 t d σ e 2 2 taking the partial derivative of 3 yields g e e k i 2 t x 2 k i 2 t then we have that g e 0 as e 0 g e 0 as e 0 over the set ω i and g e 0 as e 0 therefore we can infer that g e 0 always is true over the set ω i then we get e 2 2 v i second we indicate that v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t holds we define the function as 4 ϕ e x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t 0 e σ σ x d 2 σ x d 2 k i 2 t d σ calculating the partial derivative of 4 yields ϕ e e x 2 x 2 k i 2 t then we have that ϕ e 0 as e 0 ϕ e 0 as e 0 over the set ω i and ϕ e 0 as e 0 accordingly we can deduce that ϕ e 0 is always true over the set ω i then it is straightforward to obtain v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t this completes the proof of theorem 1 theorem 2 for any positive time varying function k i t we define χ x r x k i t r and n r l χ r l 1 as open sets consider the system 5 η h η t where η ω x t n and h r n r l 1 is piecewise continuous in t locally lipschitz in η and uniformly in t on r n suppose that functions u ω r l r and v x x χ r are positive definite and continuously differentiable in their respective domains such that 6 v x x a s x k i t 7 γ 1 ω u ω γ 2 ω where γ 1 and γ 2 are class k functions let v η v x x u ω with the initial value satisfying x 0 χ if the inequality 8 v v η h μ v λ where η n μ and λ are positive constants holds then ω is bounded and x t χ t 0 proof we can obtain that the maximal solution η t on the time interval t 0 τ max exists and is unique in view of the conditions on h in light of the initial condition x 0 χ we know that v x x 0 and v η 0 exist integrating both sides of 8 yields v η t v η 0 λ μ t 0 τ max in terms of v η v x x u ω and because v x x is a positive function we have that v x x is bounded as t 0 τ max based on the fact that v x x only if x k i t and boundedness of v x x we infer that x k i t as t 0 τ max accordingly there is a compact subset k n such that the maximal solution of 5 satisfies η t k as t 0 τ max however since the domain of the definition of η t is t 0 it is obvious that x t χ as t 0 the proof of theorem 2 is completed remark 2 theorems 1 2 proposed in this paper complete the stability analysis of the controller based on restructuring time varying iblf in addition the proof process of theorem 2 in this paper is similar to the proof process of lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 however there are differences between them lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 is utilized to analyze the system state x can be constrained to a range around zero for instance x k k 0 meanwhile theorem 2 is devoted to proving that the infimum of the system state x is never violated for example x k k 0 furthermore theorem 2 has a wide range of practical application values for example in the leader follower formation control for vessels theorem 2 can analyze and avoid collisions between the two vessels and in safety guaranteed hovercraft motion control theorem 2 can ensure that the greatest lower bound is never violated by the surge speed an enhanced time varying iblf which guarantees that the system states remain within a constraint range containing zero is constructed as 9 v r e x d k r t 0 e σ k r 2 t k r 2 t σ x d 2 d σ where e x x d denotes the tracking error and x d represents a continuously differentiable desired trajectory satisfying x d k r t with k r t being a time varying positive function and σ is the integration variable representing a measure for the tracking error we know that v r is a positive definite and continuously differentiable functional when the system state x is in the set ω r x x k r t lemma 1 kong et al 2019 the functional v r e x d k r t over the set ω r satisfies 10 e 2 2 v r e x d k r t k r 2 t e 2 k r 2 t x 2 the proof process of lemma 1 is similar to that of theorem 1 in this paper therefore it will not be covered here lemma 2 chen and ge 2013 for any unknown continuously nonlinear function f x r m r it can be approximated by the radial basis function nn over a compact set ω r m as 11 f x w t h x δ where x r m represents the input of the nn and w w 1 w n t r n represents the ideal weight vector the number of hidden nodes is n and δ denotes the ideal approximation error satisfying δ δ δ 0 the bounded ideal weight value w is given by 12 w arg min w ˆ sup x ω f x w ˆ t h x where w ˆ represents the estimation of w h x h 1 x h n x t ω r n with h i x being chosen as 13 h i x exp x μ i 2 η i 2 where μ i r m and η i r are the center and width of the radial basis function respectively 2 2 problem formulation a four degrees of freedom model of a hovercraft in the presence of unknown system uncertainties without considering the pitch and heave motion is described as follows fu et al 2019 14 x u cos ψ v sin ψ cos φ y u sin ψ v cos ψ cos φ φ p ψ r cos φ u v r f x d 0 m 0 f u τ u m 0 v u r f y d 0 m 0 f v p m x d 0 j x 0 f p r m z d 0 j z 0 f r τ r j z 0 where x y and φ ψ signify the positions and attitudes of the hovercraft in the earth fixed frame respectively the speeds and angular velocities are denoted by u v and p r respectively the mass and moment of inertia are represented by m 0 j x 0 j z 0 respectively and τ u τ r represent the control inputs the total drags of the known model are denoted by f x d 0 f y d 0 m x d 0 m z d 0 please refer to fu et al 2019 obtain details on the drags the model uncertainties are represented by f u f v f p f r remark 3 surface vessels are generally divided into two types underactuated and fully actuated in reyhanoglu 1997 jin 2016b a three degrees of freedom mathematical model for an underactuated autonomous surface vessel with two independent thrusters is established and in fossen and strand 1999 a three degrees of freedom mathematical model for a fully actuated vessel is established in vessel motion control these two typical mathematical models are used for both fully actuated vessels and underactuated vessels for a hovercraft the model is similar to that in reyhanoglu 1997 jin 2016b if only horizontal motion is considered however the hovercraft can be lifted up by a large enough air cushion force to run at high speed and roll motion always exists and increases as the turn rate increases the roll angle is important for safe hovercraft motion therefore the four degrees of freedom model including roll motion which is closer to the performance of an actual vessel than the three degrees of freedom model is established in this paper assumption 1 the initial values of the hovercraft state satisfy u 0 k i u t v 0 k r v t and r 0 k r r t the safety boundaries k i u t k r v t and k r r t will be specified later on assumption 2 the desired trajectories of the hovercraft states u v and r satisfy u d k i u t v d k r v t and r d k r r t respectively in this paper the control objective is to develop adaptive safety motion controllers for a hovercraft such that the states of the hovercraft converge to the desired targets with ideal accuracy while ensuring the safety constraint boundaries on the states u v r and the drift angle β are never violated fig 2 shows the block diagram of the overall control system the desired surge speed u d and sway speed v d are user set values and the desired yaw angular velocity r d is generated by the virtual sway controller 3 safety

employed 25 β max β β max β max arctan v u β max u t tan β max v u t tan β max where β m a x denotes the maximum safety boundary accordingly the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into one

where h v z v is the basis function z v u v r is the input of the nn and δ v is ideal estimation error that satisfies δ v δ v with δ v being a positive constant the adaptive updating law is designed

yields 48 0 v v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ then according to theorem 1 and lemma 1 we have 49 e u 2 2 0 e u β β u d 2 β u d 2 k i u 2 t d β v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ e i 2 2 0 e i β k r i 2 t k r i 2 t β i d 2 d β v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ 1 2 w j t γ j 1 w j v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ where i v r and j u v r let ξ v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ then we have that the tracking errors and the approximation errors satisfy e j 2 ξ and w j 2 ξ λ min γ j 1 respectively as we all know the tracking errors e j depend on the values of ρ and ε it is obvious that 2 ξ can be decreased by decreasing ε or increasing ρ therefore the tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately choosing design positive parameters k u k v k r σ j λ min γ j in light of the boundedness of v we know that there is a positive constant k l such that v k l furthermore we have v only if u k i u t or v k r v t or r k r r t according to the definition of the proposed iblf hence we know u k i u t v k r v t and r k r r t following assumption 1 theorem 2 proposed in this paper and lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 we can conclude that u k i u t v k r v t and r k r r t for t 0 according to k r v t u t tan β max inequality 25 and u t tan β max v u t tan β max is true then we have the drift angle satisfies β max β β max for t 0 this completes the proof of theorem 3 remark 7 compared with existing works in zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 xia et al 2019 zhang 2018 an enhanced time varying iblf is constructed to design the virtual sway control law and yaw control law in order to address the time varying constraints on system states v and r in this paper in particular a totally new time varying iblf is proposed to constrain the surge speed above the resistance hump speed to achieve better course stability the two iblfs are used to address the upper and lower bound constraints on state and the the greatest lower bound constraint on state respectively remark 8 in the previous work on hovercraft motion control in fu et al 2019 the drift angle was not safely constrained in this paper according to the definition of the drift angle β arctan v u we transform the constraint on the drift angle into one on the sway speed thereby the drift angle can be constrained indirectly by designing a virtual sway controller to constrain the sway speed this method to indirectly constrain the drift angle is unprecedented 4 simulation results in this section the effectiveness and universality of the proposed safety guaranteed motion control scheme are demonstrated on a hovercraft in this case the surge speed sway speed drift angle and yaw angular velocity are constrained the reader can refer to fu et al 2019 for more details on the hovercraft s main parameters used in the simulations the selection of the initial values satisfies assumption 1 as u 0 30 v 0 0 r 0 0 and β 0 0 the user defined control parameters k u 4 k v 8 8 and k r 80 represent the control gains of the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom respectively in addition the units of the speed attitude angle and angular velocity are kn deg and deg s in this paper respectively to verify the robustness of the proposed method the random noises randomly distributed in intervals 0 6 10 4 0 4 10 4 and 0 8 10 4 are introduced into the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom respectively since nn is used to approximate the model uncertainties f u f v and f r the hidden node numbers for w ˆ u t h u z u w ˆ v t h v z v and w ˆ r t h r z r are set to n 13 with centers of radial basis functions μ l 1 l 1 1 n μ l 2 l 2 1 n and μ l 3 l 3 1 n evenly spacing in 20 35 1 5 1 5 and 1 1 respectively the widths of radial basis functions are chosen as η l 1 2 η l 2 1 and η l 2 1 respectively the simulation study is divided into two cases to verify the feasibility and universality of the proposed method case 1 in the first case in order to prove the universality of the proposed method we set the constraints on the states to time invariant constants k i u 26 k r v 1 5 and k r r 1 it similar to previous works in li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 the desired surge and sway speed are u d 30 sin 0 04 t and v d sin 0 02 t respectively the control laws and the virtual sway control law are expressed as 50 τ u m 0 k u e u v r f x d 0 m 0 w ˆ u t h u u 2 k i u 2 t u 2 l u d u d δ u sgn e u 51 r d k v e v f y d 0 m 0 w ˆ v t h v k r v 2 t v 2 k r v 2 t l v d v d δ v

similar to previous works in li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 which can only deal with time invariant constraints on the states this scheme has limitations for the systems with time varying state constraints for this paper the above scheme cannot fulfil to constrain the drift angle case 1 aims at assessing the feasibility and universality of the scheme proposed in this paper the simulation results of case 1 are depicted in figs 3 6 it can be observed from figs 3 6 that the desired trajectories u d v d and r d can be tracked by the corresponding states of the hovercraft with ideal accuracy the surge speed can be constrained above the resistance hump speed and the sway speed and yaw angular velocity can be ensured to remain within the pre specified time invariant range containing zero the control inputs are shown in fig 6 the analysis of the simulation results for case 1 obviously shows that the proposed control scheme can be directly applied to a nonlinear system with the time invariant state constraints the results from the simulation study indicate that the proposed scheme is feasible and universal case 2 in the second case we will verify that the proposed scheme which addresses the practical safety navigation problems of a hovercraft is effective the desired trajectories u d and v d are same as case 1 and r d is given by 30 the resistance hump speed is set to k i u t 26 sin 0 04 t and the safety boundaries on states r and v are set to k r r t 0 2 u t 7 and k r v t u t tan β m a x respectively with β m a x 5 being the constraint boundary on the drift angle the safety boundaries k i u t k r r t and β m a x are designed following references hua 2008 gran et al 1982 the control laws are given by 22 32 and 41 the simulation results of case 2 are presented in figs 7 11 in fig 6 the lowest safety boundary k i u t on the surge speed is never violated therefore the better course stability can be obtained it can be observed from figs 8 9 that the transformed constraint k r v t u t tan β m a x related to the surge speed and the safety boundary β m a x of the drift angle is not violated by the sway speed and thus the drift angle is ensured to remain within the safety range β m a x β β m a x as well the yaw angular velocity tracking performance is plotted in fig 10 it is obvious that the yaw angular velocity can be constrained to the inside of the safety boundary k r r t 0 2 u t 0 7 related the surge speed in order to ensure a safe turning motion at the high speed accordingly when the yaw angular velocity and drift angle are constrained the roll angle will also remain within the safe range as well moreover all the tracking errors can converge to their desired values with ideal accuracy the control inputs are shown in fig 11 according to analysis of the simulation results we know that the proposed safety guaranteed motion controller is effective for a hovercraft with the complex safety constraint problems in addition according to the simulation results of cases 1 2 it can be seen that the proposed control method can still complete tracking control in the presence of external noises therefore the designed controller has strong robustness and insensitivity against external noise 5 conclusion driven by the practical requirements for an underactuated hovercraft to sail safely in the control process while being subjected to multiple constraints a safety guaranteed adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed for the hovercrafts motion control the proposed new time varying iblf technique successfully ensures that the surge speed is above the resistance hump speed the safety constraint boundaries on the sway speed and yaw angular velocity which are related to the surge speed are not violated at all times in addition the drift angle is indirectly constrained by constraining the sway speed simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed scheme in future work the proposed iblf may be further used in the leader follower formation control for autonomous surface vessels to confine the line of sight range and angle because the proposed iblf defined in 1 can deal with time varying constraints the constraint on the line of sight range can be predefined by a time varying function which depends on the relative speed of the leader and follower vessels namely the safety distance between two ships can be adjusted according to the relative sailing speed to avoid a collision between two vessels for the improved iblf defined in 9 it can be used to constrain the nonlinear system with time varying state constraints in addition the actuator saturation problem which may exist in the design of controllers using barrier lyapunov functions will be considered in future works credit authorship

21172,this paper develops a safety guaranteed adaptive neural motion controller for an underactuated hovercraft in the presence of multiple constraints and model uncertainties first a surge controller is designed based on a new improved integral barrier lyapunov function iblf to guarantee that the surge speed is above the resistance hump speed to achieve better course stability second the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into one on the sway speed and then the virtual sway controller is designed to constrain the sway speed for the purpose of confining the drift angle third a time varying iblf is constructed to constrain the yaw angular velocity to inside of safety boundary relating to the surge speed to ensure a safe turning motion at high speed neural networks nns are incorporated into each controller to handle the model uncertainties it is proved that all the tracking errors are ultimately uniformly bounded finally the results from numerous simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches keywords underactuated hovercraft safety constraint improved integral barrier lyapunov function motion control 1 introduction the underactuated hovercraft shown in fig 1 can be lifted up to run above the water surface using a large enough air cushion force to obtain unique amphibious performance compared with normal displacement vessels a hovercraft is faster because its hydrodynamic resistance is very small thus hovercrafts have attracted increasingly more attention in both civil and military fields due to special performances hua 2008 it should be noted that a hovercraft has poor course stability at low speed and it easily experiences drift and heeling motion during fast turning these situations create safety problems for a hovercraft s motion control according to the theoretical studies and the testing using prototype ships the course stability of a hovercraft is poor at the speed around or below the resistance hump speed hua 2008 after a detailed review of the motion control of the hovercraft we found that a constraint on the surge speed was not considered in shojaei 2015 shojaei 2014 rigatos and raffo 2015 morales et al 2015 sira ramirez 2002 fu et al 2019 therefore we should ensure the hovercraft s speed is above the resistance hump speed to achieve ideal course stability moreover it is easy for a large roll angle and drift angle to occur when a hovercraft is turning and the roll and drift motion become increasingly more violent as the yaw angular velocity increases as the roll angle and drift angle increase one side of hovercraft s skirt will contact with water which will reduce the transverse stability cohen et al 2001 in addition turning at high speed will result in the stern kickoff phenomenon and may even cause the hovercraft to capsize hua 2008 in conclusion the surge speed drift angle and yaw angular velocity must be effectively constrained to ensure the safe navigation of a hovercraft recently through the efforts of researchers various significant achievements to address the state constraints in nonlinear systems have been proposed in particular motivated by the idea of reconstructing a control lyapunov function barrier lyapunov functions blfs such as log type blfs tee et al 2009 tee and ge 2011 liu et al 2014 li et al 2018a an et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 and tan type blfs zheng et al 2018 ni et al 2018 have been proposed to realize the safety state and output constraints of nonlinear systems in zhao et al 2014 a symmetric log type blf is used to prevent violations of the time invariant multiple output constraints when a fully actuated marine surface vessel is tracking a desired trajectory a control strategy based on an asymmetric log type blf combined with an nn was proposed to ensure that a robotic system completed the tracking of the desired positions and velocities with an ideal accuracy while the full state constraints were never violated he et al 2016 in he et al 2017 a log type blf is utilized to address the time varying asymmetric output constraints of a marine surface vessel in the presence of uncertainties a tan type blf was proposed to guarantee that the output tracking errors exponentially converge into a small range around zero without violating the time varying constraints on the system states jin 2016a a time varying tan type blf introduced in jin 2016b was incorporated with a finite time control scheme to address the line of sight range and angle constraints for a group of underactuated autonomous surface vessels in leader follower formation control unfortunately the above log type and tan type blfs are just able to constrain the error signals and then they indirectly constrain the corresponding system states hence an additional mapping to the system state space is required considering the inadequacies of the log type and tan type blfs in constraining system states iblfs which can directly constrain the system states are proposed in tee and ge 2012 kim and yoo 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 liu et al 2018b in xia et al 2019 a novel iblf is used to develop a control scheme that provides enhanced system stability and guarantees output constraints the simulation results indicate that the proposed iblf control technique avoids the existing inadequacies of the log type and tan type blfs the state and input constraints of a strict feedback nonlinear tracking system are handled by introducing an iblf into backstepping procedure and extending the system input as a system state in zhang 2018 in tang et al 2016 an adaptive nn was combined with iblf to design a tracking controller for a class of perturbed uncertain nonlinear systems the proposal effectively ensures that time invariant constraint boundaries on system states are never violated in addition to the nns an adaptive fuzzy system was also incorporated into an iblf in kong et al 2019 an iblf based adaptive fuzzy control for coordinated multiple robots to handle a time varying constraint is proposed however unfortunately there is a partial derivative of the iblf in the designed control law and thus the control law cannot be applied directly to a practical system in addition the iblf was also introduced into sliding mode control for example in wang et al 2016 a control iblf is used to develop the reaching law such that the sliding mode can be reached within finite time in addition in qin 2020 an iblf based unit sliding mode controller is designed to ensure the boundedness of the iblf in the closed loop and obtain the global constraints of the system state variables however almost all the aforementioned iblfs are only used to deal with the time invariant constraints on system states among them the iblf technique used in kong et al 2019 only dealt with the time varying constraint and it did not obtain the concrete expression of the control law this paper will improve the existing iblf to address the time varying constraint furthermore a totally new iblf is proposed to ensure that the greatest lower bound of a hovercraft s surge speed is never violated therefore the proposed iblf has a wider application range since the constraints on the states are mostly time varying in practical control systems it is well known that adaptive control techniques are a powerful tool used to approximate nonlinear functions and achieve any accuracy in control and applications for nonlinear systems a variable structure adaptive control method for a linear time invariant system with additive and multiplicative unmodeled dynamics is designed and proposed in feng and wu 1996 in this paper the unknown terms were handled by designing parameter adaptive updating rules in eq 21 in tao and kokotovic 1993 a mathematical model of the backlash inverse was developed and a parametrization of the estimated error was given then a backlash inverse controller with a parameter adaptive adjustment scheme for unknown plants was applied to update the backlash inverse estimate and to stabilize the closed loop system in ge et al 2004 an adaptive neural controller for a strict feedback nonlinear system with unknown nonlinear functions with unknown signs is proposed in it the unknown function q 1 z 1 was arbitrarily approximated by a nn with any accuracy in yousef et al 2009 a fuzzy basis function approach based adaptive robust tracking control scheme for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems with mimo subsystems was proposed to adaptively compensate for disturbances and interconnections with unknown bounds in conclusion adaptive control means that the designed controller can effectively approximate and compensate for external disturbances model uncertainties and unknown system dynamics furthermore the controller makes the corresponding adjustments according to the designed adaptive updating rules in this paper an adaptive nn will be used to approximate the model uncertainties of the hovercraft motion model inspired by the abovementioned observations this paper perfects the time varying iblf technique given in kong et al 2019 to address the time varying safety constraints on the sway speed and yaw angular velocity in particular in order to address the safety constraints on the surge speed we restructure a totally new iblf to guarantee that the surge speed is always above the resistance hump speed accordingly the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 unlike the existing iblf based state constraint method in xia et al 2019 zhang 2018 kong et al 2019 in this study the surge speed is constrained above the resistance hump speed by restructuring a totally new iblf to obtain better course stability 2 the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into the constraint on the sway speed in this study then the constraint on the drift angle is indirectly fulfilled by ensuring that the constraint converted from the drift angle on the sway speed is never violated under the action of the virtual controller designed based on the time varying iblf 3 the yaw angular velocity is constrained to inside the safety boundary related to the surge speed to guarantee a safe turning motion at high speed and prevent dangerous navigation situations such as great heeling caused by the drift angle the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are introduced in section 2 the safety guaranteed adaptive motion control design for a hovercraft with multiple constraints and model uncertainties is proposed in section 3 the simulation results that demonstrate the feasibility and universality of the proposed control approach are given in section 4 the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 time varying integral barrier lyapunov function a totally new time varying iblf which guarantees the infimum of the system states is constructed

being a time varying positive function and σ is the integration variable representing a measure for the tracking error we know that v i is a positive definite and continuously differentiable functional when the system state x is in the set ω i x x k i t remark 1 compared with existing works tee and ge 2012 kim and yoo 2015 li et al 2016 k i t in 1 is a time varying function and denotes the greatest lower bound of constrained state x namely x k i t for t 0 given that initial value x 0 k i 0 the time varying constraint is more general and complicated than the time invariant constraint the time varying iblf based designed control algorithm has a wider application range theorem 1 the functional v i over the set ω i constructed in this paper satisfies 2 e 2 2 v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t proof first we prove that inequality e 2 2 v i is true we define the function as 3 g e 0 e σ σ x d 2 σ x d 2 k i 2 t d σ e 2 2 taking the partial derivative of 3 yields g e e k i 2 t x 2 k i 2 t then we have that g e 0 as e 0 g e 0 as e 0 over the set ω i and g e 0 as e 0 therefore we can infer that g e 0 always is true over the set ω i then we get e 2 2 v i second we indicate that v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t holds we define the function as 4 ϕ e x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t 0 e σ σ x d 2 σ x d 2 k i 2 t d σ calculating the partial derivative of 4 yields ϕ e e x 2 x 2 k i 2 t then we have that ϕ e 0 as e 0 ϕ e 0 as e 0 over the set ω i and ϕ e 0 as e 0 accordingly we can deduce that ϕ e 0 is always true over the set ω i then it is straightforward to obtain v i x 2 e 2 x 2 k i 2 t this completes the proof of theorem 1 theorem 2 for any positive time varying function k i t we define χ x r x k i t r and n r l χ r l 1 as open sets consider the system 5 η h η t where η ω x t n and h r n r l 1 is piecewise continuous in t locally lipschitz in η and uniformly in t on r n suppose that functions u ω r l r and v x x χ r are positive definite and continuously differentiable in their respective domains such that 6 v x x a s x k i t 7 γ 1 ω u ω γ 2 ω where γ 1 and γ 2 are class k functions let v η v x x u ω with the initial value satisfying x 0 χ if the inequality 8 v v η h μ v λ where η n μ and λ are positive constants holds then ω is bounded and x t χ t 0 proof we can obtain that the maximal solution η t on the time interval t 0 τ max exists and is unique in view of the conditions on h in light of the initial condition x 0 χ we know that v x x 0 and v η 0 exist integrating both sides of 8 yields v η t v η 0 λ μ t 0 τ max in terms of v η v x x u ω and because v x x is a positive function we have that v x x is bounded as t 0 τ max based on the fact that v x x only if x k i t and boundedness of v x x we infer that x k i t as t 0 τ max accordingly there is a compact subset k n such that the maximal solution of 5 satisfies η t k as t 0 τ max however since the domain of the definition of η t is t 0 it is obvious that x t χ as t 0 the proof of theorem 2 is completed remark 2 theorems 1 2 proposed in this paper complete the stability analysis of the controller based on restructuring time varying iblf in addition the proof process of theorem 2 in this paper is similar to the proof process of lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 however there are differences between them lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 is utilized to analyze the system state x can be constrained to a range around zero for instance x k k 0 meanwhile theorem 2 is devoted to proving that the infimum of the system state x is never violated for example x k k 0 furthermore theorem 2 has a wide range of practical application values for example in the leader follower formation control for vessels theorem 2 can analyze and avoid collisions between the two vessels and in safety guaranteed hovercraft motion control theorem 2 can ensure that the greatest lower bound is never violated by the surge speed an enhanced time varying iblf which guarantees that the system states remain within a constraint range containing zero is constructed as 9 v r e x d k r t 0 e σ k r 2 t k r 2 t σ x d 2 d σ where e x x d denotes the tracking error and x d represents a continuously differentiable desired trajectory satisfying x d k r t with k r t being a time varying positive function and σ is the integration variable representing a measure for the tracking error we know that v r is a positive definite and continuously differentiable functional when the system state x is in the set ω r x x k r t lemma 1 kong et al 2019 the functional v r e x d k r t over the set ω r satisfies 10 e 2 2 v r e x d k r t k r 2 t e 2 k r 2 t x 2 the proof process of lemma 1 is similar to that of theorem 1 in this paper therefore it will not be covered here lemma 2 chen and ge 2013 for any unknown continuously nonlinear function f x r m r it can be approximated by the radial basis function nn over a compact set ω r m as 11 f x w t h x δ where x r m represents the input of the nn and w w 1 w n t r n represents the ideal weight vector the number of hidden nodes is n and δ denotes the ideal approximation error satisfying δ δ δ 0 the bounded ideal weight value w is given by 12 w arg min w ˆ sup x ω f x w ˆ t h x where w ˆ represents the estimation of w h x h 1 x h n x t ω r n with h i x being chosen as 13 h i x exp x μ i 2 η i 2 where μ i r m and η i r are the center and width of the radial basis function respectively 2 2 problem formulation a four degrees of freedom model of a hovercraft in the presence of unknown system uncertainties without considering the pitch and heave motion is described as follows fu et al 2019 14 x u cos ψ v sin ψ cos φ y u sin ψ v cos ψ cos φ φ p ψ r cos φ u v r f x d 0 m 0 f u τ u m 0 v u r f y d 0 m 0 f v p m x d 0 j x 0 f p r m z d 0 j z 0 f r τ r j z 0 where x y and φ ψ signify the positions and attitudes of the hovercraft in the earth fixed frame respectively the speeds and angular velocities are denoted by u v and p r respectively the mass and moment of inertia are represented by m 0 j x 0 j z 0 respectively and τ u τ r represent the control inputs the total drags of the known model are denoted by f x d 0 f y d 0 m x d 0 m z d 0 please refer to fu et al 2019 obtain details on the drags the model uncertainties are represented by f u f v f p f r remark 3 surface vessels are generally divided into two types underactuated and fully actuated in reyhanoglu 1997 jin 2016b a three degrees of freedom mathematical model for an underactuated autonomous surface vessel with two independent thrusters is established and in fossen and strand 1999 a three degrees of freedom mathematical model for a fully actuated vessel is established in vessel motion control these two typical mathematical models are used for both fully actuated vessels and underactuated vessels for a hovercraft the model is similar to that in reyhanoglu 1997 jin 2016b if only horizontal motion is considered however the hovercraft can be lifted up by a large enough air cushion force to run at high speed and roll motion always exists and increases as the turn rate increases the roll angle is important for safe hovercraft motion therefore the four degrees of freedom model including roll motion which is closer to the performance of an actual vessel than the three degrees of freedom model is established in this paper assumption 1 the initial values of the hovercraft state satisfy u 0 k i u t v 0 k r v t and r 0 k r r t the safety boundaries k i u t k r v t and k r r t will be specified later on assumption 2 the desired trajectories of the hovercraft states u v and r satisfy u d k i u t v d k r v t and r d k r r t respectively in this paper the control objective is to develop adaptive safety motion controllers for a hovercraft such that the states of the hovercraft converge to the desired targets with ideal accuracy while ensuring the safety constraint boundaries on the states u v r and the drift angle β are never violated fig 2 shows the block diagram of the overall control system the desired surge speed u d and sway speed v d are user set values and the desired yaw angular velocity r d is generated by the virtual sway controller 3 safety guaranteed motion controller design 3 1 surge controller the surge speed tracking error and its derivative are given by 15 e u u u d e u v r f x d 0 m 0 f u τ u m 0 u d to sure that the surge speed is above the resistance hump speed namely u k i u t with k i u t being a time varying positive function a greatest lower bound guaranteed iblf is constructed for the first time as 16 v u 0 e u σ σ u d 2 σ u d 2 k i u 2 t d σ 1 2 w u t γ u 1 w u where w u w u w ˆ u denotes the estimation error with w ˆ u denoting estimated value of w u and γ u is a positive definite diagonal matrix the time derivative

u t h u z u δ u f u δ u where h u z u is the basis function z u u v r is the input of the nn and the adaptive law is designed as 21 w ˆ u γ u e u u 2 u 2 k i u 2 t h u z u σ u w ˆ u then according to the lyapunov direct method the surge control law is designed as 22 τ u m 0 k u e u v r f x d 0 m 0 w ˆ u t h u z u u 2 k i u 2 t u 2 l u d u d u 2 k i u 2 t u 2 l k u 1 l k u 2 l k u 3 k i u t δ u sgn

lim e u 0 l k u 1 2 k i u u d u d 2 k i u 2 lim e u 0 l k u 2 k i u u d u d 2 k i u 2 therefore τ u is well defined substituting 21 and 22 into 19 and considering theorem 1 we have 24 v u k u e u 2 u

3 2 virtual sway controller it is a challenge to ensure that the safety constraint condition on the drift angle β arctan v u is always satisfied to guarantee this the following transformations are employed 25 β max β β max β max arctan v u β max u t tan β max v u t tan β max where β m a x denotes the maximum safety boundary accordingly the constraint on the drift angle is transformed into one on the sway speed which relates to the surge speed let k r v t u t tan β max be the time varying constraint on the sway speed namely k r v t v k r v t we define the sway speed tracking error and take the derivative 26 e v v v d e v u r f y d 0 m 0 f v v d consider the following time varying iblf that addresses the model uncertainty f v 27 v v 0 e v σ k r v 2 t k r v 2 t σ v d 2 d σ 1 2 w v t γ v 1 w v where w v w v w ˆ v denotes the estimation error with w ˆ v denoting the estimated value of w v and γ v is a positive definite diagonal matrix substituting 26 into the derivative of v v yields 28 v v k r v 2 t e v k r v 2 t v 2 u r f y d 0 m 0 f v e v l v d v d e v l k v 1 l k v 2 l k v 3 k r v t w v t γ v 1 w ˆ v where 29 l v d k r v t 2 e v log k r v t e v v d k r v t v d k r v t e v v d k r

uncertainty f v in 28 is unknown the model based designed control law is not feasible thus the nn w ˆ v t h v z v is used to approximate w v t h v z v 30 w v t h v z v w ˆ v t h v z v δ v f v δ v where h v z v is the basis function z v u v r is the input of the nn and δ v is ideal estimation error that satisfies δ v δ v with δ v being a positive constant the adaptive updating law is designed as 31 w ˆ v γ v k r v 2 t e v k r v 2 t v 2 h v z v σ v w ˆ v then according to the lyapunov direct method and the backstepping method the virtual sway control law is designed as 32 r d k v e v f y d 0 m 0 w ˆ v t h v z v k r v 2 t v 2 k r v 2 t l v d v d k r v 2 t v 2 k r v 2 t l k v 1 l k v 2 l k v 3 k r v δ v sgn e v u where k v and σ v are positive constants and sgn is the signum function remark 5 in light of l h o ˆ pital s rule and v d k r v t in assumption 2 we have 33 lim e v 0 l v d k r v 2 t k r v 2 t v d 2 lim e v 0 l k v 1 2 k r v t v d k r v 2 t v d 2 lim e v 0 l k v 2 k r v t v d k r v 2 t v d 2 thus the virtual control law r d is well defined according to lemma 1 and substituting 31 and 32 into 28 we have 34 v v k v k r v 2 t e v 2 k r v 2 t v 2 k r v 2 t e v k r v 2 t v

and k r v 2 t e v k r v 2 t v 2 u e r will be stabilized in the subsection 3 3 the result in 34 will be utilized to complete the stability analysis of the controller in subsection 3 4 3 3 yaw controller to ensure that the hovercraft performs a safe turning motion at high speed we set the safety boundary on the yaw angular velocity to k r r t 0 2 u t 7 the safety boundary k r r t is related the surge speed and is similar to the constraint on the yaw angular velocity in gran et al 1982 differentiating e r along 14 we have 35 e r m z d 0 j z 0 f r τ r j z 0 r d the time varying iblf that addresses the model uncertainty is given by 36 v r 0 e r σ k r r 2 t k r r 2 t σ r d 2 d σ 1 2 w r t γ r 1 w r where w r w r w ˆ r denotes the estimation error with w ˆ r denoting estimated value of w

unknown the model based designed control law is not feasible thus the nn w ˆ r t h r z r is used to approximate w r t h r z r 39 w r t h r z r w ˆ r t h r z r δ r f r δ r where h r z r is the basis function z r u v r is the input of the nn and δ r is ideal estimation error that satisfies δ r δ r with δ r being a positive constant the adaptive updating law is designed as 40 w ˆ r γ r k r r 2 t e

yields 48 0 v v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ then according to theorem 1 and lemma 1 we have 49 e u 2 2 0 e u β β u d 2 β u d 2 k i u 2 t d β v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ e i 2 2 0 e i β k r i 2 t k r i 2 t β i d 2 d β v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ 1 2 w j t γ j 1 w j v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ where i v r and j u v r let ξ v 0 ε ρ e ρ t ε ρ then we have that the tracking errors and the approximation errors satisfy e j 2 ξ and w j 2 ξ λ min γ j 1 respectively as we all know the tracking errors e j depend on the values of ρ and ε it is obvious that 2 ξ can be decreased by decreasing ε or increasing ρ therefore the tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately choosing design positive parameters k u k v k r σ j λ min γ j in light of the boundedness of v we know that there is a positive constant k l such that v k l furthermore we have v only if u k i u t or v k r v t or r k r r t according to the definition of the proposed iblf hence we know u k i u t v k r v t and r k r r t following assumption 1 theorem 2 proposed in this paper and lemma 3 in tang et al 2016 we can conclude that u k i u t v k r v t and r k r r t for t 0 according to k r v t u t tan β max inequality 25 and u t tan β max v u t tan β max is true then we have the drift angle satisfies β max β β max for t 0 this completes the proof of theorem 3 remark 7 compared with existing works in zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 xia et al 2019 zhang 2018 an enhanced time varying iblf is constructed to design the virtual sway control law and yaw control law in order to address the time varying constraints on system states v and r in this paper in particular a totally new time varying iblf is proposed to constrain the surge speed above the resistance hump speed to achieve better course stability the two iblfs are used to address the upper and lower bound constraints on state and the the greatest lower bound constraint on state respectively remark 8 in the previous work on hovercraft motion control in fu et al 2019 the drift angle was not safely constrained in this paper according to the definition of the drift angle β arctan v u we transform the constraint on the drift angle into one on the sway speed thereby the drift angle can be constrained indirectly by designing a virtual sway controller to constrain the sway speed this method to indirectly constrain the drift angle is unprecedented 4 simulation results in this section the effectiveness and universality of the proposed safety guaranteed motion control scheme are demonstrated on a hovercraft in this case the surge speed sway speed drift angle and yaw angular velocity are constrained the reader can refer to fu et al 2019 for more details on the hovercraft s main parameters used in the simulations the selection of the initial values satisfies assumption 1 as u 0 30 v 0 0 r 0 0 and β 0 0 the user defined control parameters k u 4 k v 8 8 and k r 80 represent the control gains of the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom respectively in addition the units of the speed attitude angle and angular velocity are kn deg and deg s in this paper respectively to verify the robustness of the proposed method the random noises randomly distributed in intervals 0 6 10 4 0 4 10 4 and 0 8 10 4 are introduced into the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom respectively since nn is used to approximate the model uncertainties f u f v and f r the hidden node numbers for w ˆ u t h u z u w ˆ v t h v z v and w ˆ r t h r z r are set to n 13 with centers of radial basis functions μ l 1 l 1 1 n μ l 2 l 2 1 n and μ l 3 l 3 1 n evenly spacing in 20 35 1 5 1 5 and 1 1 respectively the widths of radial basis functions are chosen as η l 1 2 η l 2 1 and η l 2 1 respectively the simulation study is divided into two cases to verify the feasibility and universality of the proposed method case 1 in the first case in order to prove the universality of the proposed method we set the constraints on the states to time invariant constants k i u 26 k r v 1 5 and k r r 1 it similar to previous works in li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 the desired surge and sway speed are u d 30 sin 0 04 t and v d sin 0 02 t respectively the control laws and the virtual sway control law are expressed as 50 τ u m 0 k u e u v r f x d 0 m 0 w ˆ u t h u u 2 k i u 2 t u 2 l u d u d δ u sgn e u 51 r d k v e v f y d 0 m 0 w ˆ v t h v k r v 2 t v 2 k r v 2 t l v d v d δ v

similar to previous works in li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 which can only deal with time invariant constraints on the states this scheme has limitations for the systems with time varying state constraints for this paper the above scheme cannot fulfil to constrain the drift angle case 1 aims at assessing the feasibility and universality of the scheme proposed in this paper the simulation results of case 1 are depicted in figs 3 6 it can be observed from figs 3 6 that the desired trajectories u d v d and r d can be tracked by the corresponding states of the hovercraft with ideal accuracy the surge speed can be constrained above the resistance hump speed and the sway speed and yaw angular velocity can be ensured to remain within the pre specified time invariant range containing zero the control inputs are shown in fig 6 the analysis of the simulation results for case 1 obviously shows that the proposed control scheme can be directly applied to a nonlinear system with the time invariant state constraints the results from the simulation study indicate that the proposed scheme is feasible and universal case 2 in the second case we will verify that the proposed scheme which addresses the practical safety navigation problems of a hovercraft is effective the desired trajectories u d and v d are same as case 1 and r d is given by 30 the resistance hump speed is set to k i u t 26 sin 0 04 t and the safety boundaries on states r and v are set to k r r t 0 2 u t 7 and k r v t u t tan β m a x respectively with β m a x 5 being the constraint boundary on the drift angle the safety boundaries k i u t k r r t and β m a x are designed following references hua 2008 gran et al 1982 the control laws are given by 22 32 and 41 the simulation results of case 2 are presented in figs 7 11 in fig 6 the lowest safety boundary k i u t on the surge speed is never violated therefore the better course stability can be obtained it can be observed from figs 8 9 that the transformed constraint k r v t u t tan β m a x related to the surge speed and the safety boundary β m a x of the drift angle is not violated by the sway speed and thus the drift angle is ensured to remain within the safety range β m a x β β m a x as well the yaw angular velocity tracking performance is plotted in fig 10 it is obvious that the yaw angular velocity can be constrained to the inside of the safety boundary k r r t 0 2 u t 0 7 related the surge speed in order to ensure a safe turning motion at the high speed accordingly when the yaw angular velocity and drift angle are constrained the roll angle will also remain within the safe range as well moreover all the tracking errors can converge to their desired values with ideal accuracy the control inputs are shown in fig 11 according to analysis of the simulation results we know that the proposed safety guaranteed motion controller is effective for a hovercraft with the complex safety constraint problems in addition according to the simulation results of cases 1 2 it can be seen that the proposed control method can still complete tracking control in the presence of external noises therefore the designed controller has strong robustness and insensitivity against external noise 5 conclusion driven by the practical requirements for an underactuated hovercraft to sail safely in the control process while being subjected to multiple constraints a safety guaranteed adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed for the hovercrafts motion control the proposed new time varying iblf technique successfully ensures that the surge speed is above the resistance hump speed the safety constraint boundaries on the sway speed and yaw angular velocity which are related to the surge speed are not violated at all times in addition the drift angle is indirectly constrained by constraining the sway speed simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed scheme in future work the proposed iblf may be further used in the leader follower formation control for autonomous surface vessels to confine the line of sight range and angle because the proposed iblf defined in 1 can deal with time varying constraints the constraint on the line of sight range can be predefined by a time varying function which depends on the relative speed of the leader and follower vessels namely the safety distance between two ships can be adjusted according to the relative sailing speed to avoid a collision between two vessels for the improved iblf defined in 9 it can be used to constrain the nonlinear system with time varying state constraints in addition the actuator saturation problem which may exist in the design of controllers using barrier lyapunov functions will be considered in future works credit authorship

average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller decreases by 47 53 the optimization mechanism is that the rotor stator interaction and gas liquid interaction are suppressed in optimization pump with optimal velocity moment distribution keywords multiphase pump design method controllable velocity moment pressure fluctuation suppression optimization 1 introduction with the fast rise of energy demand enhancing production efficiency and reducing environmental pollution have become the most important issue for energy extraction the offshore oil and gas resources account for about 1 3 of the total quantity on the earth but only 15 of crude oil is produced due to the technical limitation oil gas mixture transportation is the crucial technology of crude petroleum and natural gas industry compared with the traditional crude platform the mixture transportation technology is more economic environmental and efficient the core equipment for mixture transporting is the multiphase pump which can be classified into two major categories including the volume delivery pump and rotodynamic pump rabiger et al 2008 falcimagne et al 2002 for the volume delivery pump the reciprocating multiphase pump is widely used and has the advantage of good internal compression high efficiency and anti gas resistance which has greatly improved the oil and gas production however its working flow rate and boosting capability are limited by size deng et al 2018a 2018b 2018c for the rotodynamic multiphase pump it is first proposed by institut francais du petrole ifp dal porto and larson 1997 which has become the research hotspot because of its advantages of compact structure wide range of operating conditions and good abrasion resistance liu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a conducted visualization experiment on internal flow pattern of a three stage rotodynamic multiphase pump results showed that with increasing of igvf isolated bubbles flow bubbly flow gas pocket flow and segregated gas flow could be recognized in the impeller liu et al 2018b numerically investigated interphase forces of two phase flow in impeller and diffuser and found that the dominant order of interphase forces was drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force and the wall lubrication force can be negligible a numerical method which considered the four major interphase forces presented better predictive accuracy zhang et al 2019a applied a non uniform bubble model in a multiphase pump where the effect of bubby coalescence and break up on the flow filed was considered shi et al 2020a studied the flow characteristics and evolution of tip leakage vortex in a multiphase pump and found that the trajectory of tip leakage vortex was distributed in a wavy shape and significantly affected by igvf shi et al 2020b there are lots of factors that influence the efficient and stable operation of the multiphase pump such as complicated vortex structure liu et al 2019 leakage flow zhang et al 2019b gas pocket zhang et al 2016b and phase interaction zhang et al 2018a many scholars have focused on energy performance improvement for multiphase pump hu et al 2015 suh et al 2017 kim et al 2015 analyzed the influence of various design parameters on multiphase pump and established the response surface between chosen parameters and performance to improve the pump efficiency by 3 5 cao et al 2005 introduced an inverse design method for multiphase pump in which the two phase flow was supposed homogeneous and the flow net was solved by the quasi three dimensional method to improve the compatibility between stages of multiphase pump liu et al 2020a developed an oseen vortex model to predict the velocity distribution between diffuser and next impeller in this way the blade angle of next impeller could be calculated according to the actual flow and the pump efficiency can be further improved zhang et al 2011 took the numerical results as training samples to develop a performance prediction model of multiphase pump through back propagation bp neural network based on the predicted results the nsga ii multi objective genetic algorithm was applied to obtain an optimal impeller with increase of efficiency by 3 the operation stability is equally important for a multiphase pump especially at high igvf where the gas phase and liquid phase strongly interact the vortex induced by leakage flow will develop at the blade suction side and further influence the pressure fluctuation in the multiphase pump impeller zhang and tan 2018 experimental results showed that the bubbles gathered in local area and blocked the impeller which led to complicated pressure fluctuation frequencies and sharply rise of amplitude severer instability was observed in a multi stage multiphase pump because the unstable flow at the previous stage would transfer to the next stage and resulted in pressure fluctuation aggravation xu et al 2019 the flow instability can reduce the pump service life and further destroy pipe and equipment downstream however rare investigation has been conducted on the suppression of pressure fluctuation for a multiphase pump till now the design method of prescribed velocity moment was originally applicated by hawthrone et al hawthorne et al 1984 for the design of two dimensional cascade with infinitely thin blade tan et al 1984 further developed this method for design of three dimensional blade profile then zangeneh 1991 described a fully three dimensional design method for radial and mixed flow turbomachines by specifying the velocity moment on the meridional line in the present work a design method by controlling the velocity moment is firstly proposed and then parameter optimization is conducted to suppress the pressure fluctuation for a multiphase pump under single phase and two phase conditions 2 design and optimization methods the distribution of velocity moment directly affects the pump energy and operation performances firstly the blade design method on basis of controllable velocity moment is proposed and the regions of main parameters are analyzed to satisfy the design requirement then the optimal values of main parameters are determined to suppress the pressure fluctuation 2 1 design method of controllable velocity moment in the present work a design method of controllable velocity moment in combination of singularity method is proposed in this method there are three assumptions as follows 1 the flow is potential inviscid and incompressible 2 the blade thickness is regarded as infinitely thin 3 the radial velocity is 0 in the singularity method a series of bound vortices is set along the foil camber line to represent the effect of foil on flow so the complicated flow can be calculated by simplified bound vortices as shown in fig 1 the circulation density σ of distributed vortices is defined as follows 1 σ s lim δ s 0 δ γ δ s d γ d s where γ denotes circulation and s is the length along the camber line in annular cascades the circulation density in a flow passage can be represented as follows 2 σ d γ d s δ α n 2 π b where the function δ in eq 2 is dirac delta function and it is expressed mathematically as follows 3 δ x 0 x 0 4 δ x d x 1 b is the blade number and n is zero or integer α represents the angle position as follows 5 α θ ϕ r z n 2 π b where θ is the angular position of cylindrical coordinate and ϕ r z is the wrap angle r and z is the radial and axial locations in cylindrical coordinate system respectively eq 2 shows that the circulation density is non zero only when it is located on the blade surface the circulation of each circumferential vortex is 6 γ 2 π r c u b where the superscript defines a circumferential mean and c u is the circumferential velocity therefore the circulation density can be written as follows 7 σ d 2 π r c u b d s δ α n 2 π b with eq 7 the vorticity can be obtained as follow 8 ω 2 π r c u b δ α n 2 π b α where α refers to blade surface and α denotes a unit vector which is perpendicular to the blade surface according to kutta joukowski theorem the relation between lift and circulation can be written as follows 9 ρ c b l ω p p α δ α n 2 π b where ρ is the fluid density c bl is the average velocity on blade surface and it can be calculated by c bl c c 2 the superscript and denotes the blade pressure side and suction side respectively and eq 9 can be further developed with dot product a vector of α as follows 10 ρ c b l ω α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b the left hand side of eq 10 can be transformed into as follows 11 ρ c b l ω α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b with eq 8 the equation can be obtained as follows 12 ρ c b l 2 π r c u b δ α n 2 π b α α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b and above equation can be simplified as follows 13 p p 2 π b ρ c b l r c u in cylindrical coordinates c b l r c u can be written as follows 14 c b l r c u c z b l c u r z c r b l c u r r c θ b l c u r θ the right third term of eq 14 is zero because of circumferential mean of c u so eq 13 may be restricted on meridian plane now the expression of blade pressure load is obtained as follows 15 p p 2 π b ρ c b l r c u m under the hypotheses of infinite blade number the wrap angle of blades is given as follows 16 ϕ 0 l m ω r 2 c u r c m r 2 d m where l m denotes the length of meridional streamline in the blade zone ω is angular velocity which is the given design parameter when the distribution of velocity moment c u r is given the blade pressure load and blade warp angle can be determined by eq 15 and eq 16 and then the blade shape can be calculated by x rcosϕ y rsinϕ and z z 2 2 parametrization of velocity moment distribution in the proposed design method a normalized fourth order polynomial function is applied to control velocity moment distribution along the meridional streamline as follows 17 c u r c u 1 r 1 f x c u 2 r 2 c u 1 r 1 18 f x a x 4 b x 3 c x 2 d x e where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote leading edge and trailing edge x denotes relative length of the meridional streamline in the blade zone and is restricted in 0 1 a b c d e are coefficients and are determined by following five conditions 1 the velocity moment at leading edge is c u r x 0 c u 1 r 1 corresponding to f 0 0 2 the velocity moment at trailing edge is c u r x 1 c u 2 r 2 corresponding to f 1 1 3 at the leading edge it is given as d f d x x 0 k where k is a constant 4 at the trailing edge the flow satisfies kutta joukowsky condition the blade pressure load is zero corresponding to d f d x x 1 0 5 the f x at middle point of relative meridional streamline x 0 5 is given as p based on above five conditions the five coefficients can be obtained as follow 19 a 16 p 2 k 8 b 5 k 32 p 14 c 16 p 4 k 5 d k e 0 2 3 discussion of value range for p and k in section 2 2 a normalized fourth order polynomial function is applied to control velocity moment distribution pattern along any meridional streamline the five coefficients can be calculated by eq 19 in order to determine the value range for p and k the following conditions are considered 1 in the blade zone the blades work on the fluid thus the blade pressure load is greater than zero corresponding to d f d x x 0 1 0 2 according to previous design experience zangeneh 1991 the middle part of the blades should have better working ability than trailing edge and leading edge for the purpose of satisfactory performance therefore r c u m could be given as a convex function namely d 3 f d x 3 x 0 1 0 considering condition 1 the following value range can be obtained 20 k 0 x 0 p k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 x 0 0 5 k 6 x 0 5 p k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 x 0 5 1 and considering condition 2 the following value range can be obtained 21 p k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 x 0 0 5 k 2 x 0 5 p k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 x 0 5 1 with eq 20 and eq 21 the constant k has a value range of 0 2 the value range is further narrowed down to 1 3 2 because of insufficient pressurization of impeller at pump inlet in order to solve the value range of p assign 22 g 1 x k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 23 g 2 x k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 the maximum and minimum value of g 1 x and g 2 x could be solved with preset k in the range of 0 2 assign 24 r 1 max g 1 x x 0 0 5 r 2 min g 1 x x 0 5 1 25 r 3 max g 2 x x 0 0 5 r 4 min g 2 x x 0 5 1 thus the value range of p is max r 3 r 1 min r 4 r 2 because the value range of p varies with the value of k the relative values a 1 and a 2 are defined as follows to facilitate discussion 26 a 1 k k min k max k min 27 a 2 p p min p max p min it can be concluded that the value ranges of a 1 and a 2 remain 0 1 3 physical model and numerical method 3 1 physical model in order to validate the optimization method a single stage multiphase pump is selected as the baseline model by referring to kim kim et al 2015 the design parameters and major geometry parameters are shown in table 1 the meridional section of the pump is shown in fig 2 3 2 numerical method the computational domain consists of inlet pipe impeller diffuser and outlet pipe in turn as shown in fig 3 the hexahedron structural mesh of inlet pipe and outlet pipe are generated by ansys icem 17 0 and the hexahedron structural mesh of impeller and diffuser are generated by ansys turbogrid 17 0 which is specially designed for mesh of turbomachinery in order to improve the mesh quality the o block topology is applied around blade surface and local refinement is used on wall surfaces as shown in fig 4 in present research the computation fluid dynamics software ansys cfx 17 0 is applied to simulate the three dimensional turbulent flow inside the multiphase pump the navier stokes equations with the shear stress transport sst model is chosen to solve the steady and transient flows under different igvf which has been proven to be effective in the previous literatures the inhomogeneous eulerian eulerian model is chosen for the two phase flow calculations which has been proved to be effective suh et al 2018 in eulerian eulerian model the liquid phase is considered as a continuous fluid and the gas phase is considered as a dispersed fluid the governing equations of the liquid phase and the gas phases are solved respectively on basis of the physical procedure and experimental visualization of flow inside multiphase pump the eulerian eulerian multiphase model is suitable in the present numerical simulation according to the literature drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force are considered in the phase interaction model zhang et al 2018b the boundary conditions include static pressure inlet and given mass flow rate at outlet the physical walls are taken as no slip walls the interfaces between the rotational and stationary parts are set by frozen rotor and transient rotor stator methods for steady and unsteady simulations respectively liu et al 2020b han and tan 2020 liu and tan 2020 for steady simulation it is stated to be convergence when the value of root mean square is below 10 5 for unsteady simulation the result of steady simulation is taken as the initial value in order to improve the accuracy of unsteady calculation 3 3 mesh independence test the mesh quantity has a significant influence on the simulated results in order to validate the independence of mesh quantity 5 sets of meshes with total elements from 876 082 to 4 654 173 are used fig 5 shows the influence of mesh quantity on the external characteristics the nominal head h n of the multiphase pump is defined as 28 h n p 2 p 1 ρ m u l t i g 29 ρ m i g v f ρ g 1 i g v f ρ l where p 1 is the pressure at pump inlet and p 2 is the pressure at pump outlet ρ m ρ g and ρ l denote the density of multiphase gas and liquid respectively the efficiency is calculated by 30 η h n h t 31 h t m ω ρ m q g where m is the torque ω is the rotational speed and q is the flow rate as shown in fig 5 the calculated results change with the increasing of mesh quantity however when exceeds 3 500 000 the results show only a slight difference for saving time and computational resources mesh 4 with total 3 494 153 elements is selected 3 4 monitor points setting during the working process of multiphase pump the pressure sides of blades suffer the highest pressure in order to collect the pressure data of multiphase pump five monitor points at blade pressure side with equal streamline distance are set in impeller and five monitor points at blade pressure side with equal streamline distance are set in diffuser as shown in fig 6 3 5 time step independence test time step is important in unsteady simulation in present research time step δ t 4 3403 10 5 s 8 6806 10 5 s and 1 7361 10 4 s which respond to 1 96 1 192 and 1 384 of an impeller revolution period t i are employed for time step independence test fig 7 shows the time histories of pressure on dps2 dps3 and dps4 which are located at blade pressure side in diffuser the difference among the pressure curves is tiny which indicates that the influence of time step can be negligible therefore the time step of 8 6806 10 5 is chosen for transient calculation 3 6 validation of simulation in order to validate the numerical method the simulation results are compared with the experimental results which come from literature kim et al 2015 as shown in fig 8 the simulation results agree well with the experimental results under different flow rate and different igvf which demonstrates that the numerical method is reliable 3 7 validation of design method in order to validate the design method of controllable velocity moment five monitoring curves are set at different blade heights span 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 in design process the parameters are set as a 1h 0 25 a 2h 1 0 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 25 for the velocity moment distribution and the corresponding rc u is shown in fig 9 a fig 9b shows the numerically simulated distribution of blade load which matches well with the distribution of rc u the difference between the given distribution of velocity moment and calculated distribution of blade load can be ascribed to two aspects the first reason is that the flow is supposed as inviscid in the design method while in the three dimensional numerical simulation the fluid is viscid the second reason is that the blade thickness is supposed as infinite thin in design process while in the three dimensional numerical simulation the blade is thickened and the blade edge is rounded therefore the proposed design method can effectively control the velocity moment and can be used in the following optimization work 4 optimization results 4 1 orthogonal table based on above analysis overall four parameters need to be determined including a 1h a 2h a 1s and a 2s where the subscripts h and s denote the distribution at hub and shroud when the values a 1h a 2h a 1s and a 2s are given the blade velocity moment distributions near hub and shroud can be uniquely determined and the blade angles between hub and shroud are determined by linear interpolation an orthogonal table with four factors and five levels for each factor is established and denoted as l25 54 in the orthogonal method only 25 individual tests are required to cover the five factors and four corresponding factor levels which is remarkably less than original individual tests of 54 625 the factor levels cover the entire value as shown in table 2 according to the principle of orthogonality the l25 54 orthogonal table is designed as table 3 4 2 orthogonal analysis for energy performance in present orthogonal analysis the major objective is to ensure that nominal head of the impellers meet the design nominal head of 23 45 m then the suppression of pressure fluctuation can be conducted on the premise that the impeller meets the design requirements the total 25 cases are set with different impeller but the same inlet pipe diffuser and outlet pipe fig 10 shows the main effects of chosen factors on the nominal head under single phase and multi phase flow conditions the main effect of each factor on the nominal head is calculated as follows 32 h i 1 n j 1 n h n j where subscript i denotes the specific level of the factor n is the total number of tested cases with the factor at level i h n is the predicted nominal head of tested impeller with corresponding factor at corresponding level i according to the analysis results shown in fig 10 the design parameters of the impeller with minimal h n under igvf 0 and igvf 10 are both a 1h 0 a 2h 0 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 with the design parameters the impeller has a nominal head of 23 60 m under igvf 0 and 23 56 m under igvf 10 which meet the design requirement of 23 45 m therefore it can be concluded that the impellers in the chosen orthogonal optimization interval satisfy the design requirement 4 3 suppression of pressure fluctuation under single phase condition fig 11 shows the frequency spectra of pressure fluctuation in impeller and diffuser under single phase condition at rated flow for baseline pump in impeller the dominant frequency at different blade regions ips1 ips5 is 660 hz which is the blade passing frequency of diffuser in diffuser the dominant frequency at different blade regions dps1 dps5 is 180 hz which is the blade passing frequency of impeller the above results demonstrate that the main induction factor of the pressure fluctuation in multiphase pump is rotor stator interaction under single phase condition the maximum amplitude of pressure fluctuation occurs at ips5 and dps1 which are close to the rotor stator interface because the amplitude of dominant frequency at ips5 is much larger than other locations in impeller it is chosen as the optimal objective under single phase condition fig 12 shows the main effects of chosen factors on amplitude of dominant frequency at ips5 compared to other factors a 2s show the most significant effect on amplitude while a 1s is the least important parameter under single phase the impeller of optimization pump i can be obtained with a 1h 0 25 a 2h 0 25 a 1s 0 75and a 2s 0 25 the nominal head of optimization impeller is 25 81 m which improves by 5 1 compared to the baseline impeller the performance of the whole stage shows pressure rise of 211 9 kpa with an increase of 11 9 kpa and hydraulic efficiency of 70 62 with an increase of 3 6 fig 13 shows the comparison of amplitudes of dominant frequency between baseline and optimization pump i in impeller the amplitudes of optimization pump i are slightly higher than that of baseline pump at ips1 ips3 while the amplitudes near the leading edge of the blade ips4 ips5 are lower than that of baseline pump for optimization pump i the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency in impeller is 1236 9pa which decreases by 23 1 compared with baseline pump in diffuser the amplitudes of dominant frequency of optimization pump i are overall lower than that of baseline pump and the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency of optimization pump i is 13 588 5pa which decreases by 6 2 compared with baseline pump the above results demonstrate that the rotor stator interaction is suppressed in optimization pump i according to the blade angle distribution of baseline pump the dimensionless distribution function of blade pressure load r c u m c u 2 r 2 c u 1 r 1 could be solved directly fig 14 shows the comparison of dimensionless distribution function of blade pressure load between baseline impeller and optimization impeller the baseline impeller has the higher pressure load at leading edge the pressure load decreases sharply from the leading edge and then change slowly until outlet it is non zero at the trailing edge and the distribution function appears concave function therefore the working capacity of baseline impeller concentrate on the second half of the blade as for the optimization impeller the pressure load decreases steadily from the leading edge and reaches zero at the outlet the distribution function appears convex function the distribution pattern ensure that the working capacity of the whole blade is uniformly distributed based on above analysis the difference of pressure fluctuation between baseline pump and optimization pump i which is shown in fig 13 can be explain due to the different working capacity of blade the optimization impeller appears stronger pressure fluctuation in first half of blade but weaker in second half of blade and because the pressure on the second half of the blade is generally higher than the first half of the blade the uniform pressure load distribution pattern can reduce the pressure fluctuation without affecting energy performance furthermore the zero pressure load at leading edge causes more uniform outflow in impeller which weakens the rotor stator interaction and suppress the overall pressure fluctuation in diffuser 4 4 suppression of pressure fluctuation under two phase condition the pressure fluctuation under two phase condition is more complicated fig 15 shows the frequency spectra of pressure fluctuation in impeller and diffuser under igvf 10 at rated flow for baseline pump in impeller the dominant frequency of ips1 ips4 is 704 hz while the dominant frequency of ips5 is still 660 hz in diffuser the dominant frequency of dps1 dps3 is still 180 hz while the dominant frequency of dps4 dps5 is 89 hz the broadband component of pressure fluctuation increases both in impeller and diffuser due to influence of the unsteady two phase flow in order investigate the induction factors of pressure fluctuation under two phase condition the pressure fluctuation and gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity are defined as liu and tan 2018 33 i p 1 n i 1 n p i p 2 34 i g 1 n i 1 n g v f i g v f 2 where n is the sample number of last 8 revolutions p i is the pressure at each time step and p is the arithmetic average of pressure g v f i is the gas volume fraction at each time step and g v f is the arithmetic average of gas volume fraction fig 16 shows gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity and pressure fluctuation intensity on the blade pressure side of baseline impeller a strip shaped narrow region with high i g can be observed near the leading edge in fig 16a by contrast a strip shaped narrow region with high i p can also be observed at nearly the same location with the same area in fig 16b the great matching performance between these two figures indicates that the strong pressure fluctuation near the leading edge is induced by gas liquid interaction therefore the impeller is separated into two regions when two phase flow is applied for baseline impeller the first half of the impeller is defined as transition region in transition region the two phase flow is transformed from homogeneous flow into stratified flow under the effect of strong centrifugal force the flow is extremely unsteady and the gas liquid interaction is the main induction factor of pressure fluctuation the second half of the impeller is defined as the fully development region in this region the gas phase flow mainly around the hub while liquid phase flow near the shroud the flow is relatively steady and the rotor stator is the main induction factor of pressure fluctuation based on above analysis the overall average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller is selected as the goal of optimizing under two phase condition and defined as follows 35 i p i p 1 i p 2 i p 3 i p 4 i p 5 5 where i p1 i p2 i p3 i p4 and i p5 denote the pressure fluctuation intensity of ips1 ips5 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of baseline impeller is 2529pa fig 17 shows the main effects of chosen factors on average pressure fluctuation intensity in impeller the magnitude of influence for average pressure fluctuation intensity can be sorted by a 1s a 2s a 2h a 1h as shown in fig 17 the impeller of optimization pump ii can be obtained with the setting of a 1h 0 a 2h 0 25 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 25 under two phase condition numerical result shows that the optimization impeller has a nominal head of 25 35 m under igvf 10 which increases by 7 6 compared to the baseline impeller the performance of whole stage shows a pressure rise of 186 0 kpa and efficiency of 70 02 with an increase of pressure rise of 7 6 kpa and an increase of efficiency of 4 51 fig 18 shows the comparison of pressure fluctuation intensity between baseline and optimization pump ii as shown in fig 18a the pressure fluctuation intensity at impeller significantly decreases especially at the first half of impeller ips1 ips2 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of optimization impeller is 1327pa which drops by 47 53 compared to the baseline impeller the pressure fluctuation in diffuser is also suppressed as shown in fig 18b in diffuser the overall pressure fluctuation intensity of optimization pump ii is lower than baseline pump the pressure intensity of monitor point dps4 is 2422 pa after optimization which decreases 5538pa compared to the baseline pump above results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of proposed method fig 19 shows gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity and pressure fluctuation intensity on the blade pressure side after optimization compared to fig 16a the strip shaped narrow region with high i g disappear in fig 19a as a result the local high pressure fluctuation intensity near the leading edge is suppressed as shown in fig 19b the overall gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity in impeller is much lower after optimization which means the two phase flow is steady and the gas liquid interaction is weaken therefore the pressure fluctuation is mainly induced by rotor stator interaction in optimization impeller and the intensity increases gradually from the leading edge to the trailing edge fig 20 shows the iso surface of 50 gas volume fraction in baseline impeller and optimization impeller as mentioned above in fully development region the two phase flow is steady and the pressure fluctuation is relatively low the fully development region is characterized by steady gas phase flow around the hub as shown in fig 20 the fully development region of baseline impeller is formed at the middle part while the fully development region of optimization impeller is formed at the front part it can be concluded that since the different spans have the same dimensionless velocity moment distribution the blade shape changes smoothly from hub to shroud therefore the fully development region is easier to form and the transition region with strong gas liquid interaction is almost eliminated in optimization pump ii as a result the pressure fluctuation intensity at the first half ips1 ips2 of optimization impeller is much lower than that of baseline impeller 5 conclusions in the present work a design method of controllable velocity moment in combination of singularity method is proposed and it is combined with the orthogonal optimization method to suppress the pressure fluctuation in a multiphase pump according to the optimization and analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a design method of controllable velocity moment for multiphase pump is proposed and the ranges of dimensionless controllable parameters are determined 2 under igvf 0 the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency of impeller in optimization pump i is decreased by 23 1 compared with baseline pump meanwhile the pressure rise and efficiency of optimization pump i are 211 9 kpa and 70 62 increasing by 11 9 kpa and 3 6 in comparison of baseline pump respectively the reason is that the rotor stator interaction is weakened in optimization pump i with optimal velocity moment distribution 3 under igvf 10 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller in optimization pump ii is reduced by 47 53 in comparison of baseline pump meanwhile the pressure rise and efficiency of optimization pump ii are 186 0 kpa and 70 02 increasing by 7 6 kpa and 4 51 in comparison of baseline pump respectively the reason is that the transition region with strong gas liquid interaction is suppressed in optimization pump ii with optimal velocity moment distribution in the present work the design method of impeller is effective but the flow pattern and pressure fluctuation in diffuser is still not perfect therefore the design method and optimization for diffuser should be further investigated in the future work secondly the pump in the present work is a one stage pump

average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller decreases by 47 53 the optimization mechanism is that the rotor stator interaction and gas liquid interaction are suppressed in optimization pump with optimal velocity moment distribution keywords multiphase pump design method controllable velocity moment pressure fluctuation suppression optimization 1 introduction with the fast rise of energy demand enhancing production efficiency and reducing environmental pollution have become the most important issue for energy extraction the offshore oil and gas resources account for about 1 3 of the total quantity on the earth but only 15 of crude oil is produced due to the technical limitation oil gas mixture transportation is the crucial technology of crude petroleum and natural gas industry compared with the traditional crude platform the mixture transportation technology is more economic environmental and efficient the core equipment for mixture transporting is the multiphase pump which can be classified into two major categories including the volume delivery pump and rotodynamic pump rabiger et al 2008 falcimagne et al 2002 for the volume delivery pump the reciprocating multiphase pump is widely used and has the advantage of good internal compression high efficiency and anti gas resistance which has greatly improved the oil and gas production however its working flow rate and boosting capability are limited by size deng et al 2018a 2018b 2018c for the rotodynamic multiphase pump it is first proposed by institut francais du petrole ifp dal porto and larson 1997 which has become the research hotspot because of its advantages of compact structure wide range of operating conditions and good abrasion resistance liu et al 2018a zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a conducted visualization experiment on internal flow pattern of a three stage rotodynamic multiphase pump results showed that with increasing of igvf isolated bubbles flow bubbly flow gas pocket flow and segregated gas flow could be recognized in the impeller liu et al 2018b numerically investigated interphase forces of two phase flow in impeller and diffuser and found that the dominant order of interphase forces was drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force and the wall lubrication force can be negligible a numerical method which considered the four major interphase forces presented better predictive accuracy zhang et al 2019a applied a non uniform bubble model in a multiphase pump where the effect of bubby coalescence and break up on the flow filed was considered shi et al 2020a studied the flow characteristics and evolution of tip leakage vortex in a multiphase pump and found that the trajectory of tip leakage vortex was distributed in a wavy shape and significantly affected by igvf shi et al 2020b there are lots of factors that influence the efficient and stable operation of the multiphase pump such as complicated vortex structure liu et al 2019 leakage flow zhang et al 2019b gas pocket zhang et al 2016b and phase interaction zhang et al 2018a many scholars have focused on energy performance improvement for multiphase pump hu et al 2015 suh et al 2017 kim et al 2015 analyzed the influence of various design parameters on multiphase pump and established the response surface between chosen parameters and performance to improve the pump efficiency by 3 5 cao et al 2005 introduced an inverse design method for multiphase pump in which the two phase flow was supposed homogeneous and the flow net was solved by the quasi three dimensional method to improve the compatibility between stages of multiphase pump liu et al 2020a developed an oseen vortex model to predict the velocity distribution between diffuser and next impeller in this way the blade angle of next impeller could be calculated according to the actual flow and the pump efficiency can be further improved zhang et al 2011 took the numerical results as training samples to develop a performance prediction model of multiphase pump through back propagation bp neural network based on the predicted results the nsga ii multi objective genetic algorithm was applied to obtain an optimal impeller with increase of efficiency by 3 the operation stability is equally important for a multiphase pump especially at high igvf where the gas phase and liquid phase strongly interact the vortex induced by leakage flow will develop at the blade suction side and further influence the pressure fluctuation in the multiphase pump impeller zhang and tan 2018 experimental results showed that the bubbles gathered in local area and blocked the impeller which led to complicated pressure fluctuation frequencies and sharply rise of amplitude severer instability was observed in a multi stage multiphase pump because the unstable flow at the previous stage would transfer to the next stage and resulted in pressure fluctuation aggravation xu et al 2019 the flow instability can reduce the pump service life and further destroy pipe and equipment downstream however rare investigation has been conducted on the suppression of pressure fluctuation for a multiphase pump till now the design method of prescribed velocity moment was originally applicated by hawthrone et al hawthorne et al 1984 for the design of two dimensional cascade with infinitely thin blade tan et al 1984 further developed this method for design of three dimensional blade profile then zangeneh 1991 described a fully three dimensional design method for radial and mixed flow turbomachines by specifying the velocity moment on the meridional line in the present work a design method by controlling the velocity moment is firstly proposed and then parameter optimization is conducted to suppress the pressure fluctuation for a multiphase pump under single phase and two phase conditions 2 design and optimization methods the distribution of velocity moment directly affects the pump energy and operation performances firstly the blade design method on basis of controllable velocity moment is proposed and the regions of main parameters are analyzed to satisfy the design requirement then the optimal values of main parameters are determined to suppress the pressure fluctuation 2 1 design method of controllable velocity moment in the present work a design method of controllable velocity moment in combination of singularity method is proposed in this method there are three assumptions as follows 1 the flow is potential inviscid and incompressible 2 the blade thickness is regarded as infinitely thin 3 the radial velocity is 0 in the singularity method a series of bound vortices is set along the foil camber line to represent the effect of foil on flow so the complicated flow can be calculated by simplified bound vortices as shown in fig 1 the circulation density σ of distributed vortices is defined as follows 1 σ s lim δ s 0 δ γ δ s d γ d s where γ denotes circulation and s is the length along the camber line in annular cascades the circulation density in a flow passage can be represented as follows 2 σ d γ d s δ α n 2 π b where the function δ in eq 2 is dirac delta function and it is expressed mathematically as follows 3 δ x 0 x 0 4 δ x d x 1 b is the blade number and n is zero or integer α represents the angle position as follows 5 α θ ϕ r z n 2 π b where θ is the angular position of cylindrical coordinate and ϕ r z is the wrap angle r and z is the radial and axial locations in cylindrical coordinate system respectively eq 2 shows that the circulation density is non zero only when it is located on the blade surface the circulation of each circumferential vortex is 6 γ 2 π r c u b where the superscript defines a circumferential mean and c u is the circumferential velocity therefore the circulation density can be written as follows 7 σ d 2 π r c u b d s δ α n 2 π b with eq 7 the vorticity can be obtained as follow 8 ω 2 π r c u b δ α n 2 π b α where α refers to blade surface and α denotes a unit vector which is perpendicular to the blade surface according to kutta joukowski theorem the relation between lift and circulation can be written as follows 9 ρ c b l ω p p α δ α n 2 π b where ρ is the fluid density c bl is the average velocity on blade surface and it can be calculated by c bl c c 2 the superscript and denotes the blade pressure side and suction side respectively and eq 9 can be further developed with dot product a vector of α as follows 10 ρ c b l ω α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b the left hand side of eq 10 can be transformed into as follows 11 ρ c b l ω α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b with eq 8 the equation can be obtained as follows 12 ρ c b l 2 π r c u b δ α n 2 π b α α p p α 2 δ α n 2 π b and above equation can be simplified as follows 13 p p 2 π b ρ c b l r c u in cylindrical coordinates c b l r c u can be written as follows 14 c b l r c u c z b l c u r z c r b l c u r r c θ b l c u r θ the right third term of eq 14 is zero because of circumferential mean of c u so eq 13 may be restricted on meridian plane now the expression of blade pressure load is obtained as follows 15 p p 2 π b ρ c b l r c u m under the hypotheses of infinite blade number the wrap angle of blades is given as follows 16 ϕ 0 l m ω r 2 c u r c m r 2 d m where l m denotes the length of meridional streamline in the blade zone ω is angular velocity which is the given design parameter when the distribution of velocity moment c u r is given the blade pressure load and blade warp angle can be determined by eq 15 and eq 16 and then the blade shape can be calculated by x rcosϕ y rsinϕ and z z 2 2 parametrization of velocity moment distribution in the proposed design method a normalized fourth order polynomial function is applied to control velocity moment distribution along the meridional streamline as follows 17 c u r c u 1 r 1 f x c u 2 r 2 c u 1 r 1 18 f x a x 4 b x 3 c x 2 d x e where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote leading edge and trailing edge x denotes relative length of the meridional streamline in the blade zone and is restricted in 0 1 a b c d e are coefficients and are determined by following five conditions 1 the velocity moment at leading edge is c u r x 0 c u 1 r 1 corresponding to f 0 0 2 the velocity moment at trailing edge is c u r x 1 c u 2 r 2 corresponding to f 1 1 3 at the leading edge it is given as d f d x x 0 k where k is a constant 4 at the trailing edge the flow satisfies kutta joukowsky condition the blade pressure load is zero corresponding to d f d x x 1 0 5 the f x at middle point of relative meridional streamline x 0 5 is given as p based on above five conditions the five coefficients can be obtained as follow 19 a 16 p 2 k 8 b 5 k 32 p 14 c 16 p 4 k 5 d k e 0 2 3 discussion of value range for p and k in section 2 2 a normalized fourth order polynomial function is applied to control velocity moment distribution pattern along any meridional streamline the five coefficients can be calculated by eq 19 in order to determine the value range for p and k the following conditions are considered 1 in the blade zone the blades work on the fluid thus the blade pressure load is greater than zero corresponding to d f d x x 0 1 0 2 according to previous design experience zangeneh 1991 the middle part of the blades should have better working ability than trailing edge and leading edge for the purpose of satisfactory performance therefore r c u m could be given as a convex function namely d 3 f d x 3 x 0 1 0 considering condition 1 the following value range can be obtained 20 k 0 x 0 p k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 x 0 0 5 k 6 x 0 5 p k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 x 0 5 1 and considering condition 2 the following value range can be obtained 21 p k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 x 0 0 5 k 2 x 0 5 p k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 x 0 5 1 with eq 20 and eq 21 the constant k has a value range of 0 2 the value range is further narrowed down to 1 3 2 because of insufficient pressurization of impeller at pump inlet in order to solve the value range of p assign 22 g 1 x k 8 x 2 7 x 1 32 x 2 10 x 32 x 2 x 1 23 g 2 x k 8 x 5 32 x 14 32 2 x 1 the maximum and minimum value of g 1 x and g 2 x could be solved with preset k in the range of 0 2 assign 24 r 1 max g 1 x x 0 0 5 r 2 min g 1 x x 0 5 1 25 r 3 max g 2 x x 0 0 5 r 4 min g 2 x x 0 5 1 thus the value range of p is max r 3 r 1 min r 4 r 2 because the value range of p varies with the value of k the relative values a 1 and a 2 are defined as follows to facilitate discussion 26 a 1 k k min k max k min 27 a 2 p p min p max p min it can be concluded that the value ranges of a 1 and a 2 remain 0 1 3 physical model and numerical method 3 1 physical model in order to validate the optimization method a single stage multiphase pump is selected as the baseline model by referring to kim kim et al 2015 the design parameters and major geometry parameters are shown in table 1 the meridional section of the pump is shown in fig 2 3 2 numerical method the computational domain consists of inlet pipe impeller diffuser and outlet pipe in turn as shown in fig 3 the hexahedron structural mesh of inlet pipe and outlet pipe are generated by ansys icem 17 0 and the hexahedron structural mesh of impeller and diffuser are generated by ansys turbogrid 17 0 which is specially designed for mesh of turbomachinery in order to improve the mesh quality the o block topology is applied around blade surface and local refinement is used on wall surfaces as shown in fig 4 in present research the computation fluid dynamics software ansys cfx 17 0 is applied to simulate the three dimensional turbulent flow inside the multiphase pump the navier stokes equations with the shear stress transport sst model is chosen to solve the steady and transient flows under different igvf which has been proven to be effective in the previous literatures the inhomogeneous eulerian eulerian model is chosen for the two phase flow calculations which has been proved to be effective suh et al 2018 in eulerian eulerian model the liquid phase is considered as a continuous fluid and the gas phase is considered as a dispersed fluid the governing equations of the liquid phase and the gas phases are solved respectively on basis of the physical procedure and experimental visualization of flow inside multiphase pump the eulerian eulerian multiphase model is suitable in the present numerical simulation according to the literature drag force virtual mass force lift force and turbulent dispersion force are considered in the phase interaction model zhang et al 2018b the boundary conditions include static pressure inlet and given mass flow rate at outlet the physical walls are taken as no slip walls the interfaces between the rotational and stationary parts are set by frozen rotor and transient rotor stator methods for steady and unsteady simulations respectively liu et al 2020b han and tan 2020 liu and tan 2020 for steady simulation it is stated to be convergence when the value of root mean square is below 10 5 for unsteady simulation the result of steady simulation is taken as the initial value in order to improve the accuracy of unsteady calculation 3 3 mesh independence test the mesh quantity has a significant influence on the simulated results in order to validate the independence of mesh quantity 5 sets of meshes with total elements from 876 082 to 4 654 173 are used fig 5 shows the influence of mesh quantity on the external characteristics the nominal head h n of the multiphase pump is defined as 28 h n p 2 p 1 ρ m u l t i g 29 ρ m i g v f ρ g 1 i g v f ρ l where p 1 is the pressure at pump inlet and p 2 is the pressure at pump outlet ρ m ρ g and ρ l denote the density of multiphase gas and liquid respectively the efficiency is calculated by 30 η h n h t 31 h t m ω ρ m q g where m is the torque ω is the rotational speed and q is the flow rate as shown in fig 5 the calculated results change with the increasing of mesh quantity however when exceeds 3 500 000 the results show only a slight difference for saving time and computational resources mesh 4 with total 3 494 153 elements is selected 3 4 monitor points setting during the working process of multiphase pump the pressure sides of blades suffer the highest pressure in order to collect the pressure data of multiphase pump five monitor points at blade pressure side with equal streamline distance are set in impeller and five monitor points at blade pressure side with equal streamline distance are set in diffuser as shown in fig 6 3 5 time step independence test time step is important in unsteady simulation in present research time step δ t 4 3403 10 5 s 8 6806 10 5 s and 1 7361 10 4 s which respond to 1 96 1 192 and 1 384 of an impeller revolution period t i are employed for time step independence test fig 7 shows the time histories of pressure on dps2 dps3 and dps4 which are located at blade pressure side in diffuser the difference among the pressure curves is tiny which indicates that the influence of time step can be negligible therefore the time step of 8 6806 10 5 is chosen for transient calculation 3 6 validation of simulation in order to validate the numerical method the simulation results are compared with the experimental results which come from literature kim et al 2015 as shown in fig 8 the simulation results agree well with the experimental results under different flow rate and different igvf which demonstrates that the numerical method is reliable 3 7 validation of design method in order to validate the design method of controllable velocity moment five monitoring curves are set at different blade heights span 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 in design process the parameters are set as a 1h 0 25 a 2h 1 0 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 25 for the velocity moment distribution and the corresponding rc u is shown in fig 9 a fig 9b shows the numerically simulated distribution of blade load which matches well with the distribution of rc u the difference between the given distribution of velocity moment and calculated distribution of blade load can be ascribed to two aspects the first reason is that the flow is supposed as inviscid in the design method while in the three dimensional numerical simulation the fluid is viscid the second reason is that the blade thickness is supposed as infinite thin in design process while in the three dimensional numerical simulation the blade is thickened and the blade edge is rounded therefore the proposed design method can effectively control the velocity moment and can be used in the following optimization work 4 optimization results 4 1 orthogonal table based on above analysis overall four parameters need to be determined including a 1h a 2h a 1s and a 2s where the subscripts h and s denote the distribution at hub and shroud when the values a 1h a 2h a 1s and a 2s are given the blade velocity moment distributions near hub and shroud can be uniquely determined and the blade angles between hub and shroud are determined by linear interpolation an orthogonal table with four factors and five levels for each factor is established and denoted as l25 54 in the orthogonal method only 25 individual tests are required to cover the five factors and four corresponding factor levels which is remarkably less than original individual tests of 54 625 the factor levels cover the entire value as shown in table 2 according to the principle of orthogonality the l25 54 orthogonal table is designed as table 3 4 2 orthogonal analysis for energy performance in present orthogonal analysis the major objective is to ensure that nominal head of the impellers meet the design nominal head of 23 45 m then the suppression of pressure fluctuation can be conducted on the premise that the impeller meets the design requirements the total 25 cases are set with different impeller but the same inlet pipe diffuser and outlet pipe fig 10 shows the main effects of chosen factors on the nominal head under single phase and multi phase flow conditions the main effect of each factor on the nominal head is calculated as follows 32 h i 1 n j 1 n h n j where subscript i denotes the specific level of the factor n is the total number of tested cases with the factor at level i h n is the predicted nominal head of tested impeller with corresponding factor at corresponding level i according to the analysis results shown in fig 10 the design parameters of the impeller with minimal h n under igvf 0 and igvf 10 are both a 1h 0 a 2h 0 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 with the design parameters the impeller has a nominal head of 23 60 m under igvf 0 and 23 56 m under igvf 10 which meet the design requirement of 23 45 m therefore it can be concluded that the impellers in the chosen orthogonal optimization interval satisfy the design requirement 4 3 suppression of pressure fluctuation under single phase condition fig 11 shows the frequency spectra of pressure fluctuation in impeller and diffuser under single phase condition at rated flow for baseline pump in impeller the dominant frequency at different blade regions ips1 ips5 is 660 hz which is the blade passing frequency of diffuser in diffuser the dominant frequency at different blade regions dps1 dps5 is 180 hz which is the blade passing frequency of impeller the above results demonstrate that the main induction factor of the pressure fluctuation in multiphase pump is rotor stator interaction under single phase condition the maximum amplitude of pressure fluctuation occurs at ips5 and dps1 which are close to the rotor stator interface because the amplitude of dominant frequency at ips5 is much larger than other locations in impeller it is chosen as the optimal objective under single phase condition fig 12 shows the main effects of chosen factors on amplitude of dominant frequency at ips5 compared to other factors a 2s show the most significant effect on amplitude while a 1s is the least important parameter under single phase the impeller of optimization pump i can be obtained with a 1h 0 25 a 2h 0 25 a 1s 0 75and a 2s 0 25 the nominal head of optimization impeller is 25 81 m which improves by 5 1 compared to the baseline impeller the performance of the whole stage shows pressure rise of 211 9 kpa with an increase of 11 9 kpa and hydraulic efficiency of 70 62 with an increase of 3 6 fig 13 shows the comparison of amplitudes of dominant frequency between baseline and optimization pump i in impeller the amplitudes of optimization pump i are slightly higher than that of baseline pump at ips1 ips3 while the amplitudes near the leading edge of the blade ips4 ips5 are lower than that of baseline pump for optimization pump i the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency in impeller is 1236 9pa which decreases by 23 1 compared with baseline pump in diffuser the amplitudes of dominant frequency of optimization pump i are overall lower than that of baseline pump and the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency of optimization pump i is 13 588 5pa which decreases by 6 2 compared with baseline pump the above results demonstrate that the rotor stator interaction is suppressed in optimization pump i according to the blade angle distribution of baseline pump the dimensionless distribution function of blade pressure load r c u m c u 2 r 2 c u 1 r 1 could be solved directly fig 14 shows the comparison of dimensionless distribution function of blade pressure load between baseline impeller and optimization impeller the baseline impeller has the higher pressure load at leading edge the pressure load decreases sharply from the leading edge and then change slowly until outlet it is non zero at the trailing edge and the distribution function appears concave function therefore the working capacity of baseline impeller concentrate on the second half of the blade as for the optimization impeller the pressure load decreases steadily from the leading edge and reaches zero at the outlet the distribution function appears convex function the distribution pattern ensure that the working capacity of the whole blade is uniformly distributed based on above analysis the difference of pressure fluctuation between baseline pump and optimization pump i which is shown in fig 13 can be explain due to the different working capacity of blade the optimization impeller appears stronger pressure fluctuation in first half of blade but weaker in second half of blade and because the pressure on the second half of the blade is generally higher than the first half of the blade the uniform pressure load distribution pattern can reduce the pressure fluctuation without affecting energy performance furthermore the zero pressure load at leading edge causes more uniform outflow in impeller which weakens the rotor stator interaction and suppress the overall pressure fluctuation in diffuser 4 4 suppression of pressure fluctuation under two phase condition the pressure fluctuation under two phase condition is more complicated fig 15 shows the frequency spectra of pressure fluctuation in impeller and diffuser under igvf 10 at rated flow for baseline pump in impeller the dominant frequency of ips1 ips4 is 704 hz while the dominant frequency of ips5 is still 660 hz in diffuser the dominant frequency of dps1 dps3 is still 180 hz while the dominant frequency of dps4 dps5 is 89 hz the broadband component of pressure fluctuation increases both in impeller and diffuser due to influence of the unsteady two phase flow in order investigate the induction factors of pressure fluctuation under two phase condition the pressure fluctuation and gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity are defined as liu and tan 2018 33 i p 1 n i 1 n p i p 2 34 i g 1 n i 1 n g v f i g v f 2 where n is the sample number of last 8 revolutions p i is the pressure at each time step and p is the arithmetic average of pressure g v f i is the gas volume fraction at each time step and g v f is the arithmetic average of gas volume fraction fig 16 shows gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity and pressure fluctuation intensity on the blade pressure side of baseline impeller a strip shaped narrow region with high i g can be observed near the leading edge in fig 16a by contrast a strip shaped narrow region with high i p can also be observed at nearly the same location with the same area in fig 16b the great matching performance between these two figures indicates that the strong pressure fluctuation near the leading edge is induced by gas liquid interaction therefore the impeller is separated into two regions when two phase flow is applied for baseline impeller the first half of the impeller is defined as transition region in transition region the two phase flow is transformed from homogeneous flow into stratified flow under the effect of strong centrifugal force the flow is extremely unsteady and the gas liquid interaction is the main induction factor of pressure fluctuation the second half of the impeller is defined as the fully development region in this region the gas phase flow mainly around the hub while liquid phase flow near the shroud the flow is relatively steady and the rotor stator is the main induction factor of pressure fluctuation based on above analysis the overall average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller is selected as the goal of optimizing under two phase condition and defined as follows 35 i p i p 1 i p 2 i p 3 i p 4 i p 5 5 where i p1 i p2 i p3 i p4 and i p5 denote the pressure fluctuation intensity of ips1 ips5 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of baseline impeller is 2529pa fig 17 shows the main effects of chosen factors on average pressure fluctuation intensity in impeller the magnitude of influence for average pressure fluctuation intensity can be sorted by a 1s a 2s a 2h a 1h as shown in fig 17 the impeller of optimization pump ii can be obtained with the setting of a 1h 0 a 2h 0 25 a 1s 0 and a 2s 0 25 under two phase condition numerical result shows that the optimization impeller has a nominal head of 25 35 m under igvf 10 which increases by 7 6 compared to the baseline impeller the performance of whole stage shows a pressure rise of 186 0 kpa and efficiency of 70 02 with an increase of pressure rise of 7 6 kpa and an increase of efficiency of 4 51 fig 18 shows the comparison of pressure fluctuation intensity between baseline and optimization pump ii as shown in fig 18a the pressure fluctuation intensity at impeller significantly decreases especially at the first half of impeller ips1 ips2 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of optimization impeller is 1327pa which drops by 47 53 compared to the baseline impeller the pressure fluctuation in diffuser is also suppressed as shown in fig 18b in diffuser the overall pressure fluctuation intensity of optimization pump ii is lower than baseline pump the pressure intensity of monitor point dps4 is 2422 pa after optimization which decreases 5538pa compared to the baseline pump above results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of proposed method fig 19 shows gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity and pressure fluctuation intensity on the blade pressure side after optimization compared to fig 16a the strip shaped narrow region with high i g disappear in fig 19a as a result the local high pressure fluctuation intensity near the leading edge is suppressed as shown in fig 19b the overall gas volume fraction fluctuation intensity in impeller is much lower after optimization which means the two phase flow is steady and the gas liquid interaction is weaken therefore the pressure fluctuation is mainly induced by rotor stator interaction in optimization impeller and the intensity increases gradually from the leading edge to the trailing edge fig 20 shows the iso surface of 50 gas volume fraction in baseline impeller and optimization impeller as mentioned above in fully development region the two phase flow is steady and the pressure fluctuation is relatively low the fully development region is characterized by steady gas phase flow around the hub as shown in fig 20 the fully development region of baseline impeller is formed at the middle part while the fully development region of optimization impeller is formed at the front part it can be concluded that since the different spans have the same dimensionless velocity moment distribution the blade shape changes smoothly from hub to shroud therefore the fully development region is easier to form and the transition region with strong gas liquid interaction is almost eliminated in optimization pump ii as a result the pressure fluctuation intensity at the first half ips1 ips2 of optimization impeller is much lower than that of baseline impeller 5 conclusions in the present work a design method of controllable velocity moment in combination of singularity method is proposed and it is combined with the orthogonal optimization method to suppress the pressure fluctuation in a multiphase pump according to the optimization and analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a design method of controllable velocity moment for multiphase pump is proposed and the ranges of dimensionless controllable parameters are determined 2 under igvf 0 the maximum amplitude of dominant frequency of impeller in optimization pump i is decreased by 23 1 compared with baseline pump meanwhile the pressure rise and efficiency of optimization pump i are 211 9 kpa and 70 62 increasing by 11 9 kpa and 3 6 in comparison of baseline pump respectively the reason is that the rotor stator interaction is weakened in optimization pump i with optimal velocity moment distribution 3 under igvf 10 the average pressure fluctuation intensity of impeller in optimization pump ii is reduced by 47 53 in comparison of baseline pump meanwhile the pressure rise and efficiency of optimization pump ii are 186 0 kpa and 70 02 increasing by 7 6 kpa and 4 51 in comparison of baseline pump respectively the reason is that the transition region with strong gas liquid interaction is suppressed in optimization pump ii with optimal velocity moment distribution in the present work the design method of impeller is effective but the flow pattern and pressure fluctuation in diffuser is still not perfect therefore the design method and optimization for diffuser should be further investigated in the future work secondly the pump in the present work is a one stage pump but the multistage pump is more widely used in engineering application therefore the interaction of impeller with diffuser in the last stage should be considered in the design method for a multistage

surface area and aspect ratio at higher aspect ratios the side force is produced in a more efficient manner both from a general force behaviour and a side force force generation perspective finally an important note was made regarding the future introduction of blade twist in order to address an observed effect on the neutral pitch angle keywords auv collective and cyclic pitch propulsion manoeuvring design 1 introduction the collective and cyclic pitch propeller ccpp investigated here is a novel propulsion and manoeuvring system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs developed by humphrey et al 2004 by introducing advanced blade control the ccpp is able to generate propulsion and manoeuvring forces at both low and high speeds and combines long endurance travelling efficiency and low speed manoeuvring effectiveness the advanced blade control allows the pitch angle of the propeller blades to change both simultaneously collective and individually over the rotational cycle cyclic humphrey 2005 based the design of the ccpp on a study of several patents submitted over the past decades gadefelt 1965 lindahl 1966 haselton 1963 wham et al 1987 reich and uhrich 1990 schneider 1993 silberg et al 2015 humphrey showed through experimental testing that the ccpp was able to propel control and manoeuvre a torpedo shaped auv the ccpp was further investigated by niyomka 2014 and tran 2018 who confirmed the ccpp s capabilities to generate substantial manoeuvring forces through experimental research along with performance prediction programs and manoeuvring simulations early experimental research showed the capabilities of the concept to generate transverse forces of any magnitude and direction at all speeds joosen et al 1963 haselton and rice 1966 further work by joosen et al 1963 into the concept s feasibility identified the capabilities of the concept to reduce unsteady flow effects jessup 1976 confirmed the newly identified abilities by showing improvements in propulsive power combined with improved visible cavitation and vibration performance when applying cyclic pitch control experimental investigation and full scale sea trials of a so called pinnate propeller simonsson 1981 1984 showed similar results as did gabriel and atlar 1998 when investigating optimal cyclic pitch profiles later a report on the applications of cyclic pitch thrusters was published by murray et al 1994 identifying the full potential of collective and cyclic pitch propellers through numerical evaluation and rapid prototype development of a propeller for a navy vehicle similar systems were tested now referred to as a variable vector propeller varivec to be used in the control and operation of a real time imaging underwater vehicle nagashima et al 2006 and to investigate the influence of different oscillation cycle profiles chang et al 2007 the tandem propeller system was later revived by chen et al 2008 2009 he combined numerical prediction and simulation with experimental work to develop a demo vehicle and a preliminary controller for the propeller capable of motions in six degrees of freedom in this paper the recommendations of niyomka 2014 and tran 2018 and the rich history of research into the concept were used as basis for a continued investigation into the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance dubois 2019 formulated the objective to improve the ccpp s performance using a novel numerical methodology in order to develop the system into a viable and feasible propulsion and manoeuvring alternative traditional propeller performance analysis and improvement studies focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of the generated propulsion force carlton 2012 various blade design parameters such as blade rake skew twist and fabrication material and their effect on the propulsive performance of a propeller are investigated at length krasilnikov et al 2009 ji et al 2011 hayati et al 2012 he et al 2012 such an approach however cannot be applied for the ccpp as the main focus of the ccpp is the generation of side forces i e forces perpendicular to the direction of motion and thus in the propeller plane based on earlier work by the current authors a different approach is selected to determine pathways to improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance as will be discussed at length in this paper as such the current work evaluated and analysed the effect of changing the blade design on the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance first the paper discusses the applied numerical methodology and research philosophy to formulate and rationalise the chosen design pathway to be evaluated further next the study is outlined and set up to provide detailed insight into the chosen new blade designs as well as into the performance analysis and comparison approach finally the results of the performance evaluation and comparison are discussed and analysed before formulating the concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 ccpp characterisation the design and working principle of the ccpp is based on two concepts first collective pitch control allows the ccpp blades to adjust the blade pitch collectively i e changing the pitch of all blades simultaneously collective pitch control is used to govern the direction and magnitude of the generated propulsion force second cyclic pitch control enables the blade pitch of each individual blade to oscillate over the rotational or azimuthal cycle a force imbalance is generated over the cycle by the introduction of cyclic pitch control in turn resulting in a net manoeuvring or side force the ccpp shown in fig 1 is a four bladed propeller with interchangeable bolted on blades with a naca0012 profile a sinusoidal pitch profile is controlled by a swash plate mechanism through a control equation the collective pitch angle can be set between 20 and 20 while a maximum pitch amplitude of 20 can be reached the rotational speed of the propeller is limited to 600 r p m with a counter clockwise rotational direction an extended examination of the ccpp s working principle and a full overview of the ccpp s control and geometry characteristics is found in earlier work humphrey et al 2004 dubois 2019 additionally dubois 2019 discussed the history of research into and patents on the concept of collective and cyclic pitch control for the propulsion and manoeuvring of maritime vehicles and synthesized the merits of the concept 2 2 numerical model the development applicability methodology and use of the numerical model used in the current study is discussed at length in earlier work dubois et al 2017 2019a 2019b dubois 2019 in summary the ansys fluent16 0 model solves the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans with the application of the k ω sst transition turbulence model on a periodic flow domain combined with a sliding mesh approach a visualisation of the flow domain is found in fig 2 providing details on and insight into the different aspects of the simulation set up the flow domain consists of two zones connected through a sliding mesh interface to allow blade pitching or rotation independent of the propeller hub rotation motions of both the inner and outer zone are defined through user defined functions with a quaternion based algorithm to sum pitching blade motion and propeller rotation motion for the inner zone the cyclic pitch angle and rotational speed are set in the motion algorithms while the collective pitch angle and the flow velocity are set in the solver itself for future use the applied numerical parameters convergence criteria and computational mesh used in the commercial solver are discussed briefly additional information can be found in earlier work dubois et al 2017 2019b the pressure based solver used a piso algorithm for the pressure velocity coupling with spatial discretisation of the gradients least squares cell based pressure discretisation was achieved through a second order method and both momentum and turbulence parameters were discretised using second order upwind schemes for the time discretisation a bounded second order implicit dual time stepping method was applied spatial discretisation was based on a multi block structured hex grid approach ensuring a y of 1 around the hydrofoil propeller blade the flow simulations were initiated based on earlier calculations if available or the general inflow condition mitigation of start up effects was monitored by analysis of the average force values per cycle as such the oscillatory or periodic convergence is assured and the average of the last 10 cycles of each force component was used for further force and performance analysis further convergence within each time step was monitored through the continuity equation convergence tolerance set at 10 4 extensive verification and validation of the numerical methodology was performed based on a number of significant operational cases the verification study and uncertainty estimation study dubois et al 2019b established the discretisation approach for future performance investigations and showed the ability of the developed methodology to provide satisfactory results with respect to the total numerical uncertainty introduced in the validation study dubois 2019 the relation between the validation comparison error and the validation uncertainty was investigated for a wide range of cases and operational conditions closer analysis demonstrated that when applying higher combined pitch angles the validation percentage dropped significantly while results were validated at lower pitch values furthermore trend wise agreement between the results of both performance parameters was observed direct comparison of the numerical and experimental results showed the methodology s ability to predict and simulate the same effect of the cyclic pitch angle the collective pitch angle and the flow velocity on the monitored performance parameters the observed discrepancies in predicted values were related to the uncertainty in the relation between the input and output values of the experimental pitch angle in summary the validation study justified the use of the numerical methodology for further analysis of the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance as presented in the current work 2 3 hydrodynamic performance definition and force design the generated manoeuvring or side force defines the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance considered in the current investigation decomposition of the side force in a magnitude and a phase shift component facilitates the quantification and examination of the respective effectiveness and efficiency of the force generation the side force results from the sum of the forces in the propeller s rotational plane y z plane as visualised in figs 1 and 2 as such eq 1 defines the magnitude of the side force f s by the vector sum of the forces in the rotational plane the side force phase shift φ s is determined by the difference between the azimuthal orientation of the side force φ y z and the intended orientation φ int visualised in fig 3 together with the definition of the azimuthal position the intended orientation of the side force is controlled by the ccpp control mechanism and assumes a direct relation between the force orientation and the pitch profile a positive phase shift indicates a clockwise azimuthal shift or an azimuthal advance and negative values referring to a counterclockwise shift or azimuthal delay in order to further remove directional bias the force analysis will not discuss forces in the y and z components but refer to the intended and perpendicular force components the positive intended force component and direction is established to be in the negative z direction in the current work following from this the positive perpendicular component refers to the positive y direction the intended force direction signifies the desired force direction to enable the expected auv motion while the perpendicular force component defines the generation of unexpected or undesired forces and thus motions 1 f s f y 2 f z 2 φ s φ int φ y z the current numerical research efforts resulted in the formulation of several key conclusions regarding the ccpp s performance dubois et al 2018 used a simplified two dimensional numerical methodology to conclude that under bollard pull condition a compromise has to be made between the magnitude and phase shift of the generated side force at moderate pitch angles dynamic stall over the pitching foil aids in the generation of a side force with an increasingly larger magnitude as the pitch angle is increased however at larger angles the effect breaks down and a substantial drag force and pitching moment result causing a significant phase shift to occur as such the effectiveness of the force generation collides with the inability to do so in an efficient manner later dubois et al 2019a focused on the re design of the forces involved through the use of the discussed three dimensional numerical methodology the research confirmed the earlier results for a wider range of operational and flow conditions both investigations reasoned that efficient force generation becomes impossible beyond a certain threshold pitch angle even when compensating for the observed phase shift through control of the pitch profile the generated forces at high pitch angles are effective but the force generation originates from ineffective drag generation instead of lift a different approach has to be taken to ensure the generation of a sufficiently large side force without the associated phase shifts found at higher pitch angles i e a side force that is both effective and efficient 3 design alternative rationalisation 3 1 introduction to rationalisation dubois et al 2019a concluded that the developed numerical methodology would be an effective tool to re design and improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance the multitude of possible approaches and pathways that can be taken to improve the ccpp s performance necessitates a preliminary investigation of alternative designs and operational modes as such the most appropriate optimal and more importantly the most effective approach or pathway can be rationalised and motivated a complete re design of the ccpp and its mechanism is not considered in the current work the full re design of the ccpp would initially bring forward more questions than direct answers or solutions furthermore the design and building of a new ccpp mechanism would involve significant costs while the current mechanism is still functional operational and capable as observed in earlier research the most straightforward path to achieve improved hydrodynamic performance of the ccpp is through investigation of both operational and physical adjustments of the ccpp earlier work established the benefits of the analogy between the ccpp and pitching hydrofoils the analogy showed the importance of the lift and drag generated over the propeller blades and their effect on the effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting side force the suggestion was made to link ccpp s performance and the different operational and physical parameters through the lift equation as presented in eq 2 2 l c l 1 2 ρ u 2 a b the lift equation formulates the relation between the lift l and the lift coefficient c l multiplied by the fluid density ρ the flow velocity u squared and the blade surface area a b the fluid density is the only component that is not considered further as the fluid density cannot be changed a step by step analysis of the various components of the lift equation and their influence on the ccpp s performance without disregarding the drag effect is conducted to establish the optimal pathway for further investigation 3 2 lift coefficient the lift coefficient is established for a specific blade type at a chosen angle of attack in general the lift coefficient of a blade type is determined under controlled circumstances re formulating eq 2 with all parameters set and measurements of the generated lift made both the blade type and applied angle of attack can be manipulated directly and are thus potential candidates to realise improved force generation performance humphrey et al 2004 chose to fit the ccpp with interchangeable blades with a constant naca0012 profile along the blade span the blades have no twist and a limited taper ratio of 0 7 adding the geometric parameters that define the profile type results in a long list of potential blade type alternatives alternative blade types are interesting options for further investigation the blades are interchangeable meaning the costs of such a change would be relatively low and research in the past has shown that a different blade type can have significant influence on the propeller performance carlton 2012 building further on the understanding developed relatively small design changes are prioritised as an efficient method to improve the performance of a complex system additionally other components discussed next are considered to have more potential in realising direct improved performance the effective angle of attack of the blade is a result of the blade type the flow conditions and the pitch angle direct and effective control of the angle of attack is achieved through the pitch angle as discussed in sub section 2 3 and earlier work dubois et al 2018 2019a the pitch angle controls the generated lift and drag forces and consequently the performance of the side force generation operation at smaller pitch angles i e lower angles of attack was recommended stating other options had to be investigated to realise a larger force magnitude besides adjusting the magnitude of the angle of attack or pitch changes to the actual profile of the angle are possible 3 3 flow velocity the flow velocity over the pitching blades is defined by the ccpp s rotational speed and the auv s forward velocity both parameters cannot be changed drastically as the current ccpp was designed within a specific rotational speed and forward velocity range experimental and numerical work have shown that increasing the rotational speed leads to minor increases of the side force magnitude without compromising nor improving the phase shift dubois et al 2018 dubois 2019 further increases of the speed are not considered further as fitting the ccpp with a motor with a larger achievable rotational speed would increase the angle of attack beyond what is efficient and potentially overload the blade pitching mechanism similar conclusions were drawn about the forward velocity of the auv tran et al 2018 dubois 2019 furthermore the uncertainty in the relation between the generated propulsive force and the achieved auv velocity has not been addressed yet effectively making that option not viable within the current research scope 3 4 blade surface area the final parameter in the lift equation is the blade surface area defined by the blade span the chord length and the taper ratio adjustments to the blade surface area are straightforward and can be applied systematically furthermore the linear relation between the lift force magnitude and the surface area means that a direct impact on the performance can be expected finally and importantly no relation between the blade surface area and the pitch angle has been established implying that a negative effect of an increased surface area on the side force phase shift is improbable the blade surface area parameter is thus rationalised as the ideal most straightforward and pragmatic pathway to achieve the desired performance improvements in essence the blade surface area parameter provides a good design study starting point without unnecessary design implications other than variations in the hydrodynamics however the complex non linear behaviour of the ccpp not present in standard propellers due to the highly unsteady nature of the flow requires the full mobilisation of the developed analysis tools to investigate the relatively simple parametric variation of the blade surface area 4 study outline and set up the numerical study into the blade surface area effect needs the further definition of the blade alternatives to be investigated as well as selection of appropriate pitch and flow conditions based on the rationalisation and earlier research results a concise but fundamental test matrix is developed to allow evaluation of the different design variables a single cyclic pitch angle π cycl 10 0 propeller rotational speed n 300 r p m and flow velocity u 1 2 m s are selected additionally the collective pitch angle is limited to π cycl 7 5 except benchmark case to maintain control over the phase shift and hence the direction of the off axis manoeuvring forces the sinusoidal pitch profile is defined by eq 3 as a function of the azimuthal position of the blade or the dimensionless time t with the t t t based on the actual time t and the oscillation rotational period t 60 n s the rotational or pitch cycle starts at φ azi 0 0 or t 0 00 a single intended force direction is chosen as the symmetry of the ccpp and the numerical methodology allows the representation of all directis through a single direction directional independence is ensured fig 3 presented in sub section 2 3 provides additional insight into definition of the different angles and directions in the current case the intended force orientation is φ int 90 i e occurrence of maximum pitch angle which translates to an intended force purely in the negative z direction to further remove the directional bias references to the y and z force components are substituted by the terms perpendicular and intended force components respectively 3 π φ azi π coll π cycl sin φ azi with φ azi 2 π t three alternative blade designs are developed by increasing the blade surface area i e scaling the original or benchmark blade through the blade span and chord length the geometries of the four blades are presented in fig 4 the first two designs double the blade span without and with similar scaling of the chord length resulting in a respective doubling and quadrupling of the blade surface area while scaling of the chord length accordingly ensure the aspect ratio remains unchanged the changed aspect ratio case enables investigation of the aspect ratio parameter effect the fourth design is added to investigate the effect of the linear increase of the blade surface area i e doubling and later quadrupling at the same aspect ratio as the benchmark design minor adjustments were made to the scaled blade designs visualised by the dotted lines in fig 4 the adjustments are aimed to avoid both physical and numerical blade overlapping while keeping the pitch point of each design the same a short parameter evaluation showed that the effects of the adjustments were minor with a reduction of the actual blade surface area and the effective aspect ratio by less than 5 selection of the applied collective pitch angles is done to allow both direct and area weighted results comparison an overview of the cases and comparisons to be conducted is found in table 1 direct comparison of the results is possible based on three collective pitch angles while three area weighted comparison studies based on the altered angle of attack are defined the area weighted comparison is based on the relation between the increase in blade surface area and an equivalent decrease of the applied pitch angle as such the redesigned blade with double the surface area should generate an equivalent force as the benchmark blade but with a lower efficiency penalty i e a smaller side force phase shift because of the smaller applied collective pitch angle results of the analysis are presented in main parts first the mean performance results are discussed second the observed performance change is investigated further by calculating the improvement factors for both the side force effectiveness and efficiency i e force magnitude and phase shift next a two part analysis expands the observations by examination of both the blade based and force based distributions a difference which will be discussed in the relevant sections finally the observations are concluded and summarised by a final performance comparison 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of mean force components and performance the mean of the azimuthal forces determines the resulting auv manoeuvring and is analysed to provide initial insight into and overview of the results evaluation of the influence of the collective pitch angle on the mean performance of the different blade designs establishes the foundations for further detailed investigations 5 1 1 intended and perpendicular force components first the intended and perpendicular force components are plotted in fig 5 the intended and perpendicular force components are introduced to remove directional bias from the analysis as discussed in the study outline in sub section 2 3 a similar relation between the collective pitch angle and both force components is generally observed to be trend wise consistent for all blade designs fig 5a reveals a near independence of the intended force component on the collective pitch angle in fig 5b larger pitch angles are seen to result in an increase of the perpendicular force component important to note for future discussion is the sign change of the force component for s 2 0 a r 2 0 changed aspect ratio cases 5 1 2 side force magnitude and phase shift fig 6 combines the intended and perpendicular component results and shows that the collective pitch angle has little influence on the side force magnitude within the tested range of collective pitch angles the side force magnitude of the benchmark case increases slightly at higher collective pitch angles as a consequence of an equivalent increase of the perpendicular force component observed in fig 5b for the s 2 0 a r 1 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 re designs same aspect ratio cases the increase of the perpendicular force component is counter acted by a decreasing intended force component resulting in the near independence of the side force magnitude on the applied collective pitch angle both observations on the intended and perpendicular force components come together in the side force phase shift results plotted in fig 6b the side force phase shift becomes increasingly more positive at higher collective pitch angles as such for most cases the perpendicular force component is concluded to directly influence the size of the phase shift the force behaviour has been discussed in detail in the methodology discussion and performance definition as the pitch angle increases the associated drag forces take over resulting in a large perpendicular force component and thus the observed phase shift 5 1 3 additional performance parameters two additional performance parameters are introduced to help visualise the performance differences between the blade designs in more detail fig 7 a plots the side force magnitude coefficient non dimensionalising the results the side force magnitude coefficient calculated as c f s f s 0 5 ρ u 2 a b does not change the relation between the force generated and the collective pitch angle a different relation between the different blade designs does emerge as the main parameter differentiating the cases is the blade surfaces area the effect will be discussed further in the next sub section in fig 7b the relative contribution of the intended force component to the total side force magnitude is plotted for three of the collective pitch angles in general the contribution of the intended force component becomes smaller at higher collective pitch angles for all blade designs resulting in contributions as low as 75 the initial increase of the contribution for s 2 0 a r 2 0 is related to the sign change of the perpendicular force component and is not regarded as a discrepancy 5 2 initial performance improvement examination a performance improvement factor is introduced to enable explicit comparison of the effect of the different blade re designs analysis based on the direct and area weighted approach for the side force magnitude the side force magnitude coefficient as well as the side force phase shift is to be done the factor the specified performance variable for each new blade design to the benchmark result by simply dividing both results direct comparison compares the results at the same collective pitch angle while the area weighted approach uses the equivalent angles determined based on the blade surface area relation listed in table 1 in the study outline 5 2 1 side force magnitude and coefficient fig 8 a shows through direct comparison that all re designs realise an improved effectiveness of the side force generation i e generation of a side force with a larger magnitude than the benchmark case the smallest improvement for s 2 0 a r 1 0 realises an average improvement factor of 2 8 while s 2 0 a r 2 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 result in an improvement factor of 5 0 and 8 5 respectively a larger blade surface area thus as expected results in the generation of a larger side force at equal collective pitch angles additionally and more importantly a larger side force coefficient results as well seen in fig 8b the increase of the side force magnitude coefficient indicates the ability to generate a larger force per equivalent blade surface area an increase of 2 5 2 3 and 1 5 of the side force magnitude coefficient in order of the listed and plotted results is observed fig 9 plots the average performance improvement factor of the absolute side force magnitude and coefficient against the increase in the blade surface area the plot is supported by indicator lines to illustrate potential growth rates g r a b between the blade surface increase and the improvement factor a closer look at the absolute side force magnitudes crosses shows the improvement factor and thus growth rate is quantified by the relative increase of the blade span regardless of the aspect ratio from s 2 0 a r 1 0 to s 2 0 a r 1 0 the improvement factor jumps from the middle indicator line to the top one indicating a higher and non linear rate of improvement as function of the blade surface increase a different trend is observed from the coefficient results for s 2 0 a r 1 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 the continued increase of the blade surface area no longer improves the performance proportionally the growth rate of both cases is below 1 and appears to become lower as the blade surface area is increased the most effective and efficient method to increase the side force magnitude through a larger blade surface in absolute and coefficient terms is realised by adjusting the blade span only and thus changing the aspect ratio as seen for s 2 0 a r 2 0 the performance improvement factors for both the absolute magnitude and the coefficient can be estimated based on the applied parameters and the observed results for the absolute side force magnitude the factor is found by multiplying the blade surface increase factor with the equivalent span increase factor for the side force magnitude coefficient the improvement factor estimation is equal to the estimator for the absolute side force magnitude improvement divided by the equivalent blade surface increase 5 2 2 side force phase shift the observed increase of the side force generation s effectiveness will only be of value if the associated efficiency i e phase shift exhibits similar improvements in fig 10 a the results are plotted for the direct comparison and no improvements of the phase shift are observed the improvement factors are above 1 0 with exception of the higher pitch angles of s 2 0 a r 2 0 the values for π coll 0 0 are scaled and originate from the near zero phase shift of the benchmark case a direct relation between the large phase shifts of s 2 0 a r 1 0 s 2 0 a r 1 0 seen earlier in fig 6 and the perpendicular side force component contribution observed in fig 5 exists however the magnitude increases do not come at the cost of extreme phase shifts φ s 45 0 and larger found in earlier work when applying larger collective pitch angle to realise an increase of the force magnitude the area weighted comparison in fig 10b further strengthens the case for the re designed blades because large side force magnitudes are achieved independent of the collective pitch angle the ccpp can operate at lower collective pitch angles the area weighted comparison reducing the applied collective pitch angle by the factor of the blade surface increase compares the blade designs for three cases as established in table 1 operating at lower collective pitch angles results in a significant reduction of the phase shift the observed reductions bring the phase shift down to below 20 0 while ensuring a side force of sufficient effectiveness and magnitude fig 10b indicates that the biggest improvements are achieved for s 2 0 a r 2 0 and thus after changing the blade s aspect ratio 5 2 3 combining effectiveness and efficiency the direct and area weighted comparison of the performance results enables the determination of a best and an optimal case with regard to the side force effectiveness and efficiency the best case is defined as the case generating the largest absolute side force while the optimal case refers to the largest side force coefficient combined with the smallest possible side force phase shift as such the best case is s 2 0 a r 1 0 and the optimal case is s 2 0 a r 2 0 further evaluation of the results will only evaluate aforementioned cases no longer considering s 2 0 a r 1 0 additionally only force coefficients will be plotted and discussed allowing for a more straightforward and unbiased comparison 5 3 blade based distribution analysis the mean results are derived from time dependent force distributions over the azimuthal cycle a brief initial analysis is presented based on the blade based force distributions in which the directionality of the force components is disregarded to aid the analysis fig 11 plots the actual and absolute pitch angle profiles as a function of azimuthal position and dimensionless time 5 3 1 pitch profiles for different applied collective pitch angles fig 12 s shows that the benchmark case results of the side force magnitude match the trends of the absolute pitch profile values as visualised in fig 11b as the collective pitch angle is increased the force distribution becomes increasingly more asymmetric as was observed in earlier work dubois et al 2019a the re designed blade results show a different trend plotted in fig 12b and c and exhibit an increase of the peak before t 0 50 φ azi 180 0 and a smaller magnitude peak after as the collective pitch angle becomes larger further analysis does show that an increase of the collective pitch angle has the same effect on the actual force behaviour for all blade designs in short larger pitch angles increase the magnitude of the first peak and decrease that of the second peak when reversing the observed effect the re designed larger blades appear to operate at a lower effective collective pitch angle the increase of the blade span significantly increases the magnitude of the tangential flow velocities over large sections of the blade as such reducing the apparent angle of attack of the flow and in turn altering the overall pitch angle the reduction of the effective angle of attack manifests itself by altering the force distribution between the first and second half of the oscillation cycle in the case of the benchmark blade the peaks are equal at π coll 0 0 while for the new blade designs equal peak behaviour is achieved at larger collective pitch angles an important result of the observed behaviour is the occurrence of the neutral pitch angle or the angle around which zero forward force is produced the equivalent neutral angles can be estimated from the blade based force distributions as shown in fig 13 for s 2 0 a r 2 0 two angles are plotted and the equivalent angle is considered the average of both collective pitch angles 5 4 force based distribution analysis an alternative force analysis and visualisation method was developed by dubois et al 2019a to combine the side force magnitude and phase shift in a single plot the force based distribution plots the force distribution over the azimuthal cycle in a polar plot like manner connecting the end points of each individual time dependent side force vector as such the time dependence is removed from the plot and the link between the blade position and the force orientation disappears all force based distributions do include an indicator line to visualise the resulting direction of the net side force 5 4 1 force based analysis for π coll 0 0 fig 14 plots the force based distribution of the side force at π coll 0 0 for two comparison cases i e benchmark vs best and best vs optimal plots of the blade based distributions are added again to allow direct comparison and further analysis while the benchmark case exhibits two polar patterns of equal size the re designed results combine a small and a large polar pattern the force based polar patterns are directly related to the distinct a symmetric behaviour between the first and second half of the cycle observed in the blade based distributions similar force behaviour with the occurrence of a smaller and larger polar pattern is seen before for the benchmark case at larger collective pitch angles dubois et al 2019a the force based distributions also show how the net side force results from the time dependent forces over the azimuthal cycle the magnitude of the net side force is affected by the force distribution over c f int 0 i e vertical a symmetry over the specified axis in the case of the re designed blades a negative effect is observed in the larger polar pattern where the component of the pattern in the positive intended force direction in essence reduces the magnitude and thus effectiveness of the side force generation an additional form of asymmetry over c f per 0 is observed when looking at the individual polar patterns in the re designed blade cases in fig 14d a drift of both the smaller and larger polar pattern occurs the smaller polar pattern drifts to the right i e positive perpendicular direction while the larger polar pattern does so in the opposite direction because of the drift and the occurring asymmetry the orientation of the net generated side force changes and a phase shift occurs the proportional difference between the small and large polar pattern determines the net effect of the drift occurring and in turn the net orientation of the side force or side force phase shift as indicated by the dotted lines in the force based distributions 5 4 2 force based analysis for π coll 5 0 and π coll 7 5 in figs 15 and 16 the force based distributions for π coll 5 0 and π coll 7 5 respectively are plotted the small vs large polar pattern occurs for all cases and designs in general the initially small polar pattern grows and extends as the collective pitch angle increases while the opposite occurs for the initially larger polar pattern the re designed blade cases tend to approach a point where both polar patterns match up and become equal in size for the s 2 0 a r 1 0 the polar patterns are close to match up at π coll 7 5 while the match up occurs closer to π coll 5 0 for s 2 0 a r 2 0 the observed behaviour is directly related to the earlier discussed neutral pitch angle and will in more detail next analysis of the actual performance parameters based on the force based distribution plots reveals a number of additional insights the benchmark case achieve a similar maximum force coefficient at the highest collective pitch setting but achieves that maximum only for a single polar pattern as such the net resulting force coefficient is much smaller as the secondary polar pattern fails to contribute to the actual side force magnitude the observed phase shifts originate from the asymmetry over c f int 0 0 which becomes more distinct as the collective pitch angle increases and thus results in a larger phase shift interestingly the absolute difference between the phase shifts of the various cases is independent of the collective pitch angle the increased pitch angle thus has the same effect for all cases i e an increasingly larger phase shift as larger pitch angle are applied 5 4 3 neutral collective pitch angle returning to the neutral collective pitch angle assumption and discussion fig 17 plots s 2 0 a r 1 0 for π coll 7 5 and s 2 0 a r 2 0 for an averaged value between π coll 2 5 and 5 0 against the benchmark case at π coll 0 0 the results show an indisputable improvement of the side force magnitude coefficient for the re designed cases as a larger polar pattern signifies a larger net side force magnitude both re designed blades generate a side force with an equal magnitude coefficient at the assumed neutral angle changing the aspect ratio does result in a better net side force magnitude coefficient as the drift of the polar pattern s 2 0 a r 1 0 results in a significant component in the positive intended side force direction the positive intended force component of the polar pattern is directly opposite to the direction of the intended direction and thus reduces the net force coefficient the re designed blades do show a significant difference in the orientation of the polar pattern and the resulting phase shift the observed difference results from the actual absolute pitch angle applied despite the neutral angle assumption the operating pitch angle does proportionally affect the generated drag generated as observed in earlier work the larger collective pitch angle generates larger a larger drag force manifesting itself in larger perpendicular forces and thus a larger side force phase shift 5 5 results synthesis the increased blade surface area has a clear effect on the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance and the ability of the propeller to generate an effective and efficient side force through an increase of the blade surface area the ccpp is able to generate a side force with a larger magnitude while operating at smaller collective pitch angles to reduce the observed side force phase shift as such the various re designed blades ensure that the side force generation becomes both more effective and efficient the observed side force magnitude improvement is equal to the increase of the blade span regardless of the blade aspect ratio by looking at the side force coefficient the optimal approach is established to be the combination of a span increase and an increase of the aspect ratio at pitch angles before stall a higher aspect ratio blade will produce a higher lift coefficient because the blade surface area negatively affected by tip vortices is smaller for a higher aspect ratio blade the blade operates at a higher effective angle of attack and thus produces a relatively larger lift force the new design caused an issue because of the increase span length as a result of the unchanged section profile and orientation over the entire span of the blade i e no blade twist the effective angle of attack of the blade is also simultaneously reduced because of the span increase larger tangential flow velocities occur over large areas of the blade affecting the generated thrust force in essence the re designed blades operate at a reduced overall pitch angle changing the assumption for the neutral pitch angle of the ccpp the final conclusions are synthesized in fig 18 a plot of the net side force vector for each neutral collective pitch angle i e the angle producing zero forward thrust visualises both the side force magnitude absolute and relative and the phase shift the blade with the largest surface area s 2 0 a r 1 0 produces the largest absolute side force while the largest force coefficient is achieved by adjusting the aspect ratio combined with the observed phase shifts the re design through a larger surface area and changed aspect ratio is established as the optimal approach to improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance the results of the current work provide further data and insights for future blade re design and rationalisation of alternative designs within the specified scope first of all the introduction of blade twist enables a constant effective pitch angle to be maintained over the blade span as such eliminating the aforementioned neutral pitch angle issue and related thrust force discrepancy second if a further increase of the side force magnitude is deemed necessary an additional increase of the blade span at the adjusted aspect ratio or further increasing the ratio should be considered however such adjustments need to be investigated both from a hydrodynamic and structural standpoint if the absolute side force is required to double in magnitude the observed hydrodynamic force results suggest a blade design including twist with a blade span of four times the benchmark span at the higher aspect ratio quadrupling the blade surface area structural evaluation of such an approach is essential as the forces and moments in the blade hinge can potentially exceed the structure s limitations finally other blade designs that increase the blade surface area away from the propeller hub in different manners resulting in the operation in flow conditions that are less disturbed by the presence of the auv body i e the wake of the auv and its appendages should be considered furthermore the results enable the formulation of recommendations on potential future alternative design pathways to be investigated and evaluated beyond the scope of the current work as discussed a wide range of potential alternative design pathways remain possible to adjust and ideally improve the ccpp s performance both the blade based and force based distributions of the side force show that only a small force component is generated during parts of the cycle in essence reducing the net effective side force adjusting the actual pitch cycle however is not possible with the current ccpp mechanism alternative mechanisms should aim to adjust and control the absolute pitch angle including considering the effect of the mean angle and can incorporate asymmetric sine like profiles saw tooth profiles non sinusoidal wave forms and combinations of the aforementioned the collective pitch angle cannot be disregarded further as the ccpp should also function as a propulsion and manoeuvring device at speed the propulsion force is observed to be affected at high collective pitch angles but even at smaller angles any break down of the propulsive force can be detrimental to the ccpp s performance a final suggestion is the use of a second propeller to increase the net side force magnitude e g by utilising the tandem propeller concept discussed in literature 6 concluding remarks the work presented in this paper discussed a numerical investigation into improving the performance of the collective and cyclic pitch propeller or ccpp the ccpp is a novel propulsion and manoeuvring system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs through advanced control of the blade pitch both propulsion and manoeuvring forces are generated by a single system the numerical methodology applies an unsteady rans approach on a periodic two zone domain modelling one of the four ccpp blades and enabling blade pitch motion by applying a sliding mesh between the two domain zones ccpp performance is defined by the magnitude and phase shift of the generated manoeuvring or side force respectively quantifying the force generation s effectiveness and efficiency earlier work showed the potential of the numerical model to serve as a force design tool and suggested the evaluation of potential performance improvements based on the lift equation potential pathways are investigated and evaluated based on their ability to increase ccpp s effectiveness and efficiency manifested by a larger side force magnitude without compromising the side force orientation or phase shift rationalisation of the various components of the lift equation lead to the selection of blade design as the ideal pathway to achieve the aforementioned objective a study into the blade design evaluating the effect of an increase of the blade surface at a fixed and a changed aspect ration was set up and conducted increasing the blade surface area leads to the generation of a more effective side force with an absolute larger magnitude as well as based on the non dimensional coefficient based on the actual surface area thus the new design enables the ccpp to operate at a smaller collective pitch angle leading to a reduction of the observed phase shift and thus increase of the side force generation s efficiency the optimal approach to increasing the blade surface area is found in a blade with a larger span length and a larger aspect ratio further analysis of the force distributions did show that the neutral pitch angle i e the angle around which zero forward force generation is to be expected changed as a result of the blade design changes the introduction of blade twist to adapt and compensate for the observed behaviour is suggested as solution in essence the results provided enable the ccpp to operate in a more effective and efficient manner the current work provides initial insight ccpp performance improvement pathways and establish a solid basis for future research into various other aspects of the ccpp s design and operational control based on the developed methodology additional investigations into untested blade designs pitch profiles and even changed blade configurations become possible through further re iteration of the design circle using the developed numerical

21174,the collective and cyclic pitch propeller ccpp is a novel concept designed to propel and manoeuvre autonomous underwater vehicles auvs collective pitch control governs the generated thrust while through cyclic pitch control a manoeuvring force side force is generated recent work concluded that new solutions are needed to achieve large side forces without compromising the observed phase shift in this paper increasing the blade surface area is rationalised as the most effective pathway to achieve improved ccpp performance a three dimensional numerical rans based periodic numerical model was used to evaluate three alternative blade designs clear performance improvements were realised by the new blade design manifested in the ability to generate larger side forces both absolute and relative based on the actual surface area at much smaller phase shifts a performance improvement relation was established stating that optimal improvement is realised by increasing both the blade s surface area and aspect ratio at higher aspect ratios the side force is produced in a more efficient manner both from a general force behaviour and a side force force generation perspective finally an important note was made regarding the future introduction of blade twist in order to address an observed effect on the neutral pitch angle keywords auv collective and cyclic pitch propulsion manoeuvring design 1 introduction the collective and cyclic pitch propeller ccpp investigated here is a novel propulsion and manoeuvring system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs developed by humphrey et al 2004 by introducing advanced blade control the ccpp is able to generate propulsion and manoeuvring forces at both low and high speeds and combines long endurance travelling efficiency and low speed manoeuvring effectiveness the advanced blade control allows the pitch angle of the propeller blades to change both simultaneously collective and individually over the rotational cycle cyclic humphrey 2005 based the design of the ccpp on a study of several patents submitted over the past decades gadefelt 1965 lindahl 1966 haselton 1963 wham et al 1987 reich and uhrich 1990 schneider 1993 silberg et al 2015 humphrey showed through experimental testing that the ccpp was able to propel control and manoeuvre a torpedo shaped auv the ccpp was further investigated by niyomka 2014 and tran 2018 who confirmed the ccpp s capabilities to generate substantial manoeuvring forces through experimental research along with performance prediction programs and manoeuvring simulations early experimental research showed the capabilities of the concept to generate transverse forces of any magnitude and direction at all speeds joosen et al 1963 haselton and rice 1966 further work by joosen et al 1963 into the concept s feasibility identified the capabilities of the concept to reduce unsteady flow effects jessup 1976 confirmed the newly identified abilities by showing improvements in propulsive power combined with improved visible cavitation and vibration performance when applying cyclic pitch control experimental investigation and full scale sea trials of a so called pinnate propeller simonsson 1981 1984 showed similar results as did gabriel and atlar 1998 when investigating optimal cyclic pitch profiles later a report on the applications of cyclic pitch thrusters was published by murray et al 1994 identifying the full potential of collective and cyclic pitch propellers through numerical evaluation and rapid prototype development of a propeller for a navy vehicle similar systems were tested now referred to as a variable vector propeller varivec to be used in the control and operation of a real time imaging underwater vehicle nagashima et al 2006 and to investigate the influence of different oscillation cycle profiles chang et al 2007 the tandem propeller system was later revived by chen et al 2008 2009 he combined numerical prediction and simulation with experimental work to develop a demo vehicle and a preliminary controller for the propeller capable of motions in six degrees of freedom in this paper the recommendations of niyomka 2014 and tran 2018 and the rich history of research into the concept were used as basis for a continued investigation into the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance dubois 2019 formulated the objective to improve the ccpp s performance using a novel numerical methodology in order to develop the system into a viable and feasible propulsion and manoeuvring alternative traditional propeller performance analysis and improvement studies focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of the generated propulsion force carlton 2012 various blade design parameters such as blade rake skew twist and fabrication material and their effect on the propulsive performance of a propeller are investigated at length krasilnikov et al 2009 ji et al 2011 hayati et al 2012 he et al 2012 such an approach however cannot be applied for the ccpp as the main focus of the ccpp is the generation of side forces i e forces perpendicular to the direction of motion and thus in the propeller plane based on earlier work by the current authors a different approach is selected to determine pathways to improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance as will be discussed at length in this paper as such the current work evaluated and analysed the effect of changing the blade design on the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance first the paper discusses the applied numerical methodology and research philosophy to formulate and rationalise the chosen design pathway to be evaluated further next the study is outlined and set up to provide detailed insight into the chosen new blade designs as well as into the performance analysis and comparison approach finally the results of the performance evaluation and comparison are discussed and analysed before formulating the concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 ccpp characterisation the design and working principle of the ccpp is based on two concepts first collective pitch control allows the ccpp blades to adjust the blade pitch collectively i e changing the pitch of all blades simultaneously collective pitch control is used to govern the direction and magnitude of the generated propulsion force second cyclic pitch control enables the blade pitch of each individual blade to oscillate over the rotational or azimuthal cycle a force imbalance is generated over the cycle by the introduction of cyclic pitch control in turn resulting in a net manoeuvring or side force the ccpp shown in fig 1 is a four bladed propeller with interchangeable bolted on blades with a naca0012 profile a sinusoidal pitch profile is controlled by a swash plate mechanism through a control equation the collective pitch angle can be set between 20 and 20 while a maximum pitch amplitude of 20 can be reached the rotational speed of the propeller is limited to 600 r p m with a counter clockwise rotational direction an extended examination of the ccpp s working principle and a full overview of the ccpp s control and geometry characteristics is found in earlier work humphrey et al 2004 dubois 2019 additionally dubois 2019 discussed the history of research into and patents on the concept of collective and cyclic pitch control for the propulsion and manoeuvring of maritime vehicles and synthesized the merits of the concept 2 2 numerical model the development applicability methodology and use of the numerical model used in the current study is discussed at length in earlier work dubois et al 2017 2019a 2019b dubois 2019 in summary the ansys fluent16 0 model solves the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans with the application of the k ω sst transition turbulence model on a periodic flow domain combined with a sliding mesh approach a visualisation of the flow domain is found in fig 2 providing details on and insight into the different aspects of the simulation set up the flow domain consists of two zones connected through a sliding mesh interface to allow blade pitching or rotation independent of the propeller hub rotation motions of both the inner and outer zone are defined through user defined functions with a quaternion based algorithm to sum pitching blade motion and propeller rotation motion for the inner zone the cyclic pitch angle and rotational speed are set in the motion algorithms while the collective pitch angle and the flow velocity are set in the solver itself for future use the applied numerical parameters convergence criteria and computational mesh used in the commercial solver are discussed briefly additional information can be found in earlier work dubois et al 2017 2019b the pressure based solver used a piso algorithm for the pressure velocity coupling with spatial discretisation of the gradients least squares cell based pressure discretisation was achieved through a second order method and both momentum and turbulence parameters were discretised using second order upwind schemes for the time discretisation a bounded second order implicit dual time stepping method was applied spatial discretisation was based on a multi block structured hex grid approach ensuring a y of 1 around the hydrofoil propeller blade the flow simulations were initiated based on earlier calculations if available or the general inflow condition mitigation of start up effects was monitored by analysis of the average force values per cycle as such the oscillatory or periodic convergence is assured and the average of the last 10 cycles of each force component was used for further force and performance analysis further convergence within each time step was monitored through the continuity equation convergence tolerance set at 10 4 extensive verification and validation of the numerical methodology was performed based on a number of significant operational cases the verification study and uncertainty estimation study dubois et al 2019b established the discretisation approach for future performance investigations and showed the ability of the developed methodology to provide satisfactory results with respect to the total numerical uncertainty introduced in the validation study dubois 2019 the relation between the validation comparison error and the validation uncertainty was investigated for a wide range of cases and operational conditions closer analysis demonstrated that when applying higher combined pitch angles the validation percentage dropped significantly while results were validated at lower pitch values furthermore trend wise agreement between the results of both performance parameters was observed direct comparison of the numerical and experimental results showed the methodology s ability to predict and simulate the same effect of the cyclic pitch angle the collective pitch angle and the flow velocity on the monitored performance parameters the observed discrepancies in predicted values were related to the uncertainty in the relation between the input and output values of the experimental pitch angle in summary the validation study justified the use of the numerical methodology for further analysis of the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance as presented in the current work 2 3 hydrodynamic performance definition and force design the generated manoeuvring or side force defines the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance considered in the current investigation decomposition of the side force in a magnitude and a phase shift component facilitates the quantification and examination of the respective effectiveness and efficiency of the force generation the side force results from the sum of the forces in the propeller s rotational plane y z plane as visualised in figs 1 and 2 as such eq 1 defines the magnitude of the side force f s by the vector sum of the forces in the rotational plane the side force phase shift φ s is determined by the difference between the azimuthal orientation of the side force φ y z and the intended orientation φ int visualised in fig 3 together with the definition of the azimuthal position the intended orientation of the side force is controlled by the ccpp control mechanism and assumes a direct relation between the force orientation and the pitch profile a positive phase shift indicates a clockwise azimuthal shift or an azimuthal advance and negative values referring to a counterclockwise shift or azimuthal delay in order to further remove directional bias the force analysis will not discuss forces in the y and z components but refer to the intended and perpendicular force components the positive intended force component and direction is established to be in the negative z direction in the current work following from this the positive perpendicular component refers to the positive y direction the intended force direction signifies the desired force direction to enable the expected auv motion while the perpendicular force component defines the generation of unexpected or undesired forces and thus motions 1 f s f y 2 f z 2 φ s φ int φ y z the current numerical research efforts resulted in the formulation of several key conclusions regarding the ccpp s performance dubois et al 2018 used a simplified two dimensional numerical methodology to conclude that under bollard pull condition a compromise has to be made between the magnitude and phase shift of the generated side force at moderate pitch angles dynamic stall over the pitching foil aids in the generation of a side force with an increasingly larger magnitude as the pitch angle is increased however at larger angles the effect breaks down and a substantial drag force and pitching moment result causing a significant phase shift to occur as such the effectiveness of the force generation collides with the inability to do so in an efficient manner later dubois et al 2019a focused on the re design of the forces involved through the use of the discussed three dimensional numerical methodology the research confirmed the earlier results for a wider range of operational and flow conditions both investigations reasoned that efficient force generation becomes impossible beyond a certain threshold pitch angle even when compensating for the observed phase shift through control of the pitch profile the generated forces at high pitch angles are effective but the force generation originates from ineffective drag generation instead of lift a different approach has to be taken to ensure the generation of a sufficiently large side force without the associated phase shifts found at higher pitch angles i e a side force that is both effective and efficient 3 design alternative rationalisation 3 1 introduction to rationalisation dubois et al 2019a concluded that the developed numerical methodology would be an effective tool to re design and improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance the multitude of possible approaches and pathways that can be taken to improve the ccpp s performance necessitates a preliminary investigation of alternative designs and operational modes as such the most appropriate optimal and more importantly the most effective approach or pathway can be rationalised and motivated a complete re design of the ccpp and its mechanism is not considered in the current work the full re design of the ccpp would initially bring forward more questions than direct answers or solutions furthermore the design and building of a new ccpp mechanism would involve significant costs while the current mechanism is still functional operational and capable as observed in earlier research the most straightforward path to achieve improved hydrodynamic performance of the ccpp is through investigation of both operational and physical adjustments of the ccpp earlier work established the benefits of the analogy between the ccpp and pitching hydrofoils the analogy showed the importance of the lift and drag generated over the propeller blades and their effect on the effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting side force the suggestion was made to link ccpp s performance and the different operational and physical parameters through the lift equation as presented in eq 2 2 l c l 1 2 ρ u 2 a b the lift equation formulates the relation between the lift l and the lift coefficient c l multiplied by the fluid density ρ the flow velocity u squared and the blade surface area a b the fluid density is the only component that is not considered further as the fluid density cannot be changed a step by step analysis of the various components of the lift equation and their influence on the ccpp s performance without disregarding the drag effect is conducted to establish the optimal pathway for further investigation 3 2 lift coefficient the lift coefficient is established for a specific blade type at a chosen angle of attack in general the lift coefficient of a blade type is determined under controlled circumstances re formulating eq 2 with all parameters set and measurements of the generated lift made both the blade type and applied angle of attack can be manipulated directly and are thus potential candidates to realise improved force generation performance humphrey et al 2004 chose to fit the ccpp with interchangeable blades with a constant naca0012 profile along the blade span the blades have no twist and a limited taper ratio of 0 7 adding the geometric parameters that define the profile type results in a long list of potential blade type alternatives alternative blade types are interesting options for further investigation the blades are interchangeable meaning the costs of such a change would be relatively low and research in the past has shown that a different blade type can have significant influence on the propeller performance carlton 2012 building further on the understanding developed relatively small design changes are prioritised as an efficient method to improve the performance of a complex system additionally other components discussed next are considered to have more potential in realising direct improved performance the effective angle of attack of the blade is a result of the blade type the flow conditions and the pitch angle direct and effective control of the angle of attack is achieved through the pitch angle as discussed in sub section 2 3 and earlier work dubois et al 2018 2019a the pitch angle controls the generated lift and drag forces and consequently the performance of the side force generation operation at smaller pitch angles i e lower angles of attack was recommended stating other options had to be investigated to realise a larger force magnitude besides adjusting the magnitude of the angle of attack or pitch changes to the actual profile of the angle are possible 3 3 flow velocity the flow velocity over the pitching blades is defined by the ccpp s rotational speed and the auv s forward velocity both parameters cannot be changed drastically as the current ccpp was designed within a specific rotational speed and forward velocity range experimental and numerical work have shown that increasing the rotational speed leads to minor increases of the side force magnitude without compromising nor improving the phase shift dubois et al 2018 dubois 2019 further increases of the speed are not considered further as fitting the ccpp with a motor with a larger achievable rotational speed would increase the angle of attack beyond what is efficient and potentially overload the blade pitching mechanism similar conclusions were drawn about the forward velocity of the auv tran et al 2018 dubois 2019 furthermore the uncertainty in the relation between the generated propulsive force and the achieved auv velocity has not been addressed yet effectively making that option not viable within the current research scope 3 4 blade surface area the final parameter in the lift equation is the blade surface area defined by the blade span the chord length and the taper ratio adjustments to the blade surface area are straightforward and can be applied systematically furthermore the linear relation between the lift force magnitude and the surface area means that a direct impact on the performance can be expected finally and importantly no relation between the blade surface area and the pitch angle has been established implying that a negative effect of an increased surface area on the side force phase shift is improbable the blade surface area parameter is thus rationalised as the ideal most straightforward and pragmatic pathway to achieve the desired performance improvements in essence the blade surface area parameter provides a good design study starting point without unnecessary design implications other than variations in the hydrodynamics however the complex non linear behaviour of the ccpp not present in standard propellers due to the highly unsteady nature of the flow requires the full mobilisation of the developed analysis tools to investigate the relatively simple parametric variation of the blade surface area 4 study outline and set up the numerical study into the blade surface area effect needs the further definition of the blade alternatives to be investigated as well as selection of appropriate pitch and flow conditions based on the rationalisation and earlier research results a concise but fundamental test matrix is developed to allow evaluation of the different design variables a single cyclic pitch angle π cycl 10 0 propeller rotational speed n 300 r p m and flow velocity u 1 2 m s are selected additionally the collective pitch angle is limited to π cycl 7 5 except benchmark case to maintain control over the phase shift and hence the direction of the off axis manoeuvring forces the sinusoidal pitch profile is defined by eq 3 as a function of the azimuthal position of the blade or the dimensionless time t with the t t t based on the actual time t and the oscillation rotational period t 60 n s the rotational or pitch cycle starts at φ azi 0 0 or t 0 00 a single intended force direction is chosen as the symmetry of the ccpp and the numerical methodology allows the representation of all directis through a single direction directional independence is ensured fig 3 presented in sub section 2 3 provides additional insight into definition of the different angles and directions in the current case the intended force orientation is φ int 90 i e occurrence of maximum pitch angle which translates to an intended force purely in the negative z direction to further remove the directional bias references to the y and z force components are substituted by the terms perpendicular and intended force components respectively 3 π φ azi π coll π cycl sin φ azi with φ azi 2 π t three alternative blade designs are developed by increasing the blade surface area i e scaling the original or benchmark blade through the blade span and chord length the geometries of the four blades are presented in fig 4 the first two designs double the blade span without and with similar scaling of the chord length resulting in a respective doubling and quadrupling of the blade surface area while scaling of the chord length accordingly ensure the aspect ratio remains unchanged the changed aspect ratio case enables investigation of the aspect ratio parameter effect the fourth design is added to investigate the effect of the linear increase of the blade surface area i e doubling and later quadrupling at the same aspect ratio as the benchmark design minor adjustments were made to the scaled blade designs visualised by the dotted lines in fig 4 the adjustments are aimed to avoid both physical and numerical blade overlapping while keeping the pitch point of each design the same a short parameter evaluation showed that the effects of the adjustments were minor with a reduction of the actual blade surface area and the effective aspect ratio by less than 5 selection of the applied collective pitch angles is done to allow both direct and area weighted results comparison an overview of the cases and comparisons to be conducted is found in table 1 direct comparison of the results is possible based on three collective pitch angles while three area weighted comparison studies based on the altered angle of attack are defined the area weighted comparison is based on the relation between the increase in blade surface area and an equivalent decrease of the applied pitch angle as such the redesigned blade with double the surface area should generate an equivalent force as the benchmark blade but with a lower efficiency penalty i e a smaller side force phase shift because of the smaller applied collective pitch angle results of the analysis are presented in main parts first the mean performance results are discussed second the observed performance change is investigated further by calculating the improvement factors for both the side force effectiveness and efficiency i e force magnitude and phase shift next a two part analysis expands the observations by examination of both the blade based and force based distributions a difference which will be discussed in the relevant sections finally the observations are concluded and summarised by a final performance comparison 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of mean force components and performance the mean of the azimuthal forces determines the resulting auv manoeuvring and is analysed to provide initial insight into and overview of the results evaluation of the influence of the collective pitch angle on the mean performance of the different blade designs establishes the foundations for further detailed investigations 5 1 1 intended and perpendicular force components first the intended and perpendicular force components are plotted in fig 5 the intended and perpendicular force components are introduced to remove directional bias from the analysis as discussed in the study outline in sub section 2 3 a similar relation between the collective pitch angle and both force components is generally observed to be trend wise consistent for all blade designs fig 5a reveals a near independence of the intended force component on the collective pitch angle in fig 5b larger pitch angles are seen to result in an increase of the perpendicular force component important to note for future discussion is the sign change of the force component for s 2 0 a r 2 0 changed aspect ratio cases 5 1 2 side force magnitude and phase shift fig 6 combines the intended and perpendicular component results and shows that the collective pitch angle has little influence on the side force magnitude within the tested range of collective pitch angles the side force magnitude of the benchmark case increases slightly at higher collective pitch angles as a consequence of an equivalent increase of the perpendicular force component observed in fig 5b for the s 2 0 a r 1 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 re designs same aspect ratio cases the increase of the perpendicular force component is counter acted by a decreasing intended force component resulting in the near independence of the side force magnitude on the applied collective pitch angle both observations on the intended and perpendicular force components come together in the side force phase shift results plotted in fig 6b the side force phase shift becomes increasingly more positive at higher collective pitch angles as such for most cases the perpendicular force component is concluded to directly influence the size of the phase shift the force behaviour has been discussed in detail in the methodology discussion and performance definition as the pitch angle increases the associated drag forces take over resulting in a large perpendicular force component and thus the observed phase shift 5 1 3 additional performance parameters two additional performance parameters are introduced to help visualise the performance differences between the blade designs in more detail fig 7 a plots the side force magnitude coefficient non dimensionalising the results the side force magnitude coefficient calculated as c f s f s 0 5 ρ u 2 a b does not change the relation between the force generated and the collective pitch angle a different relation between the different blade designs does emerge as the main parameter differentiating the cases is the blade surfaces area the effect will be discussed further in the next sub section in fig 7b the relative contribution of the intended force component to the total side force magnitude is plotted for three of the collective pitch angles in general the contribution of the intended force component becomes smaller at higher collective pitch angles for all blade designs resulting in contributions as low as 75 the initial increase of the contribution for s 2 0 a r 2 0 is related to the sign change of the perpendicular force component and is not regarded as a discrepancy 5 2 initial performance improvement examination a performance improvement factor is introduced to enable explicit comparison of the effect of the different blade re designs analysis based on the direct and area weighted approach for the side force magnitude the side force magnitude coefficient as well as the side force phase shift is to be done the factor the specified performance variable for each new blade design to the benchmark result by simply dividing both results direct comparison compares the results at the same collective pitch angle while the area weighted approach uses the equivalent angles determined based on the blade surface area relation listed in table 1 in the study outline 5 2 1 side force magnitude and coefficient fig 8 a shows through direct comparison that all re designs realise an improved effectiveness of the side force generation i e generation of a side force with a larger magnitude than the benchmark case the smallest improvement for s 2 0 a r 1 0 realises an average improvement factor of 2 8 while s 2 0 a r 2 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 result in an improvement factor of 5 0 and 8 5 respectively a larger blade surface area thus as expected results in the generation of a larger side force at equal collective pitch angles additionally and more importantly a larger side force coefficient results as well seen in fig 8b the increase of the side force magnitude coefficient indicates the ability to generate a larger force per equivalent blade surface area an increase of 2 5 2 3 and 1 5 of the side force magnitude coefficient in order of the listed and plotted results is observed fig 9 plots the average performance improvement factor of the absolute side force magnitude and coefficient against the increase in the blade surface area the plot is supported by indicator lines to illustrate potential growth rates g r a b between the blade surface increase and the improvement factor a closer look at the absolute side force magnitudes crosses shows the improvement factor and thus growth rate is quantified by the relative increase of the blade span regardless of the aspect ratio from s 2 0 a r 1 0 to s 2 0 a r 1 0 the improvement factor jumps from the middle indicator line to the top one indicating a higher and non linear rate of improvement as function of the blade surface increase a different trend is observed from the coefficient results for s 2 0 a r 1 0 and s 2 0 a r 1 0 the continued increase of the blade surface area no longer improves the performance proportionally the growth rate of both cases is below 1 and appears to become lower as the blade surface area is increased the most effective and efficient method to increase the side force magnitude through a larger blade surface in absolute and coefficient terms is realised by adjusting the blade span only and thus changing the aspect ratio as seen for s 2 0 a r 2 0 the performance improvement factors for both the absolute magnitude and the coefficient can be estimated based on the applied parameters and the observed results for the absolute side force magnitude the factor is found by multiplying the blade surface increase factor with the equivalent span increase factor for the side force magnitude coefficient the improvement factor estimation is equal to the estimator for the absolute side force magnitude improvement divided by the equivalent blade surface increase 5 2 2 side force phase shift the observed increase of the side force generation s effectiveness will only be of value if the associated efficiency i e phase shift exhibits similar improvements in fig 10 a the results are plotted for the direct comparison and no improvements of the phase shift are observed the improvement factors are above 1 0 with exception of the higher pitch angles of s 2 0 a r 2 0 the values for π coll 0 0 are scaled and originate from the near zero phase shift of the benchmark case a direct relation between the large phase shifts of s 2 0 a r 1 0 s 2 0 a r 1 0 seen earlier in fig 6 and the perpendicular side force component contribution observed in fig 5 exists however the magnitude increases do not come at the cost of extreme phase shifts φ s 45 0 and larger found in earlier work when applying larger collective pitch angle to realise an increase of the force magnitude the area weighted comparison in fig 10b further strengthens the case for the re designed blades because large side force magnitudes are achieved independent of the collective pitch angle the ccpp can operate at lower collective pitch angles the area weighted comparison reducing the applied collective pitch angle by the factor of the blade surface increase compares the blade designs for three cases as established in table 1 operating at lower collective pitch angles results in a significant reduction of the phase shift the observed reductions bring the phase shift down to below 20 0 while ensuring a side force of sufficient effectiveness and magnitude fig 10b indicates that the biggest improvements are achieved for s 2 0 a r 2 0 and thus after changing the blade s aspect ratio 5 2 3 combining effectiveness and efficiency the direct and area weighted comparison of the performance results enables the determination of a best and an optimal case with regard to the side force effectiveness and efficiency the best case is defined as the case generating the largest absolute side force while the optimal case refers to the largest side force coefficient combined with the smallest possible side force phase shift as such the best case is s 2 0 a r 1 0 and the optimal case is s 2 0 a r 2 0 further evaluation of the results will only evaluate aforementioned cases no longer considering s 2 0 a r 1 0 additionally only force coefficients will be plotted and discussed allowing for a more straightforward and unbiased comparison 5 3 blade based distribution analysis the mean results are derived from time dependent force distributions over the azimuthal cycle a brief initial analysis is presented based on the blade based force distributions in which the directionality of the force components is disregarded to aid the analysis fig 11 plots the actual and absolute pitch angle profiles as a function of azimuthal position and dimensionless time 5 3 1 pitch profiles for different applied collective pitch angles fig 12 s shows that the benchmark case results of the side force magnitude match the trends of the absolute pitch profile values as visualised in fig 11b as the collective pitch angle is increased the force distribution becomes increasingly more asymmetric as was observed in earlier work dubois et al 2019a the re designed blade results show a different trend plotted in fig 12b and c and exhibit an increase of the peak before t 0 50 φ azi 180 0 and a smaller magnitude peak after as the collective pitch angle becomes larger further analysis does show that an increase of the collective pitch angle has the same effect on the actual force behaviour for all blade designs in short larger pitch angles increase the magnitude of the first peak and decrease that of the second peak when reversing the observed effect the re designed larger blades appear to operate at a lower effective collective pitch angle the increase of the blade span significantly increases the magnitude of the tangential flow velocities over large sections of the blade as such reducing the apparent angle of attack of the flow and in turn altering the overall pitch angle the reduction of the effective angle of attack manifests itself by altering the force distribution between the first and second half of the oscillation cycle in the case of the benchmark blade the peaks are equal at π coll 0 0 while for the new blade designs equal peak behaviour is achieved at larger collective pitch angles an important result of the observed behaviour is the occurrence of the neutral pitch angle or the angle around which zero forward force is produced the equivalent neutral angles can be estimated from the blade based force distributions as shown in fig 13 for s 2 0 a r 2 0 two angles are plotted and the equivalent angle is considered the average of both collective pitch angles 5 4 force based distribution analysis an alternative force analysis and visualisation method was developed by dubois et al 2019a to combine the side force magnitude and phase shift in a single plot the force based distribution plots the force distribution over the azimuthal cycle in a polar plot like manner connecting the end points of each individual time dependent side force vector as such the time dependence is removed from the plot and the link between the blade position and the force orientation disappears all force based distributions do include an indicator line to visualise the resulting direction of the net side force 5 4 1 force based analysis for π coll 0 0 fig 14 plots the force based distribution of the side force at π coll 0 0 for two comparison cases i e benchmark vs best and best vs optimal plots of the blade based distributions are added again to allow direct comparison and further analysis while the benchmark case exhibits two polar patterns of equal size the re designed results combine a small and a large polar pattern the force based polar patterns are directly related to the distinct a symmetric behaviour between the first and second half of the cycle observed in the blade based distributions similar force behaviour with the occurrence of a smaller and larger polar pattern is seen before for the benchmark case at larger collective pitch angles dubois et al 2019a the force based distributions also show how the net side force results from the time dependent forces over the azimuthal cycle the magnitude of the net side force is affected by the force distribution over c f int 0 i e vertical a symmetry over the specified axis in the case of the re designed blades a negative effect is observed in the larger polar pattern where the component of the pattern in the positive intended force direction in essence reduces the magnitude and thus effectiveness of the side force generation an additional form of asymmetry over c f per 0 is observed when looking at the individual polar patterns in the re designed blade cases in fig 14d a drift of both the smaller and larger polar pattern occurs the smaller polar pattern drifts to the right i e positive perpendicular direction while the larger polar pattern does so in the opposite direction because of the drift and the occurring asymmetry the orientation of the net generated side force changes and a phase shift occurs the proportional difference between the small and large polar pattern determines the net effect of the drift occurring and in turn the net orientation of the side force or side force phase shift as indicated by the dotted lines in the force based distributions 5 4 2 force based analysis for π coll 5 0 and π coll 7 5 in figs 15 and 16 the force based distributions for π coll 5 0 and π coll 7 5 respectively are plotted the small vs large polar pattern occurs for all cases and designs in general the initially small polar pattern grows and extends as the collective pitch angle increases while the opposite occurs for the initially larger polar pattern the re designed blade cases tend to approach a point where both polar patterns match up and become equal in size for the s 2 0 a r 1 0 the polar patterns are close to match up at π coll 7 5 while the match up occurs closer to π coll 5 0 for s 2 0 a r 2 0 the observed behaviour is directly related to the earlier discussed neutral pitch angle and will in more detail next analysis of the actual performance parameters based on the force based distribution plots reveals a number of additional insights the benchmark case achieve a similar maximum force coefficient at the highest collective pitch setting but achieves that maximum only for a single polar pattern as such the net resulting force coefficient is much smaller as the secondary polar pattern fails to contribute to the actual side force magnitude the observed phase shifts originate from the asymmetry over c f int 0 0 which becomes more distinct as the collective pitch angle increases and thus results in a larger phase shift interestingly the absolute difference between the phase shifts of the various cases is independent of the collective pitch angle the increased pitch angle thus has the same effect for all cases i e an increasingly larger phase shift as larger pitch angle are applied 5 4 3 neutral collective pitch angle returning to the neutral collective pitch angle assumption and discussion fig 17 plots s 2 0 a r 1 0 for π coll 7 5 and s 2 0 a r 2 0 for an averaged value between π coll 2 5 and 5 0 against the benchmark case at π coll 0 0 the results show an indisputable improvement of the side force magnitude coefficient for the re designed cases as a larger polar pattern signifies a larger net side force magnitude both re designed blades generate a side force with an equal magnitude coefficient at the assumed neutral angle changing the aspect ratio does result in a better net side force magnitude coefficient as the drift of the polar pattern s 2 0 a r 1 0 results in a significant component in the positive intended side force direction the positive intended force component of the polar pattern is directly opposite to the direction of the intended direction and thus reduces the net force coefficient the re designed blades do show a significant difference in the orientation of the polar pattern and the resulting phase shift the observed difference results from the actual absolute pitch angle applied despite the neutral angle assumption the operating pitch angle does proportionally affect the generated drag generated as observed in earlier work the larger collective pitch angle generates larger a larger drag force manifesting itself in larger perpendicular forces and thus a larger side force phase shift 5 5 results synthesis the increased blade surface area has a clear effect on the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance and the ability of the propeller to generate an effective and efficient side force through an increase of the blade surface area the ccpp is able to generate a side force with a larger magnitude while operating at smaller collective pitch angles to reduce the observed side force phase shift as such the various re designed blades ensure that the side force generation becomes both more effective and efficient the observed side force magnitude improvement is equal to the increase of the blade span regardless of the blade aspect ratio by looking at the side force coefficient the optimal approach is established to be the combination of a span increase and an increase of the aspect ratio at pitch angles before stall a higher aspect ratio blade will produce a higher lift coefficient because the blade surface area negatively affected by tip vortices is smaller for a higher aspect ratio blade the blade operates at a higher effective angle of attack and thus produces a relatively larger lift force the new design caused an issue because of the increase span length as a result of the unchanged section profile and orientation over the entire span of the blade i e no blade twist the effective angle of attack of the blade is also simultaneously reduced because of the span increase larger tangential flow velocities occur over large areas of the blade affecting the generated thrust force in essence the re designed blades operate at a reduced overall pitch angle changing the assumption for the neutral pitch angle of the ccpp the final conclusions are synthesized in fig 18 a plot of the net side force vector for each neutral collective pitch angle i e the angle producing zero forward thrust visualises both the side force magnitude absolute and relative and the phase shift the blade with the largest surface area s 2 0 a r 1 0 produces the largest absolute side force while the largest force coefficient is achieved by adjusting the aspect ratio combined with the observed phase shifts the re design through a larger surface area and changed aspect ratio is established as the optimal approach to improve the ccpp s hydrodynamic performance the results of the current work provide further data and insights for future blade re design and rationalisation of alternative designs within the specified scope first of all the introduction of blade twist enables a constant effective pitch angle to be maintained over the blade span as such eliminating the aforementioned neutral pitch angle issue and related thrust force discrepancy second if a further increase of the side force magnitude is deemed necessary an additional increase of the blade span at the adjusted aspect ratio or further increasing the ratio should be considered however such adjustments need to be investigated both from a hydrodynamic and structural standpoint if the absolute side force is required to double in magnitude the observed hydrodynamic force results suggest a blade design including twist with a blade span of four times the benchmark span at the higher aspect ratio quadrupling the blade surface area structural evaluation of such an approach is essential as the forces and moments in the blade hinge can potentially exceed the structure s limitations finally other blade designs that increase the blade surface area away from the propeller hub in different manners resulting in the operation in flow conditions that are less disturbed by the presence of the auv body i e the wake of the auv and its appendages should be considered furthermore the results enable the formulation of recommendations on potential future alternative design pathways to be investigated and evaluated beyond the scope of the current work as discussed a wide range of potential alternative design pathways remain possible to adjust and ideally improve the ccpp s performance both the blade based and force based distributions of the side force show that only a small force component is generated during parts of the cycle in essence reducing the net effective side force adjusting the actual pitch cycle however is not possible with the current ccpp mechanism alternative mechanisms should aim to adjust and control the absolute pitch angle including considering the effect of the mean angle and can incorporate asymmetric sine like profiles saw tooth profiles non sinusoidal wave forms and combinations of the aforementioned the collective pitch angle cannot be disregarded further as the ccpp should also function as a propulsion and manoeuvring device at speed the propulsion force is observed to be affected at high collective pitch angles but even at smaller angles any break down of the propulsive force can be detrimental to the ccpp s performance a final suggestion is the use of a second propeller to increase the net side force magnitude e g by utilising the tandem propeller concept discussed in literature 6 concluding remarks the work presented in this paper discussed a numerical investigation into improving the performance of the collective and cyclic pitch propeller or ccpp the ccpp is a novel propulsion and manoeuvring system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs through advanced control of the blade pitch both propulsion and manoeuvring forces are generated by a single system the numerical methodology applies an unsteady rans approach on a periodic two zone domain modelling one of the four ccpp blades and enabling blade pitch motion by applying a sliding mesh between the two domain zones ccpp performance is defined by the magnitude and phase shift of the generated manoeuvring or side force respectively quantifying the force generation s effectiveness and efficiency earlier work showed the potential of the numerical model to serve as a force design tool and suggested the evaluation of potential performance improvements based on the lift equation potential pathways are investigated and evaluated based on their ability to increase ccpp s effectiveness and efficiency manifested by a larger side force magnitude without compromising the side force orientation or phase shift rationalisation of the various components of the lift equation lead to the selection of blade design as the ideal pathway to achieve the aforementioned objective a study into the blade design evaluating the effect of an increase of the blade surface at a fixed and a changed aspect ration was set up and conducted increasing the blade surface area leads to the generation of a more effective side force with an absolute larger magnitude as well as based on the non dimensional coefficient based on the actual surface area thus the new design enables the ccpp to operate at a smaller collective pitch angle leading to a reduction of the observed phase shift and thus increase of the side force generation s efficiency the optimal approach to increasing the blade surface area is found in a blade with a larger span length and a larger aspect ratio further analysis of the force distributions did show that the neutral pitch angle i e the angle around which zero forward force generation is to be expected changed as a result of the blade design changes the introduction of blade twist to adapt and compensate for the observed behaviour is suggested as solution in essence the results provided enable the ccpp to operate in a more effective and efficient manner the current work provides initial insight ccpp performance improvement pathways and establish a solid basis for future research into various other aspects of the ccpp s design and operational control based on the developed methodology additional investigations into untested blade designs pitch profiles and even changed blade configurations become possible through further re iteration of the design circle using the developed numerical methodology the ccpp might finally fulfil its potential as viable auv propulsion and manoeuvring system credit authorship contribution statement a dubois conceptualization methodology validation
