19515,anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes using microbial mixed cultures is a promising avenue to treat residues and obtain added value products however the process has some important limitations that prevented so far any industrial application one of the main issues is that we are not able to predict reliably the product spectrum i e the stoichiometry of the process because the complex microbial community behaviour is not completely understood to address this issue in this work we propose a new metabolic network of glucose fermentation by microbial mixed cultures that incorporates electron bifurcation and homoacetogenesis our methodology uses nadh balances to analyse published experimental data and evaluate the new stoichiometry proposed our results prove for the first time the inclusion of electron bifurcation in the metabolic network as a better description of the experimental results homoacetogenesis has been used to explain the discrepancies between observed and theoretically predicted yields of gaseous h2 and co2 and it appears as the best solution among other options studied overall this work supports the consideration of electron bifurcation as an important biochemical mechanism in microbial mixed cultures fermentations and underlines the importance of considering homoacetogenesis when analysing anaerobic fermentations keywords electron bifurcation acidogenic fermentation mixed culture homoacetogenesis stoichiometry 1 introduction the recent advances in environmental technologies brought a change of paradigm regarding the organic waste materials they are now seen as potential renewable sources for a plethora of bioprocesses agler et al 2011 angenent et al 2004 kleerebezem et al 2015 and the generation of added value products from otherwise waste materials is now a promising avenue to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels to decrease the amount of untreated pollutants released to the environment and to work towards a more sustainable and circular economy among these bioprocess anaerobic systems are one of the most attractive options the absence of o2 as strong electron acceptor limits the biomass growth and allows the generation of high energy density products that could be used as biofuels or chemical building blocks agler et al 2011 so far one of the successful examples is the anaerobic digestion which has become a well established technology for biogas production however the use of biogas as biofuel is limited because its low volumetric energy density and the low price of the natural gas consequently other avenues should be considered for organic wastes valorisation most of the novel initiatives for obtaining higher added value products from organic wastes involve the use of mixed culture fermentations mcfs kleerebezem et al 2015 these are anaerobic processes in which methanogenesis is inhibited and substrates are converted into a mixture of short carboxylates also known as volatile fatty acids vfas e g acetate propionate or butyrate alcohols mainly ethanol h2 and co2 vfas are already valuable products themselves but they also can act as substrates or building blocks for several other bioprocesses producing biofuels bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoate family or biosolvents alternatively vfas can be used for electricity generation in microbial fuel cells or for h2 production agler et al 2011 angenent et al 2004 kleerebezem et al 2015 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 moreover h2 is a valuable by product of mcfs because it has potential as biofuel and energy vector bundhoo and mohee 2016 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 conversion of organic wastes into a short carboxylate pool and co2 and h2 is envisioned as one of the biorefinery platforms the carboxylate platform agler et al 2011 the use of mixed culture systems has several advantages these are systems that do not need sterilization can be operated continuously and can treat complex substrates owing to their broad functional diversity kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 however these processes involve fundamental challenges because mixed cultures are complex and uncharacterized so far we are not able to fully understand the mechanisms that control open communities of microorganisms which makes the design of such processes a difficult task in mcfs the absence of an external acceptor of electrons limits the energy available and therefore the fermentative catabolic reactions run close to the thermodynamic equilibrium this restricts the growth of the microbial population carballa et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2009 but it also opens the possibility of directing the process towards those products of interest by modifying some operational conditions changes in the operational conditions push the microbial community to adapt to the selective pressures of the system and therefore the outcome of the process could be controlled gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2007 experimentation in mcfs shows that there is a tight relationship between the operational conditions and the products obtained fang and liu 2002 horiuchi et al 2002 karadag and puhakka 2010 temudo et al 2007 yu and fang 2003 zhang et al 2015 zoetemeyer et al 1982 how this relationship works is not clear enough and for this reason we have not succeeded in directing product formation in mcfs studies reported in literature are usually conceived from an experimental point of view and do not analyse the mechanistic causes of the shifts in the product distribution only a handful of studies looked to understand the underlying reasons of these product spectrum changes and some included them in mathematical models gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 groeger et al 2017 kleerebezem et al 2008 mosey 1983 rodriguez et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 however even though the predictions from the successive models have improved there are differences when compared with the experimental observations for example at low ph butyrate is predicted to be the main product in gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 or kleerebezem et al 2008 but experimentally both butyrate and acetate are obtained fang and liu 2002 temudo et al 2007 zoetemeyer et al 1982 these discrepancies might be due to the use of an incomplete metabolic network that does not describe accurately the stoichiometry of the process in this work we propose modifications to the most commonly used metabolic networks for glucose in mcfs with the aim of improving the prediction of experimental results reported in literature the novel biochemical mechanism of electron bifurcation eb fully described elsewhere was included buckel and thauer 2013 herrmann et al 2008 li et al 2008 peters et al 2016 we also propose that homoacetogenesis ha dinamarca et al 2011 is the most reasonable hypothesis for correctly explaining the gaseous species yields 2 materials and methods a metabolic network defines the global stoichiometry of the process as a compilation of the pathways that a single microorganism or a microbial population can catalyse these pathways are described with all the intermediate metabolic steps including the energetic coupling sites and the coenzymes involved e g coenzyme a or nadh to check if including eb in a metabolic network for glucose fermentation helps improving its prediction capacity we first constructed a reference metabolic network 2 1 building the reference metabolic network the metabolic pathways of the major products observed when glucose is fermented by open microbial communities are included in the reference network fig 1 the products considered in this reference metabolic network are acetate ethanol propionate lactate and butyrate angenent et al 2004 fang and liu 2002 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 horiuchi et al 2002 lengeler et al 1999 mohd zaki et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2008 2007 zhang et al 2013 zoetemeyer et al 1982 all these products derive from a common glycolytic process glucose conversion to pyruvate in which the degradation of glucose starts with the embden meyerhof parnas pathway emp producing two moles of pyruvate per mole of glucose two other degradation pathways of glucose can be found in prokaryotes microorganisms entner doudoroff ed and pentose phosphate pathway ppp ed pathway is reported to be related with aerobic environments and to be used to mainly metabolise sugar acids peekhaus and conway 1998 ppp pathway is mainly used for anabolic purposes i e to obtain the needed metabolites in biomass generation kruger and von schaewen 2003 but the fact that emp pathway has an atp yield twice as big as the ed pathway strongly suggests selecting emp as the glycolysis route in our metabolic network these reasons and the fact that in literature emp for glycolysis is ubiquitous buckel and thauer 2013 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 kleerebezem et al 2008 mosey 1983 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2009 2008 2007 zhang et al 2013 zoetemeyer et al 1982 lead us to only consider the emp pathway in the metabolic network pyruvate is a node in the network the different branches arise from it the three carbon compounds propionate and lactate are directly yielded from pyruvate acetate ethanol and butyrate compounds with an even number of carbons need a first decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetyl coa in which an equimolar mixture of h2 and co2 or formate is produced the production of h2 and co2 versus formate is in a thermodynamic equilibrium ruled only by the ph gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2007 direct formate conversion to h2 and co2 is very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium δg m 0 3 kj mol formate and it is catalysed by formate dehydrogenases for simplicity and because both options are equivalent in mass and redox terms we assume that only h2 and co2 are yielded at this step batstone et al 2002 2 1 1 electron carriers in the metabolic network reduction and oxidation reactions happening in the metabolic network involve several electron carriers ec in the proposed network we consider two of them ferredoxin fdred fdox and nadh nadh nad fdred fdox is characterized by its low redox potential e0 400 mv and e 500 mv buckel and thauer 2013 and because is the only ec capable of reducing protons to h2 it is considered that all the fdred produced will eventually be used to produce h2 by citoplasmatic ferredoxin proton reductases ech based on this assumption and on the experimental h2 yields of mcfs it is widely accepted that fdox is only reduced in the pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl coa resulting in a maximal theoretical yield of 2 mole of h2 per mole of glucose consumed kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 the couple nadh nad has a higher redox potential than fdred fdox e0 320 mv white et al 2012 e 280 mv buckel and thauer 2013 and it is involved in most of the redox reactions occurring in the metabolic network gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 2 1 2 anabolism the metabolic network is closed by including the consumption and production of chemicals in the anabolic process following mccarty 2007 we considered anabolism as a process that uses acetyl coa as substrate to produce biomass which has a lumped chemical formula of c5h7o2n eq 1 this biomass formula has the same oxidation state as acetyl coa γ 4 therefore no further redox reactions are needed however producing acetyl coa from glucose implies that the anabolism carries an extra production of h2 co2 and nadh fig 1 and this must be considered in the global stoichiometry 1 2 5 acetyl scoa nh4 c5h7o2n h 0 5 h2o 2 5 coa sh 2 2 methodology at steady state ecs must maintain the balance between oxidised and reduced forms to keep the redox neutrality of the system therefore when an ec is reduced or oxidised it needs to be regenerated in fermentations all fdred is assumed to be oxidised producing h2 section 2 1 1 nadh on the contrary cannot produce h2 directly as the redox potential of the nadh nad couple is higher than that of the proton reduction even in the most favourable fermentative conditions gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 therefore the nadh produced during glycolysis must be consumed in other places of the metabolic network in consequence a complete and accurate metabolic network results in a neutral nadh balance of the data analysed to verify the proposed metabolic network we compared it with the experimental data by calculating the nadh balance eq 2 with the stoichiometry given by the network we calculate the amount of corresponding nadh formed and consumed according to the experimental products yields moles of product formed per mole of substrate consumed in the system if the nadh balance is neutral this means that the metabolic network represents accurately the stoichiometry of the process this can be used to compare different metabolic networks or to check whether a modification in a network improves its accuracy 2 i n υ n a d h i y i 0 where νnadh i is the nadh stoichiometric coefficient associated with the product i and yi is the yield of the product i moles of product i per mole of glucose consumed n is the total number of products the result of the summation at steady state must be zero 2 3 experimental data used the experimental work of temudo et al 2007 hereafter termed temudo experiments was selected as it is the most comprehensive data set available on glucose fermentation using mixed cultures it consists in a series of experiments using glucose as substrate 4 g l at ph values from 4 to 8 5 the hydraulic retention time average time that a compound remains inside the reactor hrt is 8 h for ph from 5 5 to 8 5 and 20 h for ph from 4 to 5 5 ph 5 5 was tested twice at different hrt the volume of the reactor is 2 l with 1 l of heading space and it was operated in continuous mode at 30 c to keep an anaerobic environment n2 was flushed in the liquid phase at a 200 ml min flow rate they measured the yields of volatile fatty acids acetate propionate lactate and butyrate ethanol formate co2 h2 biomass and other minor products closing the electron and carbon balances within a 10 of confidence the values of the experimental yields are presented in supplementary material section a at neutral and high ph the proportion of inorganic carbon in the form of bicarbonate ion hco3 should be considered and it was estimated assuming liquid gas equilibrium and acid base equilibrium the experimental set up was designed to ensure full substrate consumption and that steady state is truly reached to use these data in our work formate production was considered equivalent to the sum of h2 and co2 production 3 results and discussion 3 1 incorporation of the electron bifurcation into the metabolic network eb is an enzymatic mechanism by which an endergonic electron transfer reaction is coupled with a sufficiently exergonic one in this way the energy surplus of the exergonic reaction is used to drive the endergonic one peters et al 2016 eb was first hypothesised herrmann et al 2008 in the crotonyl coa reduction with nadh in the butyrate synthesis pathway as a possible way for additional energy conservation the reduction of crotonyl coa to butyryl coa e 37 mv when combined with the oxidation of nadh e 280 mv creates a highly exergonic step that could be used to drive endergonic reactions the mechanism was then detected li et al 2008 linking the highly exergonic and irreversible nadh mediated reduction of crotonyl coa with the endergonic fdox reduction by nadh overall when one mole of crotonyl coa is reduced to butyryl coa one mole of fdox is reduced and two moles of nadh are oxidised fig 2 the set of reactions is catalysed by a cytoplasmic enzyme complex butyryl coa dehydrogenase etf complex containing flavoproteins buckel and thauer 2013 the fdred yielded is re oxidised producing h2 section 2 1 1 increasing thus the global h2 yield of the system to a theoretical maximum of 2 7 moles of h2 per mole of glucose 35 more than without eb therefore eb could explain why higher ratios than 2 moles of h2 per mole of glucose are found in some works davila vazquez et al 2008 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 jungermann et al 1973 kapdan and kargi 2006 petitdemange et al 1976 ren et al 2016 so far eb was only observed using purified enzymes from c kluyveri buckel and thauer 2013 li et al 2008 however there is no fundamental impediment to its occurrence in living c kluyveri or c pasteurianum as proposed by buckel and thauer 2013 or in mcfs for these reasons in the new metabolic network we propose to include eb in the butyrate pathway fig 3 the inclusion of eb implies the consumption of one extra mole of nadh this helps cells to decrease the reducing potential generated by the initial glycolysis at the same time it modifies the global stoichiometry of the process as now the butyrate yielded from glucose requires the production of more oxidised products to close the electron balance of the fermentation without considering eb the two moles of nadh formed in glycolysis were consumed in the butyrate pathway fig 1 however with eb three nadh are consumed fig 3 which means that a higher share of the substrate can be oxidised to energy rich intermediates with concomitant substrate level phosphorylation slp in essence eb is an indirect way of conserving energy as reducing protons to h2 saves substrate as electron acceptor and therefore microbes have the opportunity to harvest more energy from it buckel 1998 buckel and thauer 2013 table 1 shows that atp yields increases by 11 when considering eb in the butyrate formation pathway to determine whether these modifications give a better fit with the experimental data we applied the methodology described in section 2 2 the nadh balances were calculated as per eq 2 using the measured products and biomass yields of temudo experiments and the nadh stoichiometric coefficients given by the metabolic networks for each product stoichiometric coefficients for the production and consumption of nadh of both networks and an example of the calculation of the nadh balance are included in the supplementary material section b and section c respectively the new metabolic network shows improvements in the nadh balance fig 4 primarily at low ph ph 5 5 which correlates with high butyrate production this likely indicates that without considering eb the butyrate pathway is not described adequately butyrate is produced also at ph 7 75 and again the error without considering eb is sensibly higher than when eb is included in the metabolic network this suggests that the inclusion of eb explains better the experimental results reported in temudo experiments following the same methodology we analysed other experimental data sets on mcf of glucose available in the literature de kok et al 2013 fang and liu 2002 horiuchi et al 2002 mohd zaki et al 2016 temudo et al 2009 2008 zoetemeyer et al 1982 these data sets are not as comprehensive as temudo experiments in some cases information on the minor products yields is not available or the gas production information is incomplete as a result the application of the methodology only provides qualitatively information nevertheless the results confirm the conclusions presented here regarding temudo experiments supplementary material section d 3 2 imbalanced gaseous species inclusion of eb alters the nadh balance of the network but also implies a higher overall h2 yield section 3 1 and therefore a yield ratio of h2 to co2 higher than one some authors argue that the h2 to co2 ratio should be equal to 1 because the only step in the metabolic network where h2 and co2 are produced is in the pyruvate decarboxylation gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 this seems to be confirmed by temudo experiments and apparently contradicts our eb hypothesis we calculated the theoretical yields of h2 and co2 and compared them with the yields reported in temudo experiments the theoretical yield values are those calculated considering the product spectrum of the experiment and following the stoichiometry presented in the metabolic network including eb fig 3 in fig 5 h2 theoretical yields yellow bars are higher than the experimental ones grey bars this can suggest that the difference is because eb is not occurring after all at the same time co2 theoretical yields yellow bars are higher than the measured yields grey bars and this cannot be explained by an incorrect assumption of eb to explain this imbalance we proposed two hypotheses ferredoxin regeneration without h2 formation and homoacetogenesis 3 2 1 ferredoxin regeneration without h2 formation we calculated the yield of h2 by assuming that all the fdred produced from the pyruvate decarboxylation step and from the eb mechanism is re oxidised by cytoplasmatic hydrogenases ech and produces h2 this is the most reported form of regenerating fdox buckel and thauer 2013 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 but fdox could be regenerated in other ways the two electrons of fdred can be used in anabolic reactions presumably in highly endergonic reactions in which nad p h is not a sufficiently strong electron donor buchanan and arnon 1970 for example it was reported that some clostridia species lack the enzymes needed to produce the anabolic related nadph during glycolysis and their only nadph source is through ferredoxin nadph oxidoreductase jungermann et al 1973 alternatively fdred can participate as electron donor in other catabolic reactions either directly or transferring first its electrons to nad via the enzymatic complex ferredoxin nad oxidoreductase rnfa g enzyme complex which is usually associated with energy conservation through the creation of an electrochemical na h gradient biesterveld et al 1994 buckel and thauer 2013 fonknechten et al 2010 herrmann et al 2008 hugo et al 1972 jungermann et al 1973 petitdemange et al 1976 the latter is typically found in microorganisms that cannot produce nadh by others means because they lack the appropriate enzymes or their substrate does not allow for nadh production when pyruvate is the main substrate only fdred is yielded in its decarboxylation to acetyl coa petitdemange et al 1976 any of these options decrease the predicted h2 production and the predicted h2 to co2 ratio but would not explain why the co2 predicted yields are also higher than the ones reported experimentally moreover all these options would imply that the nadh stoichiometric coefficient of the butyrate pathway with eb would be the same as without eb as in the reference metabolic network of fig 1 in consequence the nadh balances including eb would have the exact values as the ones without including it orange bars in fig 4 moreover the eb mechanism described in the butyrate pathway is reported in literature to regenerate fd ox by yielding h2 as it is the only way to explain the observed h2 yields in essays with purified enzymes from c kluyveri li et al 2008 3 2 2 homoacetogenesis in fermentative conditions ha eq 3 is reported to play an important role as h2 consumer partially due to the lack of competitors as there are no methanogens or sulphate reducing bacteria bundhoo and mohee 2016 dinamarca and bakke 2009 fang and liu 2002 guo et al 2010 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 karadag and puhakka 2010 saady 2013 some authors describe ha as persistent in fermentative conditions saady 2013 and it is considered the main barrier for h2 production via anaerobic fermentation dinamarca and bakke 2009 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 therefore ha could explain the lower than expected h2 yields found in numerous h2 oriented fermentations hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 ren et al 2016 energetic calculations show that ha is highly exergonic considering typical h2 partial pressures observed in acidogenic fermentations section e in supplementary material 3 4h2 2 hco3 h c2h3o2 4h2o like all autotrophs the growth rate of known homoacetogens is slow acetobacterium woodii is reported to have growth rates on h2 co2 between 0 024 and 0 050 h 1 peters et al 2006 straub et al 2014 while moorella sp was reported to have a growth rate of 0 042 h 1 sakai et al 2005 dilution rates in temudo experiments are 0 042 h 1 for low ph and 0 125 h 1 for medium and high ph values which apparently prevents the presence of homoacetogens however homoacetogens can also grow on organic compounds such as glucose and therefore lower their doubling times down to values of 1 75 h saady 2013 dinamarca and bakke 2009 reported homoacetogens presence in continuous experiments with a hrt of 8 h and saady 2013 discarded lowering hrt as a successful strategy to avoid ha in fermentations therefore it is feasible to hypothesise the presence of homoacetogens in temudo experiments to check if ha could be responsible for the imbalance in h2 and co2 production we assumed that ha consumed the difference between the theoretical fig 5 yellow bars and the measured yield fig 5 grey bars of either h2 or co2 accordingly the stoichiometry eq 3 defines the correspondent acetate production and co2 or h2 consumption an example of calculations is included in section f of the supplementary material green bars in fig 5 show a good fit between the theoretical and measured gaseous yields when ha is considered the root mean square deviation rmsd measures the differences between predicted and observed values table 2 these results suggest unequivocally that ha provides a much better fit to the experimental data as values improve by 85 and 95 for h2 and co2 respectively including ha in the system would also mean that part of the acetate measured did not come through direct glucose degradation but via ha consequently part of the acetate did not produce either the nadh or the co2 and the h2 of the pyruvate decarboxylation altering the nadh balance blue bars in fig 6 represent the nadh balance after considering ha for some of the experiments especially those at ph 4 and the first at ph 5 5 the consideration of ha implies an increment of the error in the nadh balance however these differences might be very well attributed to experimental deviations for example carbon recovery in the first experiment at ph 5 5 is around 110 at the same time the ratio between butyrate and acetate yields in this experiment is higher than it is in the rest of low ph experiments yields are available in section a in the supplementary material which might imply that the measurement of butyrate could be deviated as butyrate consumes nadh its consumption could be overestimated and explain the negative deviation at this ph stoichiometric coefficients are available in section b in supplementary material at ph 4 the butyrate to acetate ratio also seems to be overestimated and a negative deviation in the nadh balance is again observed nevertheless these deviations can be considered relatively small because for every glucose oxidation to pyruvate two mole of nadh are yielded 3 3 eb in the propionate pathway fumarate reduction to succinate in the propionate pathway is a similar step to crotonyl coa reduction to butyryl coa they are mechanistically alike hydrogenation of a double carbon bond and in both cases their energetics suggest an extra energy conservation e crotonyl coa 37 mv e fumarate 5 mv however the eb mechanism was reported in the crotonyl coa reduction of the butyrate pathway but not in the fumarate reduction buckel and thauer 2013 li et al 2008 the energy surplus of this metabolic step in the propionate pathway is reported to be conserved extruding a proton from the cytoplasm and therefore creating an electrochemical proton gradient buckel 2001 herrmann et al 2008 even though eb was never detected in this step we assumed it was feasible as there is no theoretical impediment for it using the same methodology as above the nadh balances were calculated assuming eb in both butyrate and propionate pathways and ha see supplementary material section g but the results show a worse fit when eb is included in the propionate pathway the nadh balances increase the error by 23 and therefore the consideration of eb in the fumarate reduction was discarded 4 conclusions the summarised conclusions of this mcfs analysis based on the new detailed stoichiometry proposed are 1 for first time eb is considered in mcfs yielding butyrate and this consideration returns a better fit between the predicted stoichiometry and the experimental yields measured 2 eb consideration implies the prediction of the formation of butyrate accompanied by acetate this was experimentally observed but not theoretically predicted before 3 the addition of eb revealed an imbalance between the stoichiometry and the observation in the production of the gaseous components h2 and co2 this highlights lack of understanding of mcfs stoichiometry 4 it has been proposed that the imbalance of h2 and co2 could be explained by the occurrence of ha in the mcfs of glucose acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the spanish ministry

that prevented so far any industrial application one of the main issues is that we are not able to predict reliably the product spectrum i e the stoichiometry of the process because the complex

important biochemical mechanism in microbial mixed cultures fermentations and underlines the importance of considering homoacetogenesis when analysing anaerobic fermentations keywords electron bifurcation acidogenic fermentation mixed culture homoacetogenesis stoichiometry 1 introduction the recent advances in environmental technologies brought a change of paradigm regarding the organic

sustainable and circular economy among these bioprocess anaerobic systems are one of the most attractive options the absence of o2 as strong electron acceptor limits the biomass growth and allows the

a well established technology for biogas production however the use of biogas as biofuel is limited because its low volumetric energy density and the low price of the natural gas consequently other avenues should be considered for organic wastes valorisation most of the novel initiatives for obtaining higher added value products from organic wastes involve the use of mixed culture fermentations mcfs kleerebezem et al 2015 these are anaerobic processes in which methanogenesis is inhibited and substrates are converted into a mixture of short carboxylates also known as volatile fatty acids vfas

bioprocesses producing biofuels bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoate family or biosolvents alternatively vfas can be used for electricity generation in microbial fuel cells or for h2 production agler et al 2011 angenent et al 2004 kleerebezem et al 2015 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 moreover h2 is a valuable by product of mcfs because it has potential as biofuel and energy vector bundhoo and mohee 2016 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 conversion of organic wastes into a short carboxylate pool and co2 and h2 is envisioned as one of the biorefinery platforms the carboxylate platform agler et al 2011 the use of mixed culture systems has several advantages these are systems that do not need sterilization can be operated continuously and can treat complex substrates owing to their broad functional diversity kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 however these processes involve fundamental challenges because mixed cultures are complex and uncharacterized so far we are not able to fully understand the mechanisms that control open communities of microorganisms which makes the design of such processes a difficult task in mcfs the absence of an external acceptor of electrons limits the energy available and therefore the fermentative catabolic reactions run close to the thermodynamic equilibrium this restricts the growth of the microbial population carballa et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2009 but it also opens the possibility of directing the process towards those products of interest by modifying some operational conditions changes in the operational conditions push the microbial community to adapt to the selective pressures of the system and therefore the outcome of the process could be controlled gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2007 experimentation in mcfs shows that there is a tight relationship between the operational conditions and the products obtained fang and liu 2002 horiuchi et al 2002 karadag and puhakka 2010 temudo et al 2007 yu and fang 2003 zhang et al 2015 zoetemeyer et al 1982 how this relationship works is not clear enough and for this reason we have not succeeded in directing product formation in mcfs studies reported in literature are usually conceived from an experimental point of view and do not analyse the mechanistic causes of the shifts in the product distribution only a handful of studies looked to understand the underlying reasons of these product spectrum changes and some included them in mathematical models gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 groeger et al 2017 kleerebezem et al 2008 mosey 1983 rodriguez et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 however even though the predictions from the successive models have improved there are differences when compared with the experimental observations for example at low ph butyrate is predicted to be the main product in gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 or kleerebezem et al 2008 but experimentally both butyrate and acetate are obtained fang and liu 2002 temudo et al 2007 zoetemeyer et al 1982 these discrepancies might be due to the use of an incomplete metabolic network that does not describe accurately the stoichiometry of the process in this work we propose modifications to the most commonly used metabolic networks for glucose in mcfs with the aim of improving the prediction of experimental results reported in literature the novel biochemical mechanism of electron bifurcation eb fully described elsewhere was included buckel and thauer 2013 herrmann et al 2008 li et al 2008 peters et al 2016 we also propose that homoacetogenesis ha dinamarca et al 2011 is the most reasonable hypothesis for correctly explaining the gaseous species yields 2 materials and methods a metabolic network defines the global stoichiometry of the process as a compilation of the pathways that a single microorganism or a microbial population can catalyse these pathways are described with all the intermediate metabolic steps including the energetic coupling sites and the coenzymes involved e g coenzyme a or nadh to check if including eb in a metabolic network for glucose fermentation helps improving its prediction capacity we first constructed a reference metabolic network 2 1 building the reference metabolic network the metabolic pathways of the major products observed when glucose is fermented by open microbial communities are included in the reference network fig 1 the products considered in this reference metabolic network are acetate ethanol propionate lactate and butyrate angenent et al 2004 fang and liu 2002 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 horiuchi et al 2002 lengeler et al 1999 mohd zaki et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2008 2007 zhang et al 2013 zoetemeyer et al 1982 all these products derive from a common glycolytic process glucose conversion to pyruvate in which the degradation of glucose starts with the embden meyerhof parnas pathway emp producing two moles of pyruvate per mole of glucose two other degradation pathways of glucose can be found in prokaryotes microorganisms entner doudoroff ed and pentose phosphate pathway ppp ed pathway is reported to be related with aerobic environments and to be used to mainly metabolise sugar acids peekhaus and conway 1998 ppp pathway is mainly used for anabolic purposes i e to obtain the needed metabolites in biomass generation kruger and von schaewen 2003 but the fact that emp pathway has an atp yield twice as big as the ed pathway strongly suggests selecting emp as the glycolysis route in our metabolic network these reasons and the fact that in literature emp for glycolysis is ubiquitous buckel and thauer 2013 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 kleerebezem et al 2008 mosey 1983 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2009 2008 2007 zhang et al 2013 zoetemeyer et al 1982 lead us to only consider the emp pathway in the metabolic network pyruvate is a node in the network the different branches arise from it the three carbon compounds propionate and lactate are directly yielded from pyruvate acetate ethanol and butyrate compounds with an even number of carbons need a first decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetyl coa in which an equimolar mixture of h2 and co2 or formate is produced the production of h2 and co2 versus formate is in a thermodynamic equilibrium ruled only by the ph gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2006 temudo et al 2007 direct formate conversion to h2 and co2 is very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium δg m 0 3 kj mol formate and it is catalysed by formate dehydrogenases for simplicity and because both options are equivalent in mass and redox terms we assume that only h2 and co2 are yielded at this step batstone et al 2002 2 1 1 electron carriers in the metabolic network reduction and oxidation reactions happening in the metabolic network involve several electron carriers ec in the proposed network we consider two of them ferredoxin fdred fdox and nadh nadh nad fdred fdox is characterized by its low redox potential e0 400 mv and e 500 mv buckel and thauer 2013 and because is the only ec capable of reducing protons to h2 it is considered that all the fdred produced will eventually be used to produce h2 by citoplasmatic ferredoxin proton reductases ech based on this assumption and on the experimental h2 yields of mcfs it is widely accepted that fdox is only reduced in the pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl coa resulting in a maximal theoretical yield of 2 mole of h2 per mole of glucose consumed kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 the couple nadh nad has a higher redox potential than fdred fdox e0 320 mv white et al 2012 e 280 mv buckel and thauer 2013 and it is involved in most of the redox reactions occurring in the metabolic network gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 2 1 2 anabolism the metabolic network is closed by including the consumption and production of chemicals in the anabolic process following mccarty 2007 we considered anabolism as a process that uses acetyl coa as substrate to produce biomass which has a lumped chemical formula of c5h7o2n eq 1 this biomass formula has the same oxidation state as acetyl coa γ 4 therefore no further redox reactions are needed however producing acetyl coa from glucose implies that the anabolism carries an extra production of h2 co2 and nadh fig 1 and this must be considered in the global stoichiometry 1 2 5 acetyl scoa nh4 c5h7o2n h 0 5 h2o 2 5 coa sh 2 2 methodology at steady state ecs must maintain the balance between oxidised and reduced forms to keep the redox neutrality of the system therefore when an ec is reduced or oxidised it needs to be regenerated in fermentations all fdred is assumed to be oxidised producing h2 section 2 1 1 nadh on the contrary cannot produce h2 directly as the redox potential of the nadh nad couple is higher than that of the proton reduction even in the most favourable fermentative conditions gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 therefore the nadh produced during glycolysis must be consumed in other places of the metabolic network in consequence a complete and accurate metabolic network results in a neutral nadh balance of the data analysed to verify the proposed metabolic network we compared it with the experimental data by calculating the nadh balance eq 2 with the stoichiometry given by the network we calculate the amount of corresponding nadh formed and consumed according to the experimental products yields moles of product formed per mole of substrate consumed in the system if the nadh balance is neutral this means that the metabolic network represents accurately the stoichiometry of the process this can be used to compare different metabolic networks or to check whether a modification in a network improves its accuracy 2 i n υ n a d h i y i 0 where νnadh i is the nadh stoichiometric coefficient associated with the product i and yi is the yield of the product i moles of product i per mole of glucose consumed n is the total number of products the result of the summation at steady state must be zero 2 3 experimental data used the experimental work of temudo et al 2007 hereafter termed temudo experiments was selected as it is the most comprehensive data set available on glucose fermentation using mixed cultures it consists in a series of experiments using glucose as substrate 4 g l at ph values from 4 to 8 5 the hydraulic retention time average time that a compound remains inside the reactor hrt is 8 h for ph from 5 5 to 8 5 and 20 h for ph from 4 to 5 5 ph 5 5 was tested twice at different hrt the volume of the reactor is 2 l with 1 l of heading space and it was operated in continuous mode at 30 c to keep an anaerobic environment n2 was flushed in the liquid phase at a 200 ml min flow rate they measured the yields of volatile fatty acids acetate propionate lactate and butyrate ethanol formate co2 h2 biomass and other minor products closing the electron and carbon balances within a 10 of confidence the values of the experimental yields are presented in supplementary material section a at neutral and high ph the proportion of inorganic carbon in the form of bicarbonate ion hco3 should be considered and it was estimated assuming liquid gas equilibrium and acid base equilibrium the experimental set up was designed to ensure full substrate consumption and that steady state is truly reached to use these data in our work formate production was considered equivalent to the sum of h2 and co2 production 3 results and discussion 3 1 incorporation of the electron bifurcation into the metabolic network eb is an enzymatic mechanism by which an endergonic electron transfer reaction is coupled with a sufficiently exergonic one in this way the energy surplus of the exergonic reaction is used to drive the endergonic one peters et al 2016 eb was first hypothesised herrmann et al 2008 in the crotonyl coa reduction with nadh in the butyrate synthesis pathway as a possible way for additional energy conservation the reduction of crotonyl coa to butyryl coa e 37 mv when combined with the oxidation of nadh e 280 mv creates a highly exergonic step that could be used to drive endergonic reactions the mechanism was then detected li et al 2008 linking the highly exergonic and irreversible nadh mediated reduction of crotonyl coa with the endergonic fdox reduction by nadh overall when one mole of crotonyl coa is reduced to butyryl coa one mole of fdox is reduced and two moles of nadh are oxidised fig 2 the set of reactions is catalysed by a cytoplasmic enzyme complex butyryl coa dehydrogenase etf complex containing flavoproteins buckel and thauer 2013 the fdred yielded is re oxidised producing h2 section 2 1 1 increasing thus the global h2 yield of the system to a theoretical maximum of 2 7 moles of h2 per mole of glucose 35 more than without eb therefore eb could explain why higher ratios than 2 moles of h2 per mole of glucose are found in some works davila vazquez et al 2008 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 jungermann et al 1973 kapdan and kargi 2006 petitdemange et al 1976 ren et al 2016 so far eb was only observed using purified enzymes from c kluyveri buckel and thauer 2013 li et al 2008 however there is no fundamental impediment to its occurrence in living c kluyveri or c pasteurianum as proposed by buckel and thauer 2013 or in mcfs for these reasons in the new metabolic network we propose to include eb in the butyrate pathway fig 3 the inclusion of eb implies the consumption of one extra mole of nadh this helps cells to decrease the reducing potential generated by the initial glycolysis at the same time it modifies the global stoichiometry of the process as now the butyrate yielded from glucose requires the production of more oxidised products to close the electron balance of the fermentation without considering eb the two moles of nadh formed in glycolysis were consumed in the butyrate pathway fig 1 however with eb three nadh are consumed fig 3 which means that a higher share of the substrate can be oxidised to energy rich intermediates with concomitant substrate level phosphorylation slp in essence eb is an indirect way of conserving energy as reducing protons to h2 saves substrate as electron acceptor and therefore microbes have the opportunity to harvest more energy from it buckel 1998 buckel and thauer 2013 table 1 shows that atp yields increases by 11 when considering eb in the butyrate formation pathway to determine whether these modifications give a better fit with the experimental data we applied the methodology described in section 2 2 the nadh balances were calculated as per eq 2 using the measured products and biomass yields of temudo experiments and the nadh stoichiometric coefficients given by the metabolic networks for each product stoichiometric coefficients for the production and consumption of nadh of both networks and an example of the calculation of the nadh balance are included in the supplementary material section b and section c respectively the new metabolic network shows improvements in the nadh balance fig 4 primarily at low ph ph 5 5 which correlates with high butyrate production this likely indicates that without considering eb the butyrate pathway is not described adequately butyrate is produced also at ph 7 75 and again the error without considering eb is sensibly higher than when eb is included in the metabolic network this suggests that the inclusion of eb explains better the experimental results reported in temudo experiments following the same methodology we analysed other experimental data sets on mcf of glucose available in the literature de kok et al 2013 fang and liu 2002 horiuchi et al 2002 mohd zaki et al 2016 temudo et al 2009 2008 zoetemeyer et al 1982 these data sets are not as comprehensive as temudo experiments in some cases information on the minor products yields is not available or the gas production information is incomplete as a result the application of the methodology only provides qualitatively information nevertheless the results confirm the conclusions presented here regarding temudo experiments supplementary material section d 3 2 imbalanced gaseous species inclusion of eb alters the nadh balance of the network but also implies a higher overall h2 yield section 3 1 and therefore a yield ratio of h2 to co2 higher than one some authors argue that the h2 to co2 ratio should be equal to 1 because the only step in the metabolic network where h2 and co2 are produced is in the pyruvate decarboxylation gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 this seems to be confirmed by temudo experiments and apparently contradicts our eb hypothesis we calculated the theoretical yields of h2 and co2 and compared them with the yields reported in temudo experiments the theoretical yield values are those calculated considering the product spectrum of the experiment and following the stoichiometry presented in the metabolic network including eb fig 3 in fig 5 h2 theoretical yields yellow bars are higher than the experimental ones grey bars this can suggest that the difference is because eb is not occurring after all at the same time co2 theoretical yields yellow bars are higher than the measured yields grey bars and this cannot be explained by an incorrect assumption of eb to explain this imbalance we proposed two hypotheses ferredoxin regeneration without h2 formation and homoacetogenesis 3 2 1 ferredoxin regeneration without h2 formation we calculated the yield of h2 by assuming that all the fdred produced from the pyruvate decarboxylation step and from the eb mechanism is re oxidised by cytoplasmatic hydrogenases ech and produces h2 this is the most reported form of regenerating fdox buckel and thauer 2013 gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 hoelzle et al 2014 kleerebezem et al 2008 temudo et al 2007 but fdox could be regenerated in other ways the two electrons of fdred can be used in anabolic reactions presumably in highly endergonic reactions in which nad p h is not a sufficiently strong electron donor buchanan and arnon 1970 for example it was reported that some clostridia species lack the enzymes needed to produce the anabolic related nadph during glycolysis and their only nadph source is through ferredoxin nadph oxidoreductase jungermann et al 1973 alternatively fdred can participate as electron donor in other catabolic reactions either directly or transferring first its electrons to nad via the enzymatic complex ferredoxin nad oxidoreductase rnfa g enzyme complex which is usually associated with energy conservation through the creation of an electrochemical na h gradient biesterveld et al 1994 buckel and thauer 2013 fonknechten et al 2010 herrmann et al 2008 hugo et al 1972 jungermann et al 1973 petitdemange et al 1976 the latter is typically found in microorganisms that cannot produce nadh by others means because they lack the appropriate enzymes or their substrate does not allow for nadh production when pyruvate is the main substrate only fdred is yielded in its decarboxylation to acetyl coa petitdemange et al 1976 any of these options decrease the predicted h2 production and the predicted h2 to co2 ratio but would not explain why the co2 predicted yields are also higher than the ones reported experimentally moreover all these options would imply that the nadh stoichiometric coefficient of the butyrate pathway with eb would be the same as without eb as in the reference metabolic network of fig 1 in consequence the nadh balances including eb would have the exact values as the ones without including it orange bars in fig 4 moreover the eb mechanism described in the butyrate pathway is reported in literature to regenerate fd ox by yielding h2 as it is the only way to explain the observed h2 yields in essays with purified enzymes from c kluyveri li et al 2008 3 2 2 homoacetogenesis in fermentative conditions ha eq 3 is reported to play an important role as h2 consumer partially due to the lack of competitors as there are no methanogens or sulphate reducing bacteria bundhoo and mohee 2016 dinamarca and bakke 2009 fang and liu 2002 guo et al 2010 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 karadag and puhakka 2010 saady 2013 some authors describe ha as persistent in fermentative conditions saady 2013 and it is considered the main barrier for h2 production via anaerobic fermentation dinamarca and bakke 2009 hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 therefore ha could explain the lower than expected h2 yields found in numerous h2 oriented fermentations hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 ren et al 2016 energetic calculations show that ha is highly exergonic considering typical h2 partial pressures observed in acidogenic fermentations section e in supplementary material 3 4h2 2 hco3 h c2h3o2 4h2o like all autotrophs the growth rate of known homoacetogens is slow acetobacterium woodii is reported to have growth rates on h2 co2 between 0 024 and 0 050 h 1 peters et al 2006 straub et al 2014 while moorella sp was reported to have a growth rate of 0 042 h 1 sakai et al 2005 dilution rates in temudo experiments are 0 042 h 1 for low ph and 0 125 h 1 for medium and high ph values which apparently prevents the presence of homoacetogens however homoacetogens can also grow on organic compounds such as glucose and therefore lower their doubling times down to values of 1 75 h saady 2013 dinamarca and bakke 2009 reported homoacetogens presence in continuous experiments with a hrt of 8 h and saady 2013 discarded lowering hrt as a successful strategy to avoid ha in fermentations therefore it is feasible to hypothesise the presence of homoacetogens in temudo experiments to check if ha could be responsible for the imbalance in h2 and co2 production we assumed that ha consumed the difference between the theoretical fig 5 yellow bars and the measured yield fig 5 grey bars of either h2 or co2 accordingly the stoichiometry eq 3 defines the correspondent acetate production and co2 or h2 consumption an example of calculations is included in section f of the supplementary material green bars in fig 5 show a good fit between the theoretical and measured gaseous yields when ha is considered the root mean square deviation rmsd measures the differences between predicted and observed values table 2 these results suggest unequivocally that ha provides a much better fit to the experimental data as values improve by 85 and 95 for h2 and co2 respectively including ha in the system would also mean that part of the acetate measured did not come through direct glucose degradation but via ha consequently part of the acetate did not produce either the nadh or the co2 and the h2 of the pyruvate decarboxylation altering the nadh balance blue bars in fig 6 represent the nadh balance after considering ha for some of the experiments especially those at ph 4 and the first at ph 5 5 the consideration of ha implies an increment of the error in the nadh balance however these differences might be very well attributed to experimental deviations for example carbon recovery in the first experiment at ph 5 5 is around 110 at the same time the ratio between butyrate and acetate yields in this experiment is higher than it is in the rest of low ph experiments yields are available in section a in the supplementary material which might imply that the measurement of butyrate could be deviated as butyrate consumes nadh its consumption could be overestimated and explain the negative deviation at this ph stoichiometric coefficients are available in section b in supplementary material at ph 4 the butyrate to acetate ratio also seems to be overestimated and a negative deviation in the nadh balance is again observed nevertheless these deviations can be considered relatively small because for every glucose oxidation to pyruvate two mole of nadh are yielded 3 3 eb in the propionate pathway fumarate reduction to succinate in the propionate pathway is a similar step to crotonyl coa reduction to butyryl coa they are mechanistically alike hydrogenation of a double carbon bond and in both cases their energetics suggest an extra energy conservation e crotonyl coa 37 mv e fumarate 5 mv however the eb mechanism was reported in the crotonyl coa reduction of the butyrate pathway but not in the fumarate reduction buckel and thauer 2013 li et al 2008 the energy surplus of this metabolic step in the propionate pathway is reported to be conserved extruding a proton from the cytoplasm and therefore creating an electrochemical proton gradient buckel 2001 herrmann et al 2008 even though eb was never detected in this step we assumed it was feasible as there is no theoretical impediment for it using the same methodology as above the nadh balances were calculated assuming eb in both butyrate and propionate pathways and ha see supplementary material section g but the results show a worse fit when eb is included in the propionate pathway the nadh balances increase the error by 23 and therefore the consideration of eb in the fumarate reduction was discarded 4 conclusions the summarised conclusions of this mcfs analysis based on the new detailed stoichiometry proposed are 1 for first time eb is considered in mcfs yielding butyrate and this consideration returns a better fit between the predicted stoichiometry and the experimental yields measured 2 eb consideration implies the prediction of the formation of butyrate accompanied by acetate this was experimentally observed but not theoretically predicted before 3 the addition of eb revealed an imbalance between the stoichiometry and the observation in the production of the gaseous components h2 and co2 this highlights lack of understanding of mcfs stoichiometry 4 it has been proposed that the imbalance of h2 and co2 could be explained by the occurrence of ha in the mcfs of glucose acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the spanish ministry

19516,arsenic compounds are carcinogenic to humans and are typically removed from contaminated water using various sorbents the ionic composition plays a significant role in arsenate removal efficiency during the process of water remediation here we quantify the effects of natural ions chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and phosphates and humic acid on the removal of arsenates by ferrate vi at ph 6 6 in the experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as and the concentrations of ions varied in the range from 5 to 100 mg l 1 of element in ionic form and humic acid the achieved results show that only phosphate ions had principle influence on the efficiency of arsenate removal by ferrate vi the effect of phosphates was elucidated by applying transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy to solid samples prepared under different weight ratios of ferrate vi arsenates and phosphates these results show three crucial effects of phosphates on the arsenate removal mechanisms at low p as weight ratio up to 1 1 the incorporation of arsenate ions into the crystalline structure of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was found to be suppressed by the presence of phosphates thus arsenates were mainly adsorbed onto the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles further increase in the p as weight ratio more than 1 1 resulted in the competition between arsenates and phosphates sorption with the increased concentration of phosphate ions the number of arsenates on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was reduced finally the complexation of iron iii ions with phosphate ions occurred leading to a decrease in the arsenates removal efficiency which resulted from a lower content of precipitated γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles all these aspects need to be considered prior to application of ferrate vi for arsenates removal in real natural waters

sharma 2002 wood 1958 the main benefit of the application of ferrate vi arises from the simultaneous oxidation disinfection and subsequent coagulation by iron iii oxides the final products of ferrate vi reduction in water in recent years a few studies have been reported on the effective coagulation of toxic metal ions including arsenic by ferrate vi bartzatt et al 1992 filip et al 2011 jiang and lloyd 2002 prucek et al 2013 however for the first time the role of natural ions and humic acid has been studied systematically to improve the efficiency of ferrate vi in removing arsenates the objectives of the present paper are i to address the issue of removal of arsenates by ferrate vi in water containing chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates phosphates and humic acid ii to understand the negative effect of phosphates on arsenates removal by ferrate vi by performing experiments as a function of fe as p molar or weight ratios and iii to elucidate the mechanism of decreasing efficiency of arsenates removal in the presence of phosphates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals stock solutions of arsenates and phosphates at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were prepared using na2haso4 7h2o 99 995 sigma aldrich and kh2po4 99 0 penta chemicals respectively inorganic salts i e nacl nano3 nahco3 and na2so4 and humic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich standard solutions of as p and fe for atomic absorption spectroscopy aas measurements were prepared using tracecert commercial standards with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 of an element in nitric acid which were purchased from fluka inc all chemicals were used as received without any further purification potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 sigma aldrich was used throughout the experiments the weighted amount of solid ferrate vi was added to the sample solution before each experiment all the samples were prepared with deionized water 18 mω cm 1 millipore system 2 2 removal of arsenates and phosphates by ferrate vi first the influence of concentration of ferrate vi on the removal of either arsenates or phosphates was monitored at ph 6 6 in the experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as the concentrations of ferrate vi as fe varied up to 80 mg l 1 after ferrate vi was added the ph of the solutions was adjusted by 2 solution of hydrochloric acid the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of either arsenates or phosphates was examined at fe as weight ratios of 3 1 and fe p weight ratio of 6 1 respectively in all these experiments solutions of ferrate vi were added to the solutions of arsenates or phosphates in water in the erlenmeyer flasks the final volume was 50 ml mixed solutions were shaken on a conventional end over end shaker for 60 min and filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters afterwards the residual concentration of arsenates or phosphates in the filtrate were immediately determined using an aas technique these experiments served to find the fe as or p weight ratios and to optimize the ph for further experiments for the investigation of the effect of ions i e chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and phosphates and humic acid on removal efficiency of arsenates two sets of samples termed as ex situ and in situ were prepared the in situ samples originated from simultaneous additions of ferrate vi and ion containing salt only one of the studied ions to arsenates containing water after ferrate vi was added the ph of the solutions was adjusted and solution was shaken for 60 min in other words the process involved the formation of the secondary iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides from the ferrate vi in the presence of arsenates and eventually other ions in the in situ experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as and the concentration of ferrate vi was set to 30 mg l 1 as fe the ex situ samples were formed in two steps i adding ferrate vi to deionized water was followed by adjusting the ph of the solution to 6 6 and by subsequent shaking of the samples for 30 min ii a mixed solution containing arsenic and ion containing salts only one of the studied ions was then added to the mixture prepared in the first step the as prepared samples were kept at ph 6 6 and shaken for 60 min in other words at first the process involved the formation and partial aggregation of the secondary iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides from the ferrate vi in deionized water followed by addition of arsenates and ions to the iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides solution in the next step the in situ and ex situ procedures processes have already been described and explained in detail elsewhere prucek et al 2013 the initial concentration of arsenates as as was again set to 10 mg l 1 the amount of solid k2feo4 added to obtain the final concentration of iron was 60 mg l 1 as fe the concentrations of ions were in the range from 5 to 100 mg l 1 of a particular element in ionic form and humic acid i e nitrates as n carbonates as c sulfates as s and phosphates as p the experiments were performed at ph 6 6 these experiments were carried out in triplicates the detailed investigation of the effect of phosphates on the removal of arsenates was studied by determining removal efficiency and sorption capacity in this case the prepared solutions had fixed concentrations of ferrate vi 30 mg l 1 as fe and arsenates 10 mg l 1 as as and variable concentrations of phosphates ranging from 0 2 to 6 mg l 1 as p mixing and filtrate procedures were identical to those described above for the physicochemical characterization of the solid samples several types of samples were prepared for clear understanding of the mechanism of the effect of phosphates ions on the arsenates removal all the solid samples for characterizations were prepared in molar ratios in molar ratios the count of ions in the system was evident the in situ samples of ferrate vi in arsenates and phosphates containing water at a varying amount of phosphates at ph 6 6 and the in situ sample of ferrate vi in arsenates and nitrates containing water at ph 6 6 were prepared finally the two samples for the study of the effect of arsenates and phosphates ions on their sorption competition on the iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles surface were prepared i e i the in situ sample of ferrate vi in arsenates containing water at an fe as molar ratio of 4 1 at ph 6 6 with a shaking time of 60 min and subsequent addition of phosphates ions at a final fe as p molar ratio of 4 1 1 and ii the in situ sample of ferrate vi in phosphates containing water at an fe p molar ratio of 4 1 at ph 6 6 with a shaking time of 60 min and subsequent addition of arsenates at a final fe p as molar ratio of 4 1 1 all the samples were dried overnight in an evacuated desiccator 2 3 analytical and characterization techniques arsenic concentrations were determined by an electrothermal atomization atomic absorption eta aas technique with a graphite furnace using contraa 600 analytik jena ag germany equipped with a high resolution echelle double monochromator spectral band width of 2 p m at 200 nm and a continuum radiation source xenon lamp the absorption lines used for as p and fe analyses were 193 6 nm 213 6 nm and 248 3 nm respectively detailed particle size and morphological aspects of the solid samples were examined by a transmission electron microscopy tem on a jeol jem 2010 microscope equipped with a lab6 cathode an accelerating voltage of 160 kv and a point to point resolution of 0 194 nm a drop of high purity distilled water was placed

dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds technique for hrtem stem haadf and stem eds analyses the powder samples were dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated for 5 min one drop of the resulting suspension was then placed on a copper grid covered with a holey carbon film and allowed to dry at room temperature transmission 57fe mössbauer spectra were recorded with a mössbauer spectrometer of ms96 type regional centre of advanced technologies and materials palacký university in olomouc czech republic operating in a constant acceleration mode and equipped with 50 mci 57co rh radioactive source for low temperature and in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy measurements the samples were placed inside the chamber of the cryomagnetic system oxford instruments uk to which the mössbauer spectrometer is mounted in a parallel geometry if an external magnetic field is applied in the sample position its field lines are oriented in the parallel direction with respect to the γ rays propagation the collected 57fe mössbauer spectra were analyzed with the mosswinn software program klencsar et al 1996 prior to fitting the signal to noise ratio was increased simultaneously applying the statistical procedure developed by prochazka et al 2010 and mosswinn software routines the isomer shift values were referenced to metallic α fe at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates in the first set of experiments the efficiency of removal of arsenates or phosphates at various concentrations of ferrate vi was examined at ph 6 6 initial concentration of arsenates or phosphates was set to 10 mg l 1 as as or p the concentration of fe calculated from the content in ferrate vi varied in the range from 5 to 50 mg l 1 as shown in fig s1a the removal of arsenates and phosphates was facilitated by increasing the concentrations of ferrate vi the complete removal of arsenates was obtained at an fe as weight ratio of 3 1 or a molar ratio of 4 1 comparatively an fe p weight ratio of 6 1 or a molar ratio of 3 1 was needed to obtain the complete removal of phosphates these weight molar ratios were then used to investigate the effect of the ph on the removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates see fig s1b the maximum removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates was found at ph 6 6 a further increase in the ph decreased the removal efficiency of both arsenates and phosphates see fig s1b sharp decreases in removal efficiencies were observed in the ph range from 7 5 to 9 0 similar values of pka of phosphates and arsenates see the text in the supplementary data file for more details reflected a similar trend in removal efficiencies as demonstrated in fig s1b all these experiments served to find optimal conditions these results were in agreement with our previous studies kralchevska et al 2016 prucek et al 2013 as it has previously been demonstrated in the case of arsenates removal by ferrate vi some parts of the arsenates were incorporated into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles and also adsorbed on their surfaces in addition the arsenites were found to oxidize to arsenates immediately when in contact with ferrate vi such oxidized arsenites were then removed in situ from aqueous solution analogously as chemically pure arsenates prucek et al 2013 therefore such experiments involving arsenites removal were not performed within this study in the case of the removal of phosphates by ferrate vi the phosphates ions were cleaned from the aqueous solution solely by sorption on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles as products of ferrate vi transformation in water kralchevska et al 2016 3 2 effect of dissolved ions and humic acid concentration on removal of arsenates fig 1 a and b shows the effects of phosphates chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and humic acid on the removal of arsenates under in situ and ex situ conditions in the case of in situ experiments ferrate vi was added to the solution containing arsenic and one of the ions in these experiments the efficiency of arsenates removal was not affected by chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and humic acid up to concentrations of 100 mg l 1 however the removal of arsenates was greatly affected by the presence of phosphates ions the removal efficiency of arsenates decreased gradually as the concentration of phosphates increased the removal efficiency of arsenates lowered to 50 at an p as weight ratio of 1 1 almost complete inhibition of arsenate removal by ferrate vi was observed when the concentration of phosphates was 100 mg l 1 i e at an p as weight ratio of 10 1 arsenates and phosphates have similar values of pka and also of ionic radii resulting in a competition between both of these species for sorption sites on iron iii oxide surface elias et al 2012 in the case of ex situ experiments the ferrate vi was firstly mixed with deionized water adjusted ph 6 6 and then the arsenates and one of the ions were added into this system at a double amount of ferrate vi i e 60 mg l 1 the efficiency of arsenates removal was found to be lowered by 14 in comparison with the in situ process see fig 1a and b the decrease in efficiency of the arsenic removal is explainable as a consequence of the ex situ approach when the arsenate ions are adsorbed predominantly on the surface of the formed and partially aggregated iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles as reported previously prucek et al 2013 the ions the chlorides and the sulfates and the humic acid showed no influence on the efficiency of arsenates removal the removal efficiency only slightly decreased when the concentrations of nitrates and carbonates were 100 mg l 1 see fig 1b conversely the removal efficiency dropped dramatically with the presence of phosphates ions similarly as under the in situ conditions almost complete inhibition of arsenates removal by ferrate vi was observed when the concentration of phosphates reached 60 mg l 1 to comprehend the results pertaining to the effect of phosphates on removal of arsenates we prepared solutions of a fixed concentration of ferrate vi 30 mg l 1 as fe and arsenates 10 mg l 1 as as and a variable concentration of phosphates 0 2 6 0 mg l 1 as p and determined the residual dissolved concentrations of as p and fe after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe filter the changes of the amount of dissolved arsenates phosphates and iron iii in the solutions as a function of added p as weight ratios in the mixed solutions are depicted in fig 2 a as clearly seen an increase in dissolved iron iii is witnessed upon increasing the p as weight ratio this suggests a decrease in the solid surface of iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides in removing arsenates from the solution which results in an increase of dissolved arsenates in the solution i e a decrease in sorption of arsenates with raising level of phosphates in the solution see fig 2a this observation is highly likely to be explained by adopting a scenario under which phosphates ions form complexes with iron iii and do not allow precipitation of iron iii in water jiang et al 2015 kolář et al 2016 rahnemaie et al 2007a 2007b simultaneously an increase in the dissolved concentration of phosphates was observed with the added amount of phosphates in the mixed solution see fig 2a the influence of phosphates ions on precipitation of iron iii was further seen in the representative tem images fig s2 displays dissolved iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles in solution after reaction and filtration through 0 2 μm syringe filters the content of dissolved as p and fe were also monitored for a prolonged time the concentrations of as p and fe remained almost unchanged within a period of one week see fig s3 the sorption capacity of arsenates and phosphates onto the solid iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide surfaces at various p as weight ratios was also calculated see fig 2b the sorption of arsenates decreased when the p as weight ratio was higher than 0 4 1 or a molar ratio of 1 1 on the other hand the phosphates sorption capacity increased up to a weight ratio of 0 8 1 or a molar ratio of 2 1 followed by a decrease with a further increase in the p as weight ratio this suggests that up to an fe p as weight ratio of 3 0 4 1 or a molar ratio of 4 1 1 the specific surface of iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles provided enough free sites for adsorption of arsenates and phosphates ions this initial sorption was followed by the competition between arsenates and phosphates for sorption sites on the surface of solid iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles the removal mechanism of arsenates in the presence of phosphates was further examined in detail by a surface characterization and surface competition studies as described below 3 3 characterization of the solid surface adsorption mechanisms at first the solid surface characterization was explored the distribution of arsenates and phosphates onto the iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles surfaces was examined by tem image analysis to do so three types of solid samples that were obtained from the addition of ferrate vi to aqueous solutions of arsenates only phosphates only and mixed arsenates and phosphates were selected the representative tem images of these three samples are shown in fig 3 a c as it is evident all the systems were composed of ultrasmall particles that tend to form agglomerates generally the nanoparticles exhibited a spherical character and their size ranged from 3 to 10 nm eds elemental mapping of the sample obtained from mixing ferrate vi arsenates and phosphates at an fe as p molar ratio of 4 1 1 proved a homogeneous distribution of arsenates and phosphates adsorbed on the surfaces of iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles see fig 3d in order to thoroughly understand the mechanism of influence of phosphates ions on the arsenates removal an in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was employed 3 4 understanding the mechanism of arsenates removal by ferrate vi in the presence of phosphates it is well known that if ferrate vi is added in aqueous environment it disproportionates rapidly to iron iii forming ultrafine core shell nanoparticles with a core of γ fe2o3 nature and a shell composed of γ feooh at the ph close to 7 prucek et al 2013 importantly γ fe2o3 has a stoichiometric character iron iii ions occupy all the tetrahedral t sites and 5 6 of octahedral o sites in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure leaving the rest of the o sites vacant as proved by the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy measurements prucek et al 2013 recently the determination of spectral ratio of sextet components belonging to the t and o sites in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure was found as a crucial parameter to identify the pathway of removal of arsenic aluminum copper cobalt nickel and cadmium treated by ferrate vi prucek et al 2015 2013 in particular detailed analysis of the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectra proved that with ferrate vi besides sorption the arsenates species were removed from aqueous medium by a partial incorporation of arsenate ions into the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure prucek et al 2013 thus firm embedding of arsenate ions into the crystal structure of iron iii oxide nanoparticles is viewed as an additional process significantly enhancing the removal capacity of the ferrate vi agent on the basis of previous experiments three samples were prepared with an fe as p molar ratios of 4 1 0 5 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the spectral deconvolution of the respective low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectra identified three sextet components i e two sextets with the values of the mössbauer hyperfine parameters resembling those frequently reported for γ fe2o3 for its t and o sites and one sextet with spectral characteristics typical of γ feooh see fig 4 a c as the phosphates level increased the spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet raised approaching to the ideal o t value for stoichiometric γ fe2o3 i e 1 66 1 see table s1 tuček et al 2006 armstrong et al 1966 herein it should be emphasized that when fitting the in field 57fe mössbauer spectra we assumed that the spin canting phenomenon manifested by non vanishing of the 2nd and the 5th sextet resonant lines was more pronounced at the o sites due to vacancies which induce local magnetic anisotropy encouraging the reluctance of iron iii magnetic moments at the o sites to align to the external magnetic field tuček et al 2006 as arsenate ions can enter the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure substituting the iron iii ions the effective electric charge over the lattice is increased thus vacancies are needed to be introduced in order to establish the neutral charge in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure the vacancies are formed in the o sites as evidenced by a decrease in the spectral area of the o sites sextet and increased intensities of the 2nd and the 5th sextet resonant lines in comparison to those observed for the 2nd and the 5th resonant lines of the t sites sextet in other words as the phosphates concentration in the aqueous solution increases smaller portion of arsenate ion is incorporated into the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure therefore a smaller number of vacancies are introduced to compensate the raise in the positive charge as documented by the increased spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet i e 1 25 1 1 52 1 and 1 61 1 for the samples with fe as p molar ratios of 4 1 0 5 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 respectively see table s1 thus the phosphates could prevent arsenate ions entering the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 formed during the in situ reaction of ferrate vi with aqueous solution of arsenates and phosphates containing compounds resulting in the decreased removal capability driven solely by a sorption in order to verify the proposed hypothesis the three following samples were prepared and analyzed i a solid sample from the aqueous solution containing arsenic and nitrates ii a solid sample from the aqueous phosphates containing solution to which ferrate vi and then arsenates were added and iii a solid sample from the aqueous arsenates containing solution to which ferrate vi and then phosphates were added for the sample with an fe as n molar ratio of 4 1 2 three sextet components were identified upon fitting its low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum see fig 4d and table s1 confirming a formation of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles the spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet was found to be 1 03 1 implying that arsenate ions were firmly embedded into the t sites of the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 during in situ treatment of arsenate nitrates solution by ferrate vi as in the case of in situ removal of arsenates by ferrate vi reported previously prucek et al 2013 thus unlike phosphates nitrates do not hamper the removal of arsenic by its incorporation to the formed γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles overall the 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy study provided the evidence that the phosphates hindered the removal of arsenates by firm embedding into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 which significantly decreased the capability of ferrate vi to remove arsenates in water further the 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy studies were performed to examine the removal of arsenates by ferrate vi enhanced by altering the order of the addition of ions in particular if ferrate vi was added to the arsenates containing solution and the phosphates were added only afterwards the embedding of arsenic into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 was favoured as seen from the analysis of the respective low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum see fig 5 a and table s1 evidencing for the o sites to t sites sextet ratio equal to 0 97 1 under this condition the phosphates only adsorbed to the remaining sites on the surface of the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles significantly the addition of the phosphates caused only 9 of arsenates leaching back to the solution moreover only 25 of the added phosphates were adsorbed onto the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum was also recorded for the sample obtained by the addition of ferrate vi to the aqueous solution containing phosphates only followed by the addition of arsenates the results are presented in fig 5b and table s1 the removal mechanism of the arsenates involved solely the adsorption excluding any incorporation of the arsenates into the crystal lattice of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles the removal of the phosphates did not result from the introduction into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 either as demonstrated by the o sites to t sites sextet ratio equal to 1 61 1 as in the case of increasing p as molar ratio and as reported earlier kralchevska et al 2016 for this sample 7 5 of phosphates was found to leach back into the aqueous solution while arsenates adsorption reached 46 these surface competition experiments demonstrated that the adsorbed arsenates can be leached from the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles by a phosphate ion which enters the equilibrium system subsequently simultaneously the arsenates already embedded into the crystal structure of the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles were not affected on the other hand the arsenates were adsorbed on the remaining sites on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles these sites were not occupied by phosphates ions in the equilibrium system of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles and phosphates 4 conclusions the achieved results demonstrate that inorganic ions and organic matter typically present in natural waters have different impact on removal of arsenates by ferrate vi from the aqueous environment interestingly the ions such as chlorides nitrates carbonates and sulfates as well as humic acid had marginal or no effect on the removal efficiency of arsenates by ferrate vi however the presence of the phosphate ions had a negative influence on the efficiency of arsenates removal by ferrate vi with the increased concentration of phosphates the efficiency of arsenates removal was found to decrease in summary there are three crucial aspects of the effect of phosphates on the arsenates removal mechanisms at a low p as weight ratio up to 1 1 the incorporation of the arsenates ions into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 nanoparticles was suppressed the arsenates were mainly adsorbed on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles increasing the p as weight ratio more than 1 1 led to the competition between the arsenates and the phosphates with an increased concentration of phosphates ions the number of arsenates on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was reduced finally with a further increase in the phosphates concentration the complexation of iron iii ions with phosphate ions occurred which led to the reduction of arsenates removal efficiency because of a lower content of precipitated γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles these findings were confirmed through in situ and ex situ experiments arsenate and phosphate ions frequently occur together in natural water therefore all the described aspects need to be considered prior to the application of ferrate vi for arsenates removal in real natural waters if the phosphates concentration significantly exceeds arsenates it is necessary to treat the phosphates first thereafter ferrate vi can be applied for the arsenates and or phosphates removal with different efficiency depending on the p as weight ratio for this reason it is necessary to know the content of the phosphates in arsenic contaminated waters to gain its effective elimination acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the support from the technology agency of the czech republic competence centres te01020218 the ministry of the interior of the

19516,arsenic compounds are carcinogenic to humans and are typically removed from contaminated water using various sorbents the ionic composition plays a significant role in arsenate removal efficiency during the process of water remediation here we quantify the effects of natural ions chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and phosphates and humic acid on the removal of arsenates by ferrate vi at ph 6 6 in the experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as and the concentrations of ions varied in the range from 5 to 100 mg l 1 of element in ionic form and humic acid the achieved results show that only phosphate ions had principle influence on the efficiency of arsenate removal by ferrate vi the effect of phosphates was elucidated by applying transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy to solid samples prepared under different weight ratios of ferrate vi arsenates and phosphates these results show three crucial effects of phosphates on the arsenate removal mechanisms at low p as weight ratio up to 1 1 the incorporation of arsenate ions into the crystalline structure of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was found to be suppressed by the presence of phosphates thus arsenates were mainly adsorbed onto the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles further increase in the p as weight ratio more than 1 1 resulted in the competition between arsenates and phosphates sorption with the increased concentration of phosphate ions the number of arsenates on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was reduced finally the complexation of iron iii ions with phosphate ions occurred leading to a decrease in the arsenates removal efficiency which resulted from a lower content of precipitated γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles all these aspects need to be considered prior to application of ferrate vi for arsenates removal in real natural waters

carbonates exceeding 500 mg l 1 phosphates 0 5 mg l 1 and doc 10 mg l 1 shvartsev 2008 ferrate vi ions have been proved to be an effective agent for treating various organic and inorganic contaminants sharma 2002 wood 1958 the main benefit of the application of ferrate vi arises from the simultaneous oxidation disinfection and subsequent coagulation by iron iii oxides the final products of ferrate vi reduction in water in recent years a few studies have been reported on the effective coagulation of toxic metal ions including arsenic by ferrate vi bartzatt et al 1992 filip et al 2011 jiang and lloyd 2002 prucek et al 2013 however for the first time the role of natural ions and humic acid has been studied systematically to improve the efficiency of ferrate vi in removing arsenates the objectives of the present paper are i to address the issue of removal of arsenates by ferrate vi in water containing chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates phosphates and humic acid ii to understand the negative effect of phosphates on arsenates removal by ferrate vi by performing experiments as a function of fe as p molar or weight ratios and iii to elucidate the mechanism of decreasing efficiency of arsenates removal in the presence of phosphates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals stock solutions of arsenates and phosphates at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were prepared using na2haso4 7h2o 99 995 sigma aldrich and kh2po4 99 0 penta chemicals respectively inorganic salts i e nacl nano3 nahco3 and na2so4 and humic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich standard solutions of as p and fe for atomic absorption spectroscopy aas measurements were prepared using tracecert commercial standards with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 of an element in nitric acid which were purchased from fluka inc all chemicals were used as received without any further purification potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 sigma aldrich was used throughout the experiments the weighted amount of solid ferrate vi was added to the sample solution before each experiment all the samples were prepared with deionized water 18 mω cm 1 millipore system 2 2 removal of arsenates and phosphates by ferrate vi first the influence of concentration of ferrate vi on the removal of either arsenates or phosphates was monitored at ph 6 6 in the experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as the concentrations of ferrate vi as fe varied up to 80 mg l 1 after ferrate vi was added the ph of the solutions was adjusted by 2 solution of hydrochloric acid the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of either arsenates or phosphates was examined at fe as weight ratios of 3 1 and fe p weight ratio of 6 1 respectively in all these experiments solutions of ferrate vi were added to the solutions of arsenates or phosphates in water in the erlenmeyer flasks the final volume was 50 ml mixed solutions were shaken on a conventional end over end shaker for 60 min and filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters afterwards the residual concentration of arsenates or phosphates in the filtrate were immediately determined using an aas technique these experiments served to find the fe as or p weight ratios and to optimize the ph for further experiments for the investigation of the effect of ions i e chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and phosphates and humic acid on removal efficiency of arsenates two sets of samples termed as ex situ and in situ were prepared the in situ samples originated from simultaneous additions of ferrate vi and ion containing salt only one of the studied ions to arsenates containing water after ferrate vi was added the ph of the solutions was adjusted and solution was shaken for 60 min in other words the process involved the formation of the secondary iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides from the ferrate vi in the presence of arsenates and eventually other ions in the in situ experiments the initial concentration of arsenates was 10 mg l 1 as as and the concentration of ferrate vi was set to 30 mg l 1 as fe the ex situ samples were formed in two steps i adding ferrate vi to deionized water was followed by adjusting the ph of the solution to 6 6 and by subsequent shaking of the samples for 30 min ii a mixed solution containing arsenic and ion containing salts only one of the studied ions was then added to the mixture prepared in the first step the as prepared samples were kept at ph 6 6 and shaken for 60 min in other words at first the process involved the formation and partial aggregation of the secondary iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides from the ferrate vi in deionized water followed by addition of arsenates and ions to the iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides solution in the next step the in situ and ex situ procedures processes have already been described and explained in detail elsewhere prucek et al 2013 the initial concentration of arsenates as as was again set to 10 mg l 1 the amount of solid k2feo4 added to obtain the final concentration of iron was 60 mg l 1 as fe the concentrations of ions were in the range from 5 to 100 mg l 1 of a particular element in ionic form and humic acid i e nitrates as n carbonates as c sulfates as s and phosphates as p the experiments were performed at ph 6 6 these experiments were carried out in triplicates the detailed investigation of the effect of phosphates on the removal of arsenates was studied by determining removal efficiency and sorption capacity in this case the prepared solutions had fixed concentrations of ferrate vi 30 mg l 1 as fe and arsenates 10 mg l 1 as as and variable concentrations of phosphates ranging from 0 2 to 6 mg l 1 as p mixing and filtrate procedures were identical to those described above for the physicochemical characterization of the solid samples several types of samples were prepared for clear understanding of the mechanism of the effect of phosphates ions on the arsenates removal all the solid samples for characterizations were prepared in molar ratios in molar ratios the count of ions in the system was evident the in situ samples of ferrate vi in arsenates and phosphates containing water at a varying amount of phosphates at ph 6 6 and the in situ sample of ferrate vi in arsenates and nitrates containing water at ph 6 6 were prepared finally the two samples for the study of the effect of arsenates and phosphates ions on their sorption competition on the iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles surface were prepared i e i the in situ sample of ferrate vi in arsenates containing water at an fe as molar ratio of 4 1 at

low temperature and in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy measurements the samples were placed inside the chamber of the cryomagnetic system oxford instruments uk to which the mössbauer spectrometer is mounted in a parallel geometry if an external magnetic field is applied in the sample position its field lines are oriented in the parallel direction with respect to the γ rays propagation the collected 57fe mössbauer spectra were analyzed with the mosswinn software program klencsar et al 1996 prior to fitting the signal to noise ratio was increased simultaneously applying the statistical procedure developed by prochazka et al 2010 and mosswinn software routines the isomer shift values were referenced to metallic α fe at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates in the first set of experiments the efficiency of removal of arsenates or phosphates at various concentrations of ferrate vi was examined at ph 6 6 initial concentration of arsenates or phosphates was set to 10 mg l 1 as as or p the concentration of fe calculated from the content in ferrate vi varied in the range from 5 to 50 mg l 1 as shown in fig s1a the removal of arsenates and phosphates was facilitated by increasing the concentrations of ferrate vi the complete removal of arsenates was obtained at an fe as weight ratio of 3 1 or a molar ratio of 4 1 comparatively an fe p weight ratio of 6 1 or a molar ratio of 3 1 was needed to obtain the complete removal of phosphates these weight molar ratios were then used to investigate the effect of the ph on the removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates see fig s1b the maximum removal efficiency of arsenates and phosphates was found at ph 6 6 a further increase in the ph decreased the removal efficiency of both arsenates and phosphates see fig s1b sharp decreases in removal efficiencies were observed in the ph range from 7 5 to 9 0 similar values of pka of phosphates and arsenates see the text in the supplementary data file for more details reflected a similar trend in removal efficiencies as demonstrated in fig s1b all these experiments served to find optimal conditions these results were in agreement with our previous studies kralchevska et al 2016 prucek et al 2013 as it has previously been demonstrated in the case of arsenates removal by ferrate vi some parts of the arsenates were incorporated into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles and also adsorbed on their surfaces in addition the arsenites were found to oxidize to arsenates immediately when in contact with ferrate vi such oxidized arsenites were then removed in situ from aqueous solution analogously as chemically pure arsenates prucek et al 2013 therefore such experiments involving arsenites removal were not performed within this study in the case of the removal of phosphates by ferrate vi the phosphates ions were cleaned from the aqueous solution solely by sorption on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles as products of ferrate vi transformation in water kralchevska et al 2016 3 2 effect of dissolved ions and humic acid concentration on removal of arsenates fig 1 a and b shows the effects of phosphates chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and humic acid on the removal of arsenates under in situ and ex situ conditions in the case of in situ experiments ferrate vi was added to the solution containing arsenic and one of the ions in these experiments the efficiency of arsenates removal was not affected by chlorides nitrates carbonates sulfates and humic acid up to concentrations of 100 mg l 1 however the removal of arsenates was greatly affected by the presence of phosphates ions the removal efficiency of arsenates decreased gradually as the concentration of phosphates increased the removal efficiency of arsenates lowered to 50 at an p as weight ratio of 1 1 almost complete inhibition of arsenate removal by ferrate vi was observed when the concentration of phosphates was 100 mg l 1 i e at an p as weight ratio of 10 1 arsenates and phosphates have similar values of pka and also of ionic radii resulting in a competition between both of these species for sorption sites on iron iii oxide surface elias et al 2012 in the case of ex situ experiments the ferrate vi was firstly mixed with deionized water adjusted ph 6 6 and then the arsenates and one of the ions were added into this system at a double amount of ferrate vi i e 60 mg l 1 the efficiency of arsenates removal was found to be lowered by 14 in comparison with the in situ process see fig 1a and b the decrease in efficiency of the arsenic removal is explainable as a consequence of the ex situ approach when the arsenate ions are adsorbed predominantly on the surface of the formed and partially aggregated iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles as reported previously prucek et al 2013 the ions the chlorides and the sulfates and the humic acid showed no influence on the efficiency of arsenates removal the removal efficiency only slightly decreased when the concentrations of nitrates and carbonates were 100 mg l 1 see fig 1b conversely the removal efficiency dropped dramatically with the presence of phosphates ions similarly as under the in situ conditions almost complete inhibition of arsenates removal by ferrate vi was observed when the concentration of phosphates reached 60 mg l 1 to comprehend the results pertaining to the effect of phosphates on removal of arsenates we prepared solutions of a fixed concentration of ferrate vi 30 mg l 1 as fe and arsenates 10 mg l 1 as as and a variable concentration of phosphates 0 2 6 0 mg l 1 as p and determined the residual dissolved concentrations of as p and fe after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe filter the changes of the amount of dissolved arsenates phosphates and iron iii in the solutions as a function of added p as weight ratios in the mixed solutions are depicted in fig 2 a as clearly seen an increase in dissolved iron iii is witnessed upon increasing the p as weight ratio this suggests a decrease in the solid surface of iron iii oxides oxyhydroxides in removing arsenates from the solution which results in an increase of dissolved arsenates in the solution i e a decrease in sorption of arsenates with raising level of phosphates in the solution see fig 2a this observation is highly likely to be explained by adopting a scenario under which phosphates ions form complexes with iron iii and do not allow precipitation of iron iii in water jiang et al 2015 kolář et al 2016 rahnemaie et al 2007a 2007b simultaneously an increase in the dissolved concentration of phosphates was observed with the added amount of phosphates in the mixed solution see fig 2a the influence of phosphates ions on precipitation of iron iii was further seen in the representative tem images fig s2 displays dissolved iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles in solution after reaction and filtration through 0 2 μm syringe filters the content of dissolved as p and fe were also monitored for a prolonged time the concentrations of as p and fe remained almost unchanged within a period of one week see fig s3 the sorption capacity of arsenates and phosphates onto the solid iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide surfaces at various p as weight ratios was also calculated see fig 2b the sorption of arsenates decreased when the p as weight ratio was higher than 0 4 1 or a molar ratio of 1 1 on the other hand the phosphates sorption capacity increased up to a weight ratio of 0 8 1 or a molar ratio of 2 1 followed by a decrease with a further increase in the p as weight ratio this suggests that up to an fe p as weight ratio of 3 0 4 1 or a molar ratio of 4 1 1 the specific surface of iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles provided enough free sites for adsorption of arsenates and phosphates ions this initial sorption was followed by the competition between arsenates and phosphates for sorption sites on the surface of solid iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles the removal mechanism of arsenates in the presence of phosphates was further examined in detail by a surface characterization and surface competition studies as described below 3 3 characterization of the solid surface adsorption mechanisms at first the solid surface characterization was explored the distribution of arsenates and phosphates onto the iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles surfaces was examined by tem image analysis to do so three types of solid samples that were obtained from the addition of ferrate vi to aqueous solutions of arsenates only phosphates only and mixed arsenates and phosphates were selected the representative tem images of these three samples are shown in fig 3 a c as it is evident all the systems were composed of ultrasmall particles that tend to form agglomerates generally the nanoparticles exhibited a spherical character and their size ranged from 3 to 10 nm eds elemental mapping of the sample obtained from mixing ferrate vi arsenates and phosphates at an fe as p molar ratio of 4 1 1 proved a homogeneous distribution of arsenates and phosphates adsorbed on the surfaces of iron iii oxide oxyhydroxide nanoparticles see fig 3d in order to thoroughly understand the mechanism of influence of phosphates ions on the arsenates removal an in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was employed 3 4 understanding the mechanism of arsenates removal by ferrate vi in the presence of phosphates it is well known that if ferrate vi is added in aqueous environment it disproportionates rapidly to iron iii forming ultrafine core shell nanoparticles with a core of γ fe2o3 nature and a shell composed of γ feooh at the ph close to 7 prucek et al 2013 importantly γ fe2o3 has a stoichiometric character iron iii ions occupy all the tetrahedral t sites and 5 6 of octahedral o sites in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure leaving the rest of the o sites vacant as proved by the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy measurements prucek et al 2013 recently the determination of spectral ratio of sextet components belonging to the t and o sites in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure was found as a crucial parameter to identify the pathway of removal of arsenic aluminum copper cobalt nickel and cadmium treated by ferrate vi prucek et al 2015 2013 in particular detailed analysis of the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectra proved that with ferrate vi besides sorption the arsenates species were removed from aqueous medium by a partial incorporation of arsenate ions into the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure prucek et al 2013 thus firm embedding of arsenate ions into the crystal structure of iron iii oxide nanoparticles is viewed as an additional process significantly enhancing the removal capacity of the ferrate vi agent on the basis of previous experiments three samples were prepared with an fe as p molar ratios of 4 1 0 5 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the spectral deconvolution of the respective low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectra identified three sextet components i e two sextets with the values of the mössbauer hyperfine parameters resembling those frequently reported for γ fe2o3 for its t and o sites and one sextet with spectral characteristics typical of γ feooh see fig 4 a c as the phosphates level increased the spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet raised approaching to the ideal o t value for stoichiometric γ fe2o3 i e 1 66 1 see table s1 tuček et al 2006 armstrong et al 1966 herein it should be emphasized that when fitting the in field 57fe mössbauer spectra we assumed that the spin canting phenomenon manifested by non vanishing of the 2nd and the 5th sextet resonant lines was more pronounced at the o sites due to vacancies which induce local magnetic anisotropy encouraging the reluctance of iron iii magnetic moments at the o sites to align to the external magnetic field tuček et al 2006 as arsenate ions can enter the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure substituting the iron iii ions the effective electric charge over the lattice is increased thus vacancies are needed to be introduced in order to establish the neutral charge in the γ fe2o3 crystal structure the vacancies are formed in the o sites as evidenced by a decrease in the spectral area of the o sites sextet and increased intensities of the 2nd and the 5th sextet resonant lines in comparison to those observed for the 2nd and the 5th resonant lines of the t sites sextet in other words as the phosphates concentration in the aqueous solution increases smaller portion of arsenate ion is incorporated into the t sites of the γ fe2o3 crystal structure therefore a smaller number of vacancies are introduced to compensate the raise in the positive charge as documented by the increased spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet i e 1 25 1 1 52 1 and 1 61 1 for the samples with fe as p molar ratios of 4 1 0 5 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 respectively see table s1 thus the phosphates could prevent arsenate ions entering the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 formed during the in situ reaction of ferrate vi with aqueous solution of arsenates and phosphates containing compounds resulting in the decreased removal capability driven solely by a sorption in order to verify the proposed hypothesis the three following samples were prepared and analyzed i a solid sample from the aqueous solution containing arsenic and nitrates ii a solid sample from the aqueous phosphates containing solution to which ferrate vi and then arsenates were added and iii a solid sample from the aqueous arsenates containing solution to which ferrate vi and then phosphates were added for the sample with an fe as n molar ratio of 4 1 2 three sextet components were identified upon fitting its low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum see fig 4d and table s1 confirming a formation of γ fe2o3 γ feooh core shell nanoparticles the spectral ratio of the o sites to t sites sextet was found to be 1 03 1 implying that arsenate ions were firmly embedded into the t sites of the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 during in situ treatment of arsenate nitrates solution by ferrate vi as in the case of in situ removal of arsenates by ferrate vi reported previously prucek et al 2013 thus unlike phosphates nitrates do not hamper the removal of arsenic by its incorporation to the formed γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles overall the 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy study provided the evidence that the phosphates hindered the removal of arsenates by firm embedding into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 which significantly decreased the capability of ferrate vi to remove arsenates in water further the 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy studies were performed to examine the removal of arsenates by ferrate vi enhanced by altering the order of the addition of ions in particular if ferrate vi was added to the arsenates containing solution and the phosphates were added only afterwards the embedding of arsenic into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 was favoured as seen from the analysis of the respective low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum see fig 5 a and table s1 evidencing for the o sites to t sites sextet ratio equal to 0 97 1 under this condition the phosphates only adsorbed to the remaining sites on the surface of the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles significantly the addition of the phosphates caused only 9 of arsenates leaching back to the solution moreover only 25 of the added phosphates were adsorbed onto the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles the low temperature in field 57fe mössbauer spectrum was also recorded for the sample obtained by the addition of ferrate vi to the aqueous solution containing phosphates only followed by the addition of arsenates the results are presented in fig 5b and table s1 the removal mechanism of the arsenates involved solely the adsorption excluding any incorporation of the arsenates into the crystal lattice of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles the removal of the phosphates did not result from the introduction into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 either as demonstrated by the o sites to t sites sextet ratio equal to 1 61 1 as in the case of increasing p as molar ratio and as reported earlier kralchevska et al 2016 for this sample 7 5 of phosphates was found to leach back into the aqueous solution while arsenates adsorption reached 46 these surface competition experiments demonstrated that the adsorbed arsenates can be leached from the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles by a phosphate ion which enters the equilibrium system subsequently simultaneously the arsenates already embedded into the crystal structure of the γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles were not affected on the other hand the arsenates were adsorbed on the remaining sites on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles these sites were not occupied by phosphates ions in the equilibrium system of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles and phosphates 4 conclusions the achieved results demonstrate that inorganic ions and organic matter typically present in natural waters have different impact on removal of arsenates by ferrate vi from the aqueous environment interestingly the ions such as chlorides nitrates carbonates and sulfates as well as humic acid had marginal or no effect on the removal efficiency of arsenates by ferrate vi however the presence of the phosphate ions had a negative influence on the efficiency of arsenates removal by ferrate vi with the increased concentration of phosphates the efficiency of arsenates removal was found to decrease in summary there are three crucial aspects of the effect of phosphates on the arsenates removal mechanisms at a low p as weight ratio up to 1 1 the incorporation of the arsenates ions into the crystal structure of γ fe2o3 nanoparticles was suppressed the arsenates were mainly adsorbed on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles increasing the p as weight ratio more than 1 1 led to the competition between the arsenates and the phosphates with an increased concentration of phosphates ions the number of arsenates on the surface of γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles was reduced finally with a further increase in the phosphates concentration the complexation of iron iii ions with phosphate ions occurred which led to the reduction of arsenates removal efficiency because of a lower content of precipitated γ fe2o3 γ feooh nanoparticles these findings were confirmed through in situ and ex situ experiments arsenate and phosphate ions frequently occur together in natural water therefore all the described aspects need to be considered prior to the application of ferrate vi for arsenates removal in real natural waters if the phosphates concentration significantly exceeds arsenates it is necessary to treat the phosphates first thereafter ferrate vi can be applied for the arsenates and or phosphates removal with different efficiency depending on the p as weight ratio for this reason it is necessary to know the content of the phosphates in arsenic contaminated waters to gain its effective elimination acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the support from the technology agency of the czech republic competence centres te01020218 the ministry of the interior of the

19517,the impact of the starting inoculum on long term anaerobic digestion performance process functionality and microbial community composition remains unclear to understand the impact of starting inoculum active microbial communities from four different full scale anaerobic digesters were each used to inoculate four continuous lab scale anaerobic digesters which were operated identically for 295 days digesters were operated at 15 days solid retention time an organic loading rate of 1 g cod lr 1 d 1 75 25 cellulose casein and 37 c results showed that long term process performance metabolic rates hydrolytic acetogenic and methanogenic and microbial community are independent of the inoculum source digesters process performance converged after 80 days while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged after 120 145 days the convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core community proves that the deterministic factors process operational conditions were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition indeed the core community represented 72 of the relative abundance among the four digesters moreover a number of positive correlations were observed between higher metabolic rates and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups these correlations showed that both substrate consumers and suppliers trigger higher metabolic rates expanding the knowledge of the nexus between microorganisms and functionality overall these results support that deterministic factors control microbial communities in bioreactors independently of the inoculum source hence it seems plausible that a desired microbial composition and functionality can be achieved by tuning process operational conditions keywords anaerobic digestion microbial community core community activity assays kinetics correlation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a process used worldwide to treat and stabilise organic waste and currently stands as a key technology in the emerging green economy de vrieze et al 2015b puyol et al 2016 ad is a biochemical microbially mediated multi step process where organic matter is hydrolysed fermented syntrophically oxidised to acetate and hydrogen and converted to biogas methane and carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen batstone et al 2002 extensive process based research and operation of full scale digesters has improved the feasibility and reliability of ad however a better understanding of the associated microbial communities and their dynamics may reveal new avenues to further improve ad efficiency and broaden its application carballa et al 2015 microorganisms in engineered ad systems are mainly provided during the inoculation phase where inoculum e g digested sludge manure from a well functioning anaerobic digester is transferred to a new digester from an engineering perspective inoculum is used to provide active microorganisms reducing the risk of process failure during start up or facilitating the recovery after major process disturbances regueiro et al 2012 given the key role of microorganisms in ad there is a fundamental need to determine the impact of the inoculum microbial community on the long term ad performance the effects of initial microbial community composition on anaerobic digestion performance have primarily been assessed by determining the capabilities of the starting inoculum through short term batch experiments chamy and ramos 2011 de vrieze et al 2015a perrotta et al 2017 however these assays cannot predict if the microbial community will maintain its activity and capabilities in the new environment neither if the microbial community will be able to develop new capabilities long term continuous replicates starting with the same inoculum have shown that a microbial community is governed by deterministic factors i e the microbial community is driven to a greater extent by operational conditions fernández et al 1999 lucas et al 2015 vanwonterghem et al 2014 liu et al 2017 showed that the long term microbial community of three anaerobic digesters started with different inocula was also driven by deterministic factors exhibiting a similar overall performance i e similar methane yields however the specific activity of the various ad functional groups hydrolytic fermentative and methanogenic in these studies was not explored leaving open the question to what extent the function of those microbial communities converged this fact is especially relevant since the role of individual microbial groups many of which can perform a variety of functional roles remains undiscovered challenging the evaluation that microbial composition and dynamics exert over the process performance martiny et al 2015 widder et al 2016 the variations in microbial communities can have an impact on process performance as shown by wittebolle et al 2005 and han et al 2016 who showed that process functionality was related to differences in microbial composition conversely it has also been shown that dynamic microbial communities do not necessarily result in different process capabilities since microorganisms can maintain a functional stability of the major metabolic processes allison and martiny 2008 fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 gobet et al 2012 wittebolle et al 2008 therefore in engineered ecosystems such as ad where microbial communities are imported it is critical to identify how different starting microbial communities will develop and function when subjected to the same operational conditions in addition microbial communities can be functional redundant carballa et al 2015 in which case changes in microbial community composition may not influence the process performance and metabolic rates this study aims to evaluate how different anaerobic microbial communities transition due to certain operational conditions and how this affects long term digestion performance to achieve this aim active microbial communities from

were performed in rstudio v3 3 1 digesters performance was compared using one way anova 5 significance threshold microbial communities were analysed using vegan oksanen et al 2016 and phyloseq packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 differences in community composition and dynamics were explored by principal component analysis pca where the otu table was rarefied to the depth of the shallowest sample 14500 counts using rarefy even depth rgn seed 712 from phyloseq package the data was hellinger transformed prior ordination analysis of procrustes rotations was performed to compare the individual pca microbial trajectories of each digester correlations between microbial community composition and performance data were calculated using environmental parameter fitting envfit in the package vegan performance data was variance stabilised prior to correlation analyses community dynamics and structure were further explored through α diversity and β diversity α diversity indexes estimated richness simpson index and shannon index were calculated based on repeated random subsampling of the raw otu table β diversity was examined by non metrical multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity similarities between the microbial communities of the four digesters were also explored by computing the core community i e number of shared otus among the four digesters at each time point pearson and spearman correlations between metabolic rates and taxa relative abundance were performed on hellinger transformed abundance and non transformed calculated metabolic rates prior to the correlation tests variance due to primary factors i e time and digester was subtracted in those tests where these primary factors were significant 3 results 3 1 anaerobic digesters performance operation of the digesters was divided in 3 phases fig 1 i start up day 0 34 period where the srt was decreased from 40 to 15 days ii transition day 35 80 period where the inoculum background was washed out and iii steady state day 81 295 period where all digesters run at stable performance operation of all digesters was disturbed due to a malfunction of the central pump controller on day 156 which caused an organic load shock 4 times the nominal olr and exposed the contents of all digesters to air 7 h all digester performance returned to pre disturbance levels by day 165 data from day 157 to day 165 is not included in performance analysis biogas data from days 215 240 was not included in performance analysis due to a leak in the gas collection line table 1 summarises the steady state performance of the 4 digesters excluding the aforementioned periods supplementary figures s i and s ii show the evolution of the measured parameters over time the rapid establishment of methane production and low vfa concentrations indicated that the four inocula adapted to the new operational conditions with the accumulation of propionate in pl 75 mg cod l 1 the only remarkable phenomenon steady state conditions were reached at day 80 although metabolic assays profiles and microbial analysis shows that the community continued to evolve until days 120 145 figs 2 and 3 during steady state conditions digesters performance parameters were not significantly different vfa levels at steady state averaged 19 1 mg cod l 1 p 0 250 with acetate being the major vfa compound followed by traces of propionate valerate and butyrate figure s i ph values were stable for the 4 digesters at 7 3 0 1 p 0 767 methane yield averaged 279 22 lnch4 kg 1 codin p 0 783 which corresponds to a feedstock cod removal of 80 this value is in agreement with the cod removals values 80 1 p 0 178 calculated by measuring the influent and effluent cod table 1 the latter proves that the measured data is both consistent and representative of process performance figure s iii 3 2 metabolic activities metabolic assays along the experimental period were used to evaluate the capacity of the main ad metabolic steps i e hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the consumption rate of cellulose butyrate propionate acetate and formate reflects the ability of the microbial community to utilise the specific substrate the substrate consumption rates are shown in fig 2 the initial metabolic assays day 0 were carried out prior to digester start up and reflect the behaviour of the inocula adapted to their native habitats the initial metabolic profile of each inoculum was different sl and bg showed higher acetogenesis both butyrate and propionate and acetoclastic methanogenesis rates compared to ss and pl the hydrolytic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rates were more similar among inocula additionally each inoculum had a unique balance between metabolic steps figure s iv the metabolic rates of the tested substrates converged among digesters after 145 days of operation with averages of i 0 08 0 01 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for cellulose hydrolysis ii 0 19 0 02 gcod g 1

vsinoculum d 1 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 3 microbial communities the development of the seeding microbial communities was evaluated by pca ordination based on hellinger transformed rarefied abundances fig 3 and nmds ordinations based on bray curtis dissimilarity figure s v both analyses showed that the trajectories traced by the four inocula migrated to a similar region in the ordination space after 120 145 days of operation about 65 days after process performance convergence with time as the only significant factor p 0 001 additionally the individual trajectories of the bacterial and archaeal domain showed a higher variability for bacteria than archaea over time see figure s vi in supplementary material different groups of taxa increased in abundance with operational time while others were progressively washed out from the digesters as shown in fig 4 and figure s x among the initially dominant groups methanobacterium methanolinea various representatives from phylum chloroflexi anaerolineaceae and anaerolineaceae candidate genus t78 firmicutes bacilli and clostridiales candidate phylum od1 and synergistetes genus e6 clearly decreased in abundance the groups that flourished in the digesters were methanomicrobiales methanoregulaceae and methanospirillum ruminococcaceae spirochaetes treponema and sediment 4 kosmotoga and dethiosulfovibrionaceae candidate genus ha73 otus belonging to methanosaeta and bacteroidales were found in high abundance average relative abundance 16 7 7 3 and 10 0 5 3 respectively at all times in all digesters in addition to microbial community composition the estimated richness also showed that the microbial structure converged for the four digesters to an average of 358 15 16s otus similarly simpson diversity d and shannon wiener h entropy showed the synchronisation of all digesters after 185 days with averages of 0 95 0 01 d and 4 05 0 19 h see figure s vii the four starting inocula shared an average of 31 of the otus representing around 43 of the total relative abundance most of the shared relative abundance was due to archaea 34 bacteria only represented 9 of the initial shared community figure s viii during the microbial steady state day 120 295 52 of all identified otus were shared among all digesters representing 72 of the total microbial community relative abundance figure s viii in contrast to initial conditions most of the shared relative abundance was due to bacteria 54 while archaea accounted for 18 finally the procrustes analyses showed that the microbial community development of the 4 digesters followed a coordinated pattern of change despite the initial microbial composition figure s ix tables s i 3 4 linkage of microbial composition to functionality 16s rrna data was correlated with the output of metabolic activity assays to infer microbial function and some relationships between taxa at 97 similarity using the lowest possible taxonomic assignment and metabolic rates were identified fig 5 shows pearson and spearman correlations where only positive correlations have been considered see figure s xi for complete correlation matrix the presence of flavobacteriaceae representatives of chloroflexi firmicutes candidates phyla od1 and op8 and armatimonadetes were positively correlated with an increment in cellulolytic rates however these groups belonged to taxa with relative abundances of less than 2 5 in all samples butyrate consumption rate was positively associated with syntrophomonas syntrophobacter and bacteroidete ba008 while propionate consumption rate was positively correlated with clostridium veillonellaceae succiniclasticum phycisphaeraceae and syntrophobacter methanomassiliicoccus was the only methanogen correlated with higher acetate consumption rates however unclassified bacteroidales representatives of chloroflexi candidate phyla gn04 geobacter and syntrophobacter were also correlated with higher acetate consumption rates formate consumption rate was not correlated to the relative abundance of methanogens but positively correlated with several bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria representatives of caldiresica and chlorobi and genus fibrobacter and candidatus cloacamonas 4 discussion 4 1 microbial composition linked to process function and metabolic rates 4 1 1 process and microbial community performance ad efficiency is governed by the limiting step the slowest as shown by the metabolic assays results hydrolysis was the limiting step regardless of the inoculum or operational time see fig 2 and figure s iv this is consistent with the literature where hydrolysis is generally accepted as the limiting step during mesophilic treatment of particulate organic matter batstone et al 2002 vavilin et al 2008 the slow and stable hydrolysis rate combined with a relatively long srt 15 days explains the convergence of the methane production of the 4 digesters after 60 days 3 5 srt fig 1a however neither the metabolic rates of downstream processes nor the microbial communities had converged at this time figs 2 and 3 the dominance of the hydrolysis rate on process performance also explains the low vfa concentrations 20 mgcod l 1 detected in all digesters hydrolysis was not only the slowest step but also the metabolic rate that fluctuated the least over time fig 2 the fact that similar hydrolysis rates were obtained by different microbial communities indicates functional redundancy of the hydrolytic population carballa et al 2015 this is further supported using functional assignments based on literature the initial hydrolytic population of sl and ss was dominated by chloroflexi wwe1 and clostridum pl was initially dominated by clostridiales and bacilli and the bg community had a diverse hydrolytic population but with lower relative abundance fig 4 the inferred hydrolytic population of the 4 digesters converged after 145 days and was dominated by ruminococcaceae bacteroidales thermotogales and spirochaetes ad efficiency was clearly controlled by the hydrolytic step however ad is a highly interdependent process and therefore the performance of downstream metabolic processes i e acetogenesis and methanogenesis should also be considered since they contribute to process stability and end products profile acetogenesis was in most cases the fastest step as well as the step with the most variable metabolic rate fig 2 as a general trend the relative abundance of syntrophaceae syntrophobacteraceae syntrophorhabdaceae and dethiosulfovibrionaceae stabilised to similar levels in the 4 digesters after 120 days acetoclastic methanogenesis was faster than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the 4 digesters throughout most of the experiment confirming that acetoclastic methanogenesis is the preferred methanogenic pathway at these operational conditions this is in agreement with the general trend in the literature for mesophilic anaerobic digesters operated at low ammonia and vfa concentrations fotidis et al 2013 regueiro et al 2012 concomitantly methanosaeta an acetoclastic methanogen was the dominant methanogen in all digesters for the full duration of the experiment the other methanogens present in the digesters were identified as hydrogenotrophic methanogens which displayed a higher variability than the acetoclastic population methanobacteriales present in all native inocula but with different abundance vanished in favour of methanomicrobiales although this shift in composition and abundance did not lead to changes in the formate consumption rate this suggests a high level of functional redundancy within hydrogenotrophic methanogens 4 1 2 relationship between metabolic rates and individual microbial groups correlation results related higher hydrolysis rates with flavobacteriaceae chloroflexi candidate class shd 231 firmicutes candidate class sha 98 and other bacterial phyla which are still not fully understood such as candidate phylum op8 or od1 the aforementioned bacteria tend to be very functionally diverse and associated with several capabilities including the use of polysaccharides the conversion of high molecular weight compounds to low molecular weight ones and show glycolysis metabolism buchan et al 2014 farag et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 sun et al 2015 2016 for instance the candidate class sha 37 from the recently defined phylum armatimonadetes showed a strong positive correlation with the hydrolysis rate armatimonadetes are defined as aerobic soil based oligotrophs lee et al 2014 however armatimonadetes have been identified in low abundance in several ad processes li et al 2015 st pierre and wright 2014 tuan et al 2014 these previous observations indicate that within armatimonadetes some strains are not strict aerobes although their role in ad is to date unidentified the present results suggest a conceivable involvement of the candidate class sha 37 in the hydrolysis fermentation step the correlation analysis does not allow discriminating if the forenamed bacteria are directly involved in the cellulose break down or utilising the monomers released from the hydrolysis berlemont et al 2014 however the presence of these bacteria benefited the hydrolysis acetogenic consumption rates showed positive correlations with well known acetogenic bacteria such as syntrophomonas butyrate consumption and syntrophobacter butyrate and propionate consumption veillonellaceae which is able to ferment sugars to propionate via acrylate and succinate pathways louis et al 2014 showed a positive relation with the propionate consumption rate this suggests that propionate consuming organisms are triggered by propionate supply and demonstrates the important interactions between metabolic steps in ad similarly the candidate family ba008 associated with bacteroidetes showed a positive correlation with butyrate consumption rate there is currently little information available on ba008 however the only strain isolated to date tbc1t has an anaerobic fermentative metabolism sun et al 2016 which could have been contributing to butyrate production supporting the higher rates of butyrate consumers methanogenenic rates could not be linked to shifts in archaeal community since one of the variables was relatively constant on the one hand methanosaeta was ubiquitous while acetate consumption rates were variable on the other hand the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was dynamic but similar formate consumption rates were obtained however positive correlations were found with taxa capable to produce acetate as an end product such as syntrophobacter geobacter and some bacteroidales kuever 2014 rotaru et al 2014 which could have contributed to the higher acetoclastic methanogenic rates by supplying acetate to methanosaeta similarly fibrobacter showed a positive correlation with the formate consumption rate the complete genome of fibrobacter succinogenes revealed a specialised cellulose hydrolyser that utilises the soluble hydrolysis products and produces formate as one of the major fermentative products suen et al 2011 these relationships supports the hypothesis that higher metabolic rates are stimulated by substrate supply and that ad is a highly interdependent process these results must be interpreted and extrapolated with caution spurious correlations due to biases in the determination of microbial composition and relative abundance based on pcr based 16s rrna gene normalisation of metabolic rates or merely by chance cannot be discarded further experiments are needed to complement and confirm the relationships presented in this study e g using pcr free genomic methods combined with rna based methods to target the active communities or linked to other post genomic approaches however the present results suggest potential linkages between microbial communities and process functioning narrowing down the diverse ad microbial communities to few potential taxa associated with the main ad metabolic processes 4 2 development of microbial communities towards a core community the four starting inocula were collected from healthy ad full scale plants these ad processes differed in substrate type organic and hydraulic load process configuration and temperature therefore the chosen laboratory conditions represented an operational shock to the native communities the most relevant differences between the native and the laboratory operational conditions substrate type biomass retention time and mixing regime were the main deterministic contributors to prevent a further shock that could lead to the ad process failure i e accumulation of vfa ph drop and cessation of methane production the digesters were started up with a gradual increase of the olr see section 2 2 this strategy provided an acclimatisation period to the microbial communities before the nominal conditions were reached day 35 by identically operating the four digesters the major source of stochasticity was attributed to the initial microbial communities the pca ordination fig 3 and nmds figure s v figure s vi showed the convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core community these results imply that the deterministic factors process operational conditions were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition the development of a core community representing a 72 of the relative abundance of the final microbial communities figure s viii is in agreement with recent findings that concluded that a bioreactor microbial community is mainly regulated by deterministic processes rather than stochastic liu et al 2017 luo et al 2015 valentin vargas et al 2012 vanwonterghem et al 2014 however even after 295 days each digester retained a significant number of unique otus mostly bacteria explaining up to 5 of the relative abundance indicating a contribution of stochastic deviations nonetheless these differences attributable to the original seed inoculum did not contribute to a difference in functionality as shown by digesters performance and the metabolic rates profile high levels of stochasticity have been reported in bioreactor systems operated in replicated but more challenging operational conditions for example zhou et al 2013 used the same inoculum wastewater to seed replicate microbial electrolysis cell bioreactors and venkiteshwaran et al 2017 used different ad inocula to treat synthetic wastewater at 3 g cod lr 1 d 1 and 10 d srt both studies reported the development of distinct microbial communities and bioreactor functionality in the replicates it worth considering that in both studies inocula were subjected to the new conditions in a single step which could have caused a severe disturbance to the microbial communities indeed de jonge et al 2017 reported that subjecting ad replicate digesters to a long starvation period resulted in different responses in community assembly and functionality once digesters operation was re started similarly goux et al 2015 observed that subjecting the digesters to an olr of 4 5 g cod lr 1 d 1 resulted in lasting shifts in microbial community composition but not in digesters performance these contrasting results suggest that more systematic studies should be carried out to understand the undelaying mechanisms that drive the assembly under challenging conditions however the results obtained in this study suggest that the operational conditions drove the long term ad microbial communities and functionality to further support the relevance of deterministic factors the analysis of the procrustes rotations figure s ix tables s i showed that the four starting microbial communities followed similar successional trajectories from day 0 until the end of the experimentation the patterns observed among the development of the four microbial communities strengthen the concept of synchrony which is a characteristic of deterministic assembly mechanisms griffin and wells 2017 synchronised patterns have been reported in natural habitats such aquatic ecosystems kent et al 2007 and animal gut microbiota bergmann et al 2015 and in engineered bioreactors such as activated sludge bioreactors griffin and wells 2017 denitrifying bioreactors porter et al 2015 and replicated ad digesters seeded with the same inoculum vanwonterghem et al 2014 the novelty of this work is that synchronisation and convergence has been observed even when the digesters started with a different microbial community these results highlight that microbial communities exhibit predictable patterns which could ease the efforts for integrating the role of microbial communities in anaerobic digestion mathematical models 5 conclusions the operation of four identical anaerobic digesters each started with a different inoculum has demonstrated that long term process performance is independent of the starting microbial community composition with the limiting step i e hydrolysis dominating process efficiency after inoculation performance of the digesters converged and stabilised in 80 days while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged and stabilised after 145 days of operation the synchronisation of the microbial communities and the development of a core community strengthen the hypothesis that microbial communities and their functionality are mainly driven by deterministic factors as a response to specific operational conditions overall the combination of these results suggest that a microbial population could be achieved and predicted by tuning process conditions finally the positive correlation of metabolic rates with microbial abundance has identified several bacterial taxa with a conceivable involvement in the different anaerobic digestion steps expanding the understanding

19517,the impact of the starting inoculum on long term anaerobic digestion performance process functionality and microbial community composition remains unclear to understand the impact of starting inoculum active microbial communities from four different full scale anaerobic digesters were each used to inoculate four continuous lab scale anaerobic digesters which were operated identically for 295 days digesters were operated at 15 days solid retention time an organic loading rate of 1 g cod lr 1 d 1 75 25 cellulose casein and 37 c results showed that long term process performance metabolic rates hydrolytic acetogenic and methanogenic and microbial community are independent of the inoculum source digesters process performance converged after 80 days while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged after 120 145 days the convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core community proves that the deterministic factors process operational conditions were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition indeed the core community represented 72 of the relative abundance among the four digesters moreover a number of positive correlations were observed between higher metabolic rates and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups these correlations showed that both substrate consumers and suppliers trigger higher metabolic rates expanding the knowledge of the nexus between microorganisms and functionality overall these results support that deterministic factors control microbial communities in bioreactors independently of the inoculum source hence it seems plausible that a desired microbial composition and functionality can be achieved by tuning process operational conditions keywords anaerobic digestion microbial community core community activity assays kinetics correlation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a process used worldwide to treat and stabilise organic waste and currently stands as a key technology in the emerging green economy de vrieze et al 2015b puyol et al 2016 ad is a biochemical microbially mediated multi step process where organic matter is hydrolysed fermented syntrophically oxidised to acetate and hydrogen and converted to biogas methane and carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen batstone et al 2002 extensive process based research and operation of full scale digesters has improved the feasibility and reliability of ad however a better understanding of the associated microbial communities and their dynamics may reveal new avenues to further improve ad efficiency and broaden its application carballa et al 2015 microorganisms in engineered ad systems are mainly provided during the inoculation phase where inoculum e g digested sludge manure from a well functioning anaerobic digester is transferred to a new digester from an engineering perspective inoculum is used to provide active microorganisms reducing the risk of process failure during start up or facilitating the recovery after major process disturbances regueiro et al 2012 given the key role of microorganisms in ad there is a fundamental need to determine the impact of the inoculum microbial community on the long term ad performance the effects of initial microbial community composition on anaerobic digestion performance have primarily been assessed by determining the capabilities of the starting inoculum through short term batch experiments chamy and ramos 2011 de vrieze et al 2015a perrotta et al 2017 however these assays cannot predict if the microbial community will maintain its activity and capabilities in the new environment neither if the microbial community will be able to develop new capabilities long term continuous replicates starting with the same inoculum have shown that a microbial community is governed by deterministic factors i e the microbial community is driven to a greater extent by operational conditions fernández et al 1999 lucas et al 2015 vanwonterghem et al 2014 liu et al 2017 showed that the long term microbial community of three anaerobic digesters started with different inocula was also driven by deterministic factors exhibiting a similar overall performance i e similar methane yields however the specific activity of the various ad functional groups hydrolytic fermentative and methanogenic in these studies was not explored leaving open the question to what extent the function of those microbial communities converged this fact is especially relevant since the role of individual microbial groups many of which can perform a variety of functional roles remains undiscovered challenging the evaluation that microbial composition and dynamics exert over the process performance martiny et al 2015 widder et al 2016 the variations in microbial communities can have an impact on process performance as shown by wittebolle et al 2005 and han et al 2016 who showed that process functionality was related to differences in microbial composition conversely it has also been shown that dynamic microbial communities do not necessarily result in different process capabilities since microorganisms can maintain a functional stability of the major metabolic processes allison and martiny 2008 fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 gobet et al 2012 wittebolle et al 2008 therefore in engineered ecosystems such as ad where microbial communities are imported it is critical to identify how different starting microbial communities will develop and function when subjected to the same operational conditions in addition microbial communities can be functional redundant carballa et al 2015 in which case changes in microbial community composition may not influence the process performance and metabolic rates this study aims to evaluate how different anaerobic microbial communities transition due to certain operational conditions and how this affects long term digestion performance to achieve this aim active microbial communities from four different full scale anaerobic digesters substrate type and reactor configuration were each used to inoculate a continuous anaerobic digester the four digesters were operated identically for 295 days on a feed of cellulose and casein digesters were monitored by i process performance ii metabolic activity assays and iii microbial community composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and substrate inocula were collected from the following sources i ss mesophilic anaerobic digested sewage sludge from a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant queensland australia the ss was

wastewater under mesophilic conditions 35 3 c at a hydraulic retention time of 0 5 days the four digesters were fed synthetic media containing a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose sigma aldrich usa

295 days as semi continuous stirred tank reactors cstr at mesophilic conditions 37 1 c a nominal solid retention time srt of 15 days and an organic loading rate olr of 1 g cod lr 1 d 1 the temperature in each digester was maintained using a thermoregulator to circulate temperature controlled water through an external water jacket the digesters were fed semi continuously at 8 h intervals using a peristaltic pump operated at a flow rate of 89 ml min 1 the digesters were fed and drained simultaneously each digester was stirred using an overhead paddle stirrer set at 35 rpm all digesters were equipped with a tipping bucket gas meter and gas collection system the start up strategy was the same for all digesters and was designed to prevent digesters acidification during the first 5 days the digesters were fed once per day with an effective olr of 0 25 g cod lr 1 d 1 and a 40 d srt after day 5 and for the rest of the experiment the digesters were fed 3 times per day at an olr of 1 g cod

representative samples of each microbial community collected at start up day 0 and at several times during process operation day 90 145 185 and 295 metabolic assays were carried out at mesophilic temperature 37 1 c metabolic activity assays were performed in triplicate in 120 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 80 ml the serum bottles contained inoculum as collected from the continuous digesters and the amount of substrate required to achieve an initial inoculum to substrate ratio of 5 vs basis the headspace of each bottle was flushed with 99 9 n2 for 1 min 4 l min 1 and then sealed with rubber septa and aluminium caps the bottles were placed in a temperature controlled incubator the bottles were mixed by manually swirling before each sampling event five different model substrates were tested cellulose hydrolytic activity sodium butyrate and sodium propionate acetogenic activity sodium acetate and sodium formate methanogenic activity to determine the hydrolytic rate six serum bottles were used three to measure the methane production and three to measure the soluble cod that accounts for the hydrolysed compounds that had not been methanised to determine the acetogenic rate substrate concentration evolution was monitored by extracting a sample of well mixed liquor at each sample event the methanogenic rate was determined by measuring the methane production calculated from the pressure increase and methane composition of the headspace at each sampling event methane production in cod equivalents is reported at standard conditions i e 0 c and 1 bar blank assays containing only inoculum were used to correct the background influence on the target compound 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 physicochemical analyses total solids ts and volatile solids

amplicon reads were hard trimmed to 190 base pair length using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 to retain a sequence length with a high quality score fast qc score 28 and any with less than 190 bases was excluded the forward and the assembled reads were independently examined to confirm the taxonomic composition only the results from the forward reads were used in the subsequent analyses clustering

specific substrate consumption on a cod basis g cod g 1 vsinoculum versus time day for subsets of data over which the rate was approximately constant 2 5 2 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed in rstudio v3 3 1 digesters performance was compared using one way anova 5 significance threshold microbial communities were analysed using vegan oksanen et al 2016 and phyloseq packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 differences in community composition and dynamics were explored by principal component analysis pca where the otu table was rarefied to the depth of the shallowest sample 14500 counts using rarefy even depth rgn seed 712 from phyloseq package the data was hellinger transformed prior ordination analysis of procrustes rotations was performed to compare the individual pca microbial trajectories of each digester correlations between microbial community composition and performance data were calculated using environmental parameter fitting envfit in the package vegan performance data was variance stabilised prior to correlation analyses community dynamics and structure were further explored through α diversity and β diversity α diversity indexes estimated richness simpson index and shannon index were calculated based on repeated random subsampling of the raw otu table β diversity was examined by non metrical multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity similarities between the microbial communities of the four digesters were also explored by computing the core community i e number of shared otus among the four digesters at each time point pearson and spearman correlations between metabolic rates and taxa relative abundance were performed on hellinger transformed abundance and non transformed calculated metabolic rates prior to the correlation tests variance due to primary factors i e time and digester was subtracted in those tests where these primary factors were significant 3 results 3 1 anaerobic digesters performance operation of the digesters was divided in 3 phases fig 1 i start up day 0 34 period where the srt was decreased from 40 to 15 days ii transition day 35 80 period where the inoculum background was washed out and iii steady state day 81 295 period where all digesters run at stable performance operation of all digesters was disturbed due to a malfunction of the central pump controller on day 156 which caused an organic load shock 4 times the nominal olr and exposed the contents of all digesters to air 7 h all digester performance returned to pre disturbance levels by day 165 data from day 157 to day 165 is not included in performance analysis biogas data from days 215 240 was not included in performance analysis due to a leak in the gas collection line table 1 summarises the steady state performance of the 4 digesters excluding the aforementioned periods supplementary figures s i and s ii show the evolution of the measured parameters over time the rapid establishment of methane production and low vfa concentrations indicated that the four inocula adapted to the new operational conditions with the accumulation of propionate in pl 75 mg cod l 1 the only remarkable phenomenon steady state conditions were reached at day 80 although metabolic assays profiles and microbial analysis shows that the community continued to evolve until days 120 145 figs 2 and 3 during steady state conditions digesters performance parameters were not significantly different vfa levels at steady state averaged 19 1 mg cod l 1 p 0 250 with acetate being the major vfa compound followed by traces of propionate valerate and butyrate figure s i ph values were stable for the 4 digesters at 7 3 0 1 p 0 767 methane yield averaged 279 22 lnch4 kg 1 codin p 0 783 which corresponds to a feedstock cod removal of 80 this value is in agreement with the cod removals values 80 1 p 0 178 calculated by measuring the influent and effluent cod table 1 the latter proves that the measured data is both consistent and representative of process performance figure s iii 3 2 metabolic activities metabolic assays along the experimental period were used to evaluate the capacity of the main ad metabolic steps i e hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the consumption rate of cellulose butyrate propionate acetate and formate reflects the ability of the microbial community to utilise the specific substrate the substrate consumption rates are shown in fig 2 the initial metabolic assays day 0 were carried out prior to digester start up and reflect the behaviour of the inocula adapted to their native habitats the initial metabolic profile of each inoculum was different sl and bg showed higher acetogenesis both butyrate and propionate and acetoclastic methanogenesis rates compared to ss and pl the hydrolytic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rates were more similar among inocula additionally each inoculum had a unique balance between metabolic steps figure s iv the metabolic rates of the tested substrates converged among digesters after 145 days of operation with averages of i 0 08 0 01 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for cellulose hydrolysis ii 0 19 0 02 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for butyrate acetogenesis iii 0 18 0 02 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for propionate acetogenesis iv 0 18 0 03 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for acetoclastic methanogenesis and v 0 12 0 02 gcod g 1 vsinoculum d 1 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 3 microbial communities the development of the seeding microbial communities was evaluated by pca ordination based on hellinger transformed rarefied abundances fig 3 and nmds ordinations based on bray curtis dissimilarity figure s v both analyses showed that the trajectories traced by the four inocula migrated to a similar region in the ordination space after 120 145 days of operation about 65 days after process performance convergence with time as the only significant factor p 0 001 additionally the individual trajectories of the bacterial and archaeal domain showed a higher variability for bacteria than archaea over time see figure s vi in supplementary material different groups of taxa increased in abundance with operational time while others were progressively washed out from the digesters as shown in fig 4 and figure s x among the initially dominant groups methanobacterium methanolinea various representatives from phylum chloroflexi anaerolineaceae and anaerolineaceae candidate genus t78 firmicutes bacilli and clostridiales candidate phylum od1 and synergistetes genus e6 clearly decreased in abundance the groups that flourished in the digesters were methanomicrobiales methanoregulaceae and methanospirillum ruminococcaceae spirochaetes treponema and sediment 4 kosmotoga and dethiosulfovibrionaceae candidate genus ha73 otus belonging to methanosaeta and bacteroidales were found in high abundance average relative abundance 16 7 7 3 and 10 0 5 3 respectively at all times in all digesters in addition to microbial community composition the estimated richness also showed that the microbial structure converged for the four digesters to an average of 358 15 16s otus similarly simpson diversity d and shannon wiener h entropy showed the synchronisation of all digesters after 185 days with averages of 0 95 0 01 d and 4 05 0 19 h see figure s vii the four starting inocula shared an average of 31 of the otus representing around 43 of the total relative abundance most of the shared relative abundance was due to archaea 34 bacteria only represented 9 of the initial shared community figure s viii during the microbial steady state day 120 295 52 of all identified otus were shared among all digesters representing 72 of the total microbial community relative abundance figure s viii in contrast to initial conditions most of the shared relative abundance was due to bacteria 54 while archaea accounted for 18 finally the procrustes analyses showed that the microbial community development of the 4 digesters followed a coordinated pattern of change despite the initial microbial composition figure s ix tables s i 3 4 linkage of microbial composition to functionality 16s rrna data was correlated with the output of metabolic activity assays to infer microbial function and some relationships between taxa at 97 similarity using the lowest possible taxonomic assignment and metabolic rates were identified fig 5 shows pearson and spearman correlations where only positive correlations have been considered see figure s xi for complete correlation matrix the presence of flavobacteriaceae representatives of chloroflexi firmicutes candidates phyla od1 and op8 and armatimonadetes were positively correlated with an increment in cellulolytic rates however these groups belonged to taxa with relative abundances of less than 2 5 in all samples butyrate consumption rate was positively associated with syntrophomonas syntrophobacter and bacteroidete ba008 while propionate consumption rate was positively correlated with clostridium veillonellaceae succiniclasticum phycisphaeraceae and syntrophobacter methanomassiliicoccus was the only methanogen correlated with higher acetate consumption rates however unclassified bacteroidales representatives of chloroflexi candidate phyla gn04 geobacter and syntrophobacter were also correlated with higher acetate consumption rates formate consumption rate was not correlated to the relative abundance of methanogens but positively correlated with several bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria representatives of caldiresica and chlorobi and genus fibrobacter and candidatus cloacamonas 4 discussion 4 1 microbial composition linked to process function and metabolic rates 4 1 1 process and microbial community performance ad efficiency is governed by the limiting step the slowest as shown by the metabolic assays results hydrolysis was the limiting step regardless of the inoculum or operational time see fig 2 and figure s iv this is consistent with the literature where hydrolysis is generally accepted as the limiting step during mesophilic treatment of particulate organic matter batstone et al 2002 vavilin et al 2008 the slow and stable hydrolysis rate combined with a relatively long srt 15 days explains the convergence of the methane production of the 4 digesters after 60 days 3 5 srt fig 1a however neither the metabolic rates of downstream processes nor the microbial communities had converged at this time figs 2 and 3 the dominance of the hydrolysis rate on process performance also explains the low vfa concentrations 20 mgcod l 1 detected in all digesters hydrolysis was not only the slowest step but also the metabolic rate that fluctuated the least over time fig 2 the fact that similar hydrolysis rates were obtained by different microbial communities indicates functional redundancy of the hydrolytic population carballa et al 2015 this is further supported using functional assignments based on literature the initial hydrolytic population of sl and ss was dominated by chloroflexi wwe1 and clostridum pl was initially dominated by clostridiales and bacilli and the bg community had a diverse hydrolytic population but with lower relative abundance fig 4 the inferred hydrolytic population of the 4 digesters converged after 145 days and was dominated by ruminococcaceae bacteroidales thermotogales and spirochaetes ad efficiency was clearly controlled by the hydrolytic step however ad is a highly interdependent process and therefore the performance of downstream metabolic processes i e acetogenesis and methanogenesis should also be considered since they contribute to process stability and end products profile acetogenesis was in most cases the fastest step as well as the step with the most variable metabolic rate fig 2 as a general trend the relative abundance of syntrophaceae syntrophobacteraceae syntrophorhabdaceae and dethiosulfovibrionaceae stabilised to similar levels in the 4 digesters after 120 days acetoclastic methanogenesis was faster than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the 4 digesters throughout most of the experiment confirming that acetoclastic methanogenesis is the preferred methanogenic pathway at these operational conditions this is in agreement with the general trend in the literature for mesophilic anaerobic digesters operated at low ammonia and vfa concentrations fotidis et al 2013 regueiro et al 2012 concomitantly methanosaeta an acetoclastic methanogen was the dominant methanogen in all digesters for the full duration of the experiment the other methanogens present in the digesters were identified as hydrogenotrophic methanogens which displayed a higher variability than the acetoclastic population methanobacteriales present in all native inocula but with different abundance vanished in favour of methanomicrobiales although this shift in composition and abundance did not lead to changes in the formate consumption rate this suggests a high level of functional redundancy within hydrogenotrophic methanogens 4 1 2 relationship between metabolic rates and individual microbial groups correlation results related higher hydrolysis rates with flavobacteriaceae chloroflexi candidate class shd 231 firmicutes candidate class sha 98 and other bacterial phyla which are still not fully understood such as candidate phylum op8 or od1 the aforementioned bacteria tend to be very functionally diverse and associated with several capabilities including the use of polysaccharides the conversion of high molecular weight compounds to low molecular weight ones and show glycolysis metabolism buchan et al 2014 farag et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 sun et al 2015 2016 for instance the candidate class sha 37 from the recently defined phylum armatimonadetes showed a strong positive correlation with the hydrolysis rate armatimonadetes are defined as aerobic soil based oligotrophs lee et al 2014 however armatimonadetes have been identified in low abundance in several ad processes li et al 2015 st pierre and wright 2014 tuan et al 2014 these previous observations indicate that within armatimonadetes some strains are not strict aerobes although their role in ad is to date unidentified the present results suggest a conceivable involvement of the candidate class sha 37 in the hydrolysis fermentation step the correlation analysis does not allow discriminating if the forenamed bacteria are directly involved in the cellulose break down or utilising the monomers released from the hydrolysis berlemont et al 2014 however the presence of these bacteria benefited the hydrolysis acetogenic consumption rates showed positive correlations with well known acetogenic bacteria such as syntrophomonas butyrate consumption and syntrophobacter butyrate and propionate consumption veillonellaceae which is able to ferment sugars to propionate via acrylate and succinate pathways louis et al 2014 showed a positive relation with the propionate consumption rate this suggests that propionate consuming organisms are triggered by propionate supply and demonstrates the important interactions between metabolic steps in ad similarly the candidate family ba008 associated with bacteroidetes showed a positive correlation with butyrate consumption rate there is currently little information available on ba008 however the only strain isolated to date tbc1t has an anaerobic fermentative metabolism sun et al 2016 which could have been contributing to butyrate production supporting the higher rates of butyrate consumers methanogenenic rates could not be linked to shifts in archaeal community since one of the variables was relatively constant on the one hand methanosaeta was ubiquitous while acetate consumption rates were variable on the other hand the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was dynamic but similar formate consumption rates were obtained however positive correlations were found with taxa capable to produce acetate as an end product such as syntrophobacter geobacter and some bacteroidales kuever 2014 rotaru et al 2014 which could have contributed to the higher acetoclastic methanogenic rates by supplying acetate to methanosaeta similarly fibrobacter showed a positive correlation with the formate consumption rate the complete genome of fibrobacter succinogenes revealed a specialised cellulose hydrolyser that utilises the soluble hydrolysis products and produces formate as one of the major fermentative products suen et al 2011 these relationships supports the hypothesis that higher metabolic rates are stimulated by substrate supply and that ad is a highly interdependent process these results must be interpreted and extrapolated with caution spurious correlations due to biases in the determination of microbial composition and relative abundance based on pcr based 16s rrna gene normalisation of metabolic rates or merely by chance cannot be discarded further experiments are needed to complement and confirm the relationships presented in this study e g using pcr free genomic methods combined with rna based methods to target the active communities or linked to other post genomic approaches however the present results suggest potential linkages between microbial communities and process functioning narrowing down the diverse ad microbial communities to few potential taxa associated with the main ad metabolic processes 4 2 development of microbial communities towards a core community the four starting inocula were collected from healthy ad full scale plants these ad processes differed in substrate type organic and hydraulic load process configuration and temperature therefore the chosen laboratory conditions represented an operational shock to the native communities the most relevant differences between the native and the laboratory operational conditions substrate type biomass retention time and mixing regime were the main deterministic contributors to prevent a further shock that could lead to the ad process failure i e accumulation of vfa ph drop and cessation of methane production the digesters were started up with a gradual increase of the olr see section 2 2 this strategy provided an acclimatisation period to the microbial communities before the nominal conditions were reached day 35 by identically operating the four digesters the major source of stochasticity was attributed to the initial microbial communities the pca ordination fig 3 and nmds figure s v figure s vi showed the convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core community these results imply that the deterministic factors process operational conditions were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition the development of a core community representing a 72 of the relative abundance of the final microbial communities figure s viii is in agreement with recent findings that concluded that a bioreactor microbial community is mainly regulated by deterministic processes rather than stochastic liu et al 2017 luo et al 2015 valentin vargas et al 2012 vanwonterghem et al 2014 however even after 295 days each digester retained a significant number of unique otus mostly bacteria explaining up to 5 of the relative abundance indicating a contribution of stochastic deviations nonetheless these differences attributable to the original seed inoculum did not contribute to a difference in functionality as shown by digesters performance and the metabolic rates profile high levels of stochasticity have been reported in bioreactor systems operated in replicated but more challenging operational conditions for example zhou et al 2013 used the same inoculum wastewater to seed replicate microbial electrolysis cell bioreactors and venkiteshwaran et al 2017 used different ad inocula to treat synthetic wastewater at 3 g cod lr 1 d 1 and 10 d srt both studies reported the development of distinct microbial communities and bioreactor functionality in the replicates it worth considering that in both studies inocula were subjected to the new conditions in a single step which could have caused a severe disturbance to the microbial communities indeed de jonge et al 2017 reported that subjecting ad replicate digesters to a long starvation period resulted in different responses in community assembly and functionality once digesters operation was re started similarly goux et al 2015 observed that subjecting the digesters to an olr of 4 5 g cod lr 1 d 1 resulted in lasting shifts in microbial community composition but not in digesters performance these contrasting results suggest that more systematic studies should be carried out to understand the undelaying mechanisms that drive the assembly under challenging conditions however the results obtained in this study suggest that the operational conditions drove the long term ad microbial communities and functionality to further support the relevance of deterministic factors the analysis of the procrustes rotations figure s ix tables s i showed that the four starting microbial communities followed similar successional trajectories from day 0 until the end of the experimentation the patterns observed among the development of the four microbial communities strengthen the concept of synchrony which is a characteristic of deterministic assembly mechanisms griffin and wells 2017 synchronised patterns have been reported in natural habitats such aquatic ecosystems kent et al 2007 and animal gut microbiota bergmann et al 2015 and in engineered bioreactors such as activated sludge bioreactors griffin and wells 2017 denitrifying bioreactors porter et al 2015 and replicated ad digesters seeded with the same inoculum vanwonterghem et al 2014 the novelty of this work is that synchronisation and convergence has been observed even when the digesters started with a different microbial community these results highlight that microbial communities exhibit predictable patterns which could ease the efforts for integrating the role of microbial communities in anaerobic digestion mathematical models 5 conclusions the operation of four identical anaerobic digesters each started with a different inoculum has demonstrated that long term process performance is independent of the starting microbial community composition with the limiting step i e hydrolysis dominating process efficiency after inoculation performance of the digesters converged and stabilised in 80 days while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged and stabilised after 145 days of operation the synchronisation of the microbial communities and the development of a core community strengthen the hypothesis that microbial communities and their functionality are mainly driven by deterministic factors as a response to specific operational conditions overall the combination of these results suggest that a microbial population could be achieved and predicted by tuning process conditions finally the positive correlation of metabolic rates with microbial abundance has identified several bacterial taxa with a conceivable involvement in the different anaerobic digestion steps expanding the understanding

19518,this paper uses chemical and physical data from a large 2017 u s geological survey groundwater dataset with wells in the u s and three smaller international groundwater datasets with wells primarily in australia and spain to carry out a comprehensive investigation of brackish groundwater composition in relation to minimum desalination energy costs first we compute the site specific least work required for groundwater desalination least work of separation represents a baseline for specific energy consumption of desalination systems we develop simplified equations based on the u s data for least work as a function of water recovery ratio and a proxy variable for composition either total dissolved solids specific conductance molality or ionic strength we show that the u s correlations for total dissolved solids and molality may be applied to the international datasets we find that total molality can be used to calculate the least work of dilute solutions with very high accuracy then we examine the effects of groundwater solute composition on minimum energy requirements showing that separation requirements increase from calcium to sodium for cations and from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride for anions for any given tds concentration we study the geographic distribution of least work total dissolved solids and major ions concentration across the u s we determine areas with both low least work and high water stress in order to highlight regions holding potential for desalination to decrease the disparity between high water demand and low water supply finally we discuss the implications of the usgs results on water resource planning by comparing least work to the specific energy consumption of brackish water reverse osmosis plants and showing the scaling

in the use of groundwater to meet fresh water demand the majority of earth s groundwater resources are brackish requiring desalination before use to provide an alternative fresh water source in the united states brackish groundwater bgw is a widely available but minimally used resource in 2010 21 of the u s water supply came from fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l while less than 1 came from saline groundwater tds 1000 mg l maupin et al 2014 a recent national study by u s geological survey usgs indicates that the volume of bgw 1000 mg l tds 10 000 mg l is over 800 times the amount of saline groundwater used each year and over 35 times the amount of fresh groundwater used stanton et al 2017 thus increased exploitation of bgw might relieve some of the growing pressure on freshwater supplies around the world particularly in drier landlocked regions fig 1 despite bgw s potential to relieve the mounting pressure on freshwater supplies the resource has been studied far less as a water source than seawater or freshwater a 1965 usgs report feth 1965 served as the primary source of information on the u s distribution of bgw until usgs published an updated assessment in 2017 stanton et al 2017 moreover comprehensive assessments of bgw desalination energy requirements are absent in the literature because groundwater ionic composition varies greatly from location to location unlike seawater stewart 2008 world health organization 2007 a large scale analysis of the resource s energy costs in the u s and several other countries was undertaken in the current study because water stress occurs worldwide this assesment has implications beyond the countries studied water shortages experienced by an individual country are a function of physical water scarcity technology and policy and water distribution and consumption not just within its borders but also in other nations that are its trading partners for example the u s is currently the largest importer and largest exporter of water so changes to the u s water supply such as increased exploitation of an underused resource like bgw may have significant impacts on water use elsewhere hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 this paper summarizes an investigation of bgw characteristics and minimum desalination energy requirements in the continental united states qi and harris 2017 stanton et al 2017 south australia gray and bardwell 2016 spain hidalgo and cruz sanjulian 2001 hidalgo 1993 and numerous other countries united nations environment programme 2017 in the present analysis we define bgw as containing 500 10 000 mg l of tds the lower bound on tds is extended to 500 mg l based on the lower tds recommendation for drinking water and irrigation office of water 2018 first the site specific least work of separation lws is calculated for approximately 28 000 bgw samples across the u s lws represents an absolute minimum for specific energy consumption sec of desalination systems by focusing on lws we use a metric that is independent of desalination technology and which will not change as technologies are improved lws calculations are used to develop simplified equations between lws and tds specific conductance ionic strength and molality as well as to explore the impact of groundwater composition on lws second we show the geographic distribution of tds for 45 000 bgw samples and of major ions and lws for 28 000 bgw samples areas with high water stress and low lws requirements are mapped to highlight regions with high potential for effective desalination and use of bgw third we show that the tds and molality simplified equations as well as the groundwater composition trends can be extended to bgw samples elsewhere in the world by comparing usgs groundwater samples to 5650 bgw samples from three international groundwater datasets with wells in twenty three countries lastly we discuss the implications of our results on water resource planning we compare lws to sec of brackish water reverse osmosis bwro plants and we show the scaling propensity of major electrolytes and silica in usgs groundwater samples 2 groundwater datasets this paper performs a bgw analysis using one u s dataset and three international datasets the u s geological survey usgs major ions groundwater dataset and the continental scale hydrogeochemistry south australia database cshsa global water quality database and information system gemstat and the university of grenada ugr hydrochemical study of the baza caniles aquifer in spain 2 1 usgs major ions dataset usgs recently compiled a database of the major ions in groundwater to provide an updated summary of the occurrence of bgw and a more complete characterization of bgw resources stanton et al 2017 qi and harris 2017 the major ions database contains chemical physical and geographic properties of groundwater compiled from 16 data sources for approximately 124 000 groundwater samples across the continental u s alaska hawaii puerto rico the u s virgin islands guam and american samoa this paper uses bgw data from the continental u s only 2 1 1 coverage the geochemical sources used to compile the major ions dataset range from single publications to large datasets and from state studies to national assessments stanton et al 2017 qi and harris 2017 groundwater properties in the dataset include the concentrations of tds major ions trace elements and radionuclides ph temperature specific conductance saturation indexes and density many of these properties are necessary to evaluate lws some samples in the database have missing density or bicarbonate and or carbonate concentration data in these cases density was calculated using a well established correlation for density temperature and tds millero and poisson 1981 alkalinity was converted to bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations according to methods outlined by stumm and morgan stumm and morgan 1996 using the debye hückel limiting law debye and huückel 1923 the dataset also contains latitude and longitude for each sample enabling geographic distribution analyses of groundwater characteristics approximately 66 500 samples are freshwater tds 500 mg l and 45 200 samples are brackish water of the brackish samples approximately 28 000 have complete composition data not diverging from electroneutrality by more than 5 1 1 the percent deviation from electroneutrality is calculated by summing over all of the molalities of cation species c and anion species a in the distributed solution using the charge z of each species percent error 100 c z c b c a z a b a c z c b c a z a b a groundwater samples are drawn from all 50 states 2 1 2 limitations although the major ions dataset covers large areas across the united states it has some limitations usgs was unable to compile all available groundwater data for the nation particularly from local sources the agency relied on larger datasets available in a digital format from national and state level organizations well selection biases also influence the type of groundwater data that are available well sites are not methodologically selected to characterize entire aquifers rather they tend to be drilled in areas that have freshwater and or a lower depth requirement to tap into the resource this preference for freshwater and shallow wells results in a lack of comprehensive and consistent data consequently the dataset does not represent a complete characterization of bgw resources in the u s the majority of samples have a tds less than 500 mg l and there is an uneven distribution of wells across the 50 states resulting in data gaps for many parts of the nation this non uniform well distribution may result partly from population density and total groundwater withdrawals in a given area where total groundwater withdrawals includes fresh brackish and saline water correlation coefficients of number of wells per state with state population and with total state groundwater withdrawals are 0 53 and 0 60 respectively these values indicate that number of wells in a state is related to these two parameters fig 2 shows the total groundwater withdrawals per state in 2010 versus the number of groundwater samples per state in the major ions dataset texas and california have both the highest number of samples and the highest total groundwater withdrawals while rhode island and vermont have the smallest number of samples and the smallest total groundwater withdrawals 2 2 datasets for twenty three additional countries cshsa gray and bardwell 2016 gemstat united nations environment programme 2017 and the ugr dataset hidalgo and cruz sanjulian 2001 hidalgo 1993 include the concentrations of tds major ions ph and temperature necessary for evaluating lws as well as latitude and longitude for each sample cshsa contains approximately 5200 bgw samples with complete composition data in south australia the ugr dataset contains approximately 260 bgw samples with complete composition data in the baza caniles detrital aquifer system in granada spain gemstat contains 100 bgw samples with complete composition data in afghanistan argentina canada hungary indonesia india iran gambia japan kenya morocco mexico mali norway new zealand pakistan senegal sweden turkey tanzania and uruguay fig 3 shows the location of bgw samples from the three international datasets and the usgs dataset data limitations have prevented broader global coverage of groundwater in this paper groundwater data often includes tds but not the ionic content necessary for evaluating lws so certain other datasets from around the world could not be used 3 evaluation of lws lws is the benchmark energy consumption for any desalination system it represents the minimum amount of work required to separate the supplied water into pure h 2 o and brine streams leaving the desalination process as determined for a thermodynamically ideal reversible process the usgs data in combination with the pitzer mixed electrolyte model pitzer 1973 1987 are used to compute the difference in chemical potential mistry et al 2011 of these streams which determines lws for each groundwater sample in this study lws is calculated per unit mass of pure h 2 o produced m p 1 kg s and written as w l e a s t m p with results presented in the more convenient units kwh m3 3 1 derivation lws on a mass basis is derived from a control volume surrounding a black box separator the desalination system is modeled as a black box separator with an inlet stream the feed f and two outlet streams the brine b and the product p as shown in fig 4 all streams have different salinities s a control volume is chosen far enough away from the separator that the inlet and outlet streams are at ambient pressure and temperature t e the heat entering the system at environmental temperature is q and the rate of work done on the system to cause separation is w s e p mistry et al 2013

mistry et al 2011 2 w l e a s t m p g p m b g b m f g f therefore the difference between lws and actual specific energy consumption results from irreversibilities generated in desalination systems entropy generation for thermal desalination systems primarily results from heat transfer across a finite temperature difference while entropy generation for membrane desalination systems e g reverse osmosis mainly results from water transport through the high pressure drop across the membrane mistry et al 2013 consequently compositional effects do not substantially impact entropy generation in many systems mistry et al 2013 conservation of mass for the water and the salts yields lws per mass flow rate of product in terms of mass recovery ratio 3 w l e a s t m p g p g b 1 r g f g b where the mass recovery ratio is defined as the ratio of the mass flow rate of product stream to the mass flow rate of feed stream 4 r m p m f we can gain more insight into the effect of physical properties on lws by rewriting eq 1 on a molar basis mistry et al 2011 2013 5 w l e a s t n h 2 o p r g t ln a h 2 o p a h 2 o b s b s p m h 2 o ln a s p a s b 1 r ln a h 2 o f a h 2 o b s b s f m h 2 o ln a s f a

p n h 2 o f and total molality b is defined as the sum of ion molalities in mol kg for all ion species i in solution 2 2 lws calculations account for speciation effects derived from unspeciated ion concentrations measured in a laboratory lws molality calculations include the following anions br cl co3 hco3 so4 and hso4 lws molality calculations include the following cations ba ca fe ii k mg mn na sr baoh fe ii oh fe ii hco3 mgoh mnoh and mnhco3 in contrast total measured molality calculations are done with only unspeciated ion concentrations that can be measured in a laboratory total measured molality calculations include the following anions br cl co3 hco3 and so4 total measured molality calculations include the following cations ba ca fe k mg mn na and sr total measured molality calculations are used to determine correlations between lws and measurable parameters 7 b i b i lws is a function of feed and product composition recovery ratio and ambient temperature and pressure mistry et al 2011 2013 fig 5 shows how lws increases with recovery ratio and tds a characteristic seawater solution curve is included for comparison to bgw a 35 000 mg l mixture has a minimum least work of separation mlws of approximately 0 74 kwh m3 over 3 times the amount of a 10 000 mg l brackish solution table 1 includes lws evaluated at 0 50 70 and 90 recovery for various brackish and seawater solutions including those in fig 5 3 2 calculations to determine lws we use the code developed by thiel thiel and lienhard 2014 for the pitzer mixed electrolyte model pitzer 1987 harvie et al 1984 harvie and weare 1980 in this paper lws is given for a pure product stream a h 2 o p 1 b s p 0 in eq 5 at atmospheric pressure and is evaluated at 80 recovery because functioning bgw desalination systems typically operate at 75 90 recoveries greenlee et al 2009 4 trends in lws we explore trends in lws as a function of tds specific conductance total measured molality and ionic strength as well as effects of various solute ratios related to bgw origin and geochemical processes first we develop simplified equations for lws as a function of recovery ratio and tds specific conductance molality and ionic strength all of which have correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 these equations allow lws to be estimated based on various types of proxy data tds specific conductance molality ionic strength with varying levels of precision thus offering simplified alternatives to numerical modeling we then examine how groundwater ion composition influences lws we investigate differences in lws at a fixed tds and sc by comparing separation requirements of major ion constituents 4 1 simplified correlation equations for lws based on usgs dataset correlation coefficients are determined between lws as determined from the thermodynamic model and various other measurements of solution properties see table 2 hardness and alkalinity are weakly correlated to lws while tds specific conductance total measured molality and ionic strength are more strongly correlated to lws therefore linearized equations for lws per unit of product as a function of recovery ratio and chosen parameter p are developed for tds sc total measured molality and ionic strength these equations can be written as 8 w l e a s t m p y f r p where y is a dimensional constant of magnitude 1 see table 3 the function f r is a unitless sixth order polynomial fit for each parameter with lws computed at recoveries ranging from 0 to 90 9 f r n 0 6 a i r i the polynomial accounts for the increase in lws as a function of recovery ratio as a result lws can be evaluated at a recovery of up to 90 table 4 contains the constants necessary for evaluating eq 9 it is important to note that the simplified lws equations are based on bgw data therefore any water containing a tds outside of 500 10 000 mg l may increase the departure of eq 8 from actual lws values table 5 includes the corresponding bgw ranges for specific conductance molality and ionic strength as well as the average relative percent error and standard deviation between lws approximations eq 8 and actual lws eq 3 for the four parameters 4 1 1 total dissolved solids feedwater to desalination systems is typically described in terms of tds therefore establishing a simple equation for the baseline energy requirement of a specified feedwater tds may prove quite useful for those in the desalination industry the correlation coefficient between tds and lws 0 93 indicates that these two parameters have a fairly linear relationship as illustrated in fig 6 however the scatter in this relation is considerable and further knowledge of the water composition can be used to reduce the uncertainty see section 4 2 the best fit line in this figure captures the linearity between tds and lws revealing as expected that lws increases with increasing tds 4 1 2 specific conductance specific conductance sc measures a saline water solution s ability to conduct electricity instrumentation for sc data acquisition is readily available and inexpensive and has an accuracy of over 95 therefore this parameter can easily be measured in the field the correlation coefficient between specific conductance and lws 0 95 reflects the approximately linear relationship between these two parameters lws generally increases with specific conductance as shown in fig 7 some highly anomalous points in fig 7 represent database errors possibly in sc units within the sc range specified in table 5 lws can be determined with reasonable accuracy with one simple field measurement 4 1 3 molality the correlation coefficient between total measured molality eq 7 and lws 0 99 signifies that these two parameters have an almost perfectly linear relationship corresponding to expected behavior based on the physics see section 4 2 pitzer 1973 fig 8 demonstrates that lws grows with increasing molality with less apparent relative uncertainty than the tds or sc relations figs 6 and 7 therefore the average error and standard deviation for the molality based correlation are less than those for the tds based and sc based correlations respectively because the correlation coefficient of molality with lws is almost one and the average error is quite low eq 8 can be used to calculate lws with high accuracy when compared to the pitzer kim thermodynamic model for samples containing 500 10 000 mg l of tds 4 1 4 ionic strength molal ionic strength is defined in terms of the charge z and molality of each ion species robinson and stokes 2002 10 i 1 2 i b i z i 2 the summation includes all solute ion species i in solution that are used in total measured molality calculations the correlation coefficient between ionic strength and lws 0 81 implies that these two variables have a relatively strong linear dependence on one another as shown in fig 9 although fig 9 shares a triangular like shape with fig 6 ionic strength fans outward from the origin far more than tds fig 9 includes a best fit line showing that lws increases with ionic strength 4 2 comparison of different proxies various measurement proxies for lws are compared in decreasing order of correlation coefficient with lws 1 total measured molality and lws have a near perfect linear correlation for bgw solutions due to the separation physics of dilute solutions lws is directly related to the feed solution s osmotic pressure which is a colligative property of mixtures colligative properties depend only on the number of moles of solute per unit solution for ideal dilute solutions which are approximated by the low solute concentrations found in bgw atkins and jones 2010 therefore lws is directly related to molality in dilute solutions the minor discrepancy between the molality based correlation and the pitzer mixed electrolyte model are attributed to deviations from electroneutrality of the original data 5 and effects of nonideality and speciation in these dilute solutions the molality based correlation effectively sets the solvent activity coefficient to one when in reality the activity minimally deviates from one 2 sc is a measure of how easily current flows through a solution current is simply the flow of free moving charge which in bgw solutions are the ions thus the greater the molality the more free to move charges and the greater the conductivity the relationship between concentration e g molality and conductivity is linear at very low concentrations and non linear at high concentrations robinson and stokes 2002 because molality is directly related to lws in bgw sc is also related to lws but the variations in valence of ions influence sc separately from molality 3 tds the sum of solute mass fractions is related to molality but with a weighting by solutes because molality and tds are thereby correlated lws is also strongly correlated with tds however tds s mass dependence results in a weaker correlation between tds and lws than molality or sc 4 ionic strength is a function of molality and ionic charge increasing ion molality results in higher lws while increasing ionic charge results in lower lws therefore ionic strength alone cannot generally be used to estimate lws correlations 1 3 can be used to estimate desalination energy requirements of bgw depending on availability of field measurements sc requires one simple field measurement whereas molality requires multiple measurements to establish ion concentrations when ion concentration data are available thermodynamic modeling or a molality based approximation for lws should be used if ion concentration data are incomplete the tds based correlation provides a quick and simple way to approximate lws for a solution containing a specified tds ionic strength should not be used to estimate lws this parameter requires molality measurements and if those are available using the molality based correlation will provide a much better lws approximation 4 3 effects of major ions on lws 4 3 1 major ions the dominant cations c in the usgs dataset s groundwater samples are calcium and sodium whereas the dominant anions a are bicarbonate sulfate and chloride here we consider the distribution of five major electrolytes in bgw samples calcium bicarbonate calcium sulfate sodium bicarbonate sodium sulfate and sodium chloride we denote an anion or cation major on a mass basis when it accounts for over 50 of the total mass concentration of the anion or cation respectively 11 major ion m i i c o r a m i 0 5 sodium and calcium constitute the major cation in 51 and 25 of bgw samples respectively almost all of the remaining bgw samples contain a combination of sodium and calcium as major cations i e m n a m c a 0 5 i c m i bicarbonate sulfate and chloride are major anions in 48 26 and 9 0 of bgw samples respectively the remaining samples contain a combination of the three as dominant anions i e m c l m s o 4 m h c o 3 0 5 i a m i 4 3 2 compositional effects at fixed tds and sc fig 6 shows that the tds based fit eq 8 does not capture the full dependence of eq 3 on the specific ions in groundwater two distinct trends appear above and below the best fit line this separation shows that bgw samples with equal tds can have different separation requirements the presence of different sets of constituent ions accounts for this phenomenon fig 10 is a plot of lws for six single electrolyte solutions containing a tds of 1000 mg l the five salts shown are the major electrolytes found in bgw samples in the dataset regarding cations water with sodium tends to require more work to achieve separation than water with calcium at fixed tds the general trend among anions is that separation energy decreases in going from chloride to bicarbonate to sulfate consequently heavier electrolytes tend to require a lower lws partly because of lower molality increased ion pairing and higher ionic charge monovalence vs divalence mistry et al 2013 to further investigate compositional effects on the correlations in figs 6 and 7 we replotted the data using colors to indicate the different major cations and anions in the samples fig 11 fig 11 a and c show that samples in which sodium is the major cation tend to have higher separation requirements than those for which calcium is the major cation at any given tds or sc fig 11 b and d illustrate that separation requirements tend to increase from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride at any given tds or sc fig 11 b also shows that the dominant anions in bgw solutions result in two distinct trends in lws as a function of tds bgw samples with chloride as the major anion form the upper trend while bgw samples with sulfate as the dominant anion form the lower trend consequently anions appear to be the predominant factor in lws differences at fixed tds 5 geographic distribution of lws and chemical composition across the u s lws is computed and mapped for 28 000 bgw samples with complete constituent ion data across the u s we also map bgw samples requiring a low lws and located in high water stress regions to highlight areas that hold higher potential for desalination because lws and water stress vary considerably across the u s location must be considered in decision making regarding desalination system selection and design because lws depends on major ion concentration and tds of a solution we also study the geographic distribution of these parameters across the u s tds is mapped for 46 000 bgw samples while major ions concentration is mapped for 28 000 bgw samples that have complete constituent ion data 5 1 lws fig 12 illustrates that lws for bgw samples in the usgs dataset varies considerably across the united states fig 13 shows the water stress level of the bgw samples for which lws is calculated water stress is equal to the ratio of total withdrawals for freshwater uses to total available renewable supply in a given area annually as defined by gassert et al 2013 a higher percentage indicates that more water users are competing for a limited water supply for example in extremely high stress areas more than 80 of water available to domestic agricultural and industrial users is withdrawn annually many samples are located in areas experiencing high or extremely high levels of water stress i e a large disparity between water supply and water demand groundwater samples that fall in the two highest water stress brackets from fig 13 and the two lowest lws brackets from fig 12 are mapped in fig 14 mlws represents a baseline of energy costs required for desalination independent of technology used while high water stress indicates that more water users are competing for a limited water supply therefore fig 14 highlights regions with higher potential for desalination to play a role in reducing the gap between high freshwater demand and low freshwater supply locally though other costs and limitations will be important factors in addition to lws 5 2 chemical composition the distribution of bgw chemical composition both tds and ion constituents is central to evaluating the resource variations in bgw chemical composition can be used to understand the origin of bgw and possibly interpolate or extrapolate its occurrence where data are limited based on hydrogeologic setting overall chemical composition may impact bgw treatment and use options and specific ion constituents may interfere with specific bgw uses mcmahon et al 2016 stanton et al 2017 furthermore bgw samples with similar tds can have different energy requirements if their chemical compositions differ see sec 4 3 2 therefore tds major cations and major anions are mapped across the u s regions in states and or principal aquifers containing clusters of tds or major ions highlight composition characteristics that are typically dominant in a given area as a result we identify clusters which will likely prove useful in 1 determining the most important water parameters to measure when collecting data in the field 2 selecting desalination technology 3 estimating desalination energy costs 4 minimizing membrane scaling in membrane based desalination systems 3 3 waters with calcium magnesium sulfate and carbonate have a higher scaling propensity roy et al 2015 and 5 selecting sites for groundwater wells it is emphasized that the existing data are not uniformly distributed and tend to be biased in favor of freshwater and shallow resources 5 2 1 total dissolved solids fig 15 illustrates the variability in tds of 46 000 bgw samples across the continental u s approximately 91 of the samples contain 500 3000 mg l tds and these samples are present in all parts of the u s for which data are available particularly high densities of groundwater samples occur in the dakotas texas central valley in california and southeastern kansas 5 2 2 major cations fig 16 maps the two major cations calcium and sodium across the continental u s for 28 000 bgw samples north dakota texas and california have the largest number of groundwater samples accounting for the larger number of ion clusters found in these states calcium is the major cation in connecticut illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky minnesota missouri nebraska ohio oklahoma pennsylvania and wisconsin while sodium dominates in the remaining states fig 18 a despite sodium s prevalence calcium maintains a considerable presence in almost all states clusters of calcium and sodium can be found in both landlocked and coastal regions though sodium tends to have a larger presence in coastal areas presumably due to seawater intrusion in some areas 5 2 3 major anions fig 17 maps the three major anions chloride bicarbonate and sulfate across the continental u s north dakota texas and california have the largest number of groundwater samples accounting for the larger number of ion clusters found in these states chloride is the dominant anion in alabama arizona florida massachusetts new hampshire new jersey and oregon fig 18 b chloride can be found in both landlocked and coastal areas though it typically occurs nearer to saline bodies of water sulfate is the dominant anion in colorado connecticut delaware georgia montana south dakota tennessee and wyoming fig 18 b compared to chloride and bicarbonate sulfate has a larger presence inland relative to coastal areas bicarbonate is the dominant anion in the remaining states fig 18 b it has an extensive reach across the nation in almost all coastal and landlocked areas with available bgw data the usgs data show that bicarbonate is likely to be the dominanat anion in relatively low tds samples therefore a bias towards freshwater also denotes a bias towards bicarbonate samples despite bicarbonate s prevalence both chloride and sulfate have considerable presences in california texas michigan north dakota and utah and sulfate has sizable occurrences in arizona florida iowa kansas new mexico ohio and oklahoma unlike dominant cations major anions data display a more uneven distribution across states in part due to the consideration of three rather than two ions in the anions case 6 extension of usgs lws correlations and trends to international datasets this section demonstrates that the usgs lws composition trends at fixed tds and lws simplified equations for tds and molality should apply to groundwater samples from other areas of the world sc and ionic strength correlations are not considered due to lack of data and correlation weakness with lws respectively in order to compare usgs results to international data a least work analysis is conducted on 5650 bgw samples in asia australia europe north america and south america 6 1 effects of major ions on lws at fixed tds fig 19 shows lws as a function of tds and ion composition for the international samples with the usgs samples faded in the background the major ions in the international samples are the same as those in the u s calcium and sodium are the major cations with sodium as the most commonly dominant like in the u s the major anions are chloride 65 followed by bicarbonate 33 and sulfate 2 this anion distribution differs from that in the u s data which contains bicarbonate 48 as the most commonly dominant anion this disparity reflects some limitations in data the majority of international data comes from the south australian cshsa dataset in which sodium chloride is the most commonly dominant electrolyte partly due to seawater intrusion in this region data constraints prevented us from achieving more extensive inland coverage where sulfate as the major anion might be more common for bgw samples with chloride or bicarbonate as the dominant anion the international data follow the same trajectory as the usgs data fig 19 a the cl dominated international samples form the same upper trend above the u s best fit line as the cl dominated u s data fig 11 b and high concentrations of bicarbonate also occur in lower tds samples relatively few of the international samples contain sulfate as the major anion and conform to the lower trend in fig 11 b as for the u s samples separation energy decreases in going from chloride to bicarbonate to sulfate for anions and from sodium to calcium for cations 6 2 simplified correlation equations for lws because of differences in major ion frequency in the usgs and international samples their tds linear regressions do not match precisely fig 20 a however if we apply the usgs tds correlation for lws to the international samples 12 w l e a s t m p a f r t d s international where f r can be found in table 4 the average relative percent error between the lws correlation eq 12 and actual lws eq 8 matches that of the usgs data 20 2 the standard deviation of the error in the international data is 6 38 compared to the usgs value of 15 8 the international data set has a more linear trajectory and thus smaller standard deviation from its average percent error compared to its u s counterpart which contains a wider range of compositions fig 19 b these results suggest that the tds based usgs equation for lws eq 8 derived from diverse water types can be extended approximately to groundwater samples elsewhere however because groundwater composition varies significantly from location to location local and regional correlations may provide better fits in areas with more limited geochemical variation because most of the international samples contain high concentrations of chloride we also consider linear regressions for the usgs and international data samples in which only chloride is the dominant anion fig 20 b illustrates that the two linear regressions almost perfectly match one another reaffirming the fact that the cl dominated international samples overlap with the cl dominated u s samples from these samples we develop a new linearized equation for lws per unit of product as a function of recovery ratio and tds with the same format as eq 8 the accuracy of this new result is shown by the high value of r 2 0 99 table 6 contains the constants necessary for evaluating this equation which can be used generally where chloride is known to be the dominant anion for cases in which tds is known but ionic content is unknown the more general usgs tds correlation established for groundwater of more diverse composition can be used when complete ion composition is known and chloride is not the dominant anion the molality based usgs correlation r 2 0 98 should be used to estimate lws if we apply the usgs correlation for lws as a function of molality to the international samples fig 21 the average relative percent error between the lws correlation and actual lws in the international data 6 32 almost perfectly matches that in the usgs data 6 31 the standard deviation in the international data is 1 74 compared to the usgs value of 5 66 due to wider ranges of compositions in the usgs data these results suggest that the molality based usgs equation for lws eq 8 can be extended to any groundwater sample regardless of ionic content 7 implications of usgs composition and lws results on water resource planning previous sections show that bgw composition tds major ions and lws required for bgw desalination vary considerably across the u s and in other countries consequently location is crucial in desalination decision making as a specific location for a bgw desalination plant may correspond to a particular bgw feedwater identifying clusters of ions on maps in section 5 can aid in the location and thus the source water selection process once the brackish feedwater is selected it will undergo desalination before use in high quality applications the most widely used desalination system for bgw is brackish water reverse osmosis bwro fig 22 illustrates the multiple processes that typically comprise a bwro plant for a given source water composition to a plant the scaling propensity correlating to pretreatment and lws correlating to desalination stage performance can be used to improve the overall plant performance 7 1 lws a benchmark for the performance of various desalination technologies fig 23 shows the energy consumption of ro electrodialysis reversal edr and closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro technologies used for bgw desalination at a fixed feed salinity the technologies produce different specific energy consumption sec depending on recovery ratio but they are all bounded by the lws differences in performance become more pronounced at the higher recoveries that are characteristic of bgw systems therefore lws serves as a robust benchmark for characterizing the performance of the desalination stage of any plant e g the ro stage in fig 22 regardless of what desalination technology is used lws effectively represents the work that must be done to overcome the varying osmotic pressure through a system at a given recovery ratio impacting factors such as driving force operating pressures in ro or voltage in edr and membrane area that determine the energy consumption of a given system while all real systems will use more energy than lws systems that are more energy efficient will operate closer to lws lws benchmarks the specific energy consumption sec of the desalination stage of a plant but fig 24 shows that it does not represent the sec of the entire plant i e of all stages in fig 22 the breakdown of plant sec varies on a case by case basis depending on plant parameters such as design size and fouling propensity of the feedwater fig 25 reflects the differences in the sec breakdowns of two bwro plants in california it also shows that pretreatment ro and post treatment energy requirements are typically lumped together in available datasets isolating the individual sec of these three stages would be very useful in allowing for a direct comparison of lws to ro sec this represents a gap in the publicly available data that might usefully be filled in future reporting on real plants 7 2 scaling propensity of major electrolytes and silica the saturation index is a commonly used metric for quantifying the potential for salt crystallization in aqueous solutions 13 si log q k s p log a a ν a a c ν c a w ν w k s p where q is the activity product and k s p is the solubility product when si 0 for a particular salt the solid phase salt tends to dissolve in solution when si 0 for a particular salt the solid phase salt tends to precipitate out of solution consequently the saturation indices of the salts in a solution can be used to measure the potential of scale formation on membranes in desalination systems when the solution is used as feedwater when si 0 7 for a particular salt the solution can be used as feedwater in desalination systems operating at up to approximately 80 recovery without causing salt crystallization 4 4 si 0 7 limit is approximate at si log a s o l u t e k s p 0 7 the activity of the solute is 5 times less than its activity at its solubility limit if the activity coefficient does not significantly change then the concentration would also be 5 times less than at its solubility limit at a recovery of 80 the concentration factor cf 1 1 r 5 therefore when the activity coefficient does not change as the solute concentration increases si 0 7 at the beginning of the process corresponds to si 0 at the end of the 80 recovery process the same methodology is applied for determining the approximate si limits at 70 recovery si 0 4 and 90 recovery si 1 in reality the activity does increase with concentration though by a minimal amount in dilute solutions such as bgw i e no pretreatment of feedwater for that salt is required when 0 7 si 0 some pretreatment of feedwater may be required before desalination and when si 0 pretreatment of feedwater is required before desalination figs 26 28 illustrate saturation indexes of the usgs samples for which least work of separation is calculated we consider the scaling propensity of calcium carbonate as aragonite or calcite and through the langelier saturation index calcium sulfate as anhydrite or gypsum and silica as chalcedony or quartz at 80 recovery we focus on these because divalent ions ca2 co3 2 so4 2 tend to be less soluble the plots also include si limits for 70 and 90 recovery to cover the range of typical operating recoveries for bgw systems identifying clusters of samples that may require pretreatment 0 7 si 0 or definitely require pretreatment si 0 on the si maps may assist in selecting locations for desalination where membrane scaling is at a minimum in the majority of the usgs groundwater samples calcium sulfate likely would not pose scaling problems while calcium carbonate and silica would be more likely to do so fig 29 pretreatment processes can be used to reduce the concentration of these scalants in feedwater to below their solubility limits before entering the desalination system in a plant the degree of pretreatment required based on the scaling propensity of salts in solution will impact plant capital and operating expenditures as well as total sec typical pretreatment processes include the addition of antiscalants to promote super saturation such as lime soda ash or caustic soda for silica removal and hydrochloric or sulfuric acid for calcium carbonate removal 8 conclusions the usgs major ions dataset and three international datasets for groundwater were used to assess the minimum work required for bgw desalination the impact of various groundwater ions has been studied and simplified curve fits for estimating lws from various measured quantities were considered scaling propensity has also been assessed the following conclusions have been reached 1 bgw composition tds major ions si and lws required for bgw desalination vary considerably across the united states and around the world therefore knowledge of the local water composition is needed in decision making regarding desalination system location and design 2 in the usgs data and the international data the major cations in bgw are calcium and sodium while the major anions are bicarbonate sulfate and chloride in the u s sodium is the most commonly dominant cation while bicarbonate is the most commonly dominant anion in the available non u s data sodium is the most commonly dominant cation while chloride is the most commonly dominant anion cluster identification of these ions can be used to assist in determining the key water parameters in a given area in estimating desalination energy costs and in minimizing membrane scaling in membrane based desalination systems more investment in chemical analyses of bgw would be helpful for this type of assessment 3 at any given value of tds or sc water in which calcium is the dominant cation tends to require less work to achieve separation than water in which sodium dominates the general trend among anions is that lws increases from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride at fixed tds 4 regions that hold the potential for desalination to reduce the disparity between high water demand and low water supply can be found throughout the u s similar desalination potential analysis can be extended to other parts of the world with groundwater samples that require a low lws and lie in water stressed regions 5 simplified equations were tested using samples from the usgs database for estimating lws as a function of tds r 0 93 sc r 0 95 molality r 0 99 and ionic strength r 0 81 the sc based correlation enables estimation of lws with a single commonly reported field measurement sc the molality based correlation based on measured total concentrations of major solutes can be used to determine lws with very high accuracy solute activity based calculations using the pitzer kim model are theoretically more correct however when solute concentrations are low as in bgw lws primarily depends on the number of moles of solute species per unit of solution 6 the usgs simplified equations for lws as a function of tds and molality were applied to the international data showing that they can represent much of the diversity of groundwater samples from around the world when groundwater ionic content is unknown the usgs tds correlation r 2 0 85 can be used to estimate lws when chloride is known to be the dominant anion the cl specific tds equation based on usgs and international chloride dominant solutions r 2 0 99 can be used to determine lws when complete ionic content is known and chloride is not the dominant anion the usgs molality correlation r 2 0 98 can be used to approximate lws 7 lws represents a metric independent of technology to which desalination system energy consumption can be compared in order to evaluate performance lws and total plant sec are not necessarily correlated more data on the energy consumption of individual desalination stages of plants would be useful 8 the majority of the usgs groundwater samples at 80 recovery without pretreatment are likely to experience scaling of calcium carbonate and silica but not of calcium sulfate different forms of pretreatment can be used to reduce these scalant

19518,this paper uses chemical and physical data from a large 2017 u s geological survey groundwater dataset with wells in the u s and three smaller international groundwater datasets with wells primarily in australia and spain to carry out a comprehensive investigation of brackish groundwater composition in relation to minimum desalination energy costs first we compute the site specific least work required for groundwater desalination least work of separation represents a baseline for specific energy consumption of desalination systems we develop simplified equations based on the u s data for least work as a function of water recovery ratio and a proxy variable for composition either total dissolved solids specific conductance molality or ionic strength we show that the u s correlations for total dissolved solids and molality may be applied to the international datasets we find that total molality can be used to calculate the least work of dilute solutions with very high accuracy then we examine the effects of groundwater solute composition on minimum energy requirements showing that separation requirements increase from calcium to sodium for cations and from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride for anions for any given tds concentration we study the geographic distribution of least work total dissolved solids and major ions concentration across the u s we determine areas with both low least work and high water stress in order to highlight regions holding potential for desalination to decrease the disparity between high water demand and low water supply finally we discuss the implications of the usgs results on water resource planning by comparing least work to the specific energy consumption of brackish water reverse osmosis plants and showing the scaling

in the use of groundwater to meet fresh water demand the majority of earth s groundwater resources are brackish requiring desalination before use to provide an alternative fresh water source in the united states brackish groundwater bgw is a widely available but minimally used resource in 2010 21 of the u s water supply came from fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l while less than 1 came from saline groundwater tds 1000 mg l maupin et al 2014 a recent national study by u s geological survey usgs indicates that the volume of bgw 1000 mg l tds 10 000 mg l is over 800 times the amount of saline groundwater used each year and over 35 times the amount of fresh groundwater used stanton et al 2017 thus increased exploitation of bgw might relieve some of the growing pressure on freshwater supplies around the world particularly in drier landlocked regions fig 1 despite bgw s potential to relieve the mounting pressure on freshwater supplies the resource has been studied far less as a water source than seawater or freshwater a 1965 usgs report feth 1965 served as the primary source of information on the u s distribution of bgw until usgs published an updated assessment in 2017 stanton et al 2017 moreover comprehensive assessments of bgw desalination energy requirements are absent in the literature because groundwater ionic composition varies greatly from location to location unlike seawater stewart 2008 world health organization 2007 a large scale analysis of the resource s energy costs in the u s and several other countries was undertaken in the current study because water stress occurs worldwide this assesment has implications beyond the countries studied water shortages experienced by an individual country are a function of physical water scarcity technology and policy and water distribution and consumption not just within its borders but also in other nations that are its trading partners for example the u s is currently the largest importer and largest exporter of water so changes to the u s water supply such as increased exploitation of an underused resource like bgw may have significant impacts on water use elsewhere hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 this paper summarizes an investigation of bgw characteristics and minimum desalination energy requirements in the continental united states qi and harris 2017 stanton et al 2017 south australia gray and bardwell 2016 spain hidalgo and cruz sanjulian 2001 hidalgo 1993 and numerous other countries united nations environment programme 2017 in the present analysis we define bgw as containing 500 10 000 mg l of tds the lower bound on tds is extended to 500 mg l based on the lower tds recommendation for drinking water and irrigation office of water 2018 first the site specific least work of separation lws is calculated for approximately 28 000 bgw samples across the u s lws represents an absolute minimum for specific energy consumption sec of desalination systems by focusing on lws we use a metric that is independent of desalination technology and which will not change as technologies are improved lws calculations are used to develop simplified equations between lws and tds specific conductance ionic strength and molality as well as to explore the impact of groundwater composition on lws second we show the geographic distribution of tds for 45 000 bgw samples and of major ions and lws for 28 000 bgw samples areas with high water stress and low lws requirements are mapped to highlight regions with high potential for effective desalination and use of bgw third we show that the tds and molality simplified equations as well as the groundwater composition trends can be extended to bgw samples elsewhere in the world by comparing usgs groundwater samples to 5650 bgw samples from three international groundwater datasets with wells in twenty three countries lastly we discuss the implications of our results on water resource planning we compare lws to sec of brackish water reverse osmosis bwro plants and we show the scaling propensity of major electrolytes and silica in usgs groundwater samples 2 groundwater datasets this paper performs a bgw analysis using one u s dataset and three international datasets the u s geological survey usgs major ions groundwater dataset and the continental scale hydrogeochemistry south australia database cshsa global water quality database and information system gemstat and the university of grenada ugr hydrochemical study of the baza caniles aquifer in spain 2 1 usgs major ions dataset usgs recently compiled a database of the major ions in groundwater to provide an updated summary of the occurrence of bgw and a more complete characterization of bgw resources stanton et al 2017 qi and harris 2017 the major ions database contains chemical physical and geographic properties of groundwater compiled from 16 data sources for approximately 124 000 groundwater samples across the continental u s alaska hawaii puerto rico the u s virgin islands guam and american samoa this paper uses bgw data from the continental u s only 2 1 1 coverage the geochemical sources used to compile the major ions dataset range from single publications to large datasets and from state studies to national assessments stanton et al 2017 qi and harris 2017 groundwater properties in the dataset include the concentrations of tds major ions trace elements and radionuclides ph temperature specific conductance saturation indexes and density many of these properties are necessary to evaluate lws some samples in the database have missing density or bicarbonate and or carbonate concentration data in these cases density was calculated using a well established correlation for density temperature and tds millero and poisson 1981 alkalinity was converted to bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations according to methods outlined by stumm and morgan stumm and morgan 1996 using the debye hückel limiting law debye and huückel 1923 the dataset also contains latitude and longitude for each sample enabling geographic distribution analyses of groundwater characteristics approximately 66 500 samples are freshwater tds 500 mg l and 45 200 samples are brackish water of the brackish samples approximately 28 000 have complete composition data not diverging from electroneutrality by more than 5 1 1 the percent deviation from electroneutrality is calculated by summing over all of the molalities of cation species c and anion species a in the distributed solution using the charge z of each species percent error 100 c z c b c a z a b a c z c b c a z a b a groundwater samples are drawn from all 50 states 2 1 2 limitations although the major ions dataset covers large areas across the united states it has some limitations usgs was unable to compile all available groundwater data for the nation particularly from local sources the agency relied on larger datasets available in a digital format from national and state level organizations well selection biases also influence the type of groundwater data that are available well sites are not methodologically selected to characterize entire aquifers rather they tend to be drilled in areas that have freshwater and or a lower depth requirement to tap into the resource this preference for freshwater and shallow wells results in a lack of comprehensive and consistent data consequently the dataset does not represent a complete characterization of bgw resources in the u s the majority of samples have a tds less than 500 mg l and there is an uneven distribution of wells across the 50 states resulting in data gaps for many parts of the nation this non uniform well distribution may result partly from population density and total groundwater withdrawals in a given area where total groundwater withdrawals includes fresh brackish and saline water correlation coefficients of number of wells per state with state population and with total state groundwater withdrawals are 0 53 and 0 60 respectively these values indicate that number of wells in a state is related to these two parameters fig 2 shows the total groundwater withdrawals per state in 2010 versus the number of groundwater samples per state in the major ions dataset texas and california have both the highest number of samples and the highest total groundwater withdrawals while rhode island and vermont have the smallest number of samples and the smallest total groundwater withdrawals 2 2 datasets for twenty three additional countries cshsa gray and bardwell 2016 gemstat united nations environment programme 2017 and the ugr dataset hidalgo and cruz sanjulian 2001 hidalgo 1993 include the concentrations of tds major ions ph and temperature necessary for evaluating lws as well as latitude and longitude for each sample cshsa contains approximately 5200 bgw samples with complete composition data in south australia the ugr dataset contains approximately 260 bgw samples with complete composition data in the baza caniles detrital aquifer system in granada spain gemstat contains 100 bgw samples with complete composition data in afghanistan argentina canada hungary indonesia india iran gambia japan kenya morocco mexico mali norway new zealand pakistan senegal sweden turkey tanzania and uruguay fig 3 shows the location of bgw samples from the three international datasets and the usgs dataset data limitations have prevented broader global coverage of groundwater in this paper groundwater data often includes tds but not the ionic content necessary for evaluating lws so certain other datasets from around the world could not be used 3 evaluation of lws lws is the benchmark energy consumption for any desalination system it represents the minimum amount of work required to separate the supplied water into pure h 2 o and brine streams leaving the desalination process as determined for a thermodynamically ideal reversible process the usgs data in combination with the pitzer mixed electrolyte model pitzer 1973 1987 are used to compute the difference in chemical potential mistry et al 2011 of these streams which determines lws for each groundwater sample in this study lws is calculated per unit mass of pure h 2 o produced m p 1 kg s and written as w l e a s t m p with results presented in the more convenient units kwh m3 3 1 derivation lws on a mass basis is derived from a control volume surrounding a black box separator the desalination system is modeled as a black box separator with an inlet stream the feed f and two outlet streams the brine b and the product p as shown in fig 4 all streams have different salinities s a control volume is chosen far enough away from the separator that the inlet and outlet streams are at ambient pressure and temperature t e the heat entering the system at environmental temperature is q and the rate of work done on the system to cause separation is w s e p mistry et al 2013 provide a detailed discussion regarding this choice of control volume combining the first and second laws of thermodynamics on this control volume gives the rate of work for separation 1 w s e p m p g p m b g b m f g f t e s g e n where g j is the specific gibbs free energy per kilogram of solution j m j is the mass flow rate of stream j and s g e n is the total entropy generated by the separation process within the control volume lws represents the minimum amount of work required for separation which occurs when the entropy generation is zero i e for thermodynamically reversible operation mistry et al 2011 2 w l e a s t m p g p m b g b m f g f therefore the difference between lws and actual specific energy consumption results from irreversibilities generated in desalination systems entropy generation for thermal desalination systems primarily results from heat transfer across a finite temperature difference while entropy generation for membrane desalination systems e g reverse osmosis mainly results from water transport through the high pressure drop across the membrane mistry et al 2013 consequently compositional effects do not substantially impact entropy generation in many systems mistry et al 2013 conservation of mass for the water and the salts yields lws per mass flow rate of product in terms of mass recovery ratio 3 w l e a s t m p g p g b 1 r g f g b where the mass recovery ratio is defined as the ratio of the mass flow rate of product stream to the mass flow rate of feed stream 4 r m p m f we can gain more insight into the effect of physical properties on lws by rewriting eq 1 on a molar basis mistry et al 2011 2013 5 w l e a s t n h 2 o p r g t ln a h 2 o p a h 2 o b s b s p m h 2 o ln a s p a s b 1 r ln a h 2 o f a h 2 o b s b s f m h 2 o ln a s f a s b where m is molar mass r g is the universal gas constant t is the ambient temperature subscript s represents all binary salt species formed from ion species i in the mixture a represents the activities of solutes and solvent in each stream the molar recovery ratio r is defined as the ratio of molar flow rate of water in product stream to molar flow rate of water in feed stream 6 r n h 2 o p n h 2 o f and total molality b is defined as the sum of ion molalities in mol kg for all ion species i in solution 2 2 lws calculations account for speciation effects derived from unspeciated ion concentrations measured in a laboratory lws molality calculations include the following anions br cl co3 hco3 so4 and hso4 lws molality calculations include the following cations ba ca fe ii k mg mn na sr baoh fe ii oh fe ii hco3 mgoh mnoh and mnhco3 in contrast total measured molality calculations are done with only unspeciated ion concentrations that can be measured in a laboratory total measured molality calculations include the following anions br cl co3 hco3 and so4 total measured molality calculations include the following cations ba ca fe k mg mn na and sr total measured molality calculations are used to determine correlations between lws and measurable parameters 7 b i b i lws is a function of feed and product composition recovery ratio and ambient temperature and pressure mistry et al 2011 2013 fig 5 shows how lws increases with recovery ratio and tds a characteristic seawater solution curve is included for comparison to bgw a 35 000 mg l mixture has a minimum least work of separation mlws of approximately 0 74 kwh m3 over 3 times the amount of a 10 000 mg l brackish solution table 1 includes lws evaluated at 0 50 70 and 90 recovery for various brackish and seawater solutions including those in fig 5 3 2 calculations to determine lws we use the code developed by thiel thiel and lienhard 2014 for the pitzer mixed electrolyte model pitzer 1987 harvie et al 1984 harvie and weare 1980 in this paper lws is given for a pure product stream a h 2 o p 1 b s p 0 in eq 5 at atmospheric pressure and is evaluated at 80 recovery because functioning bgw desalination systems typically operate at 75 90 recoveries greenlee et al 2009 4 trends in lws we explore trends in lws as a function of tds specific conductance total measured molality and ionic strength as well as effects of various solute ratios related to bgw origin and geochemical processes first we develop simplified equations for lws as a function of recovery ratio and tds specific conductance molality and ionic strength all of which have correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 these equations allow lws to be estimated based on various types of proxy data tds specific conductance molality ionic strength with varying levels of precision thus offering simplified alternatives to numerical modeling we then examine how groundwater ion composition influences lws we investigate differences in lws at a fixed tds and sc by comparing separation requirements of major ion constituents 4 1 simplified correlation equations for lws based on usgs dataset correlation coefficients are determined between lws as determined from the thermodynamic model and various other measurements of solution properties see table 2 hardness and alkalinity are weakly correlated to lws while tds specific conductance total measured molality and ionic strength are more strongly correlated to lws therefore linearized equations for lws per unit of product as a function of recovery ratio and chosen parameter p are developed for tds sc total measured molality and ionic strength these equations can be written as 8 w l e a s t m p y f r p where y is a dimensional constant of magnitude 1 see table 3 the function f r is a unitless sixth order polynomial fit for each parameter with lws computed at recoveries ranging from 0 to 90 9 f r n 0 6 a i r i the polynomial accounts for the increase in lws as a function of recovery ratio as a result lws can be evaluated at a recovery of up to 90 table 4 contains the constants necessary for evaluating eq 9 it is important to note that the simplified lws equations are based on bgw data therefore any water containing a tds outside of 500 10 000 mg l may increase the departure of eq 8 from actual lws values table 5 includes the corresponding bgw ranges for specific conductance molality and ionic strength as well as the average relative percent error and standard deviation between lws approximations eq 8 and actual lws eq 3 for the four parameters 4 1 1 total dissolved solids feedwater to desalination systems is typically described in terms of tds therefore establishing a simple equation for the baseline energy requirement of a specified feedwater tds may prove quite useful for those in the desalination industry the correlation coefficient between tds and lws 0 93 indicates that these two parameters have a fairly linear relationship as illustrated in fig 6 however the scatter in this relation is considerable and further knowledge of the water composition can be used to reduce the uncertainty see section 4 2 the best fit line in this figure captures the linearity between tds and lws revealing as expected that lws increases with increasing tds 4 1 2 specific conductance specific conductance sc measures a saline water solution s ability to conduct electricity instrumentation for sc data acquisition is readily available and inexpensive and has an accuracy of over 95 therefore this parameter can easily be measured in the field the correlation coefficient between specific conductance and lws 0 95 reflects the approximately linear relationship between these two parameters lws generally increases with specific conductance as shown in fig 7 some highly anomalous points in fig 7 represent database errors possibly in sc units within the sc range specified in table 5 lws can be determined with reasonable accuracy with one simple field measurement 4 1 3 molality the correlation coefficient between total measured molality eq 7 and lws 0 99 signifies that these two parameters have an almost perfectly linear relationship corresponding to expected behavior based on the physics see section 4 2 pitzer 1973 fig 8 demonstrates that lws grows with increasing molality with less apparent relative uncertainty than the tds or sc relations figs 6 and 7 therefore the average error and standard deviation for the molality based correlation are less than those for the tds based and sc based correlations respectively because the correlation coefficient of molality with lws is almost one and the average error is quite low eq 8 can be used to calculate lws with high accuracy when compared to the pitzer kim thermodynamic model for samples containing 500 10 000 mg l of tds 4 1 4 ionic strength molal ionic strength is defined in terms of the charge z and molality of each ion species robinson and stokes 2002 10 i 1 2 i b i z i 2 the summation includes all solute ion species i in solution that are used in total measured molality calculations the correlation coefficient between ionic strength and lws 0 81 implies that these two variables have a relatively strong linear dependence on one another as shown in fig 9 although fig 9 shares a triangular like shape with fig 6 ionic strength fans outward from the origin far more than tds fig 9 includes a best fit line showing that lws increases with ionic strength 4 2 comparison of different proxies various measurement proxies for lws are compared in decreasing order of correlation coefficient with lws 1 total measured molality and lws have a near perfect linear correlation for bgw solutions due to the separation physics of dilute solutions lws is directly related to the feed solution s osmotic pressure which is a colligative property of mixtures colligative properties depend only on the number of moles of solute per unit solution for ideal dilute solutions which are approximated by the low solute concentrations found in bgw atkins and jones 2010 therefore lws is directly related to molality in dilute solutions the minor discrepancy between the molality based correlation and the pitzer mixed electrolyte model are attributed to deviations from electroneutrality of the original data 5 and effects of nonideality and speciation in these dilute solutions the molality based correlation effectively sets the solvent activity coefficient to one when in reality the activity minimally deviates from one 2 sc is a measure of how easily current flows through a solution current is simply the flow of free moving charge which in bgw solutions are the ions thus the greater the molality the more free to move charges and the greater the conductivity the relationship between concentration e g molality and conductivity is linear at very low concentrations and non linear at high concentrations robinson and stokes 2002 because molality is directly related to lws in bgw sc is also related to lws but the variations in valence of ions influence sc separately from molality 3 tds the sum of solute mass fractions is related to molality but with a weighting by solutes because molality and tds are thereby correlated lws is also strongly correlated with tds however tds s mass dependence results in a weaker correlation between tds and lws than molality or sc 4 ionic strength is a function of molality and ionic charge increasing ion molality results in higher lws while increasing ionic charge results in lower lws therefore ionic strength alone cannot generally be used to estimate lws correlations 1 3 can be used to estimate desalination energy requirements of bgw depending on availability of field measurements sc requires one simple field measurement whereas molality requires multiple measurements to establish ion concentrations when ion concentration data are available thermodynamic modeling or a molality based approximation for lws should be used if ion concentration data are incomplete the tds based correlation provides a quick and simple way to approximate lws for a solution containing a specified tds ionic strength should not be used to estimate lws this parameter requires molality measurements and if those are available using the molality based correlation will provide a much better lws approximation 4 3 effects of major ions on lws 4 3 1 major ions the dominant cations c in the usgs dataset s groundwater samples are calcium and sodium whereas the dominant anions a are bicarbonate sulfate and chloride here we consider the distribution of five major electrolytes in bgw samples calcium bicarbonate calcium sulfate sodium bicarbonate sodium sulfate and sodium chloride we denote an anion or cation major on a mass basis when it accounts for over 50 of the total mass concentration of the anion or cation respectively 11 major ion m i i c o r a m i 0 5 sodium and calcium constitute the major cation in 51 and 25 of bgw samples respectively almost all of the remaining bgw samples contain a combination of sodium and calcium as major cations i e m n a m c a 0 5 i c m i bicarbonate sulfate and chloride are major anions in 48 26 and 9 0 of bgw samples respectively the remaining samples contain a combination of the three as dominant anions i e m c l m s o 4 m h c o 3 0 5 i a m i 4 3 2 compositional effects at fixed tds and sc fig 6 shows that the tds based fit eq 8 does not capture the full dependence of eq 3 on the specific ions in groundwater two distinct trends appear above and below the best fit line this separation shows that bgw samples with equal tds can have different separation requirements the presence of different sets of constituent ions accounts for this phenomenon fig 10 is a plot of lws for six single electrolyte solutions containing a tds of 1000 mg l the five salts shown are the major electrolytes found in bgw samples in the dataset regarding cations water with sodium tends to require more work to achieve separation than water with calcium at fixed tds the general trend among anions is that separation energy decreases in going from chloride to bicarbonate to sulfate consequently heavier electrolytes tend to require a lower lws partly because of lower molality increased ion pairing and higher ionic charge monovalence vs divalence mistry et al 2013 to further investigate compositional effects on the correlations in figs 6 and 7 we replotted the data using colors to indicate the different major cations and anions in the samples fig 11 fig 11 a and c show that samples in which sodium is the major cation tend to have higher separation requirements than those for which calcium is the major cation at any given tds or sc fig 11 b and d illustrate that separation requirements tend to increase from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride at any given tds or sc fig 11 b also shows that the dominant anions in bgw solutions result in two distinct trends in lws as a function of tds bgw samples with chloride as the major anion form the upper trend while bgw samples with sulfate as the dominant anion form the lower trend consequently anions appear to be the predominant factor in lws differences at fixed tds 5 geographic distribution of lws and chemical composition across the u s lws is computed and mapped for 28 000 bgw samples with complete constituent ion data across the u s we also map bgw samples requiring a low lws and located in high water stress regions to highlight areas that hold higher potential for desalination because lws and water stress vary considerably across the u s location must be considered in decision making regarding desalination system selection and design because lws depends on major ion concentration and tds of a solution we also study the geographic distribution of these parameters across the u s tds is mapped for 46 000 bgw samples while major ions concentration is mapped for 28 000 bgw samples that have complete constituent ion data 5 1 lws fig 12 illustrates that lws for bgw samples in the usgs dataset varies considerably across the united states fig 13 shows the water stress level of the bgw samples for which lws is calculated water stress is equal to the ratio of total withdrawals for freshwater uses to total available renewable supply in a given area annually as defined by gassert et al 2013 a higher percentage indicates that more water users are competing for a limited water supply for example in extremely high stress areas more than 80 of water available to domestic agricultural and industrial users is withdrawn annually many samples are located in areas experiencing high or extremely high levels of water stress i e a large disparity between water supply and water demand groundwater samples that fall in the two highest water stress brackets from fig 13 and the two lowest lws brackets from fig 12 are mapped in fig 14 mlws represents a baseline of energy costs required for desalination independent of technology used while high water stress indicates that more water users are competing for a limited water supply therefore fig 14 highlights regions with higher potential for desalination to play a role in reducing the gap between high freshwater demand and low freshwater supply locally though other costs and limitations will be important factors in addition to lws 5 2 chemical composition the distribution of bgw chemical composition both tds and ion constituents is central to evaluating the resource variations in bgw chemical composition can be used to understand the origin of bgw and possibly interpolate or extrapolate its occurrence where data are limited based on hydrogeologic setting overall chemical composition may impact bgw treatment and use options and specific ion constituents may interfere with specific bgw uses mcmahon et al 2016 stanton et al 2017 furthermore bgw samples with similar tds can have different energy requirements if their chemical compositions differ see sec 4 3 2 therefore tds major cations and major anions are mapped across the u s regions in states and or principal aquifers containing clusters of tds or major ions highlight composition characteristics that are typically dominant in a given area as a result we identify clusters which will likely prove useful in 1 determining the most important water parameters to measure when collecting data in the field 2 selecting desalination technology 3 estimating desalination energy costs 4 minimizing membrane scaling in membrane based desalination systems 3 3 waters with calcium magnesium sulfate and carbonate have a higher scaling propensity roy et al 2015 and 5 selecting sites for groundwater wells it is emphasized that the existing data are not uniformly distributed and tend to be biased in favor of freshwater and shallow resources 5 2 1 total dissolved solids fig 15 illustrates the variability in tds of 46 000 bgw samples across the continental u s approximately 91 of the samples contain 500 3000 mg l tds and these samples are present in all parts of the u s for which data are available particularly high densities of groundwater samples occur in the dakotas texas central valley in california and southeastern kansas 5 2 2 major cations fig 16 maps the two major cations calcium and sodium across the continental u s for 28 000 bgw samples north dakota texas and california have the largest number of groundwater samples accounting for the larger number of ion clusters found in these states calcium is the major cation in connecticut illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky minnesota missouri nebraska ohio oklahoma pennsylvania and wisconsin while sodium dominates in the remaining states fig 18 a despite sodium s prevalence calcium maintains a considerable presence in almost all states clusters of calcium and sodium can be found in both landlocked and coastal regions though sodium tends to have a larger presence in coastal areas presumably due to seawater intrusion in some areas 5 2 3 major anions fig 17 maps the three major anions chloride bicarbonate and sulfate across the continental u s north dakota texas and california have the largest number of groundwater samples accounting for the larger number of ion clusters found in these states chloride is the dominant anion in alabama arizona florida massachusetts new hampshire new jersey and oregon fig 18 b chloride can be found in both landlocked and coastal areas though it typically occurs nearer to saline bodies of water sulfate is the dominant anion in colorado connecticut delaware georgia montana south dakota tennessee and wyoming fig 18 b compared to chloride and bicarbonate sulfate has a larger presence inland relative to coastal areas bicarbonate is the dominant anion in the remaining states fig 18 b it has an extensive reach across the nation in almost all coastal and landlocked areas with available bgw data the usgs data show that bicarbonate is likely to be the dominanat anion in relatively low tds samples therefore a bias towards freshwater also denotes a bias towards bicarbonate samples despite bicarbonate s prevalence both chloride and sulfate have considerable presences in california texas michigan north dakota and utah and sulfate has sizable occurrences in arizona florida iowa kansas new mexico ohio and oklahoma unlike dominant cations major anions data display a more uneven distribution across states in part due to the consideration of three rather than two ions in the anions case 6 extension of usgs lws correlations and trends to international datasets this section demonstrates that the usgs lws composition trends at fixed tds and lws simplified equations for tds and molality should apply to groundwater samples from other areas of the world sc and ionic strength correlations are not considered due to lack of data and correlation weakness with lws respectively in order to compare usgs results to international data a least work analysis is conducted on 5650 bgw samples in asia australia europe north america and south america 6 1 effects of major ions on lws at fixed tds fig 19 shows lws as a function of tds and ion composition for the international samples with the usgs samples faded in the background the major ions in the international samples are the same as those in the u s calcium and sodium are the major cations with sodium as the most commonly dominant like in the u s the major anions are chloride 65 followed by bicarbonate 33 and sulfate 2 this anion distribution differs from that in the u s data which contains bicarbonate 48 as the most commonly dominant anion this disparity reflects some limitations in data the majority of international data comes from the south australian cshsa dataset in which sodium chloride is the most commonly dominant electrolyte partly due to seawater intrusion in this region data constraints prevented us from achieving more extensive inland coverage where sulfate as the major anion might be more common for bgw samples with chloride or bicarbonate as the dominant anion the international data follow the same trajectory as the usgs data fig 19 a the cl dominated international samples form the same upper trend above the u s best fit line as the cl dominated u s data fig 11 b and high concentrations of bicarbonate also occur in lower tds samples relatively few of the international samples contain sulfate as the major anion and conform to the lower trend in fig 11 b as for the u s samples separation energy decreases in going from chloride to bicarbonate to sulfate for anions and from sodium to calcium for cations 6 2 simplified correlation equations for lws because of differences in major ion frequency in the usgs and international samples their tds linear regressions do not match precisely fig 20 a however if we apply the usgs tds correlation for lws to the international samples 12 w l e a s t m p a f r t d s international where f r can be found in table 4 the average relative percent error between the lws correlation eq 12 and actual lws eq 8 matches that of the usgs data 20 2 the standard deviation of the error in the international data is 6 38 compared to the usgs value of 15 8 the international data set has a more linear trajectory and thus smaller standard deviation from its average percent error compared to its u s counterpart which contains a wider range of compositions fig 19 b these results suggest that the tds based usgs equation for lws eq 8 derived from diverse water types can be extended approximately to groundwater samples elsewhere however because groundwater composition varies significantly from location to location local and regional correlations may provide better fits in areas with more limited geochemical variation because most of the international samples contain high concentrations of chloride we also consider linear regressions for the usgs and international data samples in which only chloride is the dominant anion fig 20 b illustrates that the two linear regressions almost perfectly match one another reaffirming the fact that the cl dominated international samples overlap with the cl dominated u s samples from these samples we develop a new linearized equation for lws per unit of product as a function of recovery ratio and tds with the same format as eq 8 the accuracy of this new result is shown by the high value of r 2 0 99 table 6 contains the constants necessary for evaluating this equation which can be used generally where chloride is known to be the dominant anion for cases in which tds is known but ionic content is unknown the more general usgs tds correlation established for groundwater of more diverse composition can be used when complete ion composition is known and chloride is not the dominant anion the molality based usgs correlation r 2 0 98 should be used to estimate lws if we apply the usgs correlation for lws as a function of molality to the international samples fig 21 the average relative percent error between the lws correlation and actual lws in the international data 6 32 almost perfectly matches that in the usgs data 6 31 the standard deviation in the international data is 1 74 compared to the usgs value of 5 66 due to wider ranges of compositions in the usgs data these results suggest that the molality based usgs equation for lws eq 8 can be extended to any groundwater sample regardless of ionic content 7 implications of usgs composition and lws results on water resource planning previous sections show that bgw composition tds major ions and lws required for bgw desalination vary considerably across the u s and in other countries consequently location is crucial in desalination decision making as a specific location for a bgw desalination plant may correspond to a particular bgw feedwater identifying clusters of ions on maps in section 5 can aid in the location and thus the source water selection process once the brackish feedwater is selected it will undergo desalination before use in high quality applications the most widely used desalination system for bgw is brackish water reverse osmosis bwro fig 22 illustrates the multiple processes that typically comprise a bwro plant for a given source water composition to a plant the scaling propensity correlating to pretreatment and lws correlating to desalination stage performance can be used to improve the overall plant performance 7 1 lws a benchmark for the performance of various desalination technologies fig 23 shows the energy consumption of ro electrodialysis reversal edr and closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro technologies used for bgw desalination at a fixed feed salinity the technologies produce different specific energy consumption sec depending on recovery ratio but they are all bounded by the lws differences in performance become more pronounced at the higher recoveries that are characteristic of bgw systems therefore lws serves as a robust benchmark for characterizing the performance of the desalination stage of any plant e g the ro stage in fig 22 regardless of what desalination technology is used lws effectively represents the work that must be done to overcome the varying osmotic pressure through a system at a given recovery ratio impacting factors such as driving force operating pressures in ro or voltage in edr and membrane area that determine the energy consumption of a given system while all real systems will use more energy than lws systems that are more energy efficient will operate closer to lws lws benchmarks the specific energy consumption sec of the desalination stage of a plant but fig 24 shows that it does not represent the sec of the entire plant i e of all stages in fig 22 the breakdown of plant sec varies on a case by case basis depending on plant parameters such as design size and fouling propensity of the feedwater fig 25 reflects the differences in the sec breakdowns of two bwro plants in california it also shows that pretreatment ro and post treatment energy requirements are typically lumped together in available datasets isolating the individual sec of these three stages would be very useful in allowing for a direct comparison of lws to ro sec this represents a gap in the publicly available data that might usefully be filled in future reporting on real plants 7 2 scaling propensity of major electrolytes and silica the saturation index is a commonly used metric for quantifying the potential for salt crystallization in aqueous solutions 13 si log q k s p log a a ν a a c ν c a w ν w k s p where q is the activity product and k s p is the solubility product when si 0 for a particular salt the solid phase salt tends to dissolve in solution when si 0 for a particular salt the solid phase salt tends to precipitate out of solution consequently the saturation indices of the salts in a solution can be used to measure the potential of scale formation on membranes in desalination systems when the solution is used as feedwater when si 0 7 for a particular salt the solution can be used as feedwater in desalination systems operating at up to approximately 80 recovery without causing salt crystallization 4 4 si 0 7 limit is approximate at si log a s o l u t e k s p 0 7 the activity of the solute is 5 times less than its activity at its solubility limit if the activity coefficient does not significantly change then the concentration would also be 5 times less than at its solubility limit at a recovery of 80 the concentration factor cf 1 1 r 5 therefore when the activity coefficient does not change as the solute concentration increases si 0 7 at the beginning of the process corresponds to si 0 at the end of the 80 recovery process the same methodology is applied for determining the approximate si limits at 70 recovery si 0 4 and 90 recovery si 1 in reality the activity does increase with concentration though by a minimal amount in dilute solutions such as bgw i e no pretreatment of feedwater for that salt is required when 0 7 si 0 some pretreatment of feedwater may be required before desalination and when si 0 pretreatment of feedwater is required before desalination figs 26 28 illustrate saturation indexes of the usgs samples for which least work of separation is calculated we consider the scaling propensity of calcium carbonate as aragonite or calcite and through the langelier saturation index calcium sulfate as anhydrite or gypsum and silica as chalcedony or quartz at 80 recovery we focus on these because divalent ions ca2 co3 2 so4 2 tend to be less soluble the plots also include si limits for 70 and 90 recovery to cover the range of typical operating recoveries for bgw systems identifying clusters of samples that may require pretreatment 0 7 si 0 or definitely require pretreatment si 0 on the si maps may assist in selecting locations for desalination where membrane scaling is at a minimum in the majority of the usgs groundwater samples calcium sulfate likely would not pose scaling problems while calcium carbonate and silica would be more likely to do so fig 29 pretreatment processes can be used to reduce the concentration of these scalants in feedwater to below their solubility limits before entering the desalination system in a plant the degree of pretreatment required based on the scaling propensity of salts in solution will impact plant capital and operating expenditures as well as total sec typical pretreatment processes include the addition of antiscalants to promote super saturation such as lime soda ash or caustic soda for silica removal and hydrochloric or sulfuric acid for calcium carbonate removal 8 conclusions the usgs major ions dataset and three international datasets for groundwater were used to assess the minimum work required for bgw desalination the impact of various groundwater ions has been studied and simplified curve fits for estimating lws from various measured quantities were considered scaling propensity has also been assessed the following conclusions have been reached 1 bgw composition tds major ions si and lws required for bgw desalination vary considerably across the united states and around the world therefore knowledge of the local water composition is needed in decision making regarding desalination system location and design 2 in the usgs data and the international data the major cations in bgw are calcium and sodium while the major anions are bicarbonate sulfate and chloride in the u s sodium is the most commonly dominant cation while bicarbonate is the most commonly dominant anion in the available non u s data sodium is the most commonly dominant cation while chloride is the most commonly dominant anion cluster identification of these ions can be used to assist in determining the key water parameters in a given area in estimating desalination energy costs and in minimizing membrane scaling in membrane based desalination systems more investment in chemical analyses of bgw would be helpful for this type of assessment 3 at any given value of tds or sc water in which calcium is the dominant cation tends to require less work to achieve separation than water in which sodium dominates the general trend among anions is that lws increases from sulfate to bicarbonate to chloride at fixed tds 4 regions that hold the potential for desalination to reduce the disparity between high water demand and low water supply can be found throughout the u s similar desalination potential analysis can be extended to other parts of the world with groundwater samples that require a low lws and lie in water stressed regions 5 simplified equations were tested using samples from the usgs database for estimating lws as a function of tds r 0 93 sc r 0 95 molality r 0 99 and ionic strength r 0 81 the sc based correlation enables estimation of lws with a single commonly reported field measurement sc the molality based correlation based on measured total concentrations of major solutes can be used to determine lws with very high accuracy solute activity based calculations using the pitzer kim model are theoretically more correct however when solute concentrations are low as in bgw lws primarily depends on the number of moles of solute species per unit of solution 6 the usgs simplified equations for lws as a function of tds and molality were applied to the international data showing that they can represent much of the diversity of groundwater samples from around the world when groundwater ionic content is unknown the usgs tds correlation r 2 0 85 can be used to estimate lws when chloride is known to be the dominant anion the cl specific tds equation based on usgs and international chloride dominant solutions r 2 0 99 can be used to determine lws when complete ionic content is known and chloride is not the dominant anion the usgs molality correlation r 2 0 98 can be used to approximate lws 7 lws represents a metric independent of technology to which desalination system energy consumption can be compared in order to evaluate performance lws and total plant sec are not necessarily correlated more data on the energy consumption of individual desalination stages of plants would be useful 8 the majority of the usgs groundwater samples at 80 recovery without pretreatment are likely to experience scaling of calcium carbonate and silica but not of calcium sulfate different forms of pretreatment can be used to reduce these scalant

19519,legionellae are among the most important waterborne pathogens in industrialized countries monitoring and surveillance of legionella in engineered water systems is usually performed with culture based methods since the advent of culture independent techniques it has become clear that legionella concentrations are often several orders of magnitude higher than those measured by culture based techniques and that a variable proportion of these non culturable cells are viable in engineered water systems the formation of these viable but non culturable vbnc cells can be caused by different kinds of stress such as and most importantly nutrient starvation oxidative stress and heat in this study the formation of vbnc cells of six legionella strains under conditions of starvation was monitored in mono species microcosms for up to one year using a combination of different viability indicators depending on the strain complete loss of culturability was observed from 11 days to 8 weeks during the starvation process three distinct phases and different sub populations of vbnc cells were identified until complete loss of culturability the number of membrane intact cells decreased rapidly to 5 5 69 of the initial cell concentration the concentration of the sub population with low esterase activity dropped to 0 03 55 and the concentration of the highly esterase active sub population dropped to 0 01 1 2 of the initial concentration these sub populations remained stable for several weeks to months only after approximately 200 days of starvation the number of vbnc cells started to decrease below detection limits the most abundant vbnc sub populations were characterized by partially damaged membranes and low esterase activity with this study we showed that upon starvation a stable vbnc legionella community may be present over several months in a strain dependent manner even under harsh conditions even after one year of starvation a small proportion of l pneumophila cells with high esterase activity was detected we speculate that this highly active vbnc subpopulation is able to infect amoebae and human macrophages graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella viable but nonculturable starvation flow cytometry membrane integrity esterase activity 1 introduction unless appropriately managed engineered water systems are often colonized by different legionella species inhabiting biofilms and predominantly multiplying in free living amoebae fields et al 2002 if released from the biofilms and inhaled via aerosols the bacteria may multiply in human alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells legionellae can cause two types of infection legionnaires disease a severe atypical inflammation of the lungs with a case fatality rate of 8 in europe european centre for disease prevention and control 2016 or a milder form of legionnaires disease called pontiac fever fields et al 2002 a majority of the cases of legionnaires disease in europe are caused by legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 however other serogroups and species have also been reported in 5 of the culture confirmed cases european centre for disease prevention and control 2016 the presence of legionellae in water systems is usually determined via cultivation on standard medium iso 11731 1998 however several studies have shown that this method may severely underestimate the presence of viable legionellae keserue et al 2012 kirschner et al 2012 parthuisot et al 2011 under conditions of stress such as nutrient scarcity high temperature or the presence of oxidizing agents legionellae are able to enter a reversible dormant state which is described as a viable but non culturable vbnc state extensively reviewed by kirschner 2016 after alleviation of the stress the cells may be resuscitated via passage through an amoeba host cell to become culturable again e g al bana et al 2014 epalle et al 2014 steinert et al 1997 in the case of oxidative damage it was shown that scavengers of reactive oxygen species enhance the resuscitation of injured cells ducret et al 2014 different stress conditions such as starvation al bana et al 2014 steinert et al 1997 treatment with reactive oxidizing chlorine species alleron et al 2008 wang et al 2010 or heat treatment epalle et al 2014 may result in differing stress responses and abilities to recover reviewed in kirschner 2016 at the cellular physiological and transcriptional levels the stress response of legionella to nutrient depletion a process called stringent response has been investigated rather intensively e g li et al 2015 in artificial culture media legionella transforms from a non infectious form during the exponential growth phase to a highly infectious transmissive form in the stationary phase molofsky and swanson 2004 amino acid and fatty acid depletion seem to be the main triggers of this transition and of the initiation of the stringent response fonseca and swanson 2014 during starvation the bacterial population gradually loses its culturability until the cells either enter the vbnc state or die remarkably vbnc legionellae may regain their ability to infect human or human cell lines after passage through amoebae see above to date direct infection of or resuscitation in humans or human cell lines has never been reported kirschner 2016 despite these findings it is still highly unclear whether vbnc legionellae are of public health concern mainly due to the lack of quantitative data only al bana et al 2014 have shown that between one and three out of 100 000 starved vbnc l pneumophila cells were able to resuscitate in amoebae indicating that vbnc cells may pose a lower risk than culturable cells the aim of the present study was thus to monitor in detail the development of legionella sub populations over short and long periods of starvation and to quantify and characterize different sub populations of vbnc cells based on their viability status to cover a broad range of strains relevant for human health four serogroup 1 strains from different sources a serogroup 6 strain and an l micdadei strain were used in the experiments different viability indicators were used to assess the viability of the starved sub populations including culturability membrane integrity and esterase activity at the single cell level and amino acid uptake in the whole population special emphasis was placed on identifying distinct sub populations of vbnc cells by applying an optimized gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis this information will significantly improve our understanding of the presence and relevance of vbnc legionellae in engineered water systems in the companion paper dietersdorfer et al 2018 amoebae and human macrophages were used to test the infectivity of the starved legionella populations characterized in the present study 2 material and methods 2 1 legionella strains in total six different legionella strains were used for the experiments of these six strains four belong to l pneumophila serogroup 1 l pneumophila mab subtype olda lpolda strain collection nctc 12008 public health england l pneumophila mab subtype france allentown isolated from an environmental source lpenv and a clinical l pneumophila mab subtype benidorm isolate lpclin both strains provided by a indra ages vienna austria and l pneumophila mab subtype philadelphia lpparis provided by y héchard university of poitiers france the three latter strains belong to the most virulent mab 3 1 subtype according to the dresden panel helbig et al 2002 additionally we used one l pneumophila serogroup 6 strain lpsg6 strain collection nctc 11287 and a clinical l micdadei isolate lmic technical university dresden germany all strains were stored at 80 c in cryo vials roti store carl roth karlsruhe germany for preparation of cryo cultures five colonies grown on a bcye agar plate biomérieux vienna austria were harvested suspended in a cryo vial containing cryo medium and glass pellets included in the roti store kit carl roth after 1 h the supernatant was carefully removed and the remaining legionella cells sticking to the glass pellets were frozen at 80 c 2 2 starvation microcosms for the starvation experiments the legionella strains were prepared according to a standardized protocol to ensure reproducibility of the results l pneumophila strains were grown in liquid buffered yeast extract broth libye modified from edelstein 1981 50 ml tubes filled with 7 5 ml of libye were each inoculated with one pellet from the cryo vials and incubated at an angle of 45 at 37 0 5 c at 150 rpm in a rotary shaker until the cells reached the stationary phase 73 103 h fifty microliters of stationary phase culture was inoculated into 7 5 ml of fresh libye and grown under the same conditions until the cells reached the early stationary phase again 45 5 2 5 h except for lpparis which took 63 h lmic did not grow when inoculated directly in libye from cryo vials so lmic was first grown on a bcye plate biomérieux for 72 h and then three colonies from the plate were inoculated into libye and grown like the other strains for 48 h incubation in ultrapure water autoclaved water for laboratory use grade 1 iso 3696 1987 simplicity ultrapure water merck darmstadt germany was used to study the starvation process of the six legionella strains ultrapure water was chosen because such a matrix was more standardizable compared to tap water an incubation temperature of 45 c was finally chosen for the experiments as the best compromise between temperature stress and experimental duration cells were harvested from liquid cultures by washing twice with ultrapure water at 3500 g at 20 c after optical density od measurement at 600 nm biophotometer eppendorf eppendorf germany a calculated volume was added to 350 ml of autoclaved ultrapure water in 500 ml sterile glass bottles to a cell density of 5 107 1 108 cells ml starvation microcosms ph range 6 4 to 6 5 such high cell concentrations of legionella were used to achieve log reduction rates of 8 to prevent rare culturable cells from being overlooked oliver 2005 after cell inoculation sampling timepoint 0 microcosm bottles were incubated in the dark at 45 0 5 c without shaking 2 3 experimental design and sampling all legionella cultures and starvation microcosms were prepared and analyzed in biological triplicates to monitor the transition from the culturable to the vbnc state all strains were sampled twice a week from the time of inoculation until two weeks lmic and three weeks all other strains after complete loss of culturability short term starvation subsequently to monitor population dynamics in the late vbnc state all strains were sampled three times more during a one year period except lmic which was sampled only twice long term starvation sampling was performed by shaking the bottles 30 times and pouring out 15 ml of the cell suspension for all further analyses including the co culture experiments with amoebae and human macrophages which are published in the companion paper dietersdorfer et al 2018 starvation microcosms were kept at room temperature for as short a duration as possible during sampling viability of the starving legionella cells was determined in a multi parametric way combining different indicators of viability culturability membrane integrity esterase activity dna content and nutrient uptake rates negative controls prepared from subsamples of each strain and at each timepoint were used to clearly delimit the positive from the negative results details see supplementary information non culturable cells were regarded as viable when they displayed an intact membrane presence of dna and an ongoing intracellular enzymatic activity 2 4 cultivation cells were cultured by diluting the sample if necessary in ultrapure water and then spreading 100 μl of the diluted sample or 500 μl of the undiluted sample on a bcye agar plate biomérieux in triplicate followed by incubation at 37 c 0 5 c in humidified conditions the plates were incubated for at least 10 days and checked several times for the presence of legionella colonies complete loss of culturability was confirmed when an absence of colonies was observed on the three bcye plates containing the undiluted sample 8 log10 reduction 2 5 total cell count and viability indicator analyses by flow cytometry fcm legionella cells were analyzed using an attune nxt flow cytometer life technologies darmstadt germany equipped with a 488 nm flat top laser at 50 mw cells were analyzed unstained after sybr green i staining sgi total cell counts dna content after sybr green i propidium iodide staining sgi pi membrane integrity and after 5 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate cfda staining esterase activity following published staining procedures with modifications berney et al 2008 for sgi and sgi pi wang et al 2010 and hoefel et al 2003 for cfda the analysis of non specific intracellular esterase activity to quantify metabolically active cells is a widely used indicator of viability of bacteria and in particular for legionellae berney et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 wang et al 2010 yamamoto et al 1996 a non fluorescing substrate cfda is cleaved by the present intracellular esterases and the cells start fluorescing if cell membranes are intact the fluorescence is retained in the cell and quantification of metabolically active cells is possible in the fluorescence histograms of the cfda analyses we were able to differentiate between three cell sub populations according to differences in their mean fluorescence intensity mfi of the green channel fl1 cells with high low and very low esterase activity fig s1 c1 supplementary information cells with very low esterase activity which matched the peak of the negative control were considered esterase inactive cells indicating death all cells expressing higher fluorescence intensity than the negative control were considered esterase active cells indicating viability and cells contributing to the third peak were considered high esterase active cells unequivocally indicating viability and high metabolic activity cells with a lower esterase activity were considered either as cells in a low metabolic activity state if membranes are fully intact or on the way to die if membranes are compromised to sensitively discriminate esterase inactive from low esterase active cells the gates for the esterase active sub population were determined for each strain and analysis timepoint separately according to the corresponding negative control sample all results from the sgi pi assays were drawn from fl1 h height versus fl3 h dot plots three different cell sub populations of the l pneumophila strains via sgi pi staining could be differentiated as shown in fig s1 b1 4 supplementary information for lmic the cell population of the negative control could not be clearly separated from the viable population of the sample therefore no results for membrane integrity of lmic are shown for the gating of cells with intact membranes indicating viability the same gate as for sgi positive cells was used kötzsch et al 2012 cells with permeabilized membranes indicating death or injury on the way to death were gated according to the sgi pi stained cell population of the negative control see supplementary information the cell events displayed between these two gates were denoted intermediate membrane damaged cells 2 6 incorporation of radiolabelled leucine the 3h leucine incorporation method for the determination of bacterial protein synthesis rates in aqueous samples kirschner and velimirov 1999 simon and azam 1989 was used to measure nutrient uptake after the activation of cells in low nutrient medium legionella is auxotrophic in vitro for the essential amino acid leucine price et al 2014 details on the protocol used can be found in the supplementary information 2 7 statistics as most of the data sets were not normally distributed the data were analyzed by spearman s rank correlation spss vers 24 ibm international p values were calculated after bonferroni correction and accepted as significant at p 0 01 the significant results were visually verified in regression scatter plots the mann whitney u test was used to compare results between different strains 3 results all l pneumophila sg1 strains completely lost their culturability 8 log10 reduction within 14 days of starvation in ultrapure water at 45 c fig 1 table 1 lpenv was already non culturable after 11 days in contrast lpsg6 and lmic completely lost their culturability only after 4 and 8 weeks respectively on the other hand the total number of legionella cells sgi positive cells stayed constant throughout the experiment and no cell loss was observed the mean fluorescence intensity mfi of the sgi positive cells increased 1 16 1 68 during the initial timepoints 4 14 days for all strains followed by a decrease to at least half of the value until the end of the experiment short and long term periods fig 2 a the mfi of sgi positive lmic cells showed the same pattern but at much lower values and the decrease in the mfi stopped when the strain completely lost its culturability 3 1 dynamics of viability indicators during short term and long term starvation in general the analyzed viability indicators i e esterase activity and membrane integrity showed similar trends first for all strains and timepoints a highly significant correlation was found between the number of cells with intact membranes and those with esterase activity rho 0 69 p 0 001 table 2 the decrease in the number of membrane intact and esterase active cells varied between 1 log10 for l pneumophila strains and 3 log10 units for lmic in the short term period table 1 for the l pneumophila strains this decrease mainly happened during the first week of starvation afterwards the membrane intact and esterase active sub populations stabilized at a certain cell concentration fig 1 second as long as the culturability of the cells decreased the highly esterase active cell numbers and leucine uptake rates decreased as well figs 3 and 4 in addition reproducible characteristic patterns in the mfis of the gated sub populations were observed during the starvation process culturable cell numbers high esterase active cell numbers leucine uptake rates and the mfis of the esterase activity measurements were strongly inter correlated rho 0 7 p 0 001 table 2 in the long term starvation period the microcosms were examined at three l pneumophila strains or two timepoints lmic over almost one year of incubation figs 1 and 3 culturability was never observed again the variability of the viability indicators between the replicates was high when cell counts were near the quantification limit for the mab 3 1 positive strains and the lmic strain in at least one biological replicate and for one viability indicator we did not observe any sign of viability around day 300 lmic and lpclin or day 400 lpenv and lpparis moreover in one replicate of lpparis no signs of viability were detected at the last timepoint analyzed 3 1 1 impact of starvation on cell membrane integrity with the selected gating strategy we were able to differentiate between distinct cell sub populations of the l pneumophila strains via sgi pi staining cells with intact membranes indicating viability cells with fully permeabilized membranes indicating cell death or fatal injury and cells in an intermediate state were observed all l pneumophila strains showed a characteristic moon like movement semicircular movement upward of cells through the three different phases depicted in the fcm dot plots supplementary information fig s1 b1 4 in the beginning of the experiments almost all l pneumophila cells exhibited intact membranes 70 in the case of lpclin and 83 95 for the other strains after the first 3 4 days of starvation the number of cells with intact membranes decreased to approximately 40 0 4 log10 reduction of the total cell population corresponding to 60 of cells with intermediate and permeabilized membranes for all strains except for lpolda for which still 93 0 03 log10 reduction of the cells were in the gate indicating intact membranes figs 1 and 3 and supplementary information fig s2 at the timepoint when l pneumophila cells had completely lost their culturability the concentrations of cells with intact membranes had decreased by a maximum of 93 1 16 log10 reduction lpenv and a minimum of 7 0 03 log10 reduction lpolda fig 1 table 1 after the initial decrease the concentration of l pneumophila cells with intact membranes stabilized until the end of the short term period log reduction rates at the end of the short term period compared to timepoint t0 ranged from 0 19 log10 lpolda 36 reduction to 0 94 log10 lpclin 89 5 reduction the mab 3 1 l pneumophila strains lpparis lpenv and lpclin showed markedly higher reduction rates than the other l pneumophila strains lpolda and lpsg6 table 1 supplementary information fig s2 the number of intermediate membrane damaged cells of most of the strains except lpolda increased during the first 3 11 days of starvation until the cell numbers achieved a stable plateau at the end of the short term period the intermediate state cell sub population was between 26 lpsg6 and 95 lpenv of the total cell population in the long term starvation phase the number of membrane intact cells further decreased between 0 67 log10 lpsg6 and 3 21 log10 units lpolda until approximately 300 days of starvation table 1 for lpenv no cells with intact membranes were detected in either replicate after 400 days of starvation between 100 and 200 days of starvation the number of cells in the intermediate membrane state decreased by 0 65 log10 to 2 10 log10 units for the strains belonging to the mab 3 1 positive subgroup lpparis lpenv and lpclin while the number of cells with permeabilized membranes increased fig 3 table 1 in contrast only a slow decrease of cells with intermediate membranes was observed for lpsg6 and lpolda 0 05 log10 to 0 25 log10 units fig 3 table 1 3 1 2 impact of starvation on esterase activity patterns until the strains had completely lost their culturability the concentration of starved esterase active l pneumophila cells dropped between 19 lpolda 0 09 log10 reduction and 81 lpsg6 0 71 log10 reduction the concentration of esterase active lmic cells decreased by 99 9 3 05 log10 reduction during this period fig 1 and table 1 similar to the decrease in the concentration of membrane intact cells the main decrease in the esterase active sub population occurred during the first week of starvation thereafter the esterase active cell numbers stabilized with slight fluctuation until the end of the short term starvation period for all the strains the concentration of the highly esterase active sub population decreased much faster than that of the total esterase active sub population a steep decline was observed until total loss of culturability fig 3 thereafter the cell numbers stabilized until the end of the short term starvation period at this timepoint between 0 02 lpparis 3 7 log10 reduction and 1 36 lpolda 1 9 log10 reduction of the initial highly esterase active cell sub population corresponding to 0 01 and 0 34 of the total cell population respectively was still present concomitant with the decrease in the number of highly esterase active cells there was a strong reduction in the mfi of the cfda stained cells with up to 80 reduction in the l pneumophila strains and 50 in the lmic strain until complete loss of culturability subsequently stabilization of the mfi at a value slightly above the mfi of the negative control population occurred until the end of the experiment total reduction of the mfi was between 70 and 85 see fig 2b a 0 71 log10 lpolda to 2 16 log10 lpparis reduction of esterase active cell numbers of the l pneumophila sg1 strains occurred until day 300 during the long term starvation period fig 1 table 1 after 400 days no esterase active cells were detectable anymore in any of the three lpparis replicates for the mab 3 1 positive subgroup lpparis lpenv and lpclin the low esterase active cell population was constant until 100 200 days of starvation and slowly started to decline thereafter by 1 27 log10 to 2 16 log10 until approximately 300 days of starvation similar to the number of cells in the intermediate membrane state in contrast 46 of the initial esterase active lpsg6 cell numbers 0 33 log10 reduction and 24 of lpolda cell numbers 0 62 log10 reduction were still present after approximately 300 days of starvation fig 1 table 1 at that timepoint we still found quantifiable amounts of cells for all viability indicators in all replicates of lpsg6 and lpolda including highly esterase active cells that amounted to 0 05 and 0 04 of the initial cell population respectively fig 3 table 1 for the lmic strain the esterase active cell numbers fluctuated around the quantification limit during the entire long term starvation period figs 1 and 3 and the number of highly esterase active cells stayed below the quantification limit 3 1 3 uptake of amino acids the 3h leucine uptake rates of lpparis lpolda lpclin and lpsg6 cells dropped below the quantification limit at the timepoint when the strains became completely non culturable or one week later fig 4 a reduction of 2 6 log10 lpparis to 1 3 log10 units lpolda of leucine uptake was already observable after one week of starvation after the complete loss of culturability only small amounts of 3h leucine fluctuating around the quantification limit were incorporated by the legionella population for lmic the 3h leucine uptake rates at the quantification limit were already observable 2 3 weeks before complete loss of culturability 4 discussion since 1987 the vbnc state of legionella has been a matter of intense discussion bej et al 1991 hussong 1987 steinert et al 1997 however there are still numerous unanswered questions concerning the process of vbnc cell formation in response to different kinds of stress the proof of cell viability and the resuscitation potential thus there are unanswered questions concerning the public health relevance of vbnc legionella cells kirschner 2016 furthermore there is little information on the inter species and inter strain variability of legionella associated with the transition to the vbnc state as regards the characteristics of viability and infectivity in this study we monitored starving legionella cells in a highly comprehensive manner in terms of strains viability indicators and stress duration starvation was selected as an environmental stress condition commonly encountered by legionella cells even in biofilms of engineered water systems flemming et al 2016 moritz et al 2010 moreover starvation is a slow process allowing a detailed analysis of the transition to the vbnc state in addition in the companion study we used three different host organisms to test the infectivity and resuscitation of the vbnc legionella cells in different stages of starvation dietersdorfer et al 2018 4 1 phases of starvation during the one year starvation period distinct legionella sub populations e g intermediate membrane damage low esterase activity intact membrane high esterase activity or intact membrane low esterase activity fig 3 and distinct developmental phases of vbnc cell formation and cell death were identified interestingly the observed changes did not occur in a linear fashion over time but a tri phasic development of viable cells over time was observed the first phase was characterized by a rapid decrease in the viability indicators during the first week after inoculation in ultrapure water which was most likely caused by the onset of nutrient depletion and by the sudden change in chemo physical conditions the stationary phase cell population rapidly diversified into culturable cells different vbnc sub populations and dead or fatally injured cells a reduction in the number of cells with intact membranes and esterase activity of up to 1 log10 was observed for most strains consequently the fraction of cells with intermediate and permeabilized cell membranes increased until complete loss of culturability 7 4 8 2 log10 reduction of culturable cells the number of highly esterase active cells and the 3h leucine uptake rates declined even more strongly with log10 reduction rates between 1 95 log10 lpolda and 3 47 log10 lmic and between 1 19 log10 lmic and 3 19 log10 lpparis respectively at the first timepoint of complete non culturability between 18 lpolda and 99 9 lmic of the population were esterase inactive and between 2 lpenv and 46 lpclin of the population had completely lost membrane integrity and could thus be considered dead or fatally injured at the same time cells with high esterase activity constituted between 0 27 lpolda and 0 003 lmic of the total population and cells with intermediate membrane integrity already constituted between 29 lpolda and 87 lpenv of the total population the second phase was characterized by a stabilization of the vbnc sub population which mainly contained cells with low esterase activity and intact or intermediate cell membranes and was stable for more than 100 days depending on the strain starvation at 45 c in distilled water has been previously studied for l pneumophila sg1 by ohno and kato 2003 and al bana et al 2014 who observed that cells lost culturability in 14 and 18 days respectively these times are comparable to those observed for the serogroup 1 strains in our study moreover in the study by al bana et al 2014 90 of the cells had already lost their membrane integrity before the complete loss of culturability 8 log10 reduction like in our study the concentration of culturable cells decreased more rapidly than cells with intact membranes in the experiments by ohno and kato 2003 stabilization of vbnc cell numbers after loss of culturability was not observed but a continuous gradual decrease these slight differences might be due to the use of different l pneumophila sg1 strains and due to differences in the analytical methods fcm versus epifluorescence microscopy a third phase was observed during long term starvation after 200 days the number of vbnc cells of most of the strains declined gradually thus cells died or were fatally injured we interpreted cells as fatally injured or dead when either membrane integrity was completely lost or when esterase activity decreased to a level below the defined threshold supplementary information lennon and jones 2011 observed that bacterial intracellular resources are slowly depleted during dormancy which directly leads to cell death because these starved cells are no longer able to prevent certain phenomena for example the hydrolyzation and consequent degradation of dna or other important macromolecules however during all phases and for all strains no reduction in total sgi stained cell numbers was observed which is in agreement with the results of other authors e g ohno and kato 2003 however the mfi of sgi stained cells changed in the initial days of the experiment the mfi increased followed by a reduction of more than half during one year of starvation fig 2 trevors et al 2012 stated that vbnc cells condense their dna upon starvation explaining the increase of the mfi in the first days of our experiment the subsequent reduction in the fluorescence was most likely due to a reduction in the average number of dna and rna molecules in the stained population upon increasing cell death the results of this study implicate long term survival rates of vbnc legionella cells in engineered water systems triggering non culturability due to oligotrophic conditions mainly the biofilms are the places where legionellae may survive nutrient depletion and disinfection measures as vbnc cells remaining undetected by standard cultivation surveillance schemes moritz et al 2010 based on the results of this study we expect long survival times of vbnc legionella populations in biofilms of engineered water systems because biofilms provide among other benefits better nutrient conditions in comparison to the water phase flemming et al 2016 4 2 membrane integrity patterns for the assessment of membrane integrity as an indicator of viability three different states were identified with fcm analysis while a fully permeabilized membrane indicates cell death or fatal injury and a fully intact membrane indicates viability the intermediate state develops in a semicircular movement upwards between the permeabilized cells and the intact cell membrane gates in the fcm dot plot supplementary information fig s1 barbesti et al 2000 berney et al 2007 falcioni et al 2008 barbesti et al 2000 referred these events as cells with slightly damaged membranes most likely only small amounts of pi enter these intermediate cells due to incipient membrane damage resulting in an incomplete quenching of sgi by pi barbesti et al 2000 in the case of starvation the moderate penetration of pi into the cells may be caused by deficient maintenance of both membranes due to nutrient and energy depletion as the size of the intermediate state sub population in our study increased in the short term period and decreased by the end of the experiment and because at the same time more cells with permeabilized membranes appeared there is clear evidence of the existence of such an intermediate state over the course of starvation for e coli nocker et al 2017 observed the same moon like transition of chlorine challenged cells after sgi pi staining in the two dimensional dot plot e coli lost its culturability in the membrane intact gate but had already shifted up in the moon like way in its trajectory toward the permeabilized cell gate thus we conclude that in our case the intermediate membrane state is a real physiological condition of starved legionella cells 4 3 esterase activity pattern although culturability was lost within the first weeks of starvation a few highly active cells 0 01 5 of the initial concentration remained in nearly all starvation microcosms during the first 200 days for the lpolda and lpsg6 strains in particular cells with high esterase activity were detected in quantifiable amounts 1 5 104 cells ml even after 322 and 284 days of starvation respectively alleron et al 2008 have demonstrated the existence of cells with high esterase activity after 4 months of starvation in resting medium and ducret et al 2014 observed three sub populations exhibiting different degrees of esterase activity in vbnc legionella cells induced by moderate concentrations of hocl during the initial timepoints of our experiments almost all viable cells contributed to the highly esterase active sub population which then decreased along with culturability in the companion study dietersdorfer et al 2018 we observed that the long term starved vbnc cells not only infected amoebae but also monocyte derived primary human macrophages thus we hypothesize that the remaining highly esterase active and membrane intact cells represent this infective sub population the fact that the esterase inactive sub population still exhibited very low esterase activity can be explained by the auto hydrolysis of the non fluorescent cfda to the fluorescent carboxy fluorescein at low levels in the aqueous solution of the samples followed by passive diffusion into dead bacterial cells with compromised membranes hoefel et al 2003 however following our fcm gating strategy and using an appropriate negative control esterase active sub populations were distinguishable from the non active negative controls 4 4 relationship between the different viability indicators the viability indicators analyzed reveal a complex picture of the legionella sub populations which developed upon starvation as these parameters were not measured for the same cells but in different sub samples correlations and interpretation of trends are a suitable method to predict associations among these physiological conditions see table 2 first the parameters of culturability leucine uptake highly esterase active cell numbers and mfi of esterase activity correlated strongly among each other as they all correspond to high metabolic activity of the cell oliver 2005 summarized that during the transition from the culturable state to the vbnc state bacterial cells reduce nutrient transport and respiration activity which fits well with our observations for legionella cells the second group of significantly correlated parameters contained the viability indicators analyzed with fcm such as total esterase active cells and cells with intact membranes table 2 cells with intermediate membrane integrity correlated only with the cells that had low esterase activity over all strains and experiments the sum of the number of cells with intact or intermediate cell membranes was in most cases except two late timepoints higher than the number of esterase active cells consequently a part of the cell sub population with intact and intermediate cell membranes belonged to the esterase inactive cell fraction the lpolda and the lpsg6 strains showed only minor reduction in the number of cells with intact membranes and thus only a small fraction of intermediate membrane cells was formed from these results it can be concluded that upon starvation cells reduce their metabolic activity and a certain part of these cells with low esterase activity have membranes in the intermediate permeabilization state berney et al 2008 reported that bacteria with intact cytoplasmic membranes in tap water are always higher in numbers than those that have esterase activity which fits with our observations for starving legionella cells in agreement with berney et al 2008 it seems that esterase activity is the more conservative indicator with respect to cell viability membrane integrity as the sum of intact and intermediate cells overestimates the amount of viable cells 4 5 inter strain variability there is evidence that differences between the l pneumophila strains were observed upon comparison of the survival patterns of the mab 3 1 positive subgroup of l pneumophila sg1 lpparis lpenv and lpclin and the rest of the strains studied in the short term period the viable cell numbers of all mab 3 1 positive strains decreased strongly compared to the other strains specifically the number of membrane intact cells decreased by 0 85 1 05 log10 compared to a decrease of 0 19 log10 for the lpolda strain and a decrease of 0 25 log10 for the lpsg6 strain mann whitney u test p 0 001 the total number of esterase active cells dropped by 1 43 2 88 log10 during 300 days of starvation compared to a decrease of 0 3 0 6 log10 for lpolda and lpsg6 mann whitney u test p 0 001 helbig et al 2002 found that the mab 3 1 positive subgroup was the most frequent subtype in a survey of clinical isolates 66 8 of all ld cases our data show that the more virulent mab 3 1 positive strains possess weaker survival mechanisms under typical environmental conditions of starvation mentasti et al 2016 highlighted that the mab 3 1 positive l pneumophila sequence type 47 disproportionately often causes infections in humans but is rarely found in environmental samples the lmic strain showed a completely different starvation course in comparison to the l pneumophila strains synchronously with losing culturability the number of all esterase active cells decreased therefore at the timepoint of complete loss of culturability only a few cells with low esterase activity remained close to the quantification limit 5 conclusions legionella cells starved in ultrapure water gradually diversified in a tri phasic manner into distinct sub populations according to the viability indicators analyzed after 100 days the predominant sub population of most legionella strains tested was characterized by weak life signs such as partially damaged membranes and low metabolic activity however at the same time a low percentage of cells with high metabolic activity was present which may be able to infect host cells the use of culture based enumeration techniques for standard detection and surveillance and for the evaluation of disinfection strategies may lead to an underestimation of the potential risk to human health specifically highly active vbnc sub populations which could cause infection may be present the further development standardization and application of specific viability based methods are thus recommended as a complementary tool

19519,legionellae are among the most important waterborne pathogens in industrialized countries monitoring and surveillance of legionella in engineered water systems is usually performed with culture based methods since the advent of culture independent techniques it has become clear that legionella concentrations are often several orders of magnitude higher than those measured by culture based techniques and that a variable proportion of these non culturable cells are viable in engineered water systems the formation of these viable but non culturable vbnc cells can be caused by different kinds of stress such as and most importantly nutrient starvation oxidative stress and heat in this study the formation of vbnc cells of six legionella strains under conditions of starvation was monitored in mono species microcosms for up to one year using a combination of different viability indicators depending on the strain complete loss of culturability was observed from 11 days to 8 weeks during the starvation process three distinct phases and different sub populations of vbnc cells were identified until complete loss of culturability the number of membrane intact cells decreased rapidly to 5 5 69 of the initial cell concentration the concentration of the sub population with low esterase activity dropped to 0 03 55 and the concentration of the highly esterase active sub population dropped to 0 01 1 2 of the initial concentration these sub populations remained stable for several weeks to months only after approximately 200 days of starvation the number of vbnc cells started to decrease below detection limits the most abundant vbnc sub populations were characterized by partially damaged membranes and low esterase activity with this study we showed that upon starvation a stable vbnc legionella community may be present over several months in a strain dependent manner even under harsh conditions even after one year of starvation a small proportion of l pneumophila cells with high esterase activity was detected we speculate that this highly active vbnc subpopulation is able to infect amoebae and human macrophages graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella viable but nonculturable starvation flow cytometry membrane integrity esterase activity 1 introduction unless appropriately managed engineered water systems are often colonized by different legionella species inhabiting biofilms and predominantly multiplying in free living amoebae fields et al 2002 if released from the biofilms and inhaled via aerosols the bacteria may multiply in human alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells legionellae can cause two types of infection legionnaires disease a severe atypical inflammation of the lungs with a case fatality rate of 8 in europe european centre for disease prevention and control 2016 or a milder form of legionnaires disease called pontiac fever fields et al 2002 a majority of the cases of legionnaires disease in europe are caused by legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 however other serogroups and species have also been reported in 5 of the culture confirmed cases european centre for disease prevention and control 2016 the presence of legionellae in water systems is usually determined via cultivation on standard medium iso 11731 1998 however several studies have shown that this method may severely underestimate the presence of viable legionellae keserue et al 2012 kirschner et al 2012 parthuisot et al 2011 under conditions of stress such as nutrient scarcity high temperature or the presence of oxidizing agents legionellae are able to enter a reversible dormant state which is described as a viable but non culturable vbnc state extensively reviewed by kirschner 2016 after alleviation of the stress the cells may be resuscitated via passage through an amoeba host cell to become culturable again e g al bana et al 2014 epalle et al 2014 steinert et al 1997 in the case of oxidative damage it was shown that scavengers of reactive oxygen species enhance the resuscitation of injured cells ducret et al 2014 different stress conditions such as starvation al bana et al 2014 steinert et al 1997 treatment with reactive oxidizing chlorine species alleron et al 2008 wang et al 2010 or heat treatment epalle et al 2014 may result in differing stress responses and abilities to recover reviewed in kirschner 2016 at the cellular physiological and transcriptional levels the stress response of legionella to nutrient depletion a process called stringent response has been investigated rather intensively e g li et al 2015 in artificial culture media legionella transforms from a non infectious form during the exponential growth phase to a highly infectious transmissive form in the stationary phase molofsky and swanson 2004 amino acid and fatty acid depletion seem to be the main triggers of this transition and of the initiation of the stringent response fonseca and swanson 2014 during starvation the bacterial population gradually loses its culturability until the cells either enter the vbnc state or die remarkably vbnc legionellae may regain their ability to infect human or human cell lines after passage through amoebae see above to date direct infection of or resuscitation in humans or human cell lines has never been reported kirschner 2016 despite these findings it is still highly unclear whether vbnc legionellae are of public health concern mainly due to the lack of quantitative data only al bana et al 2014 have shown that between one and three out of 100 000 starved vbnc l pneumophila cells were able to resuscitate in amoebae indicating that vbnc cells may pose a lower risk than culturable cells the aim of the present study was thus to monitor in detail the development of legionella sub populations over short and long periods of starvation and to quantify and characterize different sub populations of vbnc cells based on their viability status to cover a broad range of strains relevant for human health four serogroup 1 strains from different sources a serogroup 6 strain and an l micdadei strain were used in the experiments different viability indicators were used to assess the viability of the starved sub populations including culturability membrane integrity and esterase activity at the single cell level and amino acid uptake in the whole population special emphasis was placed on identifying distinct sub populations of vbnc cells by applying an optimized gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis this information will significantly improve our understanding of the presence and relevance of vbnc legionellae in engineered water systems in the companion paper dietersdorfer et al 2018 amoebae and human macrophages were used to test the infectivity of the starved legionella populations characterized in the present study 2 material and methods 2 1 legionella strains in total six different legionella strains were used for the experiments of these six strains four belong to l pneumophila serogroup 1 l pneumophila mab subtype olda lpolda strain collection nctc 12008 public health england l pneumophila mab subtype france allentown isolated from an environmental source lpenv and a clinical l pneumophila mab subtype benidorm isolate lpclin both strains provided by a indra ages vienna austria and l pneumophila mab subtype philadelphia lpparis provided by y héchard university of poitiers france the three latter strains belong to the most virulent mab 3 1 subtype according to the dresden panel helbig et al 2002 additionally we used one l pneumophila serogroup 6 strain lpsg6 strain collection nctc 11287 and a clinical l micdadei isolate lmic technical university dresden germany all strains were stored at 80 c in cryo vials roti store carl roth karlsruhe germany for preparation of cryo cultures five colonies grown on a bcye agar plate biomérieux vienna austria were harvested suspended in a cryo vial containing cryo medium and glass pellets included in the roti store kit carl roth after 1 h the supernatant was carefully removed and the remaining legionella cells sticking to the glass pellets were frozen at 80 c 2 2 starvation microcosms for the starvation experiments the legionella strains were prepared according to a standardized protocol to ensure reproducibility of the results l pneumophila strains were grown in liquid buffered yeast extract broth libye modified from edelstein 1981 50 ml tubes filled with 7 5 ml of libye were each inoculated with one pellet from the cryo vials and incubated at an angle of 45 at 37 0 5 c at 150 rpm in a rotary shaker until the cells reached the stationary phase 73 103 h fifty microliters of stationary phase culture was inoculated into 7 5 ml of fresh libye and grown under the same conditions until the cells reached the early stationary phase again 45 5 2 5 h except for lpparis which took 63 h lmic did not grow when inoculated directly in libye from cryo vials so lmic was first grown on a bcye plate biomérieux for 72 h and then three colonies from the plate were inoculated into libye and grown like the other strains for 48 h incubation in ultrapure water autoclaved water for laboratory use grade 1 iso 3696 1987 simplicity ultrapure water merck darmstadt germany was used to study the starvation process of the six legionella strains ultrapure water was chosen because such a matrix was more standardizable compared to tap water an incubation temperature of 45 c was finally chosen for the experiments as the best compromise between temperature stress and experimental duration cells were harvested from liquid cultures by washing twice with ultrapure water at 3500 g at 20 c after optical density od measurement at 600 nm biophotometer eppendorf eppendorf germany a calculated volume was added to 350 ml of autoclaved ultrapure water in 500 ml sterile glass bottles to a cell density of 5 107 1 108 cells ml starvation microcosms ph range 6 4 to 6 5 such high cell concentrations of legionella were used to achieve log reduction rates of 8 to prevent rare culturable cells from being overlooked oliver 2005 after cell inoculation sampling timepoint 0 microcosm bottles were incubated in the dark at 45 0 5 c without shaking 2 3 experimental design and sampling all legionella cultures and starvation microcosms were prepared and analyzed in biological triplicates to monitor the transition from the culturable to the vbnc state all strains were sampled twice a week from the time of inoculation until two weeks lmic and three weeks all other strains after complete loss of culturability short term starvation subsequently to monitor population dynamics in the late vbnc state all strains were sampled three times more during a one year period except lmic which was sampled only twice long term starvation sampling was performed by shaking the bottles 30 times and pouring out 15 ml of the cell suspension for all further analyses including the co culture experiments with amoebae and human macrophages which are published in the companion paper dietersdorfer et al 2018 starvation microcosms were kept at room temperature for as short a duration as possible during sampling viability of the starving legionella cells was determined in a multi parametric way combining different indicators of viability culturability membrane integrity esterase activity dna content and nutrient uptake rates negative controls prepared from subsamples of each strain and at each timepoint were used to clearly delimit the positive from the negative results details see supplementary information non culturable cells were regarded as viable when they displayed an intact membrane presence of dna and an ongoing intracellular enzymatic activity 2 4 cultivation cells were cultured by diluting the sample if necessary in ultrapure water and then spreading 100 μl of the diluted sample or 500 μl of the undiluted sample on a bcye agar plate biomérieux in triplicate followed by incubation at 37 c 0 5 c in humidified conditions the plates were incubated for at least 10 days and checked several times for the presence of legionella colonies complete loss of culturability was confirmed when an absence of colonies was observed on the three bcye plates containing the undiluted sample 8 log10 reduction 2 5 total cell count and viability indicator analyses by flow cytometry fcm legionella cells were analyzed using an attune nxt flow cytometer life technologies darmstadt germany equipped with a 488 nm flat top laser at 50 mw cells were analyzed unstained after sybr green i staining sgi total cell counts dna content after sybr green i propidium iodide staining sgi pi membrane integrity and after 5 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate cfda staining esterase activity following published staining procedures with modifications berney et al 2008 for sgi and sgi pi wang et al 2010 and hoefel et al 2003 for cfda the analysis of non specific intracellular esterase activity to quantify metabolically active cells is a widely used indicator of viability of bacteria and in particular for legionellae berney et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 wang et al 2010 yamamoto et al 1996 a non fluorescing substrate cfda is cleaved by the present intracellular esterases and the cells start fluorescing if cell membranes are intact the fluorescence is retained in the cell and quantification of metabolically active cells is possible in the fluorescence histograms of the cfda analyses we were able to differentiate between three cell sub populations according to differences in their mean fluorescence intensity mfi of the green channel fl1 cells with high low and very low esterase activity fig s1 c1 supplementary information cells with very low esterase activity which matched the peak of the negative control were considered esterase inactive cells indicating death all cells expressing higher fluorescence intensity than the negative control were considered esterase active cells indicating viability and cells contributing to the third peak were considered high esterase active cells unequivocally indicating viability and high metabolic activity cells with a lower esterase activity were considered either as cells in a low metabolic activity state if membranes are fully intact or on the way to die if membranes are compromised to sensitively discriminate esterase inactive from low esterase active cells the gates for the esterase active sub population were determined for each strain and analysis timepoint separately according to the corresponding negative control sample all results from the sgi pi assays were drawn from fl1 h height versus fl3 h dot plots three different cell sub populations of the l pneumophila strains via sgi pi staining could be differentiated as shown in fig s1 b1 4 supplementary information for lmic the cell population of the negative control could not be clearly separated from the viable population of the sample therefore no results for membrane integrity of lmic are shown for the gating of cells with intact membranes indicating viability the same gate as for sgi positive cells was used kötzsch et al 2012 cells with permeabilized membranes indicating death or injury on the way to death were gated according to the sgi pi stained cell population of the negative control see supplementary information the cell events displayed between these two gates were denoted intermediate membrane damaged cells 2 6 incorporation of radiolabelled leucine the 3h leucine incorporation method for the determination of bacterial protein synthesis rates in aqueous samples kirschner and velimirov 1999 simon and azam 1989 was used to measure nutrient uptake after the activation of cells in low nutrient medium legionella is auxotrophic in vitro for the essential amino acid leucine price et al 2014 details on the protocol used can be found in the supplementary information 2 7 statistics as most of the data sets were not normally distributed the data were analyzed by spearman s rank correlation spss vers 24 ibm international p values were calculated after bonferroni correction and accepted as significant at p 0 01 the significant results were visually verified in regression scatter plots the mann whitney u test was used to compare results between different strains 3 results all l pneumophila sg1 strains completely lost their culturability 8 log10 reduction within 14 days of starvation in ultrapure water at 45 c fig 1 table 1 lpenv was already non culturable after 11 days in contrast lpsg6 and lmic completely lost their culturability only after 4 and 8 weeks respectively on the other hand the total number of legionella cells sgi positive cells stayed constant throughout the experiment and no cell loss was observed the mean fluorescence intensity mfi of the sgi positive cells increased 1 16 1 68 during the initial timepoints 4 14 days for all strains followed by a decrease to at least half of the value until the end of the experiment short and long term periods fig 2 a the mfi of sgi positive lmic cells showed the same pattern but at much lower values and the decrease in the mfi stopped when the strain completely lost its culturability 3 1 dynamics of viability indicators during short term and long term starvation in general the analyzed viability indicators i e esterase activity and membrane integrity showed similar trends first for all strains and timepoints a highly significant correlation was found between the number of cells with intact membranes and those with esterase activity rho 0 69 p 0 001 table 2 the decrease in the number of membrane intact and esterase active cells varied between 1 log10 for l pneumophila strains and 3 log10 units for lmic in the short term period table 1 for the l pneumophila strains this decrease mainly happened during the first week of starvation afterwards the membrane intact and esterase active sub populations stabilized at a certain cell concentration fig 1 second as long as the culturability of the cells decreased the highly esterase active cell numbers and leucine uptake rates decreased as well figs 3 and 4 in addition reproducible characteristic patterns in the mfis of the gated sub populations were observed during the starvation process culturable cell numbers high esterase active cell numbers leucine uptake rates and the mfis of the esterase activity measurements were strongly inter correlated rho 0 7 p 0 001 table 2 in the long term starvation period the microcosms were examined at three l pneumophila strains or two timepoints lmic over almost one year of incubation figs 1 and 3 culturability was never observed again the variability of the viability indicators between the replicates was high when cell counts were near the quantification limit for the mab 3 1 positive strains and the lmic strain in at least one biological replicate and for one viability indicator we did not observe any sign of viability around day 300 lmic and lpclin or day 400 lpenv and lpparis moreover in one replicate of lpparis no signs of viability were detected at the last timepoint analyzed 3 1 1 impact of starvation on cell membrane integrity with the selected gating strategy we were able to differentiate between distinct cell sub populations of the l pneumophila strains via sgi pi staining cells with intact membranes indicating viability cells with fully permeabilized membranes indicating cell death or fatal injury and cells in an intermediate state were observed all l pneumophila strains showed a characteristic moon like movement semicircular movement upward of cells through the three different phases depicted in the fcm dot plots supplementary information fig s1 b1 4 in the beginning of the experiments almost all l pneumophila cells exhibited intact membranes 70 in the case of lpclin and 83 95 for the other strains after the first 3 4 days of starvation the number of cells with intact membranes decreased to approximately 40 0 4 log10 reduction of the total cell population corresponding to 60 of cells with intermediate and permeabilized membranes for all strains except for lpolda for which still 93 0 03 log10 reduction of the cells were in the gate indicating intact membranes figs 1 and 3 and supplementary information fig s2 at the timepoint when l pneumophila cells had completely lost their culturability the concentrations of cells with intact membranes had decreased by a maximum of 93 1 16 log10 reduction lpenv and a minimum of 7 0 03 log10 reduction lpolda fig 1 table 1 after the initial decrease the concentration of l pneumophila cells with intact membranes stabilized until the end of the short term period log reduction rates at the end of the short term period compared to timepoint t0 ranged from 0 19 log10 lpolda 36 reduction to 0 94 log10 lpclin 89 5 reduction the mab 3 1 l pneumophila strains lpparis lpenv and lpclin showed markedly higher reduction rates than the other l pneumophila strains lpolda and lpsg6 table 1 supplementary information fig s2 the number of intermediate membrane damaged cells of most of the strains except lpolda increased during the first 3 11 days of starvation until the cell numbers achieved a stable plateau at the end of the short term period the intermediate state cell sub population was between 26 lpsg6 and 95 lpenv of the total cell population in the long term starvation phase the number of membrane intact cells further decreased between 0 67 log10 lpsg6 and 3 21 log10 units lpolda until approximately 300 days of starvation table 1 for lpenv no cells with intact membranes were detected in either replicate after 400 days of starvation between 100 and 200 days of starvation the number of cells in the intermediate membrane state decreased by 0 65 log10 to 2 10 log10 units for the strains belonging to the mab 3 1 positive subgroup lpparis lpenv and lpclin while the number of cells with permeabilized membranes increased fig 3 table 1 in contrast only a slow decrease of cells with intermediate membranes was observed for lpsg6 and lpolda 0 05 log10 to 0 25 log10 units fig 3 table 1 3 1 2 impact of starvation on esterase activity patterns until the strains had completely lost their culturability the concentration of starved esterase active l pneumophila cells dropped between 19 lpolda 0 09 log10 reduction and 81 lpsg6 0 71 log10 reduction the concentration of esterase active lmic cells decreased by 99 9 3 05 log10 reduction during this period fig 1 and table 1 similar to the decrease in the concentration of membrane intact cells the main decrease in the esterase active sub population occurred during the first week of starvation thereafter the esterase active cell numbers stabilized with slight fluctuation until the end of the short term starvation period for all the strains the concentration of the highly esterase active sub population decreased much faster than that of the total esterase active sub population a steep decline was observed until total loss of culturability fig 3 thereafter the cell numbers stabilized until the end of the short term starvation period at this timepoint between 0 02 lpparis 3 7 log10 reduction and 1 36 lpolda 1 9 log10 reduction of the initial highly esterase active cell sub population corresponding to 0 01 and 0 34 of the total cell population respectively was still present concomitant with the decrease in the number of highly esterase active cells there was a strong reduction in the mfi of the cfda stained cells with up to 80 reduction in the l pneumophila strains and 50 in the lmic strain until complete loss of culturability subsequently stabilization of the mfi at a value slightly above the mfi of the negative control population occurred until the end of the experiment total reduction of the mfi was between 70 and 85 see fig 2b a 0 71 log10 lpolda to 2 16 log10 lpparis reduction of esterase active cell numbers of the l pneumophila sg1 strains occurred until day 300 during the long term starvation period fig 1 table 1 after 400 days no esterase active cells were detectable anymore in any of the three lpparis replicates for the mab 3 1 positive subgroup lpparis lpenv and lpclin the low esterase active cell population was constant until 100 200 days of starvation and slowly started to decline thereafter by 1 27 log10 to 2 16 log10 until approximately 300 days of starvation similar to the number of cells in the intermediate membrane state in contrast 46 of the initial esterase active lpsg6 cell numbers 0 33 log10 reduction and 24 of lpolda cell numbers 0 62 log10 reduction were still present after approximately 300 days of starvation fig 1 table 1 at that timepoint we still found quantifiable amounts of cells for all viability indicators in all replicates of lpsg6 and lpolda including highly esterase active cells that amounted to 0 05 and 0 04 of the initial cell population respectively fig 3 table 1 for the lmic strain the esterase active cell numbers fluctuated around the quantification limit during the entire long term starvation period figs 1 and 3 and the number of highly esterase active cells stayed below the quantification limit 3 1 3 uptake of amino acids the 3h leucine uptake rates of lpparis lpolda lpclin and lpsg6 cells dropped below the quantification limit at the timepoint when the strains became completely non culturable or one week later fig 4 a reduction of 2 6 log10 lpparis to 1 3 log10 units lpolda of leucine uptake was already observable after one week of starvation after the complete loss of culturability only small amounts of 3h leucine fluctuating around the quantification limit were incorporated by the legionella population for lmic the 3h leucine uptake rates at the quantification limit were already observable 2 3 weeks before complete loss of culturability 4 discussion since 1987 the vbnc state of legionella has been a matter of intense discussion bej et al 1991 hussong 1987 steinert et al 1997 however there are still numerous unanswered questions concerning the process of vbnc cell formation in response to different kinds of stress the proof of cell viability and the resuscitation potential thus there are unanswered questions concerning the public health relevance of vbnc legionella cells kirschner 2016 furthermore there is little information on the inter species and inter strain variability of legionella associated with the transition to the vbnc state as regards the characteristics of viability and infectivity in this study we monitored starving legionella cells in a highly comprehensive manner in terms of strains viability indicators and stress duration starvation was selected as an environmental stress condition commonly encountered by legionella cells even in biofilms of engineered water systems flemming et al 2016 moritz et al 2010 moreover starvation is a slow process allowing a detailed analysis of the transition to the vbnc state in addition in the companion study we used three different host organisms to test the infectivity and resuscitation of the vbnc legionella cells in different stages of starvation dietersdorfer et al 2018 4 1 phases of starvation during the one year starvation period distinct legionella sub populations e g intermediate membrane damage low esterase activity intact membrane high esterase activity or intact membrane low esterase activity fig 3 and distinct developmental phases of vbnc cell formation and cell death were identified interestingly the observed changes did not occur in a linear fashion over time but a tri phasic development of viable cells over time was observed the first phase was characterized by a rapid decrease in the viability indicators during the first week after inoculation in ultrapure water which was most likely caused by the onset of nutrient depletion and by the sudden change in chemo physical conditions the stationary phase cell population rapidly diversified into culturable cells different vbnc sub populations and dead or fatally injured cells a reduction in the number of cells with intact membranes and esterase activity of up to 1 log10 was observed for most strains consequently the fraction of cells with intermediate and permeabilized cell membranes increased until complete loss of culturability 7 4 8 2 log10 reduction of culturable cells the number of highly esterase active cells and the 3h leucine uptake rates declined even more strongly with log10 reduction rates between 1 95 log10 lpolda and 3 47 log10 lmic and between 1 19 log10 lmic and 3 19 log10 lpparis respectively at the first timepoint of complete non culturability between 18 lpolda and 99 9 lmic of the population were esterase inactive and between 2 lpenv and 46 lpclin of the population had completely lost membrane integrity and could thus be considered dead or fatally injured at the same time cells with high esterase activity constituted between 0 27 lpolda and 0 003 lmic of the total population and cells with intermediate membrane integrity already constituted between 29 lpolda and 87 lpenv of the total population the second phase was characterized by a stabilization of the vbnc sub population which mainly contained cells with low esterase activity and intact or intermediate cell membranes and was stable for more than 100 days depending on the strain starvation at 45 c in distilled water has been previously studied for l pneumophila sg1 by ohno and kato 2003 and al bana et al 2014 who observed that cells lost culturability in 14 and 18 days respectively these times are comparable to those observed for the serogroup 1 strains in our study moreover in the study by al bana et al 2014 90 of the cells had already lost their membrane integrity before the complete loss of culturability 8 log10 reduction like in our study the concentration of culturable cells decreased more rapidly than cells with intact membranes in the experiments by ohno and kato 2003 stabilization of vbnc cell numbers after loss of culturability was not observed but a continuous gradual decrease these slight differences might be due to the use of different l pneumophila sg1 strains and due to differences in the analytical methods fcm versus epifluorescence microscopy a third phase was observed during long term starvation after 200 days the number of vbnc cells of most of the strains declined gradually thus cells died or were fatally injured we interpreted cells as fatally injured or dead when either membrane integrity was completely lost or when esterase activity decreased to a level below the defined threshold supplementary information lennon and jones 2011 observed that bacterial intracellular resources are slowly depleted during dormancy which directly leads to cell death because these starved cells are no longer able to prevent certain phenomena for example the hydrolyzation and consequent degradation of dna or other important macromolecules however during all phases and for all strains no reduction in total sgi stained cell numbers was observed which is in agreement with the results of other authors e g ohno and kato 2003 however the mfi of sgi stained cells changed in the initial days of the experiment the mfi increased followed by a reduction of more than half during one year of starvation fig 2 trevors et al 2012 stated that vbnc cells condense their dna upon starvation explaining the increase of the mfi in the first days of our experiment the subsequent reduction in the fluorescence was most likely due to a reduction in the average number of dna and rna molecules in the stained population upon increasing cell death the results of this study implicate long term survival rates of vbnc legionella cells in engineered water systems triggering non culturability due to oligotrophic conditions mainly the biofilms are the places where legionellae may survive nutrient depletion and disinfection measures as vbnc cells remaining undetected by standard cultivation surveillance schemes moritz et al 2010 based on the results of this study we expect long survival times of vbnc legionella populations in biofilms of engineered water systems because biofilms provide among other benefits better nutrient conditions in comparison to the water phase flemming et al 2016 4 2 membrane integrity patterns for the assessment of membrane integrity as an indicator of viability three different states were identified with fcm analysis while a fully permeabilized membrane indicates cell death or fatal injury and a fully intact membrane indicates viability the intermediate state develops in a semicircular movement upwards between the permeabilized cells and the intact cell membrane gates in the fcm dot plot supplementary information fig s1 barbesti et al 2000 berney et al 2007 falcioni et al 2008 barbesti et al 2000 referred these events as cells with slightly damaged membranes most likely only small amounts of pi enter these intermediate cells due to incipient membrane damage resulting in an incomplete quenching of sgi by pi barbesti et al 2000 in the case of starvation the moderate penetration of pi into the cells may be caused by deficient maintenance of both membranes due to nutrient and energy depletion as the size of the intermediate state sub population in our study increased in the short term period and decreased by the end of the experiment and because at the same time more cells with permeabilized membranes appeared there is clear evidence of the existence of such an intermediate state over the course of starvation for e coli nocker et al 2017 observed the same moon like transition of chlorine challenged cells after sgi pi staining in the two dimensional dot plot e coli lost its culturability in the membrane intact gate but had already shifted up in the moon like way in its trajectory toward the permeabilized cell gate thus we conclude that in our case the intermediate membrane state is a real physiological condition of starved legionella cells 4 3 esterase activity pattern although culturability was lost within the first weeks of starvation a few highly active cells 0 01 5 of the initial concentration remained in nearly all starvation microcosms during the first 200 days for the lpolda and lpsg6 strains in particular cells with high esterase activity were detected in quantifiable amounts 1 5 104 cells ml even after 322 and 284 days of starvation respectively alleron et al 2008 have demonstrated the existence of cells with high esterase activity after 4 months of starvation in resting medium and ducret et al 2014 observed three sub populations exhibiting different degrees of esterase activity in vbnc legionella cells induced by moderate concentrations of hocl during the initial timepoints of our experiments almost all viable cells contributed to the highly esterase active sub population which then decreased along with culturability in the companion study dietersdorfer et al 2018 we observed that the long term starved vbnc cells not only infected amoebae but also monocyte derived primary human macrophages thus we hypothesize that the remaining highly esterase active and membrane intact cells represent this infective sub population the fact that the esterase inactive sub population still exhibited very low esterase activity can be explained by the auto hydrolysis of the non fluorescent cfda to the fluorescent carboxy fluorescein at low levels in the aqueous solution of the samples followed by passive diffusion into dead bacterial cells with compromised membranes hoefel et al 2003 however following our fcm gating strategy and using an appropriate negative control esterase active sub populations were distinguishable from the non active negative controls 4 4 relationship between the different viability indicators the viability indicators analyzed reveal a complex picture of the legionella sub populations which developed upon starvation as these parameters were not measured for the same cells but in different sub samples correlations and interpretation of trends are a suitable method to predict associations among these physiological conditions see table 2 first the parameters of culturability leucine uptake highly esterase active cell numbers and mfi of esterase activity correlated strongly among each other as they all correspond to high metabolic activity of the cell oliver 2005 summarized that during the transition from the culturable state to the vbnc state bacterial cells reduce nutrient transport and respiration activity which fits well with our observations for legionella cells the second group of significantly correlated parameters contained the viability indicators analyzed with fcm such as total esterase active cells and cells with intact membranes table 2 cells with intermediate membrane integrity correlated only with the cells that had low esterase activity over all strains and experiments the sum of the number of cells with intact or intermediate cell membranes was in most cases except two late timepoints higher than the number of esterase active cells consequently a part of the cell sub population with intact and intermediate cell membranes belonged to the esterase inactive cell fraction the lpolda and the lpsg6 strains showed only minor reduction in the number of cells with intact membranes and thus only a small fraction of intermediate membrane cells was formed from these results it can be concluded that upon starvation cells reduce their metabolic activity and a certain part of these cells with low esterase activity have membranes in the intermediate permeabilization state berney et al 2008 reported that bacteria with intact cytoplasmic membranes in tap water are always higher in numbers than those that have esterase activity which fits with our observations for starving legionella cells in agreement with berney et al 2008 it seems that esterase activity is the more conservative indicator with respect to cell viability membrane integrity as the sum of intact and intermediate cells overestimates the amount of viable cells 4 5 inter strain variability there is evidence that differences between the l pneumophila strains were observed upon comparison of the survival patterns of the mab 3 1 positive subgroup of l pneumophila sg1 lpparis lpenv and lpclin and the rest of the strains studied in the short term period the viable cell numbers of all mab 3 1 positive strains decreased strongly compared to the other strains specifically the number of membrane intact cells decreased by 0 85 1 05 log10 compared to a decrease of 0 19 log10 for the lpolda strain and a decrease of 0 25 log10 for the lpsg6 strain mann whitney u test p 0 001 the total number of esterase active cells dropped by 1 43 2 88 log10 during 300 days of starvation compared to a decrease of 0 3 0 6 log10 for lpolda and lpsg6 mann whitney u test p 0 001 helbig et al 2002 found that the mab 3 1 positive subgroup was the most frequent subtype in a survey of clinical isolates 66 8 of all ld cases our data show that the more virulent mab 3 1 positive strains possess weaker survival mechanisms under typical environmental conditions of starvation mentasti et al 2016 highlighted that the mab 3 1 positive l pneumophila sequence type 47 disproportionately often causes infections in humans but is rarely found in environmental samples the lmic strain showed a completely different starvation course in comparison to the l pneumophila strains synchronously with losing culturability the number of all esterase active cells decreased therefore at the timepoint of complete loss of culturability only a few cells with low esterase activity remained close to the quantification limit 5 conclusions legionella cells starved in ultrapure water gradually diversified in a tri phasic manner into distinct sub populations according to the viability indicators analyzed after 100 days the predominant sub population of most legionella strains tested was characterized by weak life signs such as partially damaged membranes and low metabolic activity however at the same time a low percentage of cells with high metabolic activity was present which may be able to infect host cells the use of culture based enumeration techniques for standard detection and surveillance and for the evaluation of disinfection strategies may lead to an underestimation of the potential risk to human health specifically highly active vbnc sub populations which could cause infection may be present the further development standardization and application of specific viability based methods are thus recommended as a complementary tool
