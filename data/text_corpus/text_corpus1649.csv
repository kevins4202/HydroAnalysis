8245,study region the study data draws on the drainage design for hammam agricultural project hap and eshkeda agricultural project eap located in the south of libya north of the sahara desert the results of this study are applicable to other arid areas study focus this study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data poor areas artificial neural networks anns were developed to estimate ksat and compared with empirical regression type pedotransfer function ptf equations subsequently the anns and ptfs estimated ksat values were used in endrain software to design subsurface drainage systems which were evaluated against designs using measured ksat values new hydrological insights results showed that anns more accurately predicted ksat than ptfs drainage design based on ptfs predictions 1 result in a deeper water level and 2 higher drainage density increasing costs drainage designs based on anns predictions gave drain spacing and water table depth equivalent to those predicted using measured data the results of this study indicate that anns can be developed using existing and under utilised data sets and applied successfully to data poor areas as ksat is time consuming to measure basing drainage designs on ann predictions generated from alternative datasets will reduce the overall cost of drainage designs making them more accessible to farmers planners and decision makers in least developed countries keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity artificial neural networks agricultural drainage design pedotransfer functions sub surface drainage arid areas 1 introduction in the earth s terrestrial biosphere soil plays an essential role in managing the mass and energy transferred between the earth and the atmosphere amundson et al 2015 bittelli et al 2015 upper soil horizons have hydraulic properties governed by pore size distribution water retention and hydraulic conductivity that regulate the local water balance through infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge zhang and schaap 2019 these soil properties have a fundamental effect on local regional and global land surface water and energy balances montzka et al 2017 vereecken et al 2016 verhoef and egea 2014 for example approximately 60 of rainfall is returned to the atmosphere through the soil plant atmosphere continuum katul et al 2012 oki and kanae 2006 and 50 of the global biomass production and related carbon cycle depend on soil processes cleveland et al 2013 water for agriculture is often unregulated and overexploited in spite of this the general belief is that by 2025 irrigated lands have to be extended by 20 30 in order to meet global food demands fao 2002 however the world s arable lands are degrading due to soil salinization desertification erosion and urbanisation fao 2002 in arid and semiarid areas water use efficiency is a major issue due to increasing cross sector demand for limited water resources elshemy 2018 therefore understanding soil hydrological behaviour is essential in the global drive to expand crop production abdelbaki et al 2009 for example drainage systems in arid and semiarid areas have been designed and installed to manage and control soil waterlogging and salinity problems in irrigation schemes however less than 30 of all irrigated land needing drainage have been effectively drained schultz et al 2007 and the situation is worse in least developed countries oecd 2020 according to smedema et al 2000 the proportion of agricultural land drained in developing countries is 5 10 as compared to 25 30 in developed countries this is primarily due to a fundamental lack of data on key soil attributes needed as inputs to design drainage systems ayars and evans 2015 this paucity of data is often driven by the cost of sample collection and laboratory analysis and or a lack of adequate laboratory resources historically in many countries soil data have been routinely gathered through soil surveys yet such soil data rarely includes saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat an essential parameter in drainage system design patil and singh 2016 accurate quantification of ksat is essential for multiple aspects of agrohydrology zhang and schaap 2019 saturated hydraulic conductivity is used to quantify water movement through a unit cross section of soil per unit time aimrun et al 2004 and is used to design subsurface drainage systems irrigation practices and for modelling agricultural and hydrological processes such as water movement and solute transport in the soil abdelbaki et al 2009 saturated hydraulic conductivity is also used in subsurface drainage models to determine drain spacing at specific drain depth bicknell et al 2005 chung et al 1992 ma et al 2012 skaggs 1978 van dam et al 1997 thus the accurate determination of ksat is important as it influences the technical and economic feasibility of large scale agricultural drainage projects saturated hydraulic conductivity can be estimated using either in situ methods such as the guelph permeameter above water table method reynolds and elrick 1985 and the auger hole method below water table method van beers 1958 or laboratory based methods such as the constant head and falling head permeameters klute and dirksen 1986 however ksat is highly spatially variable over a range of scales e g plot field and catchment hassler et al 2014 therefore a large number of soil samples and measurements are required to accurately describe the hydraulic properties of an area of interest sobieraj et al 2004 these measurements often are difficult time consuming and expensive fooladmand 2011 patil and singh 2016 in addition due to time and financial constraints researchers planners and decision makers in many countries especially in least developed countries are faced with inadequate data to work with ksat values are simply unavailable patil et al 2011 2010 consequently multiple researchers have focused on developing indirect methods for estimating ksat such as utilising pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate ksat from more readily available soil measurement information e g soil texture and bulk density arrington et al 2013 dashtaki et al 2010 khodaverdiloo et al 2011 ptfs were first represented by empirical regression equations relating water and solute transport parameters to the fundamental soil properties that are accessible in soil survey databases cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 for example ahuja et al 1986 developed an empirical equation to estimate ksat from the effective porosity only while li et al 2007 developed a ptf to estimate ksat that required percentage sand silt and clay bulk density bd and soil organic matter however wösten et al 2001 stated that future developments in ptfs would be derived from more accurate data mining tools such as artificial neural networks anns and group methods of data mining techniques such as k nearest neighbour and support vector machine svm k nearest neighbour have been applied to predict precipitation huang et al 2017 groundwater depth kombo et al 2020 and crop yield jothi et al 2020 whereas svm has also been applied to predict groundwater depth mallikarjuna et al 2020 and the discharge coefficient of rectangular side weirs located on trapezoidal channels azimi et al 2019 anns have been successfully applied to predict water table depth and groundwater salinity at different drain depths and spacing nozari and azadi 2017 estimate soil salinity bouksila et al 2010 and to predict evapotranspiration from limited meteorological data zanetti et al 2007 anns have also been applied to predict sediment transport without sedimentation by combining anns with the particle swarm optimization pso imperialist competitive algorithm ica genetic algorithm ga and decision tree dt methods ebtehaj et al 2020 2018 artificial neural networks have been shown to be more flexible and able to deal with multiple sources of input data as compared to ptf based regression equations wösten et al 2001 in the last two decades anns have been utilised as a special class of ptfs using feed forward or radial basis functions to approximate any continuous nonlinear function sobieraj et al 2004 detailed statistical and functional reports have been carried out to compare the performance between ann based ptfs and regression type ptfs to predict ksat on different datasets such as soil texture and bd agyare et al 2007 arshad et al 2013 parasuraman et al 2006 several authors have demonstrated that anns outperform regression techniques especially when uncertainties in the quality of the data are small baker and ellison 2008 merdun et al 2006 minasny and mcbratney 2002 therefore anns have the potential to be a more accurate approach to estimating ksat as compared to more conventional ptf regression equations this study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat in order to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data poor areas utilising existing and currently under utilised datasets it is envisaged that this will reduce the overall cost of drainage system design making them more accessible to farmers planners and decision makers in least developed countries the objectives of this study were to 1 develop anns to estimate ksat 2 compare the performance of applying anns as compare to regression type ptf equations for the estimation of ksat and 3 evaluate the performance of drainage systems based on these two contrasting methods of estimating ksat 2 material and methods 2 1 case study data sets were generated for two established agricultural projects in libya hammam agricultural project hap and eshkeda agricultural project eap using seven years 1974 1981 of archived and under utilised data from the general authority of water resources in libya both study areas are located in the southern part of libya north of the sahara desert both study areas are considered to be in the hyper arid zone fao 1989 with annual rainfall rarely exceeding 100 mm there are no perennial rivers in the area of interest consequently the only water source is paleo groundwater from two aquifers the mezda and murzuq aquifers are the source of irrigation for hap and eap respectively tantawi 2000 the hap is located in the north east part of sokna oasis 29 04 01 n 15 47 05 e at an elevation of circa 270 m above sea level asl the hap covers 1200 ha and is divided into 182 farms 6 8 ha for each farm the work on the project began in 1971 and the reclamation was completed in 1985 the hap project has a drainage system designed in the 1970s the soil texture in the hap is highly variable with eight soil texture classes table 1 according to the usda textural classification the hap dataset can be classified as sand 22 3 loamy sand 18 3 sandy loam 31 4 loam 0 6 sandy clay loam 21 0 clay loam 4 2 sandy clay 1 8 and clay 0 4 soil survey division staff 1993 see table 1 for more details the other project eap is located north of sabha city 27 32 45 n 14 16 7 e at an elevation of 320 m asl the project was initiated in 1975 and it became operational in the second half of 1976 with a drainage system being designed between 1979 1981 the eap covers 3000 ha and is divided into three subareas western area 2000 ha central area 600 ha and eastern area 370 ha in accordance with the installed irrigation wells the area comprises 25 districts each with 12 farms of circa 10 ha each the farms are sub divided into two farmed plots each 180 m by 234 m in size windbreaks have been planted between the farm plots and around the individual farms the eap dataset is associated with four soil texture classes dominated by sand 88 4 with 8 0 3 4 and 0 2 of the set represented by loamy sand sandy loam and loam respectively table 1 2 2 dataset description the data collected from the two project sites included particle size distribution sand s silt si and clay c bulk density bd g cm 3 wilting point wp field capacity fc and ksat m d 1 summarised in table 1 soil texture was measured using the hydrometer method following bouyoucos 1927 the soil bd was measured following the methods described by buckman and brady 1960 field capacity and wilting point were determined by tensiometers using the method reviewed by richards 1949 in the eap ksat was measured in the field using the average of four replications of the auger hole method van beers 1958 in the hap ksat was measured in the laboratory using undisturbed samples following the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 in total for the hap there were 770 ksat measurements c 1 measurement for every 2 ha while for the eap there were 442 ksat measurements c 1 measurement for every 5 ha to facilitate ann development and validation in both eap and hap an area was randomly selected and designated as a data poor area for which ksat measurements were assumed to be absent in the eap a 600 ha area in the central section of the scheme 5 0 km x 1 2 km was selected as the data poor area whilst in the hap a 500 ha area in the western section of the scheme 1 43 km x 3 5 km was selected the total number of ksat measurement points in these designated data poor areas were 82 and 158 in eap and hap respectively which represent 20 of the dataset for each site the remaining areas of eap and hap were assumed to be data rich areas the data from data rich areas was used to develop the anns to predict the ksat in the designated data poor areas data from the data rich areas of each scheme were assigned into two groups based on the input requirements for the development of anns the first group had limited parameters that included s si c and bd as independent variables and ksat as the dependent variable the second group included the parameters in the first group as well as wp and fc a statistical summary of the dataset used in this study is given in table 1 2 3 anns model development artificial neural networks are a mathematical approach used to characterise synthetic neurons to solve complex problems in a similar way to that of the human brain agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 since the 1940s there has been growing interest in the study of neurological mechanisms and structures that interest has led to the development of new computational models linking systems or anns based on biological processes that have been used to solve complex problems such as pattern recognition and rapid information processing and adaptation huang 2009 anns use machine learning based on the principle of self adjusting internal control parameters and can be used to recognise complex non linear relationships between input and output datasets ayoubi et al 2011 anns are typically formed of three processing layers namely an input hidden and output layer fig 1 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 more 2018 the input layer consists of the selected independent variables each variable in the input layer is connected to the hidden layer through a weighting algorithm bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 in some cases the weights given to each independent variable are generated randomly in other cases they are fine tuned and trained through a process called backpropagation bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 backpropagation quantifies the error at the output by comparing the currently derived outputs to the expected ones and modify the weights to reduce the error bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 the layer located between the input and the output layers is called the hidden layer the hidden layer may consist of more than one layer with each layer containing a number of units a grouping of independent variables these units known also as neurons are used to guide the processing of the data contained in the input layer and to generate computational connections between the input and the output layer there is no specific formula to decide the number of units to be included in the hidden layer it is generally problem dependent with the error tested by varying the number of units and layers in order to determine the appropriate number of units layers to be used bell 2015 the hidden layer is represented by a group of activation functions including linear functions logistic functions and hyperbolic functions logistic and hyperbolic functions are mainly used in classification problems because they range between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 1 while the linear functions infinity to infinity are mainly used in regression problems ghatak 2019 the output layer consists of a series of inverse functions which are used to refine the training and calculate the difference between the output predictions and the measured ksat and to minimise error one of the most widely used algorithms for this purpose is the backpropagation algorithm bell 2015 backpropagation was applied to develop the anns in this study for the development of anns to predict ksat in the designated data poor areas within eap and hap several processing steps were undertaken the first step was to define a training dataset in order to develop the anns the training dataset was based on 80 of the data from the data rich areas of the eap and hap leaving 20 of the data as the pseudo data poor area for testing purposes against the actual measured ksat data from both sites the second step was to define the appropriate network number of layers and number of neurons in each layer a sequential orthogonal approach sun 2012 was adopted to determine the optimum number of neurons this approach adds a neuron to the hidden layer until the ann with the smallest error is identified sun 2012 the ann with the smallest error in predicting ksat within the data rich area was subsequently applied to the data poor area using data from eap and hap that had not been used in the development of the model to validate and test the performance of ann by comparing the ann predicted ksat values with measured ksat values table 2 shows the input parameters used to develop six ann models to predict ksat all anns were developed for both hap and eap using two groups of input parameters the first group of input parameters included sand silt clay bulk density wilting point and field capacity were applied in ann1 ann3 and ann5 ann1 and ann3 used data only from eap and hap respectively and ann5 used the combined data set from both eap and hap the second group of input parameters included sand silt clay and bulk density were applied in ann2 ann4 and ann6 ann2 and ann4 used data only from eap and hap respectively and ann6 used the combined data set from both eap and hap the reason for having two groups of input parameters is to assess the minimum data set required to predict ksat accurately the critical evaluation of the ability of the six ann models developed in this study to accurately predict ksat was undertaken in five steps step 1 used the training data data rich area for site specific ann model training and the data from the designated data poor areas as testing datasets the best performing ann model in terms of predicting ksat in the designated data poor areas was selected by applying three statistical parameters these were 1 coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and predicted ksat values for the data poor areas e g best performance is equal to 1 2 mean square error mse and 3 root mean square error rmse patil and singh 2016 zhang and schaap 2019 which can respectively be defined mathematically as 1 r 2 1 i 1 n p i m i 2 i 1 n m i m i 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i m i 2 3 r m s e i 1 n p i m i 2 n where n represents the number of soil samples m i is the measured ksat p i is the predicted ksat and m i is the mean measured ksat mse and rmse were used to give a quantitative indication of ann model error in units of ksat the best performance value is zero step 2 tested the four site specific ann models table 2 on data rich areas only using a k fold cross validation technique bell 2015 ghatak 2019 there are other cross validation techniques such as 1 validation set approach where the data is divided randomly into two sets one set to train the model and the other set to test the model 2 leave one out cross validation where one sub set of the data point is left out the model is built on the remaining data and the model is tested using the left out data sub set bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 in this study the k fold cross validation method was applied in the k fold cross validation technique the training data data from the pre defined data rich areas in both sites were divided into ten randomly generated sub sets for eap and hap this resulted in ten randomly generated sub sets of 36 and 61 data points respectively during each k fold cross validation nine sub sets were combined and used as the training sub set and one part used as the testing sub set this process was repeated ten times rotating out a testing sub set each time so that each sub set used in each ann was applied in the testing for both eap and hap this k fold cross validation process was also repeated removing 10 data points from the dataset each time until only 10 data points remained this approach was used to quantify the performance ability to accurately predict ksat of each of the four site specific ann models table 2 against the size of the training set used chollet and allaire 2017 this technique was used to quantify the ability of the anns to predict ksat as the size of training set was reduced randomly and to also determine the minimum training set required to develop the ann step 3 of performance testing compared the outputs of the anns against outputs generated from traditional widely adopted empirical equations used to predict ksat abdelbaki et al 2009 minasny and mcbratney 2000a table 3 step 4 evaluated the performance of each developed anns to predict ksat in the other site non site specific for example ann1 and ann2 were developed and tested in eap and were applied to predict ksat in hap and ann3 and ann4 were developed and tested in hap and were applied to predict ksat in eap this step was added to evaluate the applicability of applying anns developed in specific locations to predict ksat in new locations in libya in this example the separation distance between ann development and application was 225 km i e the separation distance between eap and hap step 5 developed anns by combining the training datasets from the pre defined data rich areas of both eap and hap to predict ksat in the pre defined data poor areas in eap and hap this step was applied to evaluate the accuracy of anns based on larger combined datasets from multiple sites compared to smaller but site specific data sets to predict ksat 2 4 application of anns to drainage design drainage systems can be designed as either surface subsurface or a combination of both surface and subsurface depending on the prevailing conditions in the area and crops grown luthin 1978 this study focused on subsurface drainage which is used in both eap and hap the determination of appropriate spacing and depth of drains are the main parameters in the design of subsurface drainage systems that need to be considered luthin 1978 a number of drainage theories and associated equations for designing subsurface drainage systems have been developed dagan 1965 dumm 1960 1954 hooghoudt 1940 1937 kirkham 1958 luthin and worstell 1959 van schilfgaarde 1963 these equations were developed to relate the spacing and depth of drains to water table depth and drawdown rates methods have been developed to design drainage systems under steady or non steady state see reviews by van der ploeg et al 1999 and youngs 1999 endrain drainage computer program released by prof oosterbaan in the netherlands was applied to design drainage systems in the designated data poor areas of both eap and hap using ksat derived from the anns developed in this study table 2 as compared to widely adopted ptfs table 3 and the actual measured ksat for these data poor areas endrain uses eq 4 described by hooghoudt 1937 cited in ritzema 1994 to calculate the distance between drains and the depth of the water table at the midpoint between two drains oosterbaan 1993 4 l 2 8 k b d h 4 k a h 2 q where l is drain spacing m q is the steady state drainage discharge rate m d 1 ka is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil above drain level m d 1 kb is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil below drain level m d 1 h is the height of water table above the water level in the drain m d is the equivalent depth which is a function of the spacing l the depth in m of impervious layer below the drain di dd in fig 2 and the radius r of the drain m values for d can be found in tables presented by hooghoudt 1940 van der molen and wesseling 1991 developed this further to calculate series solutions for multiple equivalent depths endrain requires two values of ksat one from above the drain level and one from below the drain level therefore a representative ksat was required as an input to endrain according to luthin 1978 the geometric mean kg gives the best representative ksat for a study area therefore representative kg values for eap and hap were generated for input to endrain eq 5 illustrates how the geometric mean was calculated and table 4 shows the different calculations of kg based on the project area and the source of ksat e g ksat derived from anns 5 k g k s a t 1 k s a t 2 k s a t 3 k s a t n n where the geometric mean kg is found by multiplying the values of ksa ksat1 is the ksat value for sample 1 ksat2 is ksat value of sample 2 and so on to n number of values and then the nth root of the product of those values is then found nth root is equal to the number of values water table depth based on ann and ptf generated kg values table 4 was compared with water table depth based on kg values generated from measured ksat kg1 and kg 8 in table 4 the value of r used in endrain was the average water requirement for date palm phoenix dactylifer and alfalfa medicago sativa date palm was chosen because it is considered to be the most profitable crop for the south of libya elmeer et al 2016 alfalfa was adopted as it is grown as a fodder for livestock in both eap and hap the average water requirements for date palm is 0 02 m d 1 in eap and 0 007 m d 1 in hap and for alfalfa are 0 01 m d 1 for eap and 0 006 m d 1 for hap these values were taken from an unpublished report based on work undertaken by the libyan government in 1999 general water authority 1999 site investigations of soil properties were undertaken at both sites between 1974 1980 in hap by danenco 1980 and holzmann wakuti 1974 and between 1976 1981 in eap by italconsult 1976 and cornelius brochier 1981 to design agricultural projects including drainage systems in these areas the following data were taken from these reports the average depth of the impermeable layer for both eap and hap was assumed to be 1 5 m two soil layers were assumed with two different ksat values with depth and the depth of water table was set at 0 5 m the vertical ksat and the horizontal ksat were assumed to be equal hess et al 1992 table 5 shows the input parameters applied in endrain fig 2 is a schematic representation of a subsurface drainage system and provides an explanation of the input parameters used in table 5 and eq 4 finally an economic analysis was conducted to calculate the initial cost of installing each drainage system in the designated data poor areas using the measured kg as well as anns and ptfs generated kg values the cost of drains installed was assumed to be 2 62 m according to skaggs 2007 2 5 software used the data was analysed using several software packages the development of the anns utilised a neuralnet package in r stefan and guenther 2019 pedotransfer function equations table 3 used to predict ksat and the representative ksat kg were calculated in microsoft excel 2016 finally subsurface drain spacing and depth of water table were calculated using endrain oosterbaan 1993 3 results 3 1 performance of site specific anns and cross validation the structure of each of the site specific ann models developed in this study and their step 1 performance evaluation are presented in table 6 all anns were able to predict based on r2 between 0 89 0 96 of the variability in ksat in the designated data poor areas of eap and hap as expected the ann models performed better when using the training data than when the testing data was used in hap the r2 was slightly better in the testing section r2 0 96 and 0 95 than in the training section r2 0 94 and 0 93 table 6 generally the anns developed in this study showed that there was little difference in performance between the anns as r2 ranged from 0 89 0 90 in eap and 0 95 96 in hap according to the performance results in table 6 models ann1 and ann3 performed better than both ann2 and ann4 even though the number of data points in the anns developed for eap for training and testing were almost half the number used in the anns developed for hap 360 in eap and 610 in hap the rmse and mse values for the eap anns indicate that they are more accurate the results of the step 2 k fold cross validation are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows the median rmse across the ten randomly generated sub sets dark line inside the boxplot when the size of training set is fixed to the maximum size 360 in eap and 610 in hap in fig 3a it can be noted that the median rmse for ann1 ann2 ann3 and ann4 were 1 65 0 40 1 80 and 1 40 m d 1 respectively also the minimum and maximum rmse ranged between 1 37 1 84 0 10 1 40 1 30 8 10 and 0 30 2 70 m d 1 in ann1 ann2 ann3 and ann4 respectively these results showed that the developed anns for both eap and hap were in the range of the 10 fold cross validation therefore the training dataset from the data rich areas was effectively used to develop anns able to predict ksat fig 3b indicates how rmse varies with the size of training dataset as indicated by the low median rmse values the best performing anns were developed when the full dataset was used in the training phase fig 3b however for both eap and hap even if the training set was reduced to 50 the anns were still able to accurately predict ksat fig 3b 3 2 performance of ptfs and non site specific anns four ptfs that are widely adopted to predict ksat were applied to predict ksat in the designated data poor areas of eap and hap table 3 in relation to rmse and mse ptf 2 developed by dane and puckett 1994 performed better than the other ptfs in both eap and hap table 7 however it is critical to note that all the ptfs were between 2 5 times less accurate at predicting ksat than the site specific anns for example the rmse values of ptf 2 were 4 19 and 12 72 m d 1 for eap and hap respectively in contrast the rmse for all the site specific anns applied to eap and hap ranged from 1 92 to 2 82 m d 1 further the mse for the ptfs applied in eap and hap ranged from 17 60 225 00 m d 1 in contrast the mse for the site specific anns applied in eap and hap ranged from 3 69 to 7 97 m d 1 for the combined anns ann5 and ann6 the accuracy was better than the ptfs but slightly less 3 times less accurate than the site specific anns for example ann5 in rmse was 2 11 m d 1 while in ann1 was 1 92 m d 1 while ann6 was 6 09 m d 1 in predicting ksat in eap finally for the non site specific anns the accuracy was less than all other anns and ptfs with the highest rmse and mse values of 15 88 and 252 23 m d 1 respectively in ann4 for predicted ksat in eap figs 4 and 5 show the accuracy of the ptfs specific and non site specific anns in predicting ksat within the data poor areas of eap and hap the 1 1 line represents the line of perfect agreement between the predicted and the measured values of ksat it is of note that the predicted ksat of the site specific anns all closely comply with the 1 1 line the results indicate that the site specific anns were significantly better at predicting the observed ksat values compared to those predicted by the ptfs and non site specific anns applied to eap and hap for example for the highest eap observed ksat value in eap of 21 90 m d 1 ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 predicted ksat values of 2 10 4 70 2 20 and 2 00 m d 1 respectively this is an underprediction of one order of magnitude in contrast for the same sample 21 90 m d 1 ann1 and ann2 predicted values of 22 40 and 24 50 m d 1 respectively while ann3 and ann4 developed to predict ksat in hap overpredict ksat in eap with the highest value of prediction 42 20 and 29 80 m d 1 respectively furthermore in eap the measured ksat ranged between 0 60 to 21 90 m d 1 whereas the prediction values of ksat for all ptfs ranged from 1 20 to 6 30 m d 1 in contrast the non site specific ksat ranged between 7 00 to 42 20 m d 1 while in eap the predicted ksat values for the site specific anns ranged from 0 60 to 25 30 m d 1 a similar pattern was observed in the hap fig 5 where the measured ksat ranged between 0 40 to 38 00 m d 1 whereas the prediction values for all ptfs ranged between 0 03 to 6 30 m d 1 and for non site specific anns ranged between 0 01 to 3 50 m d 1 in contrast the site specific anns predicted ksat in hap ranged in value between 0 20 to 27 70 m d 1 however the site specific anns used to predict ksat in hap were unable to accurately predict ksat when the measured ksat was 30 00 m d 1 these anns underestimate the ksat values 30 00 m d 1 by 10 30 however only 6 samples out of 158 had a ksat value of 30 00 m d 1 it can be noted that the ptfs tend to under predict the ksat values when the observed measurements exceed 6 00 m d 1 and 2 00 m d 1 in eap and hap respectively additionally it is of note that ann1 fig 4 and ann3 fig 5 show slightly better compliance with the 1 1 line in comparison to ann2 fig 4 and ann4 fig 5 also ann5 and ann6 showed a comparable prediction to the ones obtained by the site specific anns where ksat values ranged between 0 70 to 23 20 m d 1 in eap and 0 50 to 30 80 m d 1 in hap however ann6 was slightly less accurate in predicting ksat especially the observed values of 15 m d 1 3 3 drain spacing and water table depths eq 5 was used to estimate the kg for the different scenarios presented in table 4 the results of which are given in table 8 estimation of kg was made above adl and below bdl the drain level these estimated values of kg were applied in endrain to predict the drain spacing and water table depths for the designated data poor areas of eap and hap measured ksat values used to calculate kg eap kg1 and hap kg8 resulted in a drain spacing between two drains of 24 7 m date palm and 34 9 m alfalfa and 56 0 m date palm and 60 5 m alfalfa for eap and hap respectively in general kg derived from the four anns ksat predictions had the lowest variation in distance between drains compared to the target value based on measured data kg1 and kg8 for eap the variation in drain spacing from the target for ann1 and ann2 was for date palm 1 1 and 4 6 respectively in contrast for the ptfs kg 4 7 variation in drain spacing from the measured data ranged from 28 6 to 36 8 table 8 for hap the variation in drain spacing from the measured data for ann3 and ann4 was 16 0 and 17 2 respectively in contrast for the ptfs kg 11 14 variation in drain spacing from the measured data ranged from 58 2 to 77 2 the target depth of water table for eap and hap was 50 cm from the soil surface as obtained by kg1 and kg8 generally the variation of water depth based on kg derived from the four anns were closer to the target water table depth with variation ranging between 2 0 6 0 and 0 6 2 0 in eap and hap respectively in contrast the variations in water depth for the ptfs compared to the target design ranged from 27 0 to 31 0 in kg 4 7 and 34 0 41 0 in kg 11 14 the estimation of the initial cost of installing a drainage system in the designated data poor areas of eap 600 ha and hap 500 ha using measured kg1 and kg8 table 8 was us 638 000 and us 450 000 in eaf and us 238 000 and us 220 000 in hap for date palm and alfalfa respectively the results show that for both eap and hap installing drainage schemes based on ksat derived from anns is more economical than designs using ksat derived from ptfs in eap kg2 derived from ann2 resulted in only a 1 1 and 1 3 increase compared to measured data in initial installation costs for date palm and alfalfa respectively table 8 in contrast kg3 derived from ann3 resulted in a 4 4 and 4 3 decrease in initial installation costs compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in hap kg9 and kg10 derived from ann3 and ann4 result in a 15 5 19 3 and 16 8 20 9 increase in initial installation costs compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in contrast kg11 14 derived from ptfs 1 4 result in substantial 234 0 431 0 and 233 0 433 0 increases in initial installation cost compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in comparison to the initial drainage costs calculated based on measured data the extra initial cost of designing drainage systems in eap and hap using kg2 kg3 kg9 and kg10 ranges between 6 000 to 46 000 in contrast the extra initial cost of designing drainage systems in eap and hap using kg values derived from ptfs is an order of magnitude higher ranging from 182 000 to 790 000 4 discussion 4 1 development of anns all site specific anns developed in this study were able to accurately predict ksat see figs 4 and 5 in this study to predict ksat values of soils in designated data poor areas of eap and hap anns were developed using selected key input variables the input parameters for models ann2 and ann4 s si and c and bd do not describe the structure or connectivity of void spaces in soil therefore they do not explain the connections between soil structures and functions very well nemes et al 2003 pachepsky et al 2006 anderson and bouma 1973 found that an excellent prediction as close as possible to the observed values of ksat can be obtained when pore space is measured directly therefore the anns that also include fc and wp ann1 and ann3 increased the accuracy of prediction of ksat in comparison to ann2 and ann4 see figs 4 and 5 the k fold cross validation was undertaken to estimate the test error rate within the training dataset in order to confirm the confidence of applying the developed ann to the designated data poor areas the results presented in fig 3b show that for areas with similar soil characteristics to eap and hap the number of ksat measurements required to generate an accurate ann can be reduced to circa 50 taking into account the total area of each scheme ranging between 1000 3000 ha these results support the findings of yang 1995 where the quality of an anns training dataset is more important than the quantity of values used this can be seen in misprediction of ksat values of 30 0 m d 1 or above in ann3 and ann4 when the highest measured ksat value used to develop these anns was 28 0 m d 1 in addition yang 1995 added that if the model was trained with a full range of expected situations then it would require fewer input values to develop the training dataset which means having all the expected values of the dependent variable within the training dataset for example in this study ksat was the dependent variable needed to be predicted for a specific location data poor area by having all ranges of ksat within the training dataset the developed ann will be more accurate generally the non site specific anns failed to accurately predict ksat in eap and hap in eap ann3 and ann4 over predict ksat especially the measured values between 0 6 to 10 0 m d 1 whereas in hap ann1 and ann2 under predict ksat these results show that an ann developed in a specific location may not be transferrable to another location even within the same pedoclimatic region however the combined anns ann5 and ann6 illustrate that soil datasets based on more than one location are able to accurately predict ksat 4 2 ptfs performance the ptfs applied in this study failed to accurately predict ksat values especially for values 10 0 m d 1 which represent 15 0 and 54 0 of the designated data poor areas in eap and hap respectively this is due to the ptfs evaluated being developed trained and tested for very different soils for example the dataset sources used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 and ptf 4 were us soils while the dataset source used to develop ptf 3 was from spain cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 critically the soil texture classes used to develop the ptfs were different to the dominant soil textures in eap and hap for example the percentage of the dataset associated with sand and loamy sand in eap was 96 4 table 1 while the percentage of these soil textures in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were 14 0 53 0 1 1 and 3 0 respectively similarly the combined percentage of sand loamy sand and sandy loam soils in hap was 72 0 in contrast the combined percentage of these soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were respectively 38 0 60 0 7 0 and 11 6 consequently the ksat values predicted using the ptfs were poorly correlated to the measured values of ksat in fact the ptfs predicted ksat with values ranging between 0 002 6 3 m d 1 while the measured values ranged between 0 4 38 0 m d 1 the ptfs underestimated ksat by 83 0 99 0 consequently at both eap and hap the ksat values predicted by the ptfs was significantly less accurate than those predicted using anns these results support the findings of pringle et al 2007 who found that all regression based ptfs naturally tend to smooth the predicted values the underestimation of ksat by the selected ptfs is predominantly due to differences in soil texture the soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were dominated by fine textured classes such as loam sandy clay loam clay loam sandy clay and clay cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 ptf 2 developed by dane and puckett 1994 as compared to the other ptfs had low rmse 22 0 27 0 and 14 0 15 0 in eap and hap respectively and low mse 39 0 46 0 and 26 0 28 0 in eap and hap respectively in predicted ksat this observation agrees with the findings of minasny and mcbratney 2000a where ptf 2 gave better prediction of ksat for sandy soils compared to other ptfs in addition this is due to the soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 2 that comprised 53 0 sandy and loamy sand and 60 0 sandy loamy sand and sandy loam however it is known that ptfs are not as reliable in their predictions when applied to different soils beyond the geomorphological and pedoclimatic region or soil texture from which it was originally derived minasny and mcbratney 2000b tietje and hennings 1996 therefore it was advised by wösten 1997 nemes 2015 and van looy et al 2017 that ptfs should only be applied to the same pedoclimatic conditions from where they were developed nemes et al 2003 suggested that it is better to use a small set of relevant data to develop ptfs than to use a large and irrelevant data set for a specific area moreover the application of ptfs in estimating ksat at a specific location that contains different dominant soil textures might yield results with very limited accuracy and relevance if these structural features are disregarded lin et al 1999 vereecken et al 2010 these ptfs will therefore be of limited use for estimating water transport in a specific field and or a specific zone within a field parasuraman et al 2006 the results of the current study corroborate these findings therefore for field scale application purposes developing ptfs from a small set of relevant site specific data may turn out to be more successful than using ptfs derived from a large but more general dataset where locally specific conditions such as structural features might be missing nemes et al 2003 for the study areas eap and hap the developed anns are a more appropriate and accurate way of estimating ksat than adoption of existing ptfs 4 3 drainage design implications in endrain ksat was the only parameter that varied in each design all other parameters remained constant an underestimation of ksat by the ptfs resulted in an underestimation of the geometric mean kg by 31 0 96 0 from the measured ksat in eap and hap respectively the consequence of this was a 29 0 37 0 and 58 0 77 0 shorter predicted distance between drains in eap and hap respectively a drainage design based on these predictions will have 1 a lower than expected water level and 2 have a higher drainage density such a design will incur significant extra initial cost as well as increased maintenance costs compared to a design based on measured data however the drainage designs based on anns predictions gave drain spacing s and water table depth equivalent to the target water table depth meaning the initial cost and subsequent maintenance costs would be almost equivalent to that based on measured data for eap this variation ranged between 4 4 1 3 and in hap between 14 4 17 3 respectively this makes the use of anns to design drainage systems significantly more economical than the ptfs consequently the anns developed in this study have considerable potential to reduce the cost of the design and maintenance of drainage systems as compared to the adoption of ptfs and are a less time consuming alternative to traditional soil sampling and analyses for a specific area therefore so long as the increase in installation cost in eap and hap is less than the saving made in the sampling and analytical programmes adoption of ann1 4 is cost effective in addition ann development indicates that if site specific anns are to be developed the number of soil samples required to create an accurate ann can be substantially reduced finally the results in table 8 show that the ksat derived from anns can be applied to the design of a drainage system that would maintain the water table depths at equivalent depths to directly measured data differences from the target designs ranged between 1 0 6 0 in eap and hap providing those models are developed using datasets that meet at least the minimum quantity and quality requirements in contrast designs based on ptfs predictions would result in a water table depth that differed from the target design in eap the difference from the target value ranged between 27 0 30 0 and in hap ranged between 34 0 41 0 5 conclusions anns as an indirect method of predicting ksat have been applied by several researchers agyare et al 2007 more and deka 2018 schaap et al 2001 sedaghat et al 2016 as a rapid and reliable method it shows good potential but its accuracy is dependent on the quality and quantity of the dataset used to develop the ann in this research anns were applied to predict ksat in designated data poor areas of two case study drainage schemes located in the south of libya it was possible to demonstrate that anns developed using easily measured existing and under utilised data such as the of sand silt and clay bulk density field capacity and wilting point were able to provide highly accurate predictions of ksat it was also shown that ksat predictions based on anns were significantly more comparable to measured ksat results than those predicted using widely adopted ptfs only ksat predicted from anns could be used to accurately calculate both the target drain spacing as well as water table depth in a drainage scheme designed using endrain therefore assuming sampling cost is not considered initial drainage design costs based on length and depth of inserted pipe would be comparable between designs based on ann predictions and those based on measured ksat these results also suggest that anns can be successfully developed using existing and under utilised datasets as ksat is time consuming to measure basing drainage designs on ann predictions generated from a minimum dataset will be more cost effective and therefore more accessible to farmers planners and decision makers in least developed countries however further research is needed to evaluate the impact of these designs on crop production salinity control and waterlogging using a simulation model such as drainmod as well as calculating the predicted income based on these designs for different cropping systems credit authorship contribution statement murad ellafi writing original draft conceptualization

8245,study region the study data draws on the drainage design for hammam agricultural project hap and eshkeda agricultural project eap located in the south of libya north of the sahara desert the results of this study are applicable to other arid areas study focus this study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data poor areas artificial neural networks anns were developed to estimate ksat and compared with empirical regression type pedotransfer function ptf equations subsequently the anns and ptfs estimated ksat values were used in endrain software to design subsurface drainage systems which were evaluated against designs using measured ksat values new hydrological insights results showed that anns more accurately predicted ksat than ptfs drainage design based on ptfs predictions 1 result in a deeper water level and 2 higher drainage density increasing costs drainage designs based on anns predictions gave drain spacing and water table depth equivalent to those predicted using measured data the results of this study indicate that anns can be developed using existing and under utilised data sets and applied successfully to data poor areas as ksat is time consuming to measure basing drainage designs on ann predictions generated from alternative datasets will reduce the overall cost

drainage design pedotransfer functions sub surface drainage arid areas 1 introduction in the earth s terrestrial biosphere soil plays an essential role in managing the mass and energy transferred between the earth and the atmosphere amundson et al 2015 bittelli et al 2015 upper soil horizons have hydraulic properties governed by pore size distribution water retention and hydraulic conductivity that regulate the local water balance through infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge zhang and schaap 2019 these soil properties have a fundamental effect on local regional and global land surface water and energy balances montzka et al 2017 vereecken et al 2016 verhoef and egea 2014 for example approximately 60 of rainfall is returned to the atmosphere through the soil plant atmosphere continuum katul et al 2012 oki and kanae 2006 and 50 of the global biomass production and related carbon cycle depend on soil processes cleveland et al 2013 water for agriculture is often unregulated and overexploited in spite of this the general belief is that by 2025 irrigated lands have to be extended by 20 30 in order to meet global food demands fao 2002 however the world s arable lands are degrading due to soil salinization desertification erosion and urbanisation fao 2002 in arid and semiarid areas water use efficiency is a major issue due to increasing cross sector demand for limited water resources elshemy 2018 therefore understanding soil hydrological behaviour is essential in the global drive to expand crop production abdelbaki et al 2009 for example drainage systems in arid and semiarid areas have been designed and installed to manage and control soil waterlogging and salinity problems in irrigation schemes however less than 30 of all irrigated land needing drainage have been effectively drained schultz et al 2007 and the situation is worse in least developed countries oecd 2020 according to smedema et al 2000 the proportion of agricultural land drained in developing countries is 5 10 as compared to 25 30 in developed countries this is primarily due to a fundamental lack of data on key soil attributes needed as inputs to design drainage systems ayars and evans 2015 this paucity of data is often driven by the cost of sample collection and laboratory analysis and or a lack of adequate laboratory resources historically in many countries soil data have been routinely gathered through soil surveys yet such soil data rarely includes saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat an essential parameter in drainage system design patil and singh 2016 accurate quantification of ksat is essential for multiple aspects of agrohydrology zhang and schaap 2019 saturated hydraulic conductivity is used to quantify water movement through a unit cross section of soil per unit time aimrun et al 2004 and is used to design subsurface drainage systems irrigation practices and for modelling agricultural and hydrological processes such as water movement and solute transport in the soil abdelbaki et al 2009 saturated hydraulic conductivity is also used in subsurface drainage models to determine drain spacing at specific drain depth bicknell et al 2005 chung et al 1992 ma et al 2012 skaggs 1978 van dam et al 1997 thus the accurate determination of ksat is important as it influences the technical and economic feasibility of large scale agricultural drainage projects saturated hydraulic conductivity can be estimated using either in situ methods such as the guelph permeameter above water table method reynolds and elrick 1985 and the auger hole method below water table method van beers 1958 or laboratory based methods such as the constant head and falling head permeameters klute and dirksen 1986 however ksat is highly spatially variable over a range of scales e g plot field and catchment hassler et al 2014 therefore a large number of soil samples and measurements are required to accurately describe the hydraulic properties of an area of interest sobieraj et al 2004 these measurements often are difficult time consuming and expensive fooladmand 2011 patil and singh 2016 in addition due to time and financial constraints researchers planners and decision makers in many countries especially in least developed countries are faced with inadequate data to work with ksat values are simply unavailable patil et al 2011 2010 consequently multiple researchers have focused on developing indirect methods for estimating ksat such as utilising pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate ksat from more readily available soil measurement information e g soil texture and bulk density arrington et al 2013 dashtaki et al 2010 khodaverdiloo et al 2011 ptfs were first represented by empirical regression equations relating water and solute transport parameters to the fundamental soil properties that are accessible in soil survey databases cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 for example ahuja et al 1986 developed an empirical equation to estimate ksat from the effective porosity only while li et al 2007 developed a ptf to estimate ksat that required percentage sand silt and clay bulk density bd and soil organic matter however wösten et al 2001 stated that future developments in ptfs would be derived from more accurate data mining tools such as artificial neural networks anns and group methods of data mining techniques such as k nearest neighbour and support vector machine svm k nearest neighbour have been applied to predict precipitation huang et al 2017 groundwater depth kombo et al 2020 and crop yield jothi et al 2020 whereas svm has also been applied to predict groundwater depth mallikarjuna et al 2020 and the discharge coefficient of rectangular side weirs located on trapezoidal channels azimi et al 2019 anns have been successfully applied to predict water table depth and groundwater salinity at different drain depths and spacing nozari and azadi 2017 estimate soil salinity bouksila et al 2010 and to predict evapotranspiration from limited meteorological data zanetti et al 2007 anns have also been applied to predict sediment transport without sedimentation by combining anns with the particle swarm optimization pso imperialist competitive algorithm ica genetic algorithm ga and decision tree dt methods ebtehaj et al 2020 2018 artificial neural networks have been shown to be more flexible and able to deal with multiple sources of input data as compared to ptf based regression equations wösten et al 2001 in the last two decades anns have been utilised as a special class of ptfs using feed forward or radial basis functions to approximate any continuous nonlinear function sobieraj et al 2004 detailed statistical and functional reports have been carried out to compare the performance between ann based ptfs and regression type ptfs to predict ksat on different datasets such as soil texture and bd agyare et al 2007 arshad et al 2013 parasuraman et al 2006 several authors have demonstrated that anns outperform regression techniques especially when uncertainties in the quality of the data are small baker and ellison 2008 merdun et al 2006 minasny and mcbratney 2002 therefore anns have the potential to be a more accurate approach to estimating ksat as compared to more conventional ptf regression equations this study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat in order to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data poor areas utilising existing and currently under utilised datasets it is envisaged that this will reduce the overall cost of drainage system design making them more accessible to farmers planners and decision makers in least developed countries the objectives of this study were to 1 develop anns to estimate ksat 2 compare the performance of applying anns as compare to regression type ptf equations for the estimation of ksat and 3 evaluate the performance of drainage systems based on these two contrasting methods of estimating ksat 2 material and methods 2 1 case study data sets were generated for two established agricultural projects in libya hammam agricultural project hap and eshkeda agricultural project eap using seven years 1974 1981 of archived and under utilised data from the general authority of water resources in libya both study areas are located in the southern part of libya north of the sahara desert both study areas are considered to be in the hyper arid zone fao 1989 with annual rainfall rarely exceeding 100 mm there are no perennial rivers in the area of interest consequently the only water source is paleo groundwater from two aquifers the mezda and murzuq aquifers are the source of irrigation for hap and eap respectively tantawi 2000 the hap is located in the north east part of sokna oasis 29 04 01 n 15 47 05 e at an elevation of circa 270 m above sea level asl the hap covers 1200 ha and is divided into 182 farms 6 8 ha for each farm the work on the project began in 1971 and the reclamation was completed in 1985 the hap project has a drainage system designed in the 1970s the soil texture in the hap is highly variable with eight soil texture classes table 1 according to the usda textural classification the hap dataset can be classified as sand 22 3 loamy sand 18 3 sandy loam 31 4 loam 0 6 sandy clay loam 21 0 clay loam 4 2 sandy clay 1 8 and clay 0 4 soil survey division staff 1993 see table 1 for more details the other project eap is located north of sabha city 27 32 45 n 14 16 7 e at an elevation of 320 m asl the project was initiated in 1975 and it became operational in the second half of 1976 with a drainage system being designed between 1979 1981 the eap covers 3000 ha and is divided into three subareas western area 2000 ha central area 600 ha and eastern area 370 ha in accordance with the installed irrigation wells the area comprises 25 districts each with 12 farms of circa 10 ha each the farms are sub divided into two farmed plots each 180 m by 234 m in size windbreaks have been planted between the farm plots and around the individual farms the eap dataset is associated with four soil texture classes dominated by sand 88 4 with 8 0 3 4 and 0 2 of the set represented by loamy sand sandy loam and loam respectively table 1 2 2 dataset description the data collected from the two project sites included particle size distribution sand s silt si and clay c bulk density bd g cm 3 wilting point wp field capacity fc and ksat m d 1 summarised in table 1 soil texture was measured using the hydrometer method following bouyoucos 1927 the soil bd was measured following the methods described by buckman and brady 1960 field capacity and wilting point were determined by tensiometers using the method reviewed by richards 1949 in the eap ksat was measured in the field using the average of four replications of the auger hole method van beers 1958 in the hap ksat was measured in the laboratory using undisturbed samples following the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 in total for the hap there were 770 ksat measurements c 1 measurement for every 2 ha while for the eap there were 442 ksat measurements c 1 measurement for every 5 ha to facilitate ann development and validation in both eap and hap an area was randomly selected and designated as a data poor area for which ksat measurements were assumed to be absent in the eap a 600 ha area in the central section of the scheme 5 0 km x 1 2 km was selected as the data poor area whilst in the hap a 500 ha area in the western section of the scheme 1 43 km x 3 5 km was selected the total number of ksat measurement points in these designated data poor areas were 82 and 158 in eap and hap respectively which represent 20 of the dataset for each site the remaining areas of eap and hap were assumed to be data rich areas the data from data rich areas was used to develop the anns to predict the ksat in the designated data poor areas data from the data rich areas of each scheme were assigned into two groups based on the input requirements for the development of anns the first group had limited parameters that included s si c and bd as independent variables and ksat as the dependent variable the second group included the parameters in the first group as well as wp and fc a statistical summary of the dataset used in this study is given in table 1 2 3 anns model development artificial neural networks are a mathematical approach used to characterise synthetic neurons to solve complex problems in a similar way to that of the human brain agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 since the 1940s there has been growing interest in the study of neurological mechanisms and structures that interest has led to the development of new computational models linking systems or anns based on biological processes that have been used to solve complex problems such as pattern recognition and rapid information processing and adaptation huang 2009 anns use machine learning based on the principle of self adjusting internal control parameters and can be used to recognise complex non linear relationships between input and output datasets ayoubi et al 2011 anns are typically formed of three processing layers namely an input hidden and output layer fig 1 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 more 2018 the input layer consists of the selected independent variables each variable in the input layer is connected to the hidden layer through a weighting algorithm bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 in some cases the weights given to each independent variable are generated randomly in other cases they are fine tuned and trained through a process called backpropagation bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 backpropagation quantifies the error at the output by comparing the currently derived outputs to the expected ones and modify the weights to reduce the error bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 the layer located between the input and the output layers is called the hidden layer the hidden layer may consist of more than one layer with each layer containing a number of units a grouping of independent variables these units known also as neurons are used to guide the processing of the data contained in the input layer and to generate computational connections between the input and the output layer there is no specific formula to decide the number of units to be included in the hidden layer it is generally problem dependent with the error tested by varying the number of units and layers in order to determine the appropriate number of units layers to be used bell 2015 the hidden layer is represented by a group of activation functions including linear functions logistic functions and hyperbolic functions logistic and hyperbolic functions are mainly used in classification problems because they range between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 1 while the linear functions infinity to infinity are mainly used in regression problems ghatak 2019 the output layer consists of a series of inverse functions which are used to refine the training and calculate the difference between the output predictions and the measured ksat and to minimise error one of the most widely used algorithms for this purpose is the backpropagation algorithm bell 2015 backpropagation was applied to develop the anns in this study for the development of anns to predict ksat in the designated data poor areas within eap and hap several processing steps were undertaken the first step was to define a training dataset in order to develop the anns the training dataset was based on 80 of the data from the data rich areas of the eap and hap leaving 20 of the data as the pseudo data poor area for testing purposes against the actual measured ksat data from both sites the second step was to define the appropriate network number of layers and number of neurons in each layer a sequential orthogonal approach sun 2012 was adopted to determine the optimum number of neurons this approach adds a neuron to the hidden layer until the ann with the smallest error is identified sun 2012 the ann with the smallest error in predicting ksat within the data rich area was subsequently applied to the data poor area using data from eap and hap that had not been used in the development of the model to validate and test the performance of ann by comparing the ann predicted ksat values with measured ksat values table 2 shows the input parameters used to develop six ann models to predict ksat all anns were developed for both hap and eap using two groups of input parameters the first group of input parameters included sand silt clay bulk density wilting point and field capacity were applied in ann1 ann3 and ann5 ann1 and ann3 used data only from eap and hap respectively and ann5 used the combined data set from both eap and hap the second group of input parameters included sand silt clay and bulk density were applied in ann2 ann4 and ann6 ann2 and ann4 used data only from eap and hap respectively and ann6 used the combined data set from both eap and hap the reason for having two groups of input parameters is to assess the minimum data set required to predict ksat accurately the critical evaluation of the ability of the six ann models developed in this study to accurately predict ksat was undertaken in five steps step 1 used the training data data rich area for site specific ann model training and the data from the designated data poor areas as testing datasets the best performing ann model in terms of predicting ksat in the designated data poor areas was selected by applying three statistical parameters these were 1 coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and predicted ksat values for the data poor areas e g best performance is equal to 1 2 mean square error mse and 3 root mean square error rmse patil and singh 2016 zhang and schaap 2019 which can respectively be defined mathematically as 1 r 2 1 i 1 n p i m i 2 i 1 n m i m i 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i m i 2 3 r m s e i 1 n p i m i 2 n where n represents the number of soil samples m i is the measured ksat p i is the predicted ksat and m i is the mean measured ksat mse and rmse were used to give a quantitative indication of ann model error in units of ksat the best performance value is zero step 2 tested the four site specific ann models table 2 on data rich areas only using a k fold cross validation technique bell 2015 ghatak 2019 there are other cross validation techniques such as 1 validation set approach where the data is divided randomly into two sets one set to train the model and the other set to test the model 2 leave one out cross validation where one sub set of the data point is left out the model is built on the remaining data and the model is tested using the left out data sub set bell 2015 chollet and allaire 2017 ghatak 2019 in this study the k fold cross validation method was applied in the k fold cross validation technique the training data data from the pre defined data rich areas in both sites were divided into ten randomly generated sub sets for eap and hap this resulted in ten randomly generated sub sets of 36 and 61 data points respectively during each k fold cross validation nine sub sets were combined and used as the training sub set and one part used as the testing sub set this process was repeated ten times rotating out a testing sub set each time so that each sub set used in each ann was applied in the testing for both eap and hap this k fold cross validation process was also repeated removing 10 data points from the dataset each time until only 10 data points remained this approach was used to quantify the performance ability to accurately predict ksat of each of the four site specific ann models table 2 against the size of the training set used chollet and allaire 2017 this technique was used to quantify the ability of the anns to predict ksat as the size of training set was reduced randomly and to also determine the minimum training set required to develop the ann step 3 of performance testing compared the outputs of the anns against outputs generated from traditional widely adopted empirical equations used to predict ksat abdelbaki et al 2009 minasny and mcbratney 2000a table 3 step 4 evaluated the performance of each developed anns to predict ksat in the other site non site specific for example ann1 and ann2 were developed and tested in eap and were applied to predict ksat in hap and ann3 and ann4 were developed and tested in hap and were applied to predict ksat in eap this step was added to evaluate the applicability of applying anns developed in specific locations to predict ksat in new locations in libya in this example the separation distance between ann development and application was 225 km i e the separation distance between eap and hap step 5 developed anns by combining the training datasets from the pre defined data rich areas of both eap and hap to predict ksat in the pre defined data poor areas in eap and hap this step was applied to evaluate the accuracy of anns based on larger combined datasets from multiple sites compared to smaller but site specific data sets to predict ksat 2 4 application of anns to drainage design drainage systems can be designed as either surface subsurface or a combination of both surface and subsurface depending on the prevailing conditions in the area and crops grown luthin 1978 this study focused on subsurface drainage which is used in both eap and hap the determination of appropriate spacing and depth of drains are the main parameters in the design of subsurface drainage systems that need to be considered luthin 1978 a number of drainage theories and associated equations for designing subsurface drainage systems have been developed dagan 1965 dumm 1960 1954 hooghoudt 1940 1937 kirkham 1958 luthin and worstell 1959 van schilfgaarde 1963 these equations were developed to relate the spacing and depth of drains to water table depth and drawdown rates methods have been developed to design drainage systems under steady or non steady state see reviews by van der ploeg et al 1999 and youngs 1999 endrain drainage computer program released by prof oosterbaan in the netherlands was applied to design drainage systems in the designated data poor areas of both eap and hap using ksat derived from the anns developed in this study table 2 as compared to widely adopted ptfs table 3 and the actual measured ksat for these data poor areas endrain uses eq 4 described by hooghoudt 1937 cited in ritzema 1994 to calculate the distance between drains and the depth of the water table at the midpoint between two drains oosterbaan 1993 4 l 2 8 k b d h 4 k a h 2 q where l is drain spacing m q is the steady state drainage discharge rate m d 1 ka is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil above drain level m d 1 kb is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil below drain level m d 1 h is the height of water table above the water level in the drain m d is the equivalent depth which is a function of the spacing l the depth in m of impervious layer below the drain di dd in fig 2 and the radius r of the drain m values for d can be found in tables presented by hooghoudt 1940 van der molen and wesseling 1991 developed this further to calculate series solutions for multiple equivalent depths endrain requires two values of ksat one from above the drain level and one from below the drain level therefore a representative ksat was required as an input to endrain according to luthin 1978 the geometric mean kg gives the best representative ksat for a study area therefore representative kg values for eap and hap were generated for input to endrain eq 5 illustrates how the geometric mean was calculated and table 4 shows the different calculations of kg based on the project area and the source of ksat e g ksat derived from anns 5 k g k s a t 1 k s a t 2 k s a t 3 k s a t n n where the geometric mean kg is found by multiplying the values of ksa ksat1 is the ksat value for sample 1 ksat2 is ksat value of sample 2 and so on to n number of values and then the nth root of the product of those values is then found nth root is equal to the number of values water table depth based on ann and ptf generated kg values table 4 was compared with water table depth based on kg values generated from measured ksat kg1 and kg 8 in table 4 the value of r used in endrain was the average water requirement for date palm phoenix dactylifer and alfalfa medicago sativa date palm was chosen because it is considered to be the most profitable crop for the south of libya elmeer et al 2016 alfalfa was adopted as it is grown as a fodder for livestock in both eap and hap the average water requirements for date palm is 0 02 m d 1 in eap and 0 007 m d 1 in hap and for alfalfa are 0 01 m d 1 for eap and 0 006 m d 1 for hap these values were taken from an unpublished report based on work undertaken by the libyan government in 1999 general water authority 1999 site investigations of soil properties were undertaken at both sites between 1974 1980 in hap by danenco 1980 and holzmann wakuti 1974 and between 1976 1981 in eap by italconsult 1976 and cornelius brochier 1981 to design agricultural projects including drainage systems in these areas the following data were taken from these reports the average depth of the impermeable layer for both eap and hap was assumed to be 1 5 m two soil layers were assumed with two different ksat values with depth and the depth of water table was set at 0 5 m the vertical ksat and the horizontal ksat were assumed to be equal hess et al 1992 table 5 shows the input parameters applied in endrain fig 2 is a schematic representation of a subsurface drainage system and provides an explanation of the input parameters used in table 5 and eq 4 finally an economic analysis was conducted to calculate the initial cost of installing each drainage system in the designated data poor areas using the measured kg as well as anns and ptfs generated kg values the cost of drains installed was assumed to be 2 62 m according to skaggs 2007 2 5 software used the data was analysed using several software packages the development of the anns utilised a neuralnet package in r stefan and guenther 2019 pedotransfer function equations table 3 used to predict ksat and the representative ksat kg were calculated in microsoft excel 2016 finally subsurface drain spacing and depth of water table were calculated using endrain oosterbaan 1993 3 results 3 1 performance of site specific anns and cross validation the structure of each of the site specific ann models developed in this study and their step 1 performance evaluation are presented in table 6 all anns were able to predict based on r2 between 0 89 0 96 of the variability in ksat in the designated data poor areas of eap and hap as expected the ann models performed better when using the training data than when the testing data was used in hap the r2 was slightly better in the testing section r2 0 96 and 0 95 than in the training section r2 0 94 and 0 93 table 6 generally the anns developed in this study showed that there was little difference in performance between the anns as r2 ranged from 0 89 0 90 in eap and 0 95 96 in hap according to the performance results in table 6 models ann1 and ann3 performed better than both ann2 and ann4 even though the number of data points in the anns developed for eap for training and testing were almost half the number used in the anns developed for hap 360 in eap and 610 in hap the rmse and mse values for the eap anns indicate that they are more accurate the results of the step 2 k fold cross validation are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows the median rmse across the ten randomly generated sub sets dark line inside the boxplot when the size of training set is fixed to the maximum size 360 in eap and 610 in hap in fig 3a it can be noted that the median rmse for ann1 ann2 ann3 and ann4 were 1 65 0 40 1 80 and 1 40 m d 1 respectively also the minimum and maximum rmse ranged between 1 37 1 84 0 10 1 40 1 30 8 10 and 0 30 2 70 m d 1 in ann1 ann2 ann3 and ann4 respectively these results showed that the developed anns for both eap and hap were in the range of the 10 fold cross validation therefore the training dataset from the data rich areas was effectively used to develop anns able to predict ksat fig 3b indicates how rmse varies with the size of training dataset as indicated by the low median rmse values the best performing anns were developed when the full dataset was used in the training phase fig 3b however for both eap and hap even if the training set was reduced to 50 the anns were still able to accurately predict ksat fig 3b 3 2 performance of ptfs and non site specific anns four ptfs that are widely adopted to predict ksat were applied to predict ksat in the designated data poor areas of eap and hap table 3 in relation to rmse and mse ptf 2 developed by dane and puckett 1994 performed better than the other ptfs in both eap and hap table 7 however it is critical to note that all the ptfs were between 2 5 times less accurate at predicting ksat than the site specific anns for example the rmse values of ptf 2 were 4 19 and 12 72 m d 1 for eap and hap respectively in contrast the rmse for all the site specific anns applied to eap and hap ranged from 1 92 to 2 82 m d 1 further the mse for the ptfs applied in eap and hap ranged from 17 60 225 00 m d 1 in contrast the mse for the site specific anns applied in eap and hap ranged from 3 69 to 7 97 m d 1 for the combined anns ann5 and ann6 the accuracy was better than the ptfs but slightly less 3 times less accurate than the site specific anns for example ann5 in rmse was 2 11 m d 1 while in ann1 was 1 92 m d 1 while ann6 was 6 09 m d 1 in predicting ksat in eap finally for the non site specific anns the accuracy was less than all other anns and ptfs with the highest rmse and mse values of 15 88 and 252 23 m d 1 respectively in ann4 for predicted ksat in eap figs 4 and 5 show the accuracy of the ptfs specific and non site specific anns in predicting ksat within the data poor areas of eap and hap the 1 1 line represents the line of perfect agreement between the predicted and the measured values of ksat it is of note that the predicted ksat of the site specific anns all closely comply with the 1 1 line the results indicate that the site specific anns were significantly better at predicting the observed ksat values compared to those predicted by the ptfs and non site specific anns applied to eap and hap for example for the highest eap observed ksat value in eap of 21 90 m d 1 ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 predicted ksat values of 2 10 4 70 2 20 and 2 00 m d 1 respectively this is an underprediction of one order of magnitude in contrast for the same sample 21 90 m d 1 ann1 and ann2 predicted values of 22 40 and 24 50 m d 1 respectively while ann3 and ann4 developed to predict ksat in hap overpredict ksat in eap with the highest value of prediction 42 20 and 29 80 m d 1 respectively furthermore in eap the measured ksat ranged between 0 60 to 21 90 m d 1 whereas the prediction values of ksat for all ptfs ranged from 1 20 to 6 30 m d 1 in contrast the non site specific ksat ranged between 7 00 to 42 20 m d 1 while in eap the predicted ksat values for the site specific anns ranged from 0 60 to 25 30 m d 1 a similar pattern was observed in the hap fig 5 where the measured ksat ranged between 0 40 to 38 00 m d 1 whereas the prediction values for all ptfs ranged between 0 03 to 6 30 m d 1 and for non site specific anns ranged between 0 01 to 3 50 m d 1 in contrast the site specific anns predicted ksat in hap ranged in value between 0 20 to 27 70 m d 1 however the site specific anns used to predict ksat in hap were unable to accurately predict ksat when the measured ksat was 30 00 m d 1 these anns underestimate the ksat values 30 00 m d 1 by 10 30 however only 6 samples out of 158 had a ksat value of 30 00 m d 1 it can be noted that the ptfs tend to under predict the ksat values when the observed measurements exceed 6 00 m d 1 and 2 00 m d 1 in eap and hap respectively additionally it is of note that ann1 fig 4 and ann3 fig 5 show slightly better compliance with the 1 1 line in comparison to ann2 fig 4 and ann4 fig 5 also ann5 and ann6 showed a comparable prediction to the ones obtained by the site specific anns where ksat values ranged between 0 70 to 23 20 m d 1 in eap and 0 50 to 30 80 m d 1 in hap however ann6 was slightly less accurate in predicting ksat especially the observed values of 15 m d 1 3 3 drain spacing and water table depths eq 5 was used to estimate the kg for the different scenarios presented in table 4 the results of which are given in table 8 estimation of kg was made above adl and below bdl the drain level these estimated values of kg were applied in endrain to predict the drain spacing and water table depths for the designated data poor areas of eap and hap measured ksat values used to calculate kg eap kg1 and hap kg8 resulted in a drain spacing between two drains of 24 7 m date palm and 34 9 m alfalfa and 56 0 m date palm and 60 5 m alfalfa for eap and hap respectively in general kg derived from the four anns ksat predictions had the lowest variation in distance between drains compared to the target value based on measured data kg1 and kg8 for eap the variation in drain spacing from the target for ann1 and ann2 was for date palm 1 1 and 4 6 respectively in contrast for the ptfs kg 4 7 variation in drain spacing from the measured data ranged from 28 6 to 36 8 table 8 for hap the variation in drain spacing from the measured data for ann3 and ann4 was 16 0 and 17 2 respectively in contrast for the ptfs kg 11 14 variation in drain spacing from the measured data ranged from 58 2 to 77 2 the target depth of water table for eap and hap was 50 cm from the soil surface as obtained by kg1 and kg8 generally the variation of water depth based on kg derived from the four anns were closer to the target water table depth with variation ranging between 2 0 6 0 and 0 6 2 0 in eap and hap respectively in contrast the variations in water depth for the ptfs compared to the target design ranged from 27 0 to 31 0 in kg 4 7 and 34 0 41 0 in kg 11 14 the estimation of the initial cost of installing a drainage system in the designated data poor areas of eap 600 ha and hap 500 ha using measured kg1 and kg8 table 8 was us 638 000 and us 450 000 in eaf and us 238 000 and us 220 000 in hap for date palm and alfalfa respectively the results show that for both eap and hap installing drainage schemes based on ksat derived from anns is more economical than designs using ksat derived from ptfs in eap kg2 derived from ann2 resulted in only a 1 1 and 1 3 increase compared to measured data in initial installation costs for date palm and alfalfa respectively table 8 in contrast kg3 derived from ann3 resulted in a 4 4 and 4 3 decrease in initial installation costs compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in hap kg9 and kg10 derived from ann3 and ann4 result in a 15 5 19 3 and 16 8 20 9 increase in initial installation costs compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in contrast kg11 14 derived from ptfs 1 4 result in substantial 234 0 431 0 and 233 0 433 0 increases in initial installation cost compared to measured data for date palm and alfalfa respectively in comparison to the initial drainage costs calculated based on measured data the extra initial cost of designing drainage systems in eap and hap using kg2 kg3 kg9 and kg10 ranges between 6 000 to 46 000 in contrast the extra initial cost of designing drainage systems in eap and hap using kg values derived from ptfs is an order of magnitude higher ranging from 182 000 to 790 000 4 discussion 4 1 development of anns all site specific anns developed in this study were able to accurately predict ksat see figs 4 and 5 in this study to predict ksat values of soils in designated data poor areas of eap and hap anns were developed using selected key input variables the input parameters for models ann2 and ann4 s si and c and bd do not describe the structure or connectivity of void spaces in soil therefore they do not explain the connections between soil structures and functions very well nemes et al 2003 pachepsky et al 2006 anderson and bouma 1973 found that an excellent prediction as close as possible to the observed values of ksat can be obtained when pore space is measured directly therefore the anns that also include fc and wp ann1 and ann3 increased the accuracy of prediction of ksat in comparison to ann2 and ann4 see figs 4 and 5 the k fold cross validation was undertaken to estimate the test error rate within the training dataset in order to confirm the confidence of applying the developed ann to the designated data poor areas the results presented in fig 3b show that for areas with similar soil characteristics to eap and hap the number of ksat measurements required to generate an accurate ann can be reduced to circa 50 taking into account the total area of each scheme ranging between 1000 3000 ha these results support the findings of yang 1995 where the quality of an anns training dataset is more important than the quantity of values used this can be seen in misprediction of ksat values of 30 0 m d 1 or above in ann3 and ann4 when the highest measured ksat value used to develop these anns was 28 0 m d 1 in addition yang 1995 added that if the model was trained with a full range of expected situations then it would require fewer input values to develop the training dataset which means having all the expected values of the dependent variable within the training dataset for example in this study ksat was the dependent variable needed to be predicted for a specific location data poor area by having all ranges of ksat within the training dataset the developed ann will be more accurate generally the non site specific anns failed to accurately predict ksat in eap and hap in eap ann3 and ann4 over predict ksat especially the measured values between 0 6 to 10 0 m d 1 whereas in hap ann1 and ann2 under predict ksat these results show that an ann developed in a specific location may not be transferrable to another location even within the same pedoclimatic region however the combined anns ann5 and ann6 illustrate that soil datasets based on more than one location are able to accurately predict ksat 4 2 ptfs performance the ptfs applied in this study failed to accurately predict ksat values especially for values 10 0 m d 1 which represent 15 0 and 54 0 of the designated data poor areas in eap and hap respectively this is due to the ptfs evaluated being developed trained and tested for very different soils for example the dataset sources used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 and ptf 4 were us soils while the dataset source used to develop ptf 3 was from spain cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 critically the soil texture classes used to develop the ptfs were different to the dominant soil textures in eap and hap for example the percentage of the dataset associated with sand and loamy sand in eap was 96 4 table 1 while the percentage of these soil textures in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were 14 0 53 0 1 1 and 3 0 respectively similarly the combined percentage of sand loamy sand and sandy loam soils in hap was 72 0 in contrast the combined percentage of these soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were respectively 38 0 60 0 7 0 and 11 6 consequently the ksat values predicted using the ptfs were poorly correlated to the measured values of ksat in fact the ptfs predicted ksat with values ranging between 0 002 6 3 m d 1 while the measured values ranged between 0 4 38 0 m d 1 the ptfs underestimated ksat by 83 0 99 0 consequently at both eap and hap the ksat values predicted by the ptfs was significantly less accurate than those predicted using anns these results support the findings of pringle et al 2007 who found that all regression based ptfs naturally tend to smooth the predicted values the underestimation of ksat by the selected ptfs is predominantly due to differences in soil texture the soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 1 ptf 2 ptf 3 and ptf 4 were dominated by fine textured classes such as loam sandy clay loam clay loam sandy clay and clay cosby et al 1984 dane and puckett 1994 julia et al 2004 puckett et al 1985 ptf 2 developed by dane and puckett 1994 as compared to the other ptfs had low rmse 22 0 27 0 and 14 0 15 0 in eap and hap respectively and low mse 39 0 46 0 and 26 0 28 0 in eap and hap respectively in predicted ksat this observation agrees with the findings of minasny and mcbratney 2000a where ptf 2 gave better prediction of ksat for sandy soils compared to other ptfs in addition this is due to the soil texture classes in the dataset used to develop ptf 2 that comprised 53 0 sandy and loamy sand and 60 0 sandy loamy sand and sandy loam however it is known that ptfs are not as reliable in their predictions when applied to different soils beyond the geomorphological and pedoclimatic region or soil texture from which it was originally derived minasny and mcbratney 2000b tietje and hennings 1996 therefore it was advised by wösten 1997 nemes 2015 and van looy et al 2017 that ptfs should only be applied to the same pedoclimatic conditions from where they were developed nemes et al 2003 suggested that it is better to use a small set of relevant data to develop ptfs than to use a large and irrelevant data set for a specific area moreover the application of ptfs in estimating ksat at a specific location that contains different dominant soil textures might yield results with very limited accuracy and relevance if these structural features are disregarded lin et al 1999 vereecken et al 2010 these ptfs will therefore be of limited use for estimating water transport in a specific field and or a specific zone within a field parasuraman et al 2006 the results of the current study corroborate these findings therefore for field scale application purposes developing ptfs from a small set of relevant site specific data may turn out to be more successful than using ptfs derived from a large but more general dataset where locally specific conditions such as structural features might be missing nemes et al 2003 for the study areas eap and hap the developed anns are a more appropriate and accurate way of estimating ksat than adoption of existing ptfs 4 3 drainage design implications in endrain ksat was the only parameter that varied in each design all other parameters remained constant an underestimation of ksat by the ptfs resulted in an underestimation of the geometric mean kg by 31 0 96 0 from the measured ksat in eap and hap respectively the consequence of this was a 29 0 37 0 and 58 0 77 0 shorter predicted distance between drains in eap and hap respectively a drainage design based on these predictions will have 1 a lower than expected water level and 2 have a higher drainage density such a design will incur significant extra initial cost as well as increased maintenance costs compared to a design based on measured data however the drainage designs based on anns predictions gave drain spacing s and water table depth equivalent to the target water table depth meaning the initial cost and subsequent maintenance costs would be almost equivalent to that based on measured data for eap this variation ranged between 4 4 1 3 and in hap between 14 4 17 3 respectively this makes the use of anns to design drainage systems significantly more economical than the ptfs consequently the anns developed in this study have considerable potential to reduce the cost of the design and maintenance of drainage systems as compared to the adoption of ptfs and are a less time consuming alternative to traditional soil sampling and analyses for a specific area therefore so long as the increase in installation cost in eap and hap is less than the saving made in the sampling and analytical programmes adoption of ann1 4 is cost effective in addition ann development indicates that if site specific anns are to be developed the number of soil samples required to create an accurate ann can be substantially reduced finally the results in table 8 show that the ksat derived from anns can be applied to the design of a drainage system that would maintain the water table depths at equivalent depths to directly measured data differences from the target designs ranged between 1 0 6 0 in eap and hap providing those models are developed using datasets that meet at least the minimum quantity and quality requirements in contrast designs based on ptfs predictions would result in a water table depth that differed from the target design in eap the difference from the target value ranged between 27 0 30 0 and in hap ranged between 34 0 41 0 5 conclusions anns as an indirect method of predicting ksat have been applied by several researchers agyare et al 2007 more and deka 2018 schaap et al 2001 sedaghat et al 2016 as a rapid and reliable method it shows good potential but its accuracy is dependent on the quality and quantity of the dataset used to develop the ann in this research anns were applied to predict ksat in designated data poor areas of two case study drainage schemes located in the south of libya it was possible to demonstrate that anns developed using easily measured existing and under utilised data such as the of sand silt and clay bulk density field capacity and wilting point were able to provide highly accurate predictions of ksat it was also shown that ksat predictions based on anns were significantly more comparable to measured ksat results than those predicted using widely adopted ptfs only ksat predicted from anns could be used to accurately calculate both the target drain spacing as well as water table depth in a drainage scheme designed using endrain therefore assuming sampling cost is not considered initial drainage design costs based on length and depth of inserted pipe would be comparable between designs based on ann predictions and those based on measured ksat these results also suggest that anns can be successfully developed using existing and under utilised datasets as ksat is time consuming to measure basing drainage designs on ann predictions generated from a minimum dataset will be more cost effective and therefore more accessible to farmers planners and decision makers in least developed countries however further research is needed to evaluate the impact of these designs on crop production salinity control and waterlogging using a simulation model such as drainmod as well as calculating the predicted income based on these designs for different cropping systems credit authorship contribution statement murad ellafi writing original draft conceptualization

water storage available for human consumption and irrigation which in most cases results in an increased dependence on groundwater if groundwater abstraction exceeds groundwater recharge for extensive areas and long time groundwater levels show significant decline and groundwater depletion occurs gleeson et al 2010 threatening the sustainability of human settlements and any related water dependant activities global pressure on groundwater resources had led to groundwater depletion in several areas of the world particularly in the high plains and central valley usa central mexico the middle east india china and spain wada et al 2012 richey et al 2015 declining groundwater level leads to negative impacts on surface water groundwater interaction e g stream flow base flow and groundwater dependent ecosystems as well as surface water groundwater conjunctive use groundwater depletion also contributes to 25 of the global sea level rise wada et al 2010 australia is the second driest continent after antarctica lavery et al 1997 and groundwater depletion occurs in several semi arid and arid areas it is often related to agricultural or municipal extraction and occurs principally in the states of western australia barron et al 2014 werner et al 2013 south australia knowling et al 2015 victoria van dijk et al 2007 leblanc et al 2009 and new south wales van dijk et al 2007 leblanc et al 2009 it is largely observed across the great artesian basin werner et al 2013 a 1 700 000 km2 regional confined aquifer encompassing three states and across the murray darling basin nevill 2009 chen et al 2016 a 1 000 000 km2 river basin covering most of the country s southeast and several states mentioned above in some cases climate change has shown to accelerate groundwater depletion barron et al 2011 2014 crosbie et al 2010 knowling et al 2015 leblanc et al 2009 and increases the anthropogenic pressure on groundwater resources because of the highly variable nature of surface water availability australia s groundwater extraction increased by 90 between 1985 and 2000 nlwra 2001 khan et al 2008 the importance of groundwater in australia s economy food security and ecosystem services along with the numerous cases of groundwater depletion reported in australia motivates the need for large scale assessment of climate and anthropogenic forcing on australia s aquifers measuring groundwater depletion is challenging the most direct way to estimate the volume of groundwater storage change from an aquifer is to compare groundwater head levels at different times such assessment requires long term records of groundwater level data only obtainable through repetitive and labour intensive field campaigns often such dataset is unavailable or insufficiently available with in the best cases numerous spatial and or temporal gaps this is often a limiting factor while monitoring groundwater depletion in vast areas of inland australia with low spatial density of population and groundwater level monitoring instruments several remote sensing techniques have been used to either compensate gaps in groundwater data or improve conceptualization of groundwater flow systems meijerink et al 2007 however very few remote sensing techniques provide quantitative insights on groundwater storage changes while being deployable multi temporally e g as a monitoring tool to this date time variable gravity data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace see e g frappart and ramillien 2018 and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar reeves et al 2014 chaussard et al 2014b or a combination of the two castellazzi et al 2016a 2018 are the most promising techniques for geodetic groundwater depletion monitoring and management at sufficient resolution on one hand grace data are directly quantitative but of horizontal resolution significantly below groundwater management s scales hundreds of km it also vertically aggregates all water storage layers from atmosphere to deep aquifers alley and konikow 2015 on the other hand insar measures ground deformation which in the context of groundwater depletion is conditioned by aquifers physical characteristics compressibility thickness storativity hence while being of largely sufficient resolution for the application scale of meters e g castellazzi et al 2016b 2017 insar data are not directly quantitative without extensive lithological data ground deformation mapping provides an interesting insight into pressure and storage changes in aquifers and aquitards the physical structure of compressible aquifers and aquitards changes in a nearly irreversible inelastic way when the groundwater head reaches unprecedented historical lows while the head declines the increasing hydrostatic pressure in the aquifer leads to pressure conditions beyond the maximum effective stress that it has experienced in the past referred to as the pre consolidation stress biot 1941 at the surface ground subsidence occurs which may cause damage to infrastructure typically such deformation is primarily visible along linear structures such as pipes canals and roads perpendicular to strong deformation gradients e g castellazzi et al 2017 reciprocally the detection of ground deformation allows detecting unsustainable groundwater extraction given that aquifers are sufficiently compressible to respond to the pressure loss beyond detection thresholds chaussard et al 2014a castellazzi et al 2018 however applications of large scale aquifer deformation data to groundwater science and management are still very limited mostly due to challenges related to data acquisition handling and processing sar science and related ground deformation monitoring techniques insar have evolved rapidly in the last few years such advancements are fostered by the increasing availability of sar datasets and the development of processing algorithms and software tools the sentinel 1 satellites part of the third generation of sar platforms have been a game changer they are the first globally acquiring sar systems optimized for insar ground deformation retrieval e g they are specifically designed with a sufficient high repeat pass frequency and spatial resolution for production of accurate ground deformation maps rucci et al 2012 sentinel 1 satellites use a specific acquisition strategy to cover all continents at a 12 day repeat path frequency called terrain observation with progressive scans topsar which is a modified version of the scansar imaging mode used in previous generations of sar satellites de zan and guarnieri 2006 the integration of sentinel 1 data into the science community has led to major technical advancements in insar science such as real time low latency monitoring of deformation raspini et al 2018 and has opened doors for deformation monitoring at unprecedented scales e g novellino et al 2017 insar stacking techniques such as small baseline subset sbas berardino et al 2002 persistent scatterers interferometry psi ferretti et al 2001 and all other variants see pepe and calò 2017 and crosetto et al 2016 for a description of the most common algorithms allow discriminating ground deformation from the major noise source affecting radar phase shifts i e the atmospheric delay corresponding to differences in the atmosphere composition between two acquisitions in all processing approaches stacking consists in compiling phase shift observations over a large array of image pairs selected along a dense sar image time series which allows separating ground deformation patterns from temporally varying phase shifts due to atmosphere density changes while the insar stacking techniques have been shown as highly efficient if used in an appropriate manner its implementation over large scales is still relatively unexplored principally due to difficulties inherent to processing parameterization the handling of large datasets and the interpretation of insar results over a wide array of land cover types in fact most applications of insar apply either on local scales volcanoes cities mountain slopes unstable coastal areas or apply on large scale for sudden displacements which do not require time series analysis and interferogram stacking e g earthquakes in the last years several large scale insar time series applications were performed in southwestern

motagh 2017 in the uk novellino et al 207 sowter et al 2017 and in china daout et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 however only few of these large scale studies focus on ground deformation related to groundwater extraction chaussard et al 2014b castellazzi et al 2018 ojha et al 2018 2020 in australia insar has been used to investigate various sources of ground deformations including mining ge et

change are rare with only parker et al 2017 and ng et al 2015 discussing groundwater storage change as a potential explanation for deformation anomalies observed over the perth and gippsland basins respectively the difficulties of monitoring large scale groundwater depletion in regional australia the recognized potential of applying insar products to monitor large scale groundwater depletion and the absence of case studies on such applications in australia motivate the research presented in this paper how can c band insar be applied for groundwater depletion mapping over extensive areas of intensive groundwater extraction this is particularly important in regional australia where the low spatial density of monitoring bores and remoteness challenges field investigations here we explore the value of insar data derived from the c band sentinel 1 mission the only large scale sar dataset available in australia to map groundwater over extraction we present a series of insar processing performed over three regions of australia where groundwater depletion has been reported in the past and confront the results to proxies for insar noise levels e g land use maps and in situ groundwater level data we also explore how deformation unrelated to aquifers appears in insar deformation maps intended for groundwater depletion mapping 2 study areas three regions of australia are presented the perth basin in western australia pwa fig 1 a northern new south wales nnsw fig 1b and southern nsw snsw fig 1c the latter covers the nsw queensland border and is spread equally across both states they are referred to as pwa nnsw and snsw throughout the paper respectively and are covered by six insar processing areas referred to as p1 to p6 throughout this article fig 1 these areas were chosen for the important groundwater depletion reported in literature barron et al 2011 2014 bureau of meteorology 2019 leblanc et al 2009 and for the important reliance of anthropogenic activities upon groundwater resources this section presents the three study areas and their main topographical climatic and hydrogeological attributes to prepare for interpretation of the insar signals we also discuss the presence of fine grained interbeds or aquitards prone to deformation within or between the aquifers as well as clay in surficial soils the perth basin in western australia pwa fig 1a surrounds the city of perth 2 m inhab the capital of the state of western australia three major aquifers occur within the basin an unconfined surficial aquifer of the swan coastal plain and two cretaceous and jurassic confined aquifers the leederville and yarragadee aquifers both are composed mostly of sandstone shales and siltstone the shallower leederville formation occurs from 50 to 500 m below ground surface and the deeper yarragadee aquifer extends up to a depth of 2 km davidson 1995 the leederville formation is composed of tidally influenced deltaic deposits and hence can be dominated by either mud or sand depending on the level of marine energy leyland 2012 hence within some of the members of the leederville formation parts of the sandstone are clayey the leaderville aquifer is either confined by overlying aquitards such as the kardinya shale belonging to the coolenya group or connected with the superficial aquifer where a pliocene unconformity led to significant erosion of the coolyena group it is underlain and separated from the deeper yarragadee formation by aquitards such as the south perth shale or confining strata of the parmelia group leyland 2012 baddock and johnson 2018 the decline of groundwater levels in the perth basin has been affecting all major aquifers of the basin while surficial clays occur in patches near the darling fault soils are mostly sandy the perth basin sits within a graben its eastern boundary the darling fault is easily visible on both topography and mean annual precipitation maps fig 2 a1 b1 annual precipitation ranges from 450 mm yr upper right corner fig 2b1 to 1200 mm yr around and beyond the darling fault land use is urban around perth and is highly heterogeneous around the city dryland cropping grazing and nature conservation areas are present in similar proportions and forests are dominant beyond the darling fault fig 2c1 the nnsw area fig 1b encompasses the condamine culgoa the moonie the border rivers the gwydir and the namoi surface water catchments fig 1b the area includes a set of alluvial aquifers surrounded by and sometimes overlaying jurassic and cretaceous sedimentary rock formations and tertiary basalts dafny and silburn 2014 aquifer confinement tends to increase around paleo valleys where alluvium thickness and heterogeneity increases creating semi confined and sometimes localized confined aquifer conditions kelly et al 2014 the lower namoi and lower gwydir basins are characterised by two quaternary alluvial aquifers overlying the deeper mesozoic palaeozoic gunnedah and surat basin sequences that contain hydrocarbon formations the quaternary sequence consists of a surficial aquifer commonly referred to as narrabri and gunnedah formations the narrabri formation only occurs in the upper namoi and lower gwydir basins and consists mainly of clays with minor sand and gravel beds and hence provides generally low yielding aquifers with approximately 30 m in average thickness williams 1986 sws 2011 the gunnedah formation extends across the upper and lower namoi as well as lower gwydir basins consists predominantly of gravel and sand with minor clay beds with up to 115 m and hence is the principal aquifer used for irrigation it is confined where it underlies the narrabri formation williams 1986 sws 2011 while in the namoi basin the two formations have been found to have good hydraulic connectivity mcneilage 2006 in the lower gwydir basin the narrabri and gunnedah basins are separated by a thick low permeability clay layer menció et al 2013 barrett 2018 in the lower namoi where the narrabri formation does not occur the gunnedah formation is the uppermost aquifer but is underlain by the cubbaroo formation which infill the pre tertiary paleochannels of the lower namoi with sand and gravel with interbedded clay williams 1986 the eastern part of the nnsw area fig 1b p3 p4 and parts of p2 is covered by clay rich soils referred to as vertosols with clay content in the range 45 65 across the namoi gwydir and border rivers alluvial valleys ahmad 1996 viscarra rossel 2011 while altitudes above 500 m are present on the eastern and southern boundaries of p3 fig 2a2 most of the area is flat and within the 100 300 m elevation range a strong east west precipitation gradient is observed ranging from 1000 mm yr in the east to 400 mm yr in the western boundary of the sar imagery footprint fig 2b2 land use is dominated by grazing and dryland cropping patches of irrigated cropping areas occur around the intensive groundwater extraction areas fig 2c2 the snsw area fig 1c encompasses the northern section of the murray riverina the billabong yanco the murrumbidgee the lachlan and parts of the benanee willandra catchments it is located over a large riverine plain with two main aquifer units the deep basal formation from the renmark group part of the murray darling basin up to 300 m thick at the western section of the area and thinning westward brown 1990 and a surficial aquifer from the sheparton formation the latter forms the large riverine plain surficial aquifer it is 50 125 m thick and is separated from the renmark group by 60 m thick coarse grained aquifer unit unconsolidated and poorly consolidated clay occur within the surficial aquifer timms and acworth 2002 clay rich soils occur throughout the riverine plain and include a large patch of vertosols fig 1 common area of p5 and p6 nsw and oeh 2020 the rest of the study area is covered by soils with clay content in the range 25 40 this study area is mostly flat with elevation close to sea level 50 150 m asl with little local variations over the north eastern section of the sar image footprints fig 2a3 mean annual precipitation rates are typical for arid climates in the range of 300 600 mm yr fig 2b3 land use is similar to the nnsw area with a significantly higher proportion of grazing native vegetation on the western side of the study area patches of irrigated cropping occur in the centre of the p6 footprint fig 2c3 3 data and methods 3 1 insar processing in this study a total of 385 images were used to cover 347 800 km2 with ground deformation maps 385 interferometric wide iw sar images from the sentinel 1 satellites were downloaded in single look complex slc level 1 format through the sentinel australasia regional access portal sara https copernicus nci org au they form six time series covering the three study regions as shown in figs 1 and 2 orbital data were updated to the latest version precise orbit ephemerides or poeorb before processing 2311 phase shit maps or interferograms were created from the six radar image time series they were corrected for topographic fringes using a 30 m resolution digital elevation model derived from data acquired by the panchromatic remote sensing instrument for stereo mapping prism aboard alos takaku et al 2014 2018 interferograms were filtered using an adaptative goldstein filter goldstein and werner 1998 of alpha values in the range 0 3 2 5 and were unwrapped using a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm insar processing was performed using sarscape 5 5 1 and its implementation of the intermittent small baseline subset isbas insar stacking technique sowter et al 2013 bateson et al 2015 which is a variation of the original sbas berardino et al 2002 isbas is similar to sbas but the requirements of the temporal stability of coherence during pixel selection is replaced by a statistical constraint usually based on a proportion of the total number of interferograms and or images in the stack this allows intermittently coherent pixels to be accounted in the phase to displacement inversion and included in the final results this usually increases coverage over natural sparsely vegetated land covers in urban settings coherence is typically stable along the sar time series hence isbas behaves like sbas this processing design optimizes coverage over natural settings but as displacement values for each pixel in the final result are not based on a unique stable number of images and or interferograms the noise level is spatially variable bateson et al 2015 cigna and sowter 2017 alshammari et al 2019 the sbas inversion which extracts displacements from the interferogram stack for selected pixels is based on a singular value decomposition svd approach and on a linear deformation model it is also weighted to coherence i e the importance of interferogram pixels in the phase to displacement inversion is relative to their coherence a 2 steps atmospheric filtering consisting in a low pass spatial filter and a high pass temporal filter was applied to extract the atmospheric component of the phase delay the insar processing is unconstrained i e it do not rely on any a priori information the corrections incl referencing to a stable point were at first based on considering a series of stable points where aquifer related deformation has minimal chances to occur i e far from well field over stable rocks or coarse grained sediment layers then a trial and error approach was used to iteratively change the reference points until a spatially consistent deformation map was created free of any obvious shift patterns or artefacts table 1 summarizes other processing parameters such as the number of images interferograms and looks the pixel aggregation factor to obtain square pixels and increase the signal to noise ratio fig 3 shows the connection graphs for each insar stack note that p4 uses almost all images from p3 94 97 with a longer temporal baseline threshold resulting in an interferogram stack containing 60 more interferograms for all study areas atmospheric phase filtering was based on a 1200 m low pass filter and a 120 days high pass filter interferogram pixels were considered only if the spatial insar coherence was above 0 2 as a coherence mask applied to each interferogram for p1 pwa area pixels with temporal stack coherence below 0 3 were not considered masking obvious atmospheric artefacts beyond the darling fault the major topographic change delimiting the perth basin a least square fitting approach was used to generate average velocity maps from the insar ground deformation time series the maps show average vertical ground displacement after being converted from line of sight los along the satellite acquisition geometry

classification general hydrography lines and catchment boundaries monthly precipitation data was aggregated from daily precipitation time series available from the bureau of meteorology website http www bom gov au as an approximation of the spatial distribution of the percentage of clay near the surface we generated a soil clay content map defining the volumetric proportion of clay in the first

that allows free access to soil and land information over the state of new south wales the modelling methods and data sources are described in nsw and oeh 2018 land use classification from nsw dpie 2019 nsw landuse 2017 v1 1 over the lower namoi region is used to study the relations between anthropogenic activities on the land surface mostly cropping related activities and insar derived displacements major hydrography network lines are overlaid on insar displacement maps throughout this paper and are derived from crossman and li 2015 the precision of sbas insar over vegetated land cover depends on several factors including the number of sar images used and the density of the connection graph fig 2 over a given pixel or area the land cover and use and the quality of the displacement model fitting over the interferogram stack stack temporal coherence as the isbas techniques allow pixels to be included into the inversion while they are partially below the coherence threshold along the interferogram stack such thresholding plays a major role in defining the level of noise in the results in fact over vegetated land covers these two thresholds table 1 typically define the trade off between the final coverage of the measurement and its precision permissive thresholds usually decrease the precision and increases the coverage and vice versa in all cases additional knowledge on the spatio temporal patterns greatly helps in interpreting the results and discriminating noise to signal anywhere the signal to noise ratio snr is low the sensitivity of insar observations toward groundwater depletion related displacements is assessed for each study areas first the large scale insar mean vertical velocity maps the ones based on multiple swath nnsw and snsw are merged by matching histograms over the common coverage and a stable reference area is used to correct each large scale map i e the mean value over the reference area is subtracted to the rest of the map second three spatial subsets in the range of 10 200 km2 expected as stable are manually selected within each study region these validation areas are selected on the basis on the following criteria 1 no major groundwater withdrawal activities or no notable groundwater level records beyond previously established historical lows critical heads during the observation period 2 no deformation according to past studies for pwa parker et al 2017 and nnsw ross and jeffery 1991 3 no particular or notable slopes or atmospheric perturbation patterns e g east of the darling fault in perth basin 4 distant from the stable reference areas selected for correction processing residuals during insar processing a histogram analysis is performed at each of these spatial subsets and interpreted with knowledge of the dominant land use occurring at these locations 3 3 field monitoring of aquifer deformation the lower namoi aquifer p4 fig 1 has been subject to several studies on land subsidence related to groundwater depletion and has now one of the most complete records of land subsidence data in australia ross and jeffery 1991 ali et al 2004 this allows the results from processing p4 fig 2 table 1 fig 3 centred over the lower namoi groundwater management area to be compared with in situ data in 1974 and 1981 two types of field monitoring installations where put in place in the lower namoi catchment p4 processing area ross and jeffery 1991 they consist in a set of wells drilled down and cemented to the bedrock called control benchmarks fig 4 b and rods inserted 1 5 m deep at the bottom of 6 m deep boreholes fig 4c called subsidence benchmarks fig 4c d e the former is taken as a stable reference used to survey the latter they are both isolated from the alluvium with pvc tubing while 9 benchmark surveys occured in the 1974 1990 period only a subset of the 41 benchmarks was included in each survey with at maximum 18 and 15 benchmarks during the 1980 and 1981 surveys after a survey gap of 29 years the benchmarks were surveyed in may 2019 nine subsidence benchmarks out of the 41 could no longer be located or were destroyed or damaged high chances of error 32 benchmark derived long term time series were usable for comparison with insar results the control benchmarks were surveyed using high precision global navigation satellite system gnss equipment with a static survey technology that involves logging a minimum of 4 control marks at the same time to determine the connections between each other station static observations are made in the field and baseline vectors between the stations are computed according to the surveyor the vertical accuracy of a static survey in an unconstrained least squares adjustment of all observations in the network is less than 30 mm which is consistent with estimated accuracies by the surveyor general of nsw for gnss control network results smk 2019 the static technique with a higher accuracy was chosen only for control benchmarks to limit error propagation from control to subsidence benchmarks in order to survey the 32 subsidence benchmarks within a timely manner a slightly less accurate real time kinematic method rtk was chosen for subsidence benchmarks rtk computes baseline vectors or positions based on reference station s in real time according to the surveyor the estimated vertical accuracy of the rtk technique is 35 mm smk 2019 for the 2019 survey the cumulative elevation error estimate between the static survey of the control benchmarks and the rtk survey of the subsidence benchmarks amounts to a total of 65 mm i e a maximum measurement error of 32 5 mm around the true value assuming that previous surveys were as accurate the error while comparing two surveys is 65 mm for the deformation trends this error was normalised by the period considered to obtain annualised errors for each benchmark the longest and shortest periods of such benchmark data are 45 and 38 years respectively 1974 2019 1981 2019 therefore the annualised error in the trends varies between 1 4 and 1 7 mm yr 65 mm 45yrs and 65 mm 38yrs respectively these least errors are derived based on the assumption that measurement accuracies of historic surveys are potentially worse compared to the 2019 survey we therefore applied a slightly more conservative error of 2 mm yr to query for benchmarks with trends outside this error margin 3 4 groundwater level monitoring data and processing in situ groundwater level data were downloaded from two portals the water information reporting tool wirt state of western australia for the pwa area and the water nsw real time data portal for all other areas for wells located over the lower namoi catchment p4 fig 1 data were provided directly by the nsw department of primary industries and environment nsw dpie in mid 2019 in situ groundwater level data were processed and interpreted following two steps first trends in head level were computed through a linear least square regression performed over a temporal subset of the groundwater level time series corresponding to the insar study period table 1 second critical head drop was computed as the minimum head level measured during a reference period prior to the start of the insar observation minus the minimum head level measured over the insar observation period table 1 a result of 0 means that level has not decreased below past minimums during the insar period while a positive number suggests that aquifer storage has reached a historical minimum during the insar observation this analysis potentially allows separating elastic and inelastic deformation induced by the dewatering of an aquifer with fine grained interbeds or aquitards to groundwater levels either above or below a previously established critical head respectively for negative or positive trends of groundwater levels located above a constant previously established critical head one can expect elastic i e recoverable compaction and expansion in contrast negative trends of groundwater levels that result in a further decline in critical head may cause inelastic and nonrecoverable land subsidence a quality check was performed by applying a certain data filtering criterion over each groundwater level time series to be only considered for a minimum of 10 measurements over 5 years during the reference period and for a minimum of 6 measurements over at least 2 years during the insar measurement period the analysis retained 661 groundwater level time series which were judged as being of sufficient quality according to these data filtering steps note that our data quality analysis of groundwater levels has unavoidable limitations related to the processing and interpretation of large time series datasets with highly variable temporal increments as for insar processing the criterion applied to the dataset controls the final coverage here groundwater level data density and the noise level in the final groundwater storage trend and critical head drop maps note that well data over the lower namoi catchment processing p4 were not subject to automated data quality checks which was replaced by a visual data quality and density verification for each individual well time series this study area is therefore covered by water data with higher density and quality than other areas 4 results deformation signals unrelated to groundwater storage change limit our ability to map and monitor groundwater storage change with insar hence they are considered as noise for that specific application this multiple source noise is assessed here by analysing insar results in several ways first part 4 1 we analyse our insar results over a well studied area the lower namoi catchment p4 fig 1 it is to our knowledge the only area equipped with field installation for long term subsidence monitoring in australia this area is also expected to be among the most challenging for the intended application due to the presence of vertosols i e soils with high content of montmorillonite clay minerals that shrink during the dry season and expand after rain events seasons see fig 4a and e second part 4 2 we analyse the correlations between land use and insar displacements to separate noise from surficial clays to other potential noise sources third part 4 3 we perform a large scale assessment of noise over all processing sites p1 to p6 by analysing histograms of insar results section 3 2 where displacements related to groundwater are not expected to occur this last analysis gives insight over the scalability of the first two noise analysis and is required for any further large scale interpretation of insar data in australia finally we present and interpret large scale deformation maps and use groundwater levels to help identifying groundwater related anomalies throughout the three regions of study 4 1 analysing the influence of surficial clays on insar deformation at catchment scale the p4 processing area fig 1 corresponding to the lower namoi catchment is characterized by a particularly clay rich surficial soil layer referred to as vertosols this study area is a typical case of intense groundwater extraction related to irrigation of the murray darling basin groundwater is extracted from alluvial aquifer units largely disconnected from upstream and downstream aquifers but connected through mostly ephemeral surface water streams in such hydrological settings the flat terrain makes hydrological connectivity particularly sensitive to ground level changes hence the strong motivation in monitoring its amplitude and anthropogenic controls the groundwater management area of the lower namoi used for groundwater flow modelling by the water management agency encompasses a dense irrigation bore network fig 5 a analysis of well head drop beyond critical heads within the groundwater management area lower namoi groundwater source is presented in fig 5b and c while in situ ground level displacement monitoring from repetitive benchmark surveys is presented in fig 5d the subsidence rates measured in situ are by design insensitive to deformation of the vertosols fig 4c and by encompassing more than four decades significantly less sensitive to short term climate variability than the 3 5 years of observation provided by insar fig 5b highlights that most groundwater level time series show significant critical head drop of more than 8 m during the full history of head level record encompassing the last 50 years for most wells it explains the subsidence rates observed in situ in the past over that region as reported by ross and jeffery 1991 multi decadal land subsidence rates beyond detection threshold occurs in 5 out of 32 benchmarks with a maximum value of 0 85 cm yr 37 4 cm over 44 years in contrast fig 5c highlights the almost complete absence or relatively small values of critical head drop during the 3 5 years insar observation period insar derived vertical velocity is shown on fig 6 b for low clay content areas and 6c for high clay content areas we note that insar results do not show any anomaly coinciding with the subsidence area observed from in situ data figs 5d and 6c the absence of critical head drop as driver for inelastic subsidence over the insar period and the lack of correlation between insar results and in situ observed subsidence suggests that insar measurements are dominated by processes unrelated to groundwater storage changes the difference between in situ and insar results lies in the sensitivity of insar to surficial clays the influence short term climate variability on them and potentially other anthropogenic factors such as cropping activities such observation allows us to use the insar results for inferring the maximum influence of surficial clays and cropping activities over insar derived vertical displacements without significant bias from groundwater related signals notably the alluvial groundwater extraction area where most irrigation bores are located fig 5a spatially corresponds to high clay content in the range 45 65 within the top metre fig 6a c and thus a noisier insar signal for groundwater interpretation purposes in comparison the non alluvial surroundings where no groundwater extraction occurs show fractional clay content in the range 10 45 fig 6a and a cleaner insar signal fig 6b as high clay content soils mostly occur within the alluvial plain there is a potential for the non groundwater insar deformation signal to spatially correlate to a potential groundwater signal which could be spatially constrained by the alluvial plain boundary this confirms the importance of accounting for signals from clayey soils before any hydrogeological interpretation of the insar signal in such settings a correlation analysis between insar measurements and clay content in the first metre of soil is presented fig 7 we note an obvious near linear behaviour of the 5 95 confidence interval of insar deformation rates in relation to the clay content increments for the three main years of the insar observation period fig 7a and a temporally varying response fig 7b c d the surficial deformation signals vary with time the clay related noise level is particularly strong in 2016 but is steadily decreasing in each of the two subsequent years such temporal pattern seems related to short term climate variability fig 8 the precipitation rates in 2016 were close to the 2005 2015 monthly averages the monthly precipitation rates over the two following years are significantly below the 2005 2015 monthly averages this suggests that precipitation has had more impact on the insar noise 2016 than the additional groundwater fed irrigation required by the crops during the drier years 2017 2018 it is important to note that this analysis is limited to the uppermost metre of soil and hence cannot prove whether deeper soil horizons contribute to ground level changes persistent scatterer interferometry psi might largely be insensitive to surficial clays as persistence of high insar coherence is required at the pixel selection step to verify that hypothesis while illustrating the coverage trade off of using psi over vegetated areas two tests were performed using the same dataset as p4 and are presented in fig s1 sup mat through these results we note that performing psi over a temporal subset including only dry years 2017 in this case allows a notable gain in coverage at the cost of an increased sensitivity to deformation from surficial clays fig s1b a quantitative evaluation of the insar noise related to surficial clays is presented in table 2 and least square regression models are presented in table s1 given the near linear relation between the clay content and insar displacements see r square values in table s1 we suggest that a linear regression is efficient at predicting the influence of surficial clays over insar measurements by multiplying the slope rates of both the 5 and 95 curves with 50 corresponding to the amount of clay occurring where the groundwater related signal is measured through in situ data benchmarks 27 and 28 fig 5d we approximate the signal deviation related to surficial clays that is masking the detection of the expected subsidence the half width between the 5th and 95th percentile curves or the half confidence interval is interpreted as the mean noise level which needs to be accounted for hydrogeological interpretation of insar data in other words a groundwater signal will need to locally shift the range of insar displacement values sufficiently in any direction positive or negative to be detectable this analysis provides valuable information for applying insar to groundwater applications in similar settings in terms of soil clay content and land cover usage a signal deviation of 53 mm yr occurs during the wetter year e g 2016 table 2 and it decreases to 21 mm yr for the drier years 2017 and 2018 in the best cases i e with a noise level at 21 mm yr over areas with 50 clay similar to where the aquifer compaction signal is expected and assuming the signal detected through in situ data fig 5d as temporally constant a snr of 0 4 is obtained the values provided in table 2 are a conservative estimation of the clay related noise as 1 the regression accounts for a large bracket of clay content values and 2 a potential groundwater anomaly may have a distinct spatial pattern allowing its separation even if below the 5 95 confidence interval in addition we note that accounting for 50 clay will be sufficient to account for the noise of 50 of the p4 area as 50 of the area is covered with soils of clay content above 50 espade v2 0 nsw and oeh 2018 2020 this analysis does not suggest that clay is the only factor contributing to the insar noise hence to further explore its controlling factors we propose a correlation analysis between insar displacements and land cover in the following section 4 2 analysing the influence of cropping activities on insar at catchment scale land use classes 330 cropping 430 irrigated cropping 210 grazing native vegetation and 320 grazing modified pastures represent together around 90 of the surface area of p4 table 3 cropping and irrigated cropping areas have standard deviations higher double or more than any other land use classes this highlights the difficulty of inferring groundwater depletion related displacements over areas subject to frequent modifications of the soil surface with c band insar which shows a high proportion of direct surface scattering over cropping areas typical for insar results land use classes corresponding to hard surfaces such as 540 residential and farm infrastructure or 550 services have mean vertical velocity values close to 0 a relatively low standard deviation and a narrow confidence interval we also note the higher noise level observed in classes 620 river and 630 reservoir dam fig 9 table 3 they correspond to areas with constant changes at the surface due to e g sediment transport the superior insar signal amplitude observed over 330 cropping and 430 irrigated cropping land cover classes in comparison to natural areas classes 110 120 130 suggests that cropping activities over clayey soils also contribute to the insar signal in addition to the moisture related volumetric changes of the surficial clays and the insar noise related to low density vegetation and low coherence the insar displacements observed in relation to surficial clay content fig 7 might also be impacted by cropping activities as they occur conjointly with high clay content typically above 45 fig 6 in order to discriminate the impacts of clay or cropping activities over insar measurements the width of the 5 95 range of displacement values is analysed for different land use classes fig 10 by comparing the curves fig 10a and b we note that cropping activities lead to an increase in measured insar displacements in the range 20 50 of fractional clay content as highlighted by the inflated curves in fig 10b irrigation activities decrease the expected difference between dry 2016 and wet years 2017 2018 fig 10c particularly in the range 40 60 of fractional clay content it is important to note that while insar measurement values for areas below 40 of clay content seems inferior in fig 10c than in the other curves the measurements depend on few values and might be considered unreliable graph d fig 10 aggregates several classes not impacted by any cropping activities and is used for comparison with observations for the cropping fig 10b and irrigated cropping fig 10c classes the value ranges are considerably smaller than in all other curves which demonstrates the influence of cropping activities on insar measurements in soils containing 40 60 clay 73 of the insar coverage and 84 of all cropping areas in p4 cropping activities increase the width of the insar measurement range by 37 6 9 95 while irrigated cropping activities increase it by 37 9 5 01 we conclude that within this clay content range no major difference between cropping and irrigated cropping activities are observed 4 3 large scale analysis of non groundwater signals across insar deformation maps a large scale analysis is necessary to better understand how the noise sources identified in previous sections impact large scale insar maps and how results from previous sections can be extrapolated to the rest of australia several spatial subsets referred to as validation areas are selected they are influenced by different sources of noise but not prone to groundwater depletion related displacements fig 11 histograms of the insar mean vertical deformation maps are analysed and interpreted in relation to the land cover and distance to reference areas selected for ground referencing the insar maps table 4 over pwa validation areas are selected east of the perth basin and above the darling fault sharp boundary on fig 2 a1 where no alluvial aquifer prone to deformation occurs signal goes up to 2 75 mm yr over grazing modified pasture northeast of the city of perth measurements are within the same range in other areas over the darling fault table 4 a2 and a3 which corresponds to land cover with similar vegetation densities in the nnsw area the maximum signal reaches 13 82 mm yr in a native vegetation area distant from the reference area b1 other measurements are in the same range of values with 11 78 and 9 06 mm yr over b2 and b3 respectively a slight positive shift of 2 to 4 mm yr median value is observed for all calibration sites in the snsw area the maximum shift reaches 6 11 mm yr in c3 the further away from the reference area this site also corresponds predominantly to a dryland cropping area hence a higher deviation is expected due to human influence on the soil surface as seen in the previous section the two other validation sites c1 and c2 are located over native vegetation areas less impacted by human activities hence their deviation from zero displacement is lower reaching 4 66 mm yr the median value of all histograms is positive and is potentially correlated with the distance to the reference area this assessment provides guidance for further interpretation of isbas insar results and allows considering noise levels for detection of groundwater depletion related displacements over non urban areas where according to the isbas strategy the connection graph and interferogram density on which the deformation measurement relies varies for each pixel we note a strong discrepancy in the noise and deviation levels with 5 95 confidence intervals of 2 75 1 03 11 78 13 82 and 4 33 6 11 mm yr in pwa nnsw and snsw respectively from this analysis the land cover seems to have a strong influence on the width of the value range the vegetation density strongly determines the density and quality of distributed scatterers controlling sar wave reflectivity and temporal phase stability higher vegetation density also increases the density of intermittent scatterers if vegetation structure and density change throughout the year this decreases the reliability of the isbas processing by decreasing the interferogram and image density that the ground deformation values rely on over these areas hence the higher noise levels in the isbas approach the number of images and interferograms considered in the phase to displacement inversion varies spatially within the selected thresholds but such variation is not easily and systematically accounted for in the interpretation for example a notable difference is observed between the snsw and the nnsw regions with higher noise levels observable in the nnsw region although similar thresholds for considering intermittent scatterers were applied during both insar processing more interferograms above the coherence threshold could be integrated in the snsw area leading to a lower noise level to accurately interpret isbas results and its spatially varying noise levels it is important to assess noise levels over each study site for each land cover type and in australia for a representative clay content range 4 4 identifying groundwater signals across large scale insar deformation maps analysis of the influences of clay and land cover presented in the previous sections help defining the thresholds beyond which the signal can be considered as anomalous thus the colour scales of all ground velocity maps showed thereafter matches the observations from this analysis and conservative ranges of 3 3 15 15 and 6 6 mm yr will be considered within the noise level of insar for detection of groundwater related signals for pwa nnsw and ssnw respectively figs 12 14 and 16 present mean ground displacement rates for the three areas accounting for the full length of the time series unless noted otherwise this section discusses potential groundwater related deformations for all three study areas 4 4 1 perth basin the pwa area shows several temporally dynamic displacement patterns fig 12 north of the city of perth land subsidence is observed in patches during the full length of the time series fig 12a and was accentuated during the first third of the insar period fig 12b when it reached values in the range 12 6 mm yr of vertical velocity sandy soils over most of that area are not particularly prone to displacements suggesting that such displacements are related to the dewatering of fine grained interbeds and aquitards a positive ground uplift anomaly up to 12 mm yr is observed in the central part the frame fig 12c corresponding to the northern suburbs of the city of perth it spatially coincides with a managed aquifer recharge mar injection site suggesting an elastic reaction to artificially increased groundwater storage we note a largely asymmetric reaction of the aquifer fig 12c which potentially corresponds to lithological discontinuities preventing the pressure to propagate northward compressibility or thickness and controlling the spatial patterns of the poro elastic reaction in the southern suburbs contrasting patterns of displacements appear with spatial high frequencies of displacement velocity in the order 12 12 mm yr across parts of the time series fig 12d the spatial patterns and the location of the anomalies near the darling fault where high clay content soils occur suggest that they are related to surficial clays rather than groundwater storage change displacements patterns showed on fig 12 are compared to head level trends and critical head drop in 387 wells screened in the three main aquifers of the perth basin fig 13 we observe negative trends in most wells north of perth upper square fig 13a b c with 70 of the wells showing values below 25 cm yr in the deeper yarragadee aquifer fig 13a and 45 of the wells showing values below 10 cm yr in the leederville aquifer fig 13b the surficial aquifer shows a contrasting reaction with both negative and positive groundwater level trends no significant critical head drop is observed during the insar observation period in the yarragadee aquifer fig 13d throughout the basin conversely critical heads in the leederville aquifer have dropped notably in wells northwest of the city of perth and in the southern part of the basin while the former does not coincide with any significant negative anomaly in the displacement map fig 12a the latter coincides with patterns shown on fig 12d suggesting that part of the contrasting signal observed might actually be attributable to groundwater depletion however it is not possible to discriminate the impacts of surficial clays and groundwater storage on displacement patterns at this stage critical heads have dropped throughout the basin in the surficial aquifer a particularly high density of bores with drops in critical head can be found in the most southern section of the perth basin with 50 of the wells showing critical head drop beyond 30 cm during the insar observation period insar signal in this section of the perth basin below square d murray catchment fig 12a is particularly noisy due to the vegetation cover however negative displacements subsidence are observed even where insar coherence is high 4 4 2 northern nsw a large scale deformation map is created for the nnsw area by aggregating the vertical displacements maps derived from p2 p3 and p4 fig 14 a the mean value was used for pixels covered with more than one insar map it is important to keep in mind that the eastern side of this study area the eastern sentinel 1 swath encompasses the period from late 2015 to late 2018 whereas the western side encompasses a shorter period from 2017 to late 2018 table 1 groundwater levels and in situ benchmark data were shown previously section 4 1 and 4 2 at the scale of the lower namoi catchment central part of the eastern swath the anomaly threshold is set to values beyond a large bracket of 15 15 mm yr in the nnsw area in agreement to the high noise level related to high clay content and cropping activities discussed in previous sections most of the area shows values within the normal range and only few outliers can be observed the western part of the map covers the condamine culgoa catchment which is mostly stable apart from a patch in the most western part of the map fig 14 no groundwater extraction occurs over that area the most plausible cause for this signal to occur being a locally increased insar noise level due to a locally denser vegetation cover the eastern section of the namoi alluvium fig 14b shows a slight uplift but with no particular spatial correlation with occurrence of irrigation bores suggesting that such signal is attributable to movements from surficial soils beyond the typical threshold discussed previously finally positive displacements occur over the upper namoi catchment fig 14c where a high density of irrigation bores occurs this suggests that no groundwater depletion beyond historical minimums has occurred over that area during the insar period two negative anomalies are also noted in the upper mid section of fig 14c corresponding to two active quarries signals in the range 15 30 mm yr are detected at the upper right section of fig 14c where strong topographic changes occur it is attributable to residuals from topographic corrections of interferograms note that active coal seam gas csg well fields occur in the most northern section of the western swath p2 fig 1 however no obvious deformation signal beyond noise thresholds could be attributed to csg activities analysis of groundwater levels over the lower namoi catchment fig 5b c and at the scale of the eastern sentinel 1 swath fig 15 suggests that strong decline in groundwater levels occurs during the insar observation period fig 15a however no or insignificant critical head drop occurred fig 15b during the same period this suggests an absence of inelastic compaction during the insar era castellazzi and schmid 2020 analysed the temporal patterns of groundwater level time series over that area and found that the last historical groundwater level minima and the potentially related inelastic reaction occurred in or prior to the 1990 s while an elastic reaction remains possible it is probably small in comparison to the noise level fig 5d given the low amplitude of inelastic deformation measured through 44 years of benchmark surveys fig 5d such elastic reaction is likely a weak signal in comparison to other signals from surficial noise sources by comparing the long term subsidence signal measured in situ with the long term critical head drop fig 5 we understand that this aquifer is prone to low rates of compaction observable only over decadal timescales at maximum 85 mm per decade on average however the annual subsidence rates observed at maximum 8 5 mm yr fig 5d are far below insar signals attributable to surficial clays and cropping activities table 2 fig 7 which suggests that c band insar is inefficient to retrieve groundwater depletion related subsidence under such conditions according to the insar results and the well data available no ground deformation attributable to groundwater depletion occurs throughout this study area however given the specificity of the lower namoi catchment it serves as a robust proof of concept to demonstrate the limitations of detecting groundwater compaction signals with insar in an area with small long term subsidence rates low coherence specific to land use changes and high sensitivities to climate variability wet years and the related swelling and subsequent shrinking of clays in vertosols prevalent in this area 4 4 3 southern nsw similar to the nnsw area a large scale deformation map for the snsw area is produced by aggregating results from the p5 and p6 processing after conversion from los to vertical displacements we note several anomalies beyond the bracket 6 6 mm yr used for this study area the area b fig 16 b is notably affected by cropping activities with displacement rates respecting crop delineation while a vast majority of displacement patterns respecting crop boundaries are positive uplift negative displacement anomalies subsidence are observed in patches along the northern boundary of the lachlan catchment fig 16b while this area coincides with an important density of irrigation bores the spatial patterns also look similar to area c fig 16c an area affected by surface water sediment transport in both area b and c we note that negative deformation anomalies tend to align to form corridors while the absence of irrigation bores rules out groundwater depletion as a plausible cause for area c it remains a plausible cause for area b at the centre of the map a subsidence patch with maximum amplitude of 15 mm yr up to 23 mm yr locally is observed it coincides with a high density of irrigation bores fig 16d suggesting a plausible relation to groundwater extraction we note that both anomalies fig 16b d are within a snr range of 1 8 2 5 if considering a maximum noise level of 6 11 mm yr table 4 anomaly d fig 16d occurred during the two last thirds of the deformation time series see mean subsidence rates analysis performed over temporal subsets on fig s2 sup mat conversely anomaly c is only observable at the beginning of the insar period these observations on the timing of the ground level change greatly supports the interpretation anomaly c only occurs after rainy events and is a sediment transport signal surrounding river channels including signals from bank overflow anomaly d is groundwater related and only occurs during the driest periods coinciding with increased irrigation and low aquifer recharge analysis of groundwater level time series data over the snsw area shows that negative level trends occur in a vast majority of the wells fig 17 a the analysis shows that during the insar observation period 88 of the wells have declined in level by more than 20 cm yr and that 58 of the wells have declined in level by more than 1 m yr this is observed throughout the study area with exception of the southern part of the eastern swath corresponding to the southern border of the billabong yanco catchment fig 1 where no particular anomaly is detected by insar fig 16 analysis of groundwater level time series show that critical head drop beyond 0 5 m during the insar observation period occurred in 32 of the wells fig 17b it also shows a north south gradient with occurrence of critical head drop being more frequent in the southern part of the map than in the north we note that occurrence of irrigation wells fig 16d and negative trends in groundwater levels correlate spatially with the anomaly highlighted by b and d suggesting that these anomalies are related to groundwater extraction the presence of a major surface water stream crossing the area raise questions about potential influence of sediment transport processes on ground level changes however the shape of the anomaly and its correspondence with a major irrigation area suggests that the signal is attributable to groundwater storage change 5 discussion 5 1 value added of intermittent sbas in hydrogeology insar coverage over agricultural areas is influenced by the vegetation type density height controlling the decrease of insar coherence with increasing temporal baselines this coherence baseline relation controls the quantity of valuable interferograms which can be generated from a stack of sar images the temporal dynamics of the displacements and its ability to be captured through a typically linear deformation model are also important this study shows that interpretation of large scale c band insar maps over australia for groundwater science purposes requires accounting for significant non groundwater related deformation sources clay cropping activities and soil moisture changes combination of insar deformation data with lithological data or remotely sensed temporal gravity data from grace satellites leads toward high resolution and volumetric estimation of groundwater storage change which is a high value product to support large scale groundwater management castellazzi et al 2018 2020 this strongly motivates further research to understand how to interpret large scale insar data in regional australia while c band sar data availability is now global its application in regional australia is limited by the absence of persistent phase signal coherence over irrigated crops where groundwater irrigation and depletion typically occur unlike with l band castellazzi et al 2018 covering cropping area with c band insar requires the inclusion of intermittently coherent pixels during the inversion stage as allowed by the isbas strategy in the study areas this intermittent coherence corresponds to temporary spaces between young plants crops in winter and intermittent patches of bare soils between native plants in summer the isbas implementation sowter et al 2013 augments the coverage of the final deformation map by adapting the stack density to the intermittent nature of insar coherence obtaining accurate deformation estimates over medium high and or dense persistent vegetation remains impossible with c band sar images following the isbas strategy sowter et al 2013 an allowance for intermittently coherent pixels is used at the pixel selection step a statistical criterion is applied to define the minimum number of interferograms required above the coherence threshold this means that adjacent pixels can be related to different sar image quantity and interferogram stack density while none of these criteria define well the specific dynamic cyclic nature of insar coherence over crops they can have significant influence on the noise level bui et al 2020 for example a stack of 30 images covering one year typical for sentinel 1 and an inversion allowing pixels below the coherence threshold for at least 50 of the images 15 images with coherent interferogram connections will be required to meet the criterion if no further constrain is applied these images could either be spread across the year or only encompass the first half of the study period e g if floods occur during the rest of the sar time series e g over floodplain environments in the former case the gap is compensated by interpolating between data points along the time series and in the latter case by extrapolating the fitted model thus isbas can lead to ambiguous results if the parametrization does not account for the nature and temporal dynamics of the intermittent targets and the deformation signal to recover more research is needed to understand how the coherence criteria should be applied at the pixel selection step to 1 allow covering low coherence areas while containing the noise level 2 define the best practise for deciding on connection graphs and stack density constraints while keeping the deformation maps within an acceptable noise level which would vary greatly depending on the application 5 2 ground displacements and groundwater storage change in australia the three insar maps presented in this study show five anomalies potentially attributable to groundwater storage change four negative storage loss anomalies are identified two in the perth basin one in the murrumbidgee catchment and one in the lachlan catchment one positive storage gain is identified north of the city of perth and is attributable to managed aquifer recharge mar activities their relation to groundwater is suggested by the high density of irrigation bores present at the location of the deformation or at its vicinity or through analysis of water level trends and critical heads from in situ well level time series certain anomalies were not attributable to groundwater either because there were too close to the noise level estimated amplitude of non groundwater signals or because of insufficient comparability with auxiliary data some other anomalies are also unlikely to have links with groundwater storage change and have obvious relations to surficial sediment transport in addition we note several sources of uncertainty which should be accounted for while interpreting insar maps in australia insar signals from high clay content soils occurring over alluvial valleys may spatially coincide with exploited aquifers e g the lower namoi catchment such noise challenges the spatial correlation between deformation and aquifer depletion hence in such settings insar allows informing on potential groundwater related deformation but used alone it is not sufficient to confirm the causal relation between deformation and groundwater storage auxiliary data are necessary to better constrain the interpretation in either the spatial bore location irrigation areas or temporal injections or extraction periods domains finally we note that the recent advancements in c band radar image acquisition and availability repeat path frequency time series length and processing isbas only partially compensate for the low coherence of c band data over groundwater irrigation areas across regional australia as the results still present significant coverage gaps related to low coherence while insar processing is slowly brought to full automation by the science community we note that in australia a significant amount of local hydrogeological knowledge is still required to unleash its full potential for groundwater management applications for any given insar anomaly attributable to groundwater storage in stacked multilayered groundwater flow systems a wide spectrum of possibility exists in terms of storage change in each aquifer to explain the observed signal ambiguity interpretation is easier when only one aquifer occurs or when the aquifer layers can be reasonably considered as one unique semi confined system this challenges interpretation of insar anomaly in regional australia where monitoring bore density is relatively low 5 3 perspectives while insar has been used extensively worldwide it is a relatively new addition in the australian groundwater research toolkit and very few case studies are available to date this paper allows drawing several research axes to fill this gap first we invite for targeted study on the five anomalies discussed in this paper if sufficient lithological constraints on aquifers compressibility thickness and storativity are available deformation anomaly could be transposed into volumes of aquifer storage change for each site this would make these insar results directly digestible in quantitative groundwater management and integrable to typical quantitative methods in hydrogeology to define the groundwater storage anomaly required to produce ground displacements beyond the insar detection threshold we suggest transposing the maximum amplitude of all combined signals non attributable to groundwater into an equivalent groundwater storage change in the recent years insar has brought new perspectives in large scale quantitative groundwater management along two main research ideas the first focused on aquifer scale characterization of the storage ground level relation this support estimation of groundwater storage change where in situ data are insufficient or to fill temporal gaps in monitoring data chaussard et al 2014b reeves et al 2014 such application typically focuses on measuring subtle elastic deformations which requires insar data with sufficient precision millimetre scale the second takes advantage of large scale ground deformation monitoring for detection of inelastic deformation highlighting new historical groundwater level minimums and unsustainable management practices both applications have their respective benefits and can be integrated into management schemes while groundwater is overexploited in several regions of australia none of these two applications have been tested this study helps paving the way toward filling this science gap by providing interpretation keys for large scale insar data across australia the catchment scale analysis presented over the lower namoi catchment can be interpreted as a noisiest worst case scenario as the area is notorious for combining several factors challenging insar processing and result interpretation presence of high proportions of compressible clays vertosols at the surface intense cropping activities and a highly varying climate implying non linearity in the deformation behaviour analysis for this region shows that the mean annual vertical velocity estimates can be deviated by up to 53 mm yr by selecting the most appropriate periods drier climate we note that such deviation can be decreased down to 21 mm yr such detection threshold challenges the use of insar to the most important cases of groundwater depletion across regional australia and potentially makes the retrieval of subtle elastic seasonal deformation from insar impossible 6 conclusion by providing several examples this study assesses the value and limits of insar displacement mapping for detection of groundwater storage anomalies and groundwater management in regional australia it also illustrates the challenges of interpreting displacement maps beyond the regional scale and where some displacement sources can be either spatially similar to the expected groundwater storage anomalies aliasing or of much higher amplitude than any potential groundwater signal masking five negative anomalies subsidence appear to be related to groundwater storage change two in the perth basin one in the murrumbidgee catchment and one in the lachlan catchment one positive anomaly uplift is detected in the perth basin and is related to groundwater level recovery due to managed aquifer recharge in contrast to the most obvious groundwater related land subsidence cases central mexico venice in italy or the central valley in the usa where the relation between groundwater storage loss and subsidence is obvious significant subsidence rates coincides with intense groundwater extraction spatially and temporally a fine scrutiny of potential displacement sources remains necessary before interpreting ground displacements for groundwater management purposes in regional australia more generally and as the research community slowly transitions towards large scale insar applications for groundwater science there is a crucial need for listing quantifying and characterizing all displacement sources affecting earth s surface level the correlation between insar displacements clay content in the surficial layers of soil land use and climate observed in this paper suggest the complexity of the interrelations that may exist between some of these displacement sources interfering with the detection of aquifer deformation signals typical sbas processing of c band sar data do not yield spatially complete deformation maps over crops and usually processing of l band sar data is preferred e g castellazzi et al 2018 while l band data are generally not available over australia the isbas insar technique applied with c band data allows including intermittently coherent targets and increases the coverage of c band insar deformation maps over agricultural areas this unleashes the potential of sentinel 1 data for large scale groundwater science applications the inclusion of intermittently coherent targets needs to be parameterized with care as it also pushes further the maximum noise level of the final insar deformation maps an understanding of the noise level which needs to be accepted to create spatially complete deformation maps the noise coverage trade off as well as noise levels from both natural clay and anthropogenic cropping activities sources is essential and provided in this paper the open access diffusion of l band sar data less sensitive to vegetation from alos 2 and in the future the nisar missions will largely support the creation of large scale deformation maps over low and intermittent vegetation the combination of interferograms from both c and l band sar datasets e g msbas insar samsonov and d oreye 2012 will be an interesting avenue for improving large scale deformation monitoring over crops after accounting for the noise related to non groundwater processes we note that insar is still a valuable tool to support groundwater management in regional australia the use of insar derived deformation to inform and constrain joint groundwater flow and subsidence models relies on prior quantification of the non groundwater related noise in groundwater flow modelling inverse estimation of parameters such as elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients are obtained by assuming that the deformation data is free of non groundwater related signals while past research castellazzi et al 2018 suggests the important potential and value added of combining ground deformation from insar and gnss with time variable gravity data no application have been performed to this date in australia we note however that the important level of noise and interference in insar data will probably limits its value to the most important

explore the value of c band insar ground deformation maps for supporting large scale aquifer depletion and compaction mapping the obtention of spatially continuous insar ground deformation maps over

services along with the numerous cases of groundwater depletion reported in australia motivates the need for large scale assessment of climate and anthropogenic forcing on australia s aquifers measuring groundwater depletion is challenging the most direct way to estimate the volume of groundwater storage change from an aquifer is to compare groundwater head levels at different times such assessment requires long term records of groundwater level data only obtainable through repetitive and labour intensive field campaigns often such dataset is unavailable or insufficiently available with in the best cases numerous spatial and or temporal gaps this is often a limiting factor while monitoring groundwater depletion in vast areas of inland australia with low spatial density of population and groundwater level monitoring instruments several remote sensing techniques have been used to either compensate gaps in groundwater data or improve conceptualization of groundwater flow systems meijerink et al 2007 however very few remote sensing techniques provide quantitative insights on groundwater storage changes while being deployable multi temporally e g as a monitoring tool to this date time variable gravity data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace see e g frappart and ramillien 2018 and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar reeves et al 2014 chaussard et al 2014b or a combination of the two castellazzi et al 2016a 2018 are the most promising techniques for geodetic groundwater depletion monitoring and management at sufficient resolution on one hand grace data are directly quantitative but of horizontal resolution significantly below groundwater management s scales hundreds of km it also vertically aggregates all water storage layers from atmosphere to deep aquifers alley and konikow 2015 on the other hand insar measures ground deformation which in the context of groundwater depletion is conditioned by aquifers physical characteristics compressibility thickness storativity hence while being of largely sufficient resolution for the application scale of meters e g castellazzi et al 2016b 2017 insar data are not directly quantitative without extensive lithological data ground deformation mapping provides an interesting insight into pressure and storage changes in aquifers and aquitards the physical structure of compressible aquifers and aquitards changes in a nearly irreversible inelastic way when the groundwater head reaches unprecedented historical lows while the head declines the increasing hydrostatic pressure in the aquifer leads to pressure conditions beyond the maximum effective stress that it has experienced in the past referred to as the pre consolidation stress biot 1941 at the surface ground subsidence occurs which may cause damage to infrastructure typically such deformation is primarily visible along linear structures such as pipes canals and roads perpendicular to strong deformation gradients e g castellazzi et al 2017 reciprocally the detection of ground deformation allows detecting unsustainable groundwater extraction given that aquifers are sufficiently compressible to respond to the pressure loss beyond detection thresholds chaussard et al 2014a castellazzi et al 2018 however applications of large scale aquifer deformation data to groundwater science and management are still very limited mostly due to challenges related to data acquisition handling and processing sar science and related ground deformation monitoring techniques insar have evolved rapidly in the last few years such advancements are fostered by the increasing availability of sar datasets and the development of processing algorithms and software tools the sentinel 1 satellites part of the third generation of sar platforms have been a game changer they are the first globally acquiring sar systems optimized for insar ground deformation retrieval e g they are specifically designed with a sufficient high repeat pass frequency and spatial resolution for production of accurate ground deformation maps rucci et al 2012 sentinel 1 satellites use a specific acquisition strategy to cover all continents at a 12 day repeat path frequency called terrain observation with progressive scans topsar which is a modified version of the scansar imaging mode used in previous generations of sar satellites de zan and guarnieri 2006 the integration of sentinel 1 data into the science community has led to major technical advancements in insar science such as real time low latency monitoring of deformation raspini et al 2018 and has opened doors for deformation monitoring at unprecedented scales e g novellino et al 2017 insar stacking techniques such as small baseline subset sbas berardino et al 2002 persistent scatterers interferometry psi ferretti et al 2001 and all other variants see pepe and calò 2017 and crosetto et al 2016 for a description of the most common algorithms allow discriminating ground deformation from the major noise source affecting radar phase shifts i e the atmospheric delay corresponding to differences in the atmosphere composition between two acquisitions in all processing approaches stacking consists in compiling phase shift observations over a large array of image pairs selected along a dense sar image time series which allows separating ground deformation patterns from temporally varying phase shifts due to atmosphere density changes while the insar stacking techniques have been shown as highly efficient if used in an appropriate manner its implementation over large scales is still relatively unexplored principally due to difficulties inherent to processing parameterization the handling of large datasets and the interpretation of insar results over a wide array of land cover types in fact most applications of insar apply either on local scales volcanoes cities mountain slopes unstable coastal areas or apply on large scale for sudden displacements which do not require time series analysis and interferogram stacking e g earthquakes in the last years several large scale insar time series applications were performed in southwestern

motagh 2017 in the uk novellino et al 207 sowter et al 2017 and in china daout et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 however only few of these large scale studies focus on ground deformation related to groundwater extraction chaussard et al 2014b castellazzi et al 2018 ojha et al 2018 2020 in australia insar has been used to investigate various sources of ground deformations including mining ge et

change are rare with only parker et al 2017 and ng et al 2015 discussing groundwater storage change as a potential explanation for deformation anomalies observed over the perth and gippsland basins respectively the difficulties of monitoring large scale groundwater depletion in regional australia the recognized potential of applying insar products to monitor large scale groundwater depletion and the absence of case studies on such applications in australia motivate the research presented in this paper how can c band insar be applied for groundwater depletion mapping over extensive areas of intensive groundwater extraction this is particularly important in regional australia where the low spatial density of monitoring bores and remoteness challenges field investigations here we explore the value of insar data derived from the c band sentinel 1 mission the only large scale sar dataset available in australia to map groundwater over extraction we present a series of insar processing performed over three regions of australia where groundwater depletion has been reported in the past and confront the results to proxies for insar noise levels e g land use maps and in situ groundwater level data we also explore how deformation unrelated to aquifers appears in insar deformation maps intended for groundwater depletion mapping 2 study areas three regions of australia are presented the perth basin in western australia pwa fig 1 a northern new south wales nnsw fig 1b and southern nsw snsw fig 1c the latter covers the nsw queensland border and is spread equally across both states they are referred to as pwa nnsw and snsw throughout the paper respectively and are covered by six insar processing areas referred to as p1 to p6 throughout this article fig 1 these areas were chosen for the important groundwater depletion reported in literature barron et al 2011 2014 bureau of meteorology 2019 leblanc et al 2009 and for the important reliance of anthropogenic activities upon groundwater resources this section presents the three study areas and their main topographical climatic and hydrogeological attributes to prepare for interpretation of the insar signals we also discuss the presence of fine grained interbeds or aquitards prone to deformation within or between the aquifers as well as clay in surficial soils the perth basin in western australia pwa fig 1a surrounds the city of perth 2 m inhab the capital of the state of western australia three major aquifers occur within the basin an unconfined surficial aquifer of the swan coastal plain and two cretaceous and jurassic confined aquifers the leederville and yarragadee aquifers both are composed mostly of sandstone shales and siltstone the shallower leederville formation occurs from 50 to 500 m below ground surface and the deeper yarragadee aquifer extends up to a depth of 2 km davidson 1995 the leederville formation is composed of tidally influenced deltaic deposits and hence can be dominated by either mud or sand depending on the level of marine energy leyland 2012 hence within some of the members of the leederville formation parts of the sandstone are clayey the leaderville aquifer is either confined by overlying aquitards such as the kardinya shale belonging to the coolenya group or connected with the superficial aquifer where a pliocene unconformity led to significant erosion of the coolyena group it is underlain and separated from the deeper yarragadee formation by aquitards such as the south perth shale or confining strata of the parmelia group leyland 2012 baddock and johnson 2018 the decline of groundwater levels in the perth basin has been affecting all major aquifers of the basin while surficial clays occur in patches near the darling fault soils are mostly sandy the perth basin sits within a graben its eastern boundary the darling fault is easily visible on both topography and mean annual precipitation maps fig 2 a1 b1 annual precipitation ranges from 450 mm yr upper right corner fig 2b1 to 1200 mm yr around and beyond the darling fault land use is urban around perth and is highly heterogeneous around the city dryland cropping grazing and nature conservation areas are present in similar proportions and forests are dominant beyond the darling fault fig 2c1 the nnsw area fig 1b encompasses the condamine culgoa the moonie the border rivers the gwydir and the namoi surface water catchments fig 1b the area includes a set of alluvial aquifers surrounded by and sometimes overlaying jurassic and cretaceous sedimentary rock formations and tertiary basalts dafny and silburn 2014 aquifer confinement tends to increase around paleo valleys where alluvium thickness and heterogeneity increases creating semi confined and sometimes localized confined aquifer conditions kelly et al 2014 the lower namoi and lower gwydir basins are characterised by two quaternary alluvial aquifers overlying the deeper mesozoic palaeozoic gunnedah and surat basin sequences that contain hydrocarbon formations the quaternary sequence consists of a surficial aquifer commonly referred to as narrabri and gunnedah formations the narrabri formation only occurs in the upper namoi and lower gwydir basins and consists mainly of clays with minor sand and gravel beds and hence provides generally low yielding aquifers with approximately 30 m in average thickness williams 1986 sws 2011 the gunnedah formation extends across the upper and lower namoi as well as lower gwydir basins consists predominantly of gravel and sand with minor clay beds with up to 115 m and hence is the principal aquifer used for irrigation it is confined where it underlies the narrabri formation williams 1986 sws 2011 while in the namoi basin the two formations have been found to have good hydraulic connectivity mcneilage 2006 in the lower gwydir basin the narrabri and gunnedah basins are separated by a thick low permeability clay layer menció et al 2013 barrett 2018 in the lower namoi where the narrabri formation does not occur the gunnedah formation is the uppermost aquifer but is underlain by the cubbaroo formation which infill the pre tertiary paleochannels of the lower namoi with sand and gravel with interbedded clay williams 1986 the eastern part of the nnsw area fig 1b p3 p4 and parts of p2 is covered by clay rich soils referred to as vertosols with clay content in the range 45 65 across the namoi gwydir and border rivers alluvial valleys ahmad 1996 viscarra rossel 2011 while altitudes above 500 m are present on the eastern and southern boundaries of p3 fig 2a2 most of the area is flat and within the 100 300 m elevation range a strong east west precipitation gradient is observed ranging from 1000 mm yr in the east to 400 mm yr in the western boundary of the sar imagery footprint fig 2b2 land use is dominated by grazing and dryland cropping patches of irrigated cropping areas occur around the intensive groundwater extraction areas fig 2c2 the snsw area fig 1c encompasses the northern section of the murray riverina the billabong yanco the murrumbidgee the lachlan and parts of the benanee willandra catchments it is located over a large riverine plain with two main aquifer units the deep basal formation from the renmark group part of the murray darling basin up to 300 m thick at the western section of the area and thinning westward brown 1990 and a surficial aquifer from the sheparton formation the latter forms the large riverine plain surficial aquifer it is 50 125 m thick and is separated from the renmark group by 60 m thick coarse grained aquifer unit unconsolidated and poorly consolidated clay occur within the surficial aquifer timms and acworth 2002 clay rich soils occur throughout the riverine plain and include a large patch of vertosols fig 1 common area of p5 and p6 nsw and oeh 2020 the rest of the study area is covered by soils with clay content in the range 25 40 this study area is mostly flat with elevation close to sea level 50 150 m asl with little local variations over the north eastern section of the sar image footprints fig 2a3 mean annual precipitation rates are typical for arid climates in the range of 300 600 mm yr fig 2b3 land use is similar to the nnsw area with a significantly higher proportion of grazing native vegetation on the western side of the study area patches of irrigated cropping occur in the centre of the p6 footprint fig 2c3 3 data and methods 3 1 insar processing in this study a total of 385 images were used to cover 347 800 km2 with ground deformation maps 385 interferometric wide iw sar images from the sentinel 1 satellites were downloaded in single look complex slc level 1 format through the sentinel australasia regional access portal sara https copernicus nci org au they form six time series covering the three study regions as shown in figs 1 and 2 orbital data were updated to the latest version precise orbit ephemerides or poeorb before processing 2311 phase shit maps or interferograms were created from the six radar image time series they were corrected for topographic fringes using a 30 m resolution digital elevation model derived from data acquired by the panchromatic remote sensing instrument for stereo mapping prism aboard alos takaku et al 2014 2018 interferograms were filtered using an adaptative goldstein filter goldstein and werner 1998 of alpha values in the range 0 3 2 5 and were unwrapped using a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm insar processing was performed using sarscape 5 5 1 and its implementation of the intermittent small baseline subset isbas insar stacking technique sowter et al 2013 bateson et al 2015 which is a variation of the original sbas berardino et al 2002 isbas is similar to sbas but the requirements of the temporal stability of coherence during pixel selection is replaced by a statistical constraint usually based on a proportion of the total number of interferograms and or images in the stack this allows intermittently coherent pixels to be accounted in the phase to displacement inversion and included in the final results this usually increases coverage over natural sparsely vegetated land covers in urban settings coherence is typically stable along the sar time series hence isbas behaves like sbas this processing design optimizes coverage over natural settings but as displacement values for each pixel in the final result are not based on a unique stable number of images and or interferograms the noise level is spatially variable bateson et al 2015 cigna and sowter 2017 alshammari et al 2019 the sbas inversion which extracts displacements from the interferogram stack for selected pixels is based on a singular value decomposition svd approach and on a linear deformation model it is also weighted to coherence i e the importance of interferogram pixels in the phase to displacement inversion is relative to their coherence a 2 steps atmospheric filtering consisting in a low pass spatial filter and a high pass temporal filter was applied to extract the atmospheric component of the phase delay the insar processing is unconstrained i e it do not rely on any a priori information the corrections incl referencing to a stable point were at first based on considering a series of stable points where aquifer related deformation has minimal chances to occur i e far from well field over stable rocks or coarse grained sediment layers then a trial and error approach was used to iteratively change the reference points until a spatially consistent deformation map was created free of any obvious shift patterns or artefacts table 1 summarizes other processing parameters such as the number of images interferograms and looks the pixel aggregation factor to obtain square pixels and increase the signal to noise ratio fig 3 shows the connection graphs for each insar stack note that p4 uses almost all images from p3 94 97 with a longer temporal baseline threshold resulting in an interferogram stack containing 60 more interferograms for all study areas atmospheric phase filtering was based on a 1200 m low pass filter and a 120 days high pass filter interferogram pixels were considered only if the spatial insar coherence was above 0 2 as a coherence mask applied to each interferogram for p1 pwa area pixels with temporal stack coherence below 0 3 were not considered masking obvious atmospheric artefacts beyond the darling fault the major topographic change delimiting the perth basin a least square fitting approach was used to generate average velocity maps from the insar ground deformation time series the maps show average vertical ground displacement after being converted from line of sight los along the satellite acquisition geometry displacements assuming the horizontal component of displacement negligible as expected in most cases of poro elastic aquifer deformations e g castellazzi et al 2017 3 2 auxiliary data reference and validation areas interpretation of the results is supported through comparison with several auxiliary datasets monthly precipitation converted from daily data surface clay content land use classification general hydrography lines and catchment boundaries monthly precipitation data was aggregated from daily precipitation time series available from the bureau of meteorology website http www bom gov au as an approximation of the spatial distribution of the percentage of clay near the surface we generated a soil clay content map defining the volumetric proportion of clay in the first meter of soil from modelled soil properties available from espade v2 0 nsw and oeh 2020 as depth weighted average from clay 0 30 cm and clay 30 100 cm espade is a google maps based information system that allows free access to soil and land information over the state of new south wales the modelling methods and data sources are described in nsw and oeh 2018 land use classification from nsw dpie 2019 nsw landuse 2017 v1 1 over the lower namoi region is used to study the relations between anthropogenic activities on the land surface mostly cropping related activities and insar derived displacements major hydrography network lines are overlaid on insar displacement maps throughout this paper and are derived from crossman and li 2015 the precision of sbas insar over vegetated land cover depends on several factors including the number of sar images used and the density of the connection graph fig 2 over a given pixel or area the land cover and use and the quality of the displacement model fitting over the interferogram stack stack temporal coherence as the isbas techniques allow pixels to be included into the inversion while they are partially below the coherence threshold along the interferogram stack such thresholding plays a major role in defining the level of noise in the results in fact over vegetated land covers these two thresholds table 1 typically define the trade off between the final coverage of the measurement and its precision permissive thresholds usually decrease the precision and increases the coverage and vice versa in all cases additional knowledge on the spatio temporal patterns greatly helps in interpreting the results and discriminating noise to signal anywhere the signal to noise ratio snr is low the sensitivity of insar observations toward groundwater depletion related displacements is assessed for each study areas first the large scale insar mean vertical velocity maps the ones based on multiple swath nnsw and snsw are merged by matching histograms over the common coverage and a stable reference area is used to correct each large scale map i e the mean value over the reference area is subtracted to the rest of the map second three spatial subsets in the range of 10 200 km2 expected as stable are manually selected within each study region these validation areas are selected on the basis on the following criteria 1 no major groundwater withdrawal activities or no notable groundwater level records beyond previously established historical lows critical heads during the observation period 2 no deformation according to past studies for pwa parker et al 2017 and nnsw ross and jeffery 1991 3 no particular or notable slopes or atmospheric perturbation patterns e g east of the darling fault in perth basin 4 distant from the stable reference areas selected for correction processing residuals during insar processing a histogram analysis is performed at each of these spatial subsets and interpreted with knowledge of the dominant land use occurring at these locations 3 3 field monitoring of aquifer deformation the lower namoi aquifer p4 fig 1 has been subject to several studies on land subsidence related to groundwater depletion and has now one of the most complete records of land subsidence data in australia ross and jeffery 1991 ali et al 2004 this allows the results from processing p4 fig 2 table 1 fig 3 centred over the lower namoi groundwater management area to be compared with in situ data in 1974 and 1981 two types of field monitoring installations where put in place in the lower namoi catchment p4 processing area ross and jeffery 1991 they consist in a set of wells drilled down and cemented to the bedrock called control benchmarks fig 4 b and rods inserted 1 5 m deep at the bottom of 6 m deep boreholes fig 4c called subsidence benchmarks fig 4c d e the former is taken as a stable reference used to survey the latter they are both isolated from the alluvium with pvc tubing while 9 benchmark surveys occured in the 1974 1990 period only a subset of the 41 benchmarks was included in each survey with at maximum 18 and 15 benchmarks during the 1980 and 1981 surveys after a survey gap of 29 years the benchmarks were surveyed in may 2019 nine subsidence benchmarks out of the 41 could no longer be located or were destroyed or damaged high chances of error 32 benchmark derived long term time series were usable for comparison with insar results the control benchmarks were surveyed using high precision global navigation satellite system gnss equipment with a static survey technology that involves logging a minimum of 4 control marks at the same time to determine the connections between each other station static observations are made in the field and baseline vectors between the stations are computed according to the surveyor the vertical accuracy of a static survey in an unconstrained least squares adjustment of all observations in the network is less than 30 mm which is consistent with estimated accuracies by the surveyor general of nsw for gnss control network results smk 2019 the static technique with a higher accuracy was chosen only for control benchmarks to limit error propagation from control to subsidence benchmarks in order to survey the 32 subsidence benchmarks within a timely manner a slightly less accurate real time kinematic method rtk was chosen for subsidence benchmarks rtk computes baseline vectors or positions based on reference station s in real time according to the surveyor the estimated vertical accuracy of the rtk technique is 35 mm smk 2019 for the 2019 survey the cumulative elevation error estimate between the static survey of the control benchmarks and the rtk survey of the subsidence benchmarks amounts to a total of 65 mm i e a maximum measurement error of 32 5 mm around the true value assuming that previous surveys were as accurate the error while comparing two surveys is 65 mm for the deformation trends this error was normalised by the period considered to obtain annualised errors for each benchmark the longest and shortest periods of such benchmark data are 45 and 38 years respectively 1974 2019 1981 2019 therefore the annualised error in the trends varies between 1 4 and 1 7 mm yr 65 mm 45yrs and 65 mm 38yrs respectively these least errors are derived based on the assumption that measurement accuracies of historic surveys are potentially worse compared to the 2019 survey we therefore applied a slightly more conservative error of 2 mm yr to query for benchmarks with trends outside this error margin 3 4 groundwater level monitoring data and processing in situ groundwater level data were downloaded from two portals the water information reporting tool wirt state of western australia for the pwa area and the water nsw real time data portal for all other areas for wells located over the lower namoi catchment p4 fig 1 data were provided directly by the nsw department of primary industries and environment nsw dpie in mid 2019 in situ groundwater level data were processed and interpreted following two steps first trends in head level were computed through a linear least square regression performed over a temporal subset of the groundwater level time series corresponding to the insar study period table 1 second critical head drop was computed as the minimum head level measured during a reference period prior to the start of the insar observation minus the minimum head level measured over the insar observation period table 1 a result of 0 means that level has not decreased below past minimums during the insar period while a positive number suggests that aquifer storage has reached a historical minimum during the insar observation this analysis potentially allows separating elastic and inelastic deformation induced by the dewatering of an aquifer with fine grained interbeds or aquitards to groundwater levels either above or below a previously established critical head respectively for negative or positive trends of groundwater levels located above a constant previously established critical head one can expect elastic i e recoverable compaction and expansion in contrast negative trends of groundwater levels that result in a further decline in critical head may cause inelastic and nonrecoverable land subsidence a quality check was performed by applying a certain data filtering criterion over each groundwater level time series to be only considered for a minimum of 10 measurements over 5 years during the reference period and for a minimum of 6 measurements over at least 2 years during the insar measurement period the analysis retained 661 groundwater level time series which were judged as being of sufficient quality according to these data filtering steps note that our data quality analysis of groundwater levels has unavoidable limitations related to the processing and interpretation of large time series datasets with highly variable temporal increments as for insar processing the criterion applied to the dataset controls the final coverage here groundwater level data density and the noise level in the final groundwater storage trend and critical head drop maps note that well data over the lower namoi catchment processing p4 were not subject to automated data quality checks which was replaced by a visual data quality and density verification for each individual well time series this study area is therefore covered by water data with higher density and quality than other areas 4 results deformation signals unrelated to groundwater storage change limit our ability to map and monitor groundwater storage change with insar hence they are considered as noise for that specific application this multiple source noise is assessed here by analysing insar results in several ways first part 4 1 we analyse our insar results over a well studied area the lower namoi catchment p4 fig 1 it is to our knowledge the only area equipped with field installation for long term subsidence monitoring in australia this area is also expected to be among the most challenging for the intended application due to the presence of vertosols i e soils with high content of montmorillonite clay minerals that shrink during the dry season and expand after rain events seasons see fig 4a and e second part 4 2 we analyse the correlations between land use and insar displacements to separate noise from surficial clays to other potential noise sources third part 4 3 we perform a large scale assessment of noise over all processing sites p1 to p6 by analysing histograms of insar results section 3 2 where displacements related to groundwater are not expected to occur this last analysis gives insight over the scalability of the first two noise analysis and is required for any further large scale interpretation of insar data in australia finally we present and interpret large scale deformation maps and use groundwater levels to help identifying groundwater related anomalies throughout the three regions of study 4 1 analysing the influence of surficial clays on insar deformation at catchment scale the p4 processing area fig 1 corresponding to the lower namoi catchment is characterized by a particularly clay rich surficial soil layer referred to as vertosols this study area is a typical case of intense groundwater extraction related to irrigation of the murray darling basin groundwater is extracted from alluvial aquifer units largely disconnected from upstream and downstream aquifers but connected through mostly ephemeral surface water streams in such hydrological settings the flat terrain makes hydrological connectivity particularly sensitive to ground level changes hence the strong motivation in monitoring its amplitude and anthropogenic controls the groundwater management area of the lower namoi used for groundwater flow modelling by the water management agency encompasses a dense irrigation bore network fig 5 a analysis of well head drop beyond critical heads within the groundwater management area lower namoi groundwater source is presented in fig 5b and c while in situ ground level displacement monitoring from repetitive benchmark surveys is presented in fig 5d the subsidence rates measured in situ are by design insensitive to deformation of the vertosols fig 4c and by encompassing more than four decades significantly less sensitive to short term climate variability than the 3 5 years of observation provided by insar fig 5b highlights that most groundwater level time series show significant critical head drop of more than 8 m during the full history of head level record encompassing the last 50 years for most wells it explains the subsidence rates observed in situ in the past over that region as reported by ross and jeffery 1991 multi decadal land subsidence rates beyond detection threshold occurs in 5 out of 32 benchmarks with a maximum value of 0 85 cm yr 37 4 cm over 44 years in contrast fig 5c highlights the almost complete absence or relatively small values of critical head drop during the 3 5 years insar observation period insar derived vertical velocity is shown on fig 6 b for low clay content areas and 6c for high clay content areas we note that insar results do not show any anomaly coinciding with the subsidence area observed from in situ data figs 5d and 6c the absence of critical head drop as driver for inelastic subsidence over the insar period and the lack of correlation between insar results and in situ observed subsidence suggests that insar measurements are dominated by processes unrelated to groundwater storage changes the difference between in situ and insar results lies in the sensitivity of insar to surficial clays the influence short term climate variability on them and potentially other anthropogenic factors such as cropping activities such observation allows us to use the insar results for inferring the maximum influence of surficial clays and cropping activities over insar derived vertical displacements without significant bias from groundwater related signals notably the alluvial groundwater extraction area where most irrigation bores are located fig 5a spatially corresponds to high clay content in the range 45 65 within the top metre fig 6a c and thus a noisier insar signal for groundwater interpretation purposes in comparison the non alluvial surroundings where no groundwater extraction occurs show fractional clay content in the range 10 45 fig 6a and a cleaner insar signal fig 6b as high clay content soils mostly occur within the alluvial plain there is a potential for the non groundwater insar deformation signal to spatially correlate to a potential groundwater signal which could be spatially constrained by the alluvial plain boundary this confirms the importance of accounting for signals from clayey soils before any hydrogeological interpretation of the insar signal in such settings a correlation analysis between insar measurements and clay content in the first metre of soil is presented fig 7 we note an obvious near linear behaviour of the 5 95 confidence interval of insar deformation rates in relation to the clay content increments for the three main years of the insar observation period fig 7a and a temporally varying response fig 7b c d the surficial deformation signals vary with time the clay related noise level is particularly strong in 2016 but is steadily decreasing in each of the two subsequent years such temporal pattern seems related to short term climate variability fig 8 the precipitation rates in 2016 were close to the 2005 2015 monthly averages the monthly precipitation rates over the two following years are significantly below the 2005 2015 monthly averages this suggests that precipitation has had more impact on the insar noise 2016 than the additional groundwater fed irrigation required by the crops during the drier years 2017 2018 it is important to note that this analysis is limited to the uppermost metre of soil and hence cannot prove whether deeper soil horizons contribute to ground level changes persistent scatterer interferometry psi might largely be insensitive to surficial clays as persistence of high insar coherence is required at the pixel selection step to verify that hypothesis while illustrating the coverage trade off of using psi over vegetated areas two tests were performed using the same dataset as p4 and are presented in fig s1 sup mat through these results we note that performing psi over a temporal subset including only dry years 2017 in this case allows a notable gain in coverage at the cost of an increased sensitivity to deformation from surficial clays fig s1b a quantitative evaluation of the insar noise related to surficial clays is presented in table 2 and least square regression models are presented in table s1 given the near linear relation between the clay content and insar displacements see r square values in table s1 we suggest that a linear regression is efficient at predicting the influence of surficial clays over insar measurements by multiplying the slope rates of both the 5 and 95 curves with 50 corresponding to the amount of clay occurring where the groundwater related signal is measured through in situ data benchmarks 27 and 28 fig 5d we approximate the signal deviation related to surficial clays that is masking the detection of the expected subsidence the half width between the 5th and 95th percentile curves or the half confidence interval is interpreted as the mean noise level which needs to be accounted for hydrogeological interpretation of insar data in other words a groundwater signal will need to locally shift the range of insar displacement values sufficiently in any direction positive or negative to be detectable this analysis provides valuable information for applying insar to groundwater applications in similar settings in terms of soil clay content and land cover usage a signal deviation of 53 mm yr occurs during the wetter year e g 2016 table 2 and it decreases to 21 mm yr for the drier years 2017 and 2018 in the best cases i e with a noise level at 21 mm yr over areas with 50 clay similar to where the aquifer compaction signal is expected and assuming the signal detected through in situ data fig 5d as temporally constant a snr of 0 4 is obtained the values provided in table 2 are a conservative estimation of the clay related noise as 1 the regression accounts for a large bracket of clay content values and 2 a potential groundwater anomaly may have a distinct spatial pattern allowing its separation even if below the 5 95 confidence interval in addition we note that accounting for 50 clay will be sufficient to account for the noise of 50 of the p4 area as 50 of the area is covered with soils of clay content above 50 espade v2 0 nsw and oeh 2018 2020 this analysis does not suggest that clay is the only factor contributing to the insar noise hence to further explore its controlling factors we propose a correlation analysis between insar displacements and land cover in the following section 4 2 analysing the influence of cropping activities on insar at catchment scale land use classes 330 cropping 430 irrigated cropping 210 grazing native vegetation and 320 grazing modified pastures represent together around 90 of the surface area of p4 table 3 cropping and irrigated cropping areas have standard deviations higher double or more than any other land use classes this highlights the difficulty of inferring groundwater depletion related displacements over areas subject to frequent modifications of the soil surface with c band insar which shows a high proportion of direct surface scattering over cropping areas typical for insar results land use classes corresponding to hard surfaces such as 540 residential and farm infrastructure or 550 services have mean vertical velocity values close to 0 a relatively low standard deviation and a narrow confidence interval we also note the higher noise level observed in classes 620 river and 630 reservoir dam fig 9 table 3 they correspond to areas with constant changes at the surface due to e g sediment transport the superior insar signal amplitude observed over 330 cropping and 430 irrigated cropping land cover classes in comparison to natural areas classes 110 120 130 suggests that cropping activities over clayey soils also contribute to the insar signal in addition to the moisture related volumetric changes of the surficial clays and the insar noise related to low density vegetation and low coherence the insar displacements observed in relation to surficial clay content fig 7 might also be impacted by cropping activities as they occur conjointly with high clay content typically above 45 fig 6 in order to discriminate the impacts of clay or cropping activities over insar measurements the width of the 5 95 range of displacement values is analysed for different land use classes fig 10 by comparing the curves fig 10a and b we note that cropping activities lead to an increase in measured insar displacements in the range 20 50 of fractional clay content as highlighted by the inflated curves in fig 10b irrigation activities decrease the expected difference between dry 2016 and wet years 2017 2018 fig 10c particularly in the range 40 60 of fractional clay content it is important to note that while insar measurement values for areas below 40 of clay content seems inferior in fig 10c than in the other curves the measurements depend on few values and might be considered unreliable graph d fig 10 aggregates several classes not impacted by any cropping activities and is used for comparison with observations for the cropping fig 10b and irrigated cropping fig 10c classes the value ranges are considerably smaller than in all other curves which demonstrates the influence of cropping activities on insar measurements in soils containing 40 60 clay 73 of the insar coverage and 84 of all cropping areas in p4 cropping activities increase the width of the insar measurement range by 37 6 9 95 while irrigated cropping activities increase it by 37 9 5 01 we conclude that within this clay content range no major difference between cropping and irrigated cropping activities are observed 4 3 large scale analysis of non groundwater signals across insar deformation maps a large scale analysis is necessary to better understand how the noise sources identified in previous sections impact large scale insar maps and how results from previous sections can be extrapolated to the rest of australia several spatial subsets referred to as validation areas are selected they are influenced by different sources of noise but not prone to groundwater depletion related displacements fig 11 histograms of the insar mean vertical deformation maps are analysed and interpreted in relation to the land cover and distance to reference areas selected for ground referencing the insar maps table 4 over pwa validation areas are selected east of the perth basin and above the darling fault sharp boundary on fig 2 a1 where no alluvial aquifer prone to deformation occurs signal goes up to 2 75 mm yr over grazing modified pasture northeast of the city of perth measurements are within the same range in other areas over the darling fault table 4 a2 and a3 which corresponds to land cover with similar vegetation densities in the nnsw area the maximum signal reaches 13 82 mm yr in a native vegetation area distant from the reference area b1 other measurements are in the same range of values with 11 78 and 9 06 mm yr over b2 and b3 respectively a slight positive shift of 2 to 4 mm yr median value is observed for all calibration sites in the snsw area the maximum shift reaches 6 11 mm yr in c3 the further away from the reference area this site also corresponds predominantly to a dryland cropping area hence a higher deviation is expected due to human influence on the soil surface as seen in the previous section the two other validation sites c1 and c2 are located over native vegetation areas less impacted by human activities hence their deviation from zero displacement is lower reaching 4 66 mm yr the median value of all histograms is positive and is potentially correlated with the distance to the reference area this assessment provides guidance for further interpretation of isbas insar results and allows considering noise levels for detection of groundwater depletion related displacements over non urban areas where according to the isbas strategy the connection graph and interferogram density on which the deformation measurement relies varies for each pixel we note a strong discrepancy in the noise and deviation levels with 5 95 confidence intervals of 2 75 1 03 11 78 13 82 and 4 33 6 11 mm yr in pwa nnsw and snsw respectively from this analysis the land cover seems to have a strong influence on the width of the value range the vegetation density strongly determines the density and quality of distributed scatterers controlling sar wave reflectivity and temporal phase stability higher vegetation density also increases the density of intermittent scatterers if vegetation structure and density change throughout the year this decreases the reliability of the isbas processing by decreasing the interferogram and image density that the ground deformation values rely on over these areas hence the higher noise levels in the isbas approach the number of images and interferograms considered in the phase to displacement inversion varies spatially within the selected thresholds but such variation is not easily and systematically accounted for in the interpretation for example a notable difference is observed between the snsw and the nnsw regions with higher noise levels observable in the nnsw region although similar thresholds for considering intermittent scatterers were applied during both insar processing more interferograms above the coherence threshold could be integrated in the snsw area leading to a lower noise level to accurately interpret isbas results and its spatially varying noise levels it is important to assess noise levels over each study site for each land cover type and in australia for a representative clay content range 4 4 identifying groundwater signals across large scale insar deformation maps analysis of the influences of clay and land cover presented in the previous sections help defining the thresholds beyond which the signal can be considered as anomalous thus the colour scales of all ground velocity maps showed thereafter matches the observations from this analysis and conservative ranges of 3 3 15 15 and 6 6 mm yr will be considered within the noise level of insar for detection of groundwater related signals for pwa nnsw and ssnw respectively figs 12 14 and 16 present mean ground displacement rates for the three areas accounting for the full length of the time series unless noted otherwise this section discusses potential groundwater related deformations for all three study areas 4 4 1 perth basin the pwa area shows several temporally dynamic displacement patterns fig 12 north of the city of perth land subsidence is observed in patches during the full length of the time series fig 12a and was accentuated during the first third of the insar period fig 12b when it reached values in the range 12 6 mm yr of vertical velocity sandy soils over most of that area are not particularly prone to displacements suggesting that such displacements are related to the dewatering of fine grained interbeds and aquitards a positive ground uplift anomaly up to 12 mm yr is observed in the central part the frame fig 12c corresponding to the northern suburbs of the city of perth it spatially coincides with a managed aquifer recharge mar injection site suggesting an elastic reaction to artificially increased groundwater storage we note a largely asymmetric reaction of the aquifer fig 12c which potentially corresponds to lithological discontinuities preventing the pressure to propagate northward compressibility or thickness and controlling the spatial patterns of the poro elastic reaction in the southern suburbs contrasting patterns of displacements appear with spatial high frequencies of displacement velocity in the order 12 12 mm yr across parts of the time series fig 12d the spatial patterns and the location of the anomalies near the darling fault where high clay content soils occur suggest that they are related to surficial clays rather than groundwater storage change displacements patterns showed on fig 12 are compared to head level trends and critical head drop in 387 wells screened in the three main aquifers of the perth basin fig 13 we observe negative trends in most wells north of perth upper square fig 13a b c with 70 of the wells showing values below 25 cm yr in the deeper yarragadee aquifer fig 13a and 45 of the wells showing values below 10 cm yr in the leederville aquifer fig 13b the surficial aquifer shows a contrasting reaction with both negative and positive groundwater level trends no significant critical head drop is observed during the insar observation period in the yarragadee aquifer fig 13d throughout the basin conversely critical heads in the leederville aquifer have dropped notably in wells northwest of the city of perth and in the southern part of the basin while the former does not coincide with any significant negative anomaly in the displacement map fig 12a the latter coincides with patterns shown on fig 12d suggesting that part of the contrasting signal observed might actually be attributable to groundwater depletion however it is not possible to discriminate the impacts of surficial clays and groundwater storage on displacement patterns at this stage critical heads have dropped throughout the basin in the surficial aquifer a particularly high density of bores with drops in critical head can be found in the most southern section of the perth basin with 50 of the wells showing critical head drop beyond 30 cm during the insar observation period insar signal in this section of the perth basin below square d murray catchment fig 12a is particularly noisy due to the vegetation cover however negative displacements subsidence are observed even where insar coherence is high 4 4 2 northern nsw a large scale deformation map is created for the nnsw area by aggregating the vertical displacements maps derived from p2 p3 and p4 fig 14 a the mean value was used for pixels covered with more than one insar map it is important to keep in mind that the eastern side of this study area the eastern sentinel 1 swath encompasses the period from late 2015 to late 2018 whereas the western side encompasses a shorter period from 2017 to late 2018 table 1 groundwater levels and in situ benchmark data were shown previously section 4 1 and 4 2 at the scale of the lower namoi catchment central part of the eastern swath the anomaly threshold is set to values beyond a large bracket of 15 15 mm yr in the nnsw area in agreement to the high noise level related to high clay content and cropping activities discussed in previous sections most of the area shows values within the normal range and only few outliers can be observed the western part of the map covers the condamine culgoa catchment which is mostly stable apart from a patch in the most western part of the map fig 14 no groundwater extraction occurs over that area the most plausible cause for this signal to occur being a locally increased insar noise level due to a locally denser vegetation cover the eastern section of the namoi alluvium fig 14b shows a slight uplift but with no particular spatial correlation with occurrence of irrigation bores suggesting that such signal is attributable to movements from surficial soils beyond the typical threshold discussed previously finally positive displacements occur over the upper namoi catchment fig 14c where a high density of irrigation bores occurs this suggests that no groundwater depletion beyond historical minimums has occurred over that area during the insar period two negative anomalies are also noted in the upper mid section of fig 14c corresponding to two active quarries signals in the range 15 30 mm yr are detected at the upper right section of fig 14c where strong topographic changes occur it is attributable to residuals from topographic corrections of interferograms note that active coal seam gas csg well fields occur in the most northern section of the western swath p2 fig 1 however no obvious deformation signal beyond noise thresholds could be attributed to csg activities analysis of groundwater levels over the lower namoi catchment fig 5b c and at the scale of the eastern sentinel 1 swath fig 15 suggests that strong decline in groundwater levels occurs during the insar observation period fig 15a however no or insignificant critical head drop occurred fig 15b during the same period this suggests an absence of inelastic compaction during the insar era castellazzi and schmid 2020 analysed the temporal patterns of groundwater level time series over that area and found that the last historical groundwater level minima and the potentially related inelastic reaction occurred in or prior to the 1990 s while an elastic reaction remains possible it is probably small in comparison to the noise level fig 5d given the low amplitude of inelastic deformation measured through 44 years of benchmark surveys fig 5d such elastic reaction is likely a weak signal in comparison to other signals from surficial noise sources by comparing the long term subsidence signal measured in situ with the long term critical head drop fig 5 we understand that this aquifer is prone to low rates of compaction observable only over decadal timescales at maximum 85 mm per decade on average however the annual subsidence rates observed at maximum 8 5 mm yr fig 5d are far below insar signals attributable to surficial clays and cropping activities table 2 fig 7 which suggests that c band insar is inefficient to retrieve groundwater depletion related subsidence under such conditions according to the insar results and the well data available no ground deformation attributable to groundwater depletion occurs throughout this study area however given the specificity of the lower namoi catchment it serves as a robust proof of concept to demonstrate the limitations of detecting groundwater compaction signals with insar in an area with small long term subsidence rates low coherence specific to land use changes and high sensitivities to climate variability wet years and the related swelling and subsequent shrinking of clays in vertosols prevalent in this area 4 4 3 southern nsw similar to the nnsw area a large scale deformation map for the snsw area is produced by aggregating results from the p5 and p6 processing after conversion from los to vertical displacements we note several anomalies beyond the bracket 6 6 mm yr used for this study area the area b fig 16 b is notably affected by cropping activities with displacement rates respecting crop delineation while a vast majority of displacement patterns respecting crop boundaries are positive uplift negative displacement anomalies subsidence are observed in patches along the northern boundary of the lachlan catchment fig 16b while this area coincides with an important density of irrigation bores the spatial patterns also look similar to area c fig 16c an area affected by surface water sediment transport in both area b and c we note that negative deformation anomalies tend to align to form corridors while the absence of irrigation bores rules out groundwater depletion as a plausible cause for area c it remains a plausible cause for area b at the centre of the map a subsidence patch with maximum amplitude of 15 mm yr up to 23 mm yr locally is observed it coincides with a high density of irrigation bores fig 16d suggesting a plausible relation to groundwater extraction we note that both anomalies fig 16b d are within a snr range of 1 8 2 5 if considering a maximum noise level of 6 11 mm yr table 4 anomaly d fig 16d occurred during the two last thirds of the deformation time series see mean subsidence rates analysis performed over temporal subsets on fig s2 sup mat conversely anomaly c is only observable at the beginning of the insar period these observations on the timing of the ground level change greatly supports the interpretation anomaly c only occurs after rainy events and is a sediment transport signal surrounding river channels including signals from bank overflow anomaly d is groundwater related and only occurs during the driest periods coinciding with increased irrigation and low aquifer recharge analysis of groundwater level time series data over the snsw area shows that negative level trends occur in a vast majority of the wells fig 17 a the analysis shows that during the insar observation period 88 of the wells have declined in level by more than 20 cm yr and that 58 of the wells have declined in level by more than 1 m yr this is observed throughout the study area with exception of the southern part of the eastern swath corresponding to the southern border of the billabong yanco catchment fig 1 where no particular anomaly is detected by insar fig 16 analysis of groundwater level time series show that critical head drop beyond 0 5 m during the insar observation period occurred in 32 of the wells fig 17b it also shows a north south gradient with occurrence of critical head drop being more frequent in the southern part of the map than in the north we note that occurrence of irrigation wells fig 16d and negative trends in groundwater levels correlate spatially with the anomaly highlighted by b and d suggesting that these anomalies are related to groundwater extraction the presence of a major surface water stream crossing the area raise questions about potential influence of sediment transport processes on ground level changes however the shape of the anomaly and its correspondence with a major irrigation area suggests that the signal is attributable to groundwater storage change 5 discussion 5 1 value added of intermittent sbas in hydrogeology insar coverage over agricultural areas is influenced by the vegetation type density height controlling the decrease of insar coherence with increasing temporal baselines this coherence baseline relation controls the quantity of valuable interferograms which can be generated from a stack of sar images the temporal dynamics of the displacements and its ability to be captured through a typically linear deformation model are also important this study shows that interpretation of large scale c band insar maps over australia for groundwater science purposes requires accounting for significant non groundwater related deformation sources clay cropping activities and soil moisture changes combination of insar deformation data with lithological data or remotely sensed temporal gravity data from grace satellites leads toward high resolution and volumetric estimation of groundwater storage change which is a high value product to support large scale groundwater management castellazzi et al 2018 2020 this strongly motivates further research to understand how to interpret large scale insar data in regional australia while c band sar data availability is now global its application in regional australia is limited by the absence of persistent phase signal coherence over irrigated crops where groundwater irrigation and depletion typically occur unlike with l band castellazzi et al 2018 covering cropping area with c band insar requires the inclusion of intermittently coherent pixels during the inversion stage as allowed by the isbas strategy in the study areas this intermittent coherence corresponds to temporary spaces between young plants crops in winter and intermittent patches of bare soils between native plants in summer the isbas implementation sowter et al 2013 augments the coverage of the final deformation map by adapting the stack density to the intermittent nature of insar coherence obtaining accurate deformation estimates over medium high and or dense persistent vegetation remains impossible with c band sar images following the isbas strategy sowter et al 2013 an allowance for intermittently coherent pixels is used at the pixel selection step a statistical criterion is applied to define the minimum number of interferograms required above the coherence threshold this means that adjacent pixels can be related to different sar image quantity and interferogram stack density while none of these criteria define well the specific dynamic cyclic nature of insar coherence over crops they can have significant influence on the noise level bui et al 2020 for example a stack of 30 images covering one year typical for sentinel 1 and an inversion allowing pixels below the coherence threshold for at least 50 of the images 15 images with coherent interferogram connections will be required to meet the criterion if no further constrain is applied these images could either be spread across the year or only encompass the first half of the study period e g if floods occur during the rest of the sar time series e g over floodplain environments in the former case the gap is compensated by interpolating between data points along the time series and in the latter case by extrapolating the fitted model thus isbas can lead to ambiguous results if the parametrization does not account for the nature and temporal dynamics of the intermittent targets and the deformation signal to recover more research is needed to understand how the coherence criteria should be applied at the pixel selection step to 1 allow covering low coherence areas while containing the noise level 2 define the best practise for deciding on connection graphs and stack density constraints while keeping the deformation maps within an acceptable noise level which would vary greatly depending on the application 5 2 ground displacements and groundwater storage change in australia the three insar maps presented in this study show five anomalies potentially attributable to groundwater storage change four negative storage loss anomalies are identified two in the perth basin one in the murrumbidgee catchment and one in the lachlan catchment one positive storage gain is identified north of the city of perth and is attributable to managed aquifer recharge mar activities their relation to groundwater is suggested by the high density of irrigation bores present at the location of the deformation or at its vicinity or through analysis of water level trends and critical heads from in situ well level time series certain anomalies were not attributable to groundwater either because there were too close to the noise level estimated amplitude of non groundwater signals or because of insufficient comparability with auxiliary data some other anomalies are also unlikely to have links with groundwater storage change and have obvious relations to surficial sediment transport in addition we note several sources of uncertainty which should be accounted for while interpreting insar maps in australia insar signals from high clay content soils occurring over alluvial valleys may spatially coincide with exploited aquifers e g the lower namoi catchment such noise challenges the spatial correlation between deformation and aquifer depletion hence in such settings insar allows informing on potential groundwater related deformation but used alone it is not sufficient to confirm the causal relation between deformation and groundwater storage auxiliary data are necessary to better constrain the interpretation in either the spatial bore location irrigation areas or temporal injections or extraction periods domains finally we note that the recent advancements in c band radar image acquisition and availability repeat path frequency time series length and processing isbas only partially compensate for the low coherence of c band data over groundwater irrigation areas across regional australia as the results still present significant coverage gaps related to low coherence while insar processing is slowly brought to full automation by the science community we note that in australia a significant amount of local hydrogeological knowledge is still required to unleash its full potential for groundwater management applications for any given insar anomaly attributable to groundwater storage in stacked multilayered groundwater flow systems a wide spectrum of possibility exists in terms of storage change in each aquifer to explain the observed signal ambiguity interpretation is easier when only one aquifer occurs or when the aquifer layers can be reasonably considered as one unique semi confined system this challenges interpretation of insar anomaly in regional australia where monitoring bore density is relatively low 5 3 perspectives while insar has been used extensively worldwide it is a relatively new addition in the australian groundwater research toolkit and very few case studies are available to date this paper allows drawing several research axes to fill this gap first we invite for targeted study on the five anomalies discussed in this paper if sufficient lithological constraints on aquifers compressibility thickness and storativity are available deformation anomaly could be transposed into volumes of aquifer storage change for each site this would make these insar results directly digestible in quantitative groundwater management and integrable to typical quantitative methods in hydrogeology to define the groundwater storage anomaly required to produce ground displacements beyond the insar detection threshold we suggest transposing the maximum amplitude of all combined signals non attributable to groundwater into an equivalent groundwater storage change in the recent years insar has brought new perspectives in large scale quantitative groundwater management along two main research ideas the first focused on aquifer scale characterization of the storage ground level relation this support estimation of groundwater storage change where in situ data are insufficient or to fill temporal gaps in monitoring data chaussard et al 2014b reeves et al 2014 such application typically focuses on measuring subtle elastic deformations which requires insar data with sufficient precision millimetre scale the second takes advantage of large scale ground deformation monitoring for detection of inelastic deformation highlighting new historical groundwater level minimums and unsustainable management practices both applications have their respective benefits and can be integrated into management schemes while groundwater is overexploited in several regions of australia none of these two applications have been tested this study helps paving the way toward filling this science gap by providing interpretation keys for large scale insar data across australia the catchment scale analysis presented over the lower namoi catchment can be interpreted as a noisiest worst case scenario as the area is notorious for combining several factors challenging insar processing and result interpretation presence of high proportions of compressible clays vertosols at the surface intense cropping activities and a highly varying climate implying non linearity in the deformation behaviour analysis for this region shows that the mean annual vertical velocity estimates can be deviated by up to 53 mm yr by selecting the most appropriate periods drier climate we note that such deviation can be decreased down to 21 mm yr such detection threshold challenges the use of insar to the most important cases of groundwater depletion across regional australia and potentially makes the retrieval of subtle elastic seasonal deformation from insar impossible 6 conclusion by providing several examples this study assesses the value and limits of insar displacement mapping for detection of groundwater storage anomalies and groundwater management in regional australia it also illustrates the challenges of interpreting displacement maps beyond the regional scale and where some displacement sources can be either spatially similar to the expected groundwater storage anomalies aliasing or of much higher amplitude than any potential groundwater signal masking five negative anomalies subsidence appear to be related to groundwater storage change two in the perth basin one in the murrumbidgee catchment and one in the lachlan catchment one positive anomaly uplift is detected in the perth basin and is related to groundwater level recovery due to managed aquifer recharge in contrast to the most obvious groundwater related land subsidence cases central mexico venice in italy or the central valley in the usa where the relation between groundwater storage loss and subsidence is obvious significant subsidence rates coincides with intense groundwater extraction spatially and temporally a fine scrutiny of potential displacement sources remains necessary before interpreting ground displacements for groundwater management purposes in regional australia more generally and as the research community slowly transitions towards large scale insar applications for groundwater science there is a crucial need for listing quantifying and characterizing all displacement sources affecting earth s surface level the correlation between insar displacements clay content in the surficial layers of soil land use and climate observed in this paper suggest the complexity of the interrelations that may exist between some of these displacement sources interfering with the detection of aquifer deformation signals typical sbas processing of c band sar data do not yield spatially complete deformation maps over crops and usually processing of l band sar data is preferred e g castellazzi et al 2018 while l band data are generally not available over australia the isbas insar technique applied with c band data allows including intermittently coherent targets and increases the coverage of c band insar deformation maps over agricultural areas this unleashes the potential of sentinel 1 data for large scale groundwater science applications the inclusion of intermittently coherent targets needs to be parameterized with care as it also pushes further the maximum noise level of the final insar deformation maps an understanding of the noise level which needs to be accepted to create spatially complete deformation maps the noise coverage trade off as well as noise levels from both natural clay and anthropogenic cropping activities sources is essential and provided in this paper the open access diffusion of l band sar data less sensitive to vegetation from alos 2 and in the future the nisar missions will largely support the creation of large scale deformation maps over low and intermittent vegetation the combination of interferograms from both c and l band sar datasets e g msbas insar samsonov and d oreye 2012 will be an interesting avenue for improving large scale deformation monitoring over crops after accounting for the noise related to non groundwater processes we note that insar is still a valuable tool to support groundwater management in regional australia the use of insar derived deformation to inform and constrain joint groundwater flow and subsidence models relies on prior quantification of the non groundwater related noise in groundwater flow modelling inverse estimation of parameters such as elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients are obtained by assuming that the deformation data is free of non groundwater related signals while past research castellazzi et al 2018 suggests the important potential and value added of combining ground deformation from insar and gnss with time variable gravity data no application have been performed to this date in australia we note however that the important level of noise and interference in insar data will probably limits its value to the most important

from a latitude of 35 cyprus to 65 finland study focus quantification of urban greening effects usually requires relatively complex and integrated models in this contribution we apply well established hydrological biomass and energy balance equations to derive meta models for the estimation of runoff reduction urban surface heating and thermal protection of buildings in order to quantify the effects of the greening of 1 m2 of impervious surface e g roofs sealed ground surfaces and underground parking lots new hydrological insights for the region we propose empirical meta models for the quick appraisal of urban greening benefits including urban runoff reduction due to soil water retention and evapotranspiration land surface temperature reduction reduction of the indoor temperature beneath the greened surface dry biomass growth we show that the choice of vegetation growth parameters has a limited effect on the results although the amount of produced bulk biomass obviously depends on vegetation type the proposed meta models can be applied for the assessment of urban greening benefits at the stage of policy evaluation land planning and the programming of investments at regional or continental scale before undertaking more detailed and site specific calculations as required in the design phase keywords urban greening runoff energy urban heat island climate change mitigation 1 introduction the resilience of cities under climate change is increasingly central in urban planning in europe european commission 2019 and worldwide under sustained global urbanization trends united nations 2019 the impact of urbanization on climate has long been recognized chandler 1962 and mitigation and adaptation strategies are extensively explored among these urban greening has aroused considerable interest as a potential method to mitigate the effects of climate changes at the urban scale particularly urban heat waves droughts and floods plenty of studies have shown that the greening of grey surfaces through a vegetated cover on their top layer can deliver multiple benefits as they shift blue water runoff to green water through evapotranspiration and store and gradually release rain water bowler et al 2010 chang et al 2007 spronken smith and oke 1998 besides improving the urban habitat with positive ecological and human well being effects greened surfaces may deliver at least the following benefits 1 a mitigation of storm water runoff by retaining precipitation depending on the storage capacity allowed by the green surface and the local climatic pattern berndtsson 2010 schultz et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 while surface greening alone has limited mitigating effects on extreme events it can be effectively combined with other flood management measures e g mentens et al 2006 2 a mitigation of urban heat as energy incoming to the surface is used for evapotranspiration instead of being absorbed issa et al 2015 susca et al 2011 this reflects in a potential reduction of the energy needed for the cooling of buildings la roche and berardi 2014 susca et al 2011 3 a fixation of atmospheric co2 into biomass if the biomass is properly managed this could turn into carbon storage moreover the biomass growing on greened surfaces may yield useful staple crops orsini et al 2014 many studies have investigated the beneficial effects of urban greening with a focus on green roofs by means of field measurements an accurate design of these complex systems usually requires rather detailed hydrological thermodynamic and micrometeorological models that must be site specifically applied e g locatelli et al 2014 la roche and berardi 2014 issa et al 2015 these are not practically applicable for the rapid appraisal of benefits at large scale as required in early stages of programming and planning in order to overcome these difficulties in this study we present simple equations able to surrogate more complex models with an acceptable approximation for the general appraisal of policies and investments based on urban greening under varying climate conditions representative of the european climate our equations are not conceived to accurately simulate local dynamics of greened surfaces and only predict relatively simple and aggregated performance indicators of a greening intervention on an urban surface yet their simplicity and immediateness of application make them suitable tools for screening level studies they enable quantitative cost benefit appraisal that would not be possible in policy development and strategic planning in the absence of resources to allocate to more complex modelling 2 materials and methods the work consisted of two stages namely 1 calculation of daily water and energy balances and biomass growth for a 1 m2 impervious area initially without soil grey surface and then covered with soil and vegetation green surface using a combined hydrological biomass growth and energy balance model 2 derivation of monovariate and multivariate regression equations to relate key output variables to appropriate predictors these equations represent meta models aimed at surrogating the underlying models in order to predict specific endpoints in this work we do not restrict the definition of urban greening the calculation applies to any surface initially paved with concrete asphalt tiles or similar materials which is then covered with a layer of soil where vegetation is planted examples of surfaces that can be greened are roofs sealed ground surfaces or covers of underground parking lots we expect that roof surfaces could be only covered with thin soil layers in the most common situations while cases with less stringent structural constraints may warrant thicker soil covers however also on structurally constrained roofs it could be possible to implement discontinuous patches of thicker soils yielding an acceptable average thickness for this reason in the derivation of our meta models we refer to a range of soil thickness beyond what is expected to be realistically applicable to green roofs alone 2 1 input data the input climatic data

temperature tmax and tmin c vapor pressure vap hpa wind speed w m s daily average net short wave radiation rad kj m2 from these data the average temperature tav was calculated as the mean of maximum and minimum temperature the long wave radiation was calculated by the equation proposed in neitsch et al 2011 the potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation see e g neitsch et al 2011 using the height of an herbaceous crop to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance 2 2 combined hydrological biomass and energy balance model applied at the daily scale in the first stage we applied the hydrological model proposed in pistocchi et al 2008 combined with the biomass growth and surface energy balance equations of the well established soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 the equations were solved in matlab r2018a 2 2 1 soil water balance for a specific soil type and thickness actual evapotranspiration aet was estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration et0 and available water neglecting vegetation canopy storage this assumption is practical in order to avoid the need of an explicit water balance for the plants including stem flow and evaporation from the leaves which would arguably represent a higher order refinement beyond the scope and needs of the present assessment with this assumption the hydrological and biomass models become independent of each other the daily precipitation in excess of actual evapotranspiration is assumed to first replete the soil and then to originate runoff the latter lumps together saturation and infiltration excess as well as gravity drainage assumed to happen at the bottom of the soil layer the soil water balance neglects all snow processes in europe these are of relevance at high latitudes and altitudes and during winter when vegetation growth is anyway severely limited by the temperature stress factor and building cooling is not necessary the impact of this simplification on the results of this analysis is therefore anticipated to be negligible 2 2 2 biomass growth model the soil water balance is computed using et0 and provides the soil water content used as an input to determine the water stress conditions possibly faced by plants the potential biomass growth in kg m2 was calculated at daily step using the equations of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 from the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par a function of atmospheric radiation and radiation use efficiency rue of the plant a function of atmospheric vapor pressure the actual biomass growth is then calculated through appropriate temperature and water stress factors depending on soil and weather conditions neitsch et al 2011 2 2 3 energy balance model the net heat flux to the soil surface was calculated as the balance of net long wave radiation net short wave radiation actual evapotranspiration and heat flux through the soil from this we computed the land surface or skin temperature under steady conditions for a 1 m2 surface with soil tsoil and without soil i e the grey surface tgrey the surface temperature in the presence of vegetation tgreen was calculated from tsoil and from the biomass weight load in order to account for the influence of plant canopy on soil temperature neitsch et al 2011 the summer average temperature values where then computed finally the temperature at the bottom of the soil layer tbase was estimated after taking into account the thermal inertia of the soil depending on soil thickness t and soil water content nietsch et al 2011 the difference δtext tgrey tgreen between the surface temperature of the green surface completely covered by vegetation and the external grey surface temperature is an indicator to quantify the improvement of urban microclimate the difference δtint tgrey tbase is instead an indicator of the change in temperature at the outer layer external roof surface of a building and is proportional to the reduction of cooling energy requirements in summer if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled 2 3 choice of soil and vegetation parameters for input to the model and thermal boundary conditions as surface greening requires importing soil specifically gathered for the purpose a medium texture soil is usually to be preferred for agronomic reasons for this reason we referred our calculations to a loamy soil corresponding tothe medium textural class as per wösten et al 1999 see table 2 in pistocchi et al 2008 for the hydrological properties of such soil we considered five soil thicknesses t 0 05 m t 0 10 m t 0 20 m t 0 30 m and t 0 50 m in order to obtain results potentially applicable in different contexts we would like to stress once more that in many cases the soil thickness applicable for the greening of surfaces is limited due to structural or architectural constraints in other cases a thicker layer may be warranted in order to cover the full range of solutions that could be implemented at least in some circumstance including the greening of parts of sealed lots such as parking spaces we developed our calculations for soil thicknesses up to 50 cm furthermore it is reasonable to think that thicker discontinuous soil patches could be also used on roofs while maintaining a compatible average thickness aboveground biomass growth was simulated using the swat model equations we referred to a herbaceous plant representing grassed surfaces with plant growth parameters for medicago sativa alfalfa suggested in swat neitsch et al 2011 these parameters can be regarded as representative of grass in general but affect the final results to a marginal extent as the dry matter potentially produced per unit surface is relatively independent of the herbaceous plant li et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis is presented in appendix a to further corroborate this observation the choice of plants to use in the design of urban greening depends anyway on a number of factors not considered here when the plant reaches maturity we assume it is cut down to the height of 3 cm which is the minimum height suggested from the swat the flow of heat through the soil layer is only relevant to compute indicators of potential energy saving in the cooling of buildings in our exercise it was computed with reference to the scheme of a green roof covering a building with an internal temperature tint 20 c and a transmittance of the roof structure underlying the soil equal to 0 30 w m 2 k 1 the latter can be regarded as a typical european value european insulation manufacturers associations 2017 anyway the results related to temperature differences do not significantly change by changing the inner building temperature tint 2 4 definition of performance indicators and development of meta models for each of the 671 functional urban areas we computed the following performance indicators for the different soil thicknesses and vegetation types with reference to a 1 m2 urban area undergoing greening the average yearly reduction of runoff rr assuming runoff for the urban surface prior to greening equals the average yearly rainfall rav y difference in ground surface temperature δtext expressed in c and averaged over summer months between the soil vegetated surface tgreen and the surface prior to greening tgrey dry biomass production cb espressed in kg m 2 y 1 an indicator of the potential benefit for the cooling of buildings this was defined as the difference in temperature at the outer skin of the roof beneath the soil layer δtint expressed in c and averaged over summer months between the temperature computed for a grey surface tgrey and the temperature at the bottom of the soil tbase in case of greening the indicator δtint is proportional to the change in heat flow from the outside to the inside of a building through a soil covered roof hence to the change in energy required for cooling if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled for each of the above indicators we developed regression equations using weather forcing variables as predictors in particular we considered the annual average of the following variables fig 1 yearly average precipitation rav y mm i e cumulated value in one average year that ranged between 200 and 1600 mm fig 1a average daily short wave radiation rad w m2 that ranged between 100 and 240 w m2 yearly average temperature tmed c ranging between 3 and 20 c yearly average potential evapotranspiration et0av y mm i e cumulated value in one average year that ranged between 400 and 1400 mm fig 1b the humidity index hi r av y et0av y ranges between 0 24 and 2 64 yearly average actual evapotranspiration aet av y mm computed by averaging the daily values obtained with the hydrological model mentioned above and ranging between 150 and 550 mm for a soil 0 30 m thick and with herbaceous plants fig 1c average actual evapotranspiration during summer months aet av s mm ranging between 20 and 250 mm the above predictors can be easily obtained from weather observations with the exception of actual evapotranspiration the latter derives from a water balance and entails a more complex calculation its long term annual average aetav y however can be easily estimated from et0av y and rav y according to a budyko approach budyko 1974 this assumes that the long term annual average aet is essentially a property of the climate and allows its ready calculation as a simple combination of these two predictors in this work we compared aetav y from the daily model simulation with the result of the budyko model finding a good correspondence but with the budyko model predicting aetav y on average 39 higher than the daily step model after dividing the budyko model aetav y by 1 39 the two values can be used interchangeably further details are provided in appendix b we tested linear and non linear univariate regression models by trial and error based on the shape displayed by the scatterplots of the indicators as a function of each of the predictor variables and selected the best performing regressions as suggested meta models with the help of the correlation matrix depicted in table 1 to choose the most appropriate predictors those exhibiting higher r2 value in addition to univariate models we explored how multivariate linear models could improve the prediction of the indicators to this end we tested a few combinations of predictors selected on the basis of correlation with the predictand and or the expected relationship among variables based on the physics of the problem while avoiding use of mutually correlated predictors the mean average error mae between the results obtained from the meta models and those obtained from the full model was calculated as xregr xmod xmod where xmod is the result calculated applying the full integrated model while xregr is the value from the regression equation in an analogous way the improvements in the accuracy from the monovariate to the multivariate model are calculated as xmultiv xmonov xmonov where xmonov is the mae or r2 of the monovariate model 3 results table 1 shows the correlation matrix of the predictands and predictors this shows that rr rav y is well correlated with precipitation rav y and to a lesser extent with et0 cb with et0 and tmed while the high correlation with rad reflects the high correlation between et0 and rad δtext is correlated with aet and to a lesser extent with vap δtint with et0 and hence with also rad in addition rr rav y shows a closer correlation with rav y after logarithmic transformation of both variables and cb and δtint show a closer correlation with the logarithm of et0 for each indicator the best performing univariate models are shown in fig 2 for a soil thickness of 0 30 m while those for different soil thickness are reported in table 2 we use explained variance r2 and mean absolute error mae as performance statistics of the models the multivariate models reported in table 3 were selected by considering the two predictors with highest correlation with each indicator while avoiding use of mutually correlated predictors table 1 multivariate models useful for a more accurate prediction reduce the mae between 0 2 and 1 3 percentage points with an r2 increase between 2 and 9 percentage points at 30 cm thickness with a maximum of mae improvement of 31 for the biomass estimation at 10 cm soil thickness the yearly average runoff reduction decreases as the yearly average precipitation increases fig 2a the term 1 rr rav y corresponds to the runoff coefficient of the greened surface and ranges between 20 and 60 as one would expect shafique et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 a monovariate model in this case would yield r2 0 67 and mae 8 4 while the elicited multivariate model for t 0 30 m yields r 2 0 69 and mae 8 tables 2 and 3 the reduction of land surface temperature δtext shows a good correlation with the yearly average value of the actual evapotranspiration aetav y the equation that relates δtext to aetav y is depicted in fig 2b for soil thickness 0 30 m and in table 2 for other conditions the temperature decrease from grey surface to green surface ranges between 2 and 5 c although the r2 value is around 0 65 the error percentage between the theoretical value calculated from the daily model and the value estimated by the regression equation is 5 7 so that this equation can be used in practical applications for soil thickness of 0 30 m the discrepancy between the theoretical value and the value predicted by the multivariate equation one is 5 contrary to δtext the difference of temperature at the outer layer of a roof underneath soil δtint is not well correlated with aet but it is well explained by et0 fig 2c this occurs because the temperature at the bottom of the soil layer t base remains relatively stable during the year so that δtint mainly depends on the grey surface temperature tgrey the latter mainly depends on the climate of which et0 compounding radiation humidity wind intensity and air temperature is an indicator the correlation between tgrey and et0 exhibits r 2 0 90 while between tbase and et0 r 2 0 70 and no correlation with aet in the case of thinner soil t 0 05 m the soil temperature tbase variation during the year is obviously higher nevertheless the et0 influence on tgrey and tbase remains more significant than the aet effect on tbase for t 0 05 m because aet reduces with soil thickness correlation between tbase and et0 is r 2 0 88 at 5 cm thickness considering the soil thickness of 0 30 m the discrepancy between the theoretical value and the multivariate analysis value is 6 2 with r2 higher than 0 69 overall temperature differences increase with rad and this can be seen from the univariate analysis between δt and rad table 1 bulk herbaceous biomass production is predicted between 1 and 4 kg m2 per year 10 40 tons per hectare fig 2d radiation alone explains 77 of the variance of yearly biomass production mae 9 while potential evapotranspiration alone explains 87 of the variance with mae 8 1 see appendix a for more details the meta models perform evenly across the european region this can be appreciated from the scatter plots of fig 2 showing no outliers nor clustered scatter points likewise while urban areas have different extents in different regions the time series that we used to derive our meta models correspond to areas reasonably uniformly distributed in space corroborating the generalizability of our results finally we correlated the equation coefficients of the monovariate meta models to soil thickness in order to provide general equations by plotting these coefficients versus the soil thickness table 2 it is possible to see that above 30 cm thickness the coefficients do not change significantly or the slope of the monotonic function progressively reduces logarithmic equations were selected to interpolate the coefficients r 2 0 9 with the exception of the intercept of the meta model for δtint which is clearly asymptotic eq 2 obtaining the following equations that are valid within the range investigated in this work 1 δtext 0 0007 ln t 0 0054 aet 0 23 ln t 1 7589 2 δtint 2 10 ln t 9 13 ln et0 19 9 e 5 86 t 30 3 rr rav y 1 56 ln t 19 267 rav y 0 55 4 cb 0 74 ln t 2 51 ln et0 4 081 ln t 13 475 the above equations give the following mae for the 30 cm soil thickness almost similar to the monovariate models with proper coefficients 6 3 for δtint 5 7 with proper coefficients 9 5 for rr 8 4 with proper coefficients 7 5 for δtint 7 5 with proper coefficients 8 1 for cb 8 1 with proper coefficients eq 2 refers to the reduction of roof temperature in summer with implications on the cooling request in summer analogously green roofs also isolate the building in winter requiring less heat for a building to be warmed from our calculations the average increase of the winter temperature at the external surface of the grey roof tbase is 2 1 c ranging between 6 3 and 2 4 c the negative values mean that the temperature in winter is lower with the green roof thus that the green roof does not reduce the heating request however the negative values only occur in 73 fuas out of 671 and typically in fuas characterized by high et0 and radiation where in winter the frequent sunny days can warm the grey roof surface thus reducing the heating request in these areas we expect the benefits from a reduction of the summer temperature to outweigh the disadvantages from a reduction of the temperature in winter globally justifying the implementation of a green roof for energy purposes 4 discussion in their exploratory intent our calculations are referred to hypothetical situations and as such they cannot be validated however the underlying equations are extensively applied and generally considered realistic especially in the european context moreover we benchmarked our results against the available literature as further discussed below the equations of the swat model as used in our analysis have been applied in malagó et al 2007 for the danube basin in samadi 2017 for the united states and in wang et al 2018 for the tennessee river basin while the hydrological model of pistocchi et al 2008 has been tested against data in various cases across europe pistocchi et al 2008 santi et al 2013 and proven realistic while the regression equations cannot be validated in the stricter sense we nonetheless checked that the variables predicted by the model were in line with available evidence our calculated difference between heat flux to the roof in case of grey surface and heat flux to the soil surface in case of green surface varies between 88 and 173 w m2 coherently with la roche and berardi 2014 and sun et al 2013 where differences between 30 and 340 w m2 were recorded issa et al 2015 found that the average decrease in the roof inner temperature at 0 07 m depth between the green and control roofs ranged from 4 to 7 c while in our calculation the decrease was between 5 and 9 c for a 0 05 m thick soil in xiao et al 2018 a validated estimation of the effect of vegetation density p expressed in percentage thus p ranged between 0 and 100 on the reduction of surface temperature tskin in summer is presented for vienna and madrid temperature is reduced by 3 c for vienna and 3 75 c for madrid as a consequence of the greening of a grey urban surface similar results were obtained by applying our theoretical model a reduction of 3 8 c for vienna and 3 4 c for madrid using a herbaceous crop and a soil 0 30 m thick overall these comparisons show that our model is realistic our predicted runoff reduction between 40 and 80 for t 30 cm compares favorably with soulis et al 2017 predicting 17 100 of runoff reduction for a soil 8 cm thick and 26 83 with our model schultz et al 2018 found an average rr of 33 for a 12 5 cm thick soil while our reduction with 12 5 cm thickness ranged between 27 and 87 and zhang et al 2015 found a water retention between 35 100 with 15 cm soil thickness 28 and 88 with our model shafique et al 2018 calculated a rr between 10 and 60 for a soil thickness of 3 cm comparable with our retention between 24 and 75 for a soil thickness of 5 cm results are also in agreement with johannessen et al 2017 where the warmest and driest locations lower annual precipitation showed highest retention in percentage of annual precipitation 5 conclusions in this contribution we illustrate a method to quantify the beneficial effects of urban greening in terms of runoff reduction biomass growth and surface temperature reduction indicators developing a satisfactory surrogate to a complex model we show that our simple equations relating these indicators to easily accessible environmental variables are consistent with the results one could obtain by applying a complex integrated model with standard parameters the discrepancy compared to more complex model results are below 9 for runoff below 9 for biomass and below 6 for surface temperature therefore the meta models proposed in this paper can be applied to estimate urban greening effects in the european context as a first approximation the proposed equations are empirical hence their validity outside of the range of conditions investigated in this study is questionable however the ample range of latitudes from 35 cyprus to 65 finland and of elevation from below 0 m the netherlands to above 1600 m austria make them arguably suited for applications across all temperate regions the proposed metamodels provide a quick tool for the appraisal of urban development and urban greening strategies water retention by urban green infrastructure may contribute to reducing floods and pollution biomass growth may contribute to carbon sequestration and may yield economically useful production for people berry crops or livestock grass it can also encourage social activities like gardening the reduction of temperature at the bottom of a soil layer on urban surfaces is directly proportional to the cost saving by reduced energy needs for summer cooling if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled the reduction of surface temperatures associated to greening yields also a potential benefit in terms of heat islands mitigation the proposed equations enable a reasonably accurate quantification of all these benefits at a first level of approximation in order to support the planning of resilient cities against the effects of climate changes quaranta et al 2021 present an application of the metamodels for continental scale assessment

research center of european commission appendix a the choice of the herbaceous crop type is not an essential parameter so that large scale analysis can be performed almost neglecting the herbaceous type this is confirmed in table a1 where it can be seen that the effect of lec and rue is negligible in comparison with the effects of soil thickness that was indeed here also investigated in fig a1 alfalfa selected as reference crop was compared with other herbaceous and berry plant to prove the minimal effect of vegetation type on the results in fig a1 the reduction of the roof temperature is shown versus et0 for alfalfa tomato timothy and strawberry parameters based on swat database and on heuvelink 1996 nangare et al 2016 olson 1981 pathak and stoddard 2018 the reduction of the temperature induced by tomato is lower than that induced by the herbaceous plants due to the lower aet of berry plants a portion of water is stored inside the fruit however results of berry crops and that of herbaceous crops are almost similar fig a2 also depicts the wet biomass of tomato and alfalfa versus the radiation fig 2d already shows the herbaceous cb versus et0 and some discussions are provided on the robustness of the estimation bulk herbaceous biomass production is predicted between 1 4 kg m2 per year 10 40 tons per hectare while the berry production between 0 2 and 50 kg m2 including the weight of plants and stems it is worth noting that cb refers to the bulk biomass of the whole plant in the case of tomato the weight of fruits alone is slightly less than one half of the total plant weight heuvelink 1996 radiation alone explains 77 of the variance of yearly biomass production mae 9 while potential evapotranspiration alone explains 79 of the variance with mae 8 1 for alfalfa for tomato radiation explains 78 of the variance with mae 53 when considering the biomass of tomato the highest mae are those whose cb value calculated by the integrated model is below 7 kg m2 if results below cb 7 kg m2 were discarded mae reduces from 38 to 17 tomato results are in agreement with nangare et al 2016 where the lycopersicon esculentum mill was cultivated at an average temperature of 22 c with an average yield of 7 kg m2 of fruits by our model considering that temperature the total biomass would be 24 kg m2 that corresponds to about 10 kg m2 of fruits kuscu et al 2014 measured a fruit yield of 32 tons ha at 14 c of average temperature i e 3 2 kg m2 that corresponds to 6 5 kg m2 of total plant yield our estimation gives a total of 2 3 kg m2 although in this case the discrepancy is higher it must be noted that this yield example is among the less productive ones thus a case that is more difficult to be predicted anyway the order of magnitude which is of our interest in this study is captured appendix b budyko 1974 assumes that the long term aet is essentially a property of the climate hence for our case this allows its readily calculation as a simple combination of the annual average et0 av y and r av y we compared aet av y from the daily model simulation with the result of the budyko model eq a1 finding a good correspondence but with the budyko model predicting aet av y on average 39 higher than the daily step model after dividing the budyko model aet av y by 1 39 the two values can be used interchangeably fig a3 a1 aet r et0 r tanh r et0 1

from a latitude of 35 cyprus to 65 finland study focus quantification of urban greening effects usually requires relatively complex and integrated models in this contribution we apply well established hydrological biomass and energy balance equations to derive meta models for the estimation of runoff reduction urban surface heating and thermal protection of buildings in order to quantify the effects of the greening of 1 m2 of impervious surface e g roofs sealed ground surfaces and underground parking lots new hydrological insights for the region we propose empirical meta models for the quick appraisal of urban greening benefits including urban runoff reduction due to soil water retention and evapotranspiration land surface temperature reduction reduction of the indoor temperature beneath the greened surface dry biomass growth we show that the choice of vegetation growth parameters has a limited effect on the results although the amount of produced bulk biomass obviously depends on vegetation type the proposed meta models can be applied for the assessment of urban greening benefits at the stage of policy evaluation land planning and the programming of investments at regional or continental scale before undertaking more detailed and site specific calculations as required in the design phase keywords urban greening runoff energy urban heat island climate change mitigation 1 introduction the resilience of cities under climate change is increasingly central in urban planning in europe european commission 2019 and worldwide under sustained global urbanization trends united nations 2019 the impact of urbanization on climate has long been recognized chandler 1962 and mitigation and adaptation strategies are extensively explored among these urban greening has aroused considerable interest as a potential method to mitigate the effects of climate changes at the urban scale particularly urban heat waves droughts and floods plenty of studies have shown that the greening of grey surfaces through a vegetated cover on their top layer can deliver multiple benefits as they shift blue water runoff to green water through evapotranspiration and store and gradually release rain water bowler et al 2010 chang et al 2007 spronken smith and oke 1998 besides improving the urban habitat with positive ecological and human well being effects greened surfaces may deliver at least the following benefits 1 a mitigation of storm water runoff by retaining precipitation depending on the storage capacity allowed by the green surface and the local climatic pattern berndtsson 2010 schultz et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 while surface greening alone has limited mitigating effects on extreme events it can be effectively combined with other flood management measures e g mentens et al 2006 2 a mitigation of urban heat as energy incoming to the surface is used for evapotranspiration instead of being absorbed issa et al 2015 susca et al 2011 this reflects in a potential reduction of the energy needed for the cooling of buildings la roche and berardi 2014 susca et al 2011 3 a fixation of atmospheric co2 into biomass if the biomass is properly managed this could turn into carbon storage moreover the biomass growing on greened surfaces may yield useful staple crops orsini et al 2014 many studies have investigated the beneficial effects of urban greening with a focus on green roofs by means of field measurements an accurate design of these complex systems usually requires rather detailed hydrological thermodynamic and micrometeorological models that must be site specifically applied e g locatelli et al 2014 la roche and berardi 2014 issa et al 2015 these are not practically applicable for the rapid appraisal of benefits at large scale as required in early stages of programming and planning in order to overcome these difficulties in this study we present simple equations able to surrogate more complex models with an acceptable approximation for the general appraisal of policies and investments based on urban greening under varying climate conditions representative of the european climate our equations are not conceived to accurately simulate local dynamics of greened surfaces and only predict relatively simple and aggregated performance indicators of a greening intervention on an urban surface yet their simplicity and immediateness of application make them suitable tools for screening level studies they enable quantitative cost benefit appraisal that would not be possible in policy development and strategic planning in the absence of resources to allocate to more complex modelling 2 materials and methods the work consisted of two stages namely 1 calculation of daily water and energy balances and biomass growth for a 1 m2 impervious area initially without soil grey surface and then covered with soil and vegetation green surface using a combined hydrological biomass growth and energy balance model 2 derivation of monovariate and multivariate regression equations to relate key output variables to appropriate predictors these equations represent meta models aimed at surrogating the underlying models in order to predict specific endpoints in this work we do not restrict the definition of urban greening the calculation applies to any surface initially paved with concrete asphalt tiles or similar materials which is then covered with a layer of soil where vegetation is planted examples of surfaces that can be greened are roofs sealed ground surfaces or covers of underground parking lots we expect that roof surfaces could be only covered with thin soil layers in the most common situations while cases with less stringent structural constraints may warrant thicker soil covers however also on structurally constrained roofs it could be possible to implement discontinuous patches of thicker soils yielding an acceptable average thickness for this reason in the derivation of our meta models we refer to a range of soil thickness beyond what is expected to be realistically applicable to green roofs alone 2 1 input data the input climatic data were 14 years meteorological daily time series 1990 2013 from the 5 5 km2 grid used in the hydrological model lisflood bisselink et al 2018 the daily grid values of the time series were averaged within the polygons representing 671 functional urban areas across europe spanning different geographic and climatic contexts at latitudes from 35 cyprus to 65 finland and from an average elevation of slightly below 0 m 3 m the netherlands to 1613 m innsbruck austria pistocchi and dorati 2019 the climatic variables included in the daily time series were precipitation r mm maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin c vapor pressure vap hpa wind speed w m s daily average net short wave radiation rad kj m2 from these data the average temperature tav was calculated as the mean of maximum and minimum temperature the long wave radiation was calculated by the equation proposed in neitsch et al 2011 the potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation see e g neitsch et al 2011 using the height of an herbaceous crop to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance 2 2 combined hydrological biomass and energy balance model applied at the daily scale in the first stage we applied the hydrological model proposed in pistocchi et al 2008 combined with the biomass growth and surface energy balance equations of the well established soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 the equations were solved in matlab r2018a 2 2 1 soil water balance for a specific soil type and thickness actual evapotranspiration aet was estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration et0 and available water neglecting vegetation canopy storage this assumption is practical in order to avoid the need of an explicit water balance for the plants including stem flow and evaporation from the leaves which would arguably represent a higher order refinement beyond the scope and needs of the present assessment with this assumption the hydrological and biomass models become independent of each other the daily precipitation in excess of actual evapotranspiration is assumed to first replete the soil and then to originate runoff the latter lumps together saturation and infiltration excess as well as gravity drainage assumed to happen at the bottom of the soil layer the soil water balance neglects all snow processes in europe these are of relevance at high latitudes and altitudes and during winter when vegetation growth is anyway severely limited by the temperature stress factor and building cooling is not necessary the impact of this simplification on the results of this analysis is therefore anticipated to be negligible 2 2 2 biomass growth model the soil water balance is computed using et0 and provides the soil water content used as an input to determine the water stress conditions possibly faced by plants the potential biomass growth in kg m2 was calculated at daily step using the equations of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 from the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par a function of atmospheric radiation and radiation use efficiency rue of the plant a function of atmospheric vapor pressure the actual biomass growth is then calculated through appropriate temperature and water stress factors depending on soil and weather conditions neitsch et al 2011 2 2 3 energy balance model the net heat flux to the soil surface was calculated as the balance of net long wave radiation net short wave radiation actual evapotranspiration and heat flux through the soil from this we computed the land surface or skin temperature under steady conditions for a 1 m2 surface with soil tsoil and without soil i e the grey surface tgrey the surface temperature in the presence of vegetation tgreen was calculated from tsoil and from the biomass weight load in order to account for the influence of plant canopy on soil temperature neitsch et al 2011 the summer average temperature values where then computed finally the temperature at the bottom of the soil layer tbase was estimated after taking into account the thermal inertia of the soil depending on soil thickness t and soil water content nietsch et al 2011 the difference δtext tgrey tgreen between the surface temperature of the green surface completely covered by vegetation and the external grey surface temperature is an indicator to quantify the improvement of urban microclimate the difference δtint tgrey tbase is instead an indicator of the change in temperature at the outer layer external roof surface of a building and is proportional to the reduction of cooling energy requirements in summer if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled 2 3 choice of soil and vegetation parameters for input to the model and thermal boundary conditions as surface greening requires importing soil specifically gathered for the purpose a medium texture soil is usually to be preferred for agronomic reasons for this reason we referred our calculations to a loamy soil corresponding tothe medium textural class as per wösten et al 1999 see table 2 in pistocchi et al 2008 for the hydrological properties of such soil we considered five soil thicknesses t 0 05 m t 0 10 m t 0 20 m t 0 30 m and t 0 50 m in order to obtain results potentially applicable in different contexts we would like to stress once more that in many cases the soil thickness applicable for the greening of surfaces is limited due to structural or architectural constraints in other cases a thicker layer may be warranted in order to cover the full range of solutions that could be implemented at least in some circumstance including the greening of parts of sealed lots such as parking spaces we developed our calculations for soil thicknesses up to 50 cm furthermore it is reasonable to think that thicker discontinuous soil patches could be also used on roofs while maintaining a compatible average thickness aboveground biomass growth was simulated using the swat model equations we referred to a herbaceous plant representing grassed surfaces with plant growth parameters for medicago sativa alfalfa suggested in swat neitsch et al 2011 these parameters can be regarded as representative of grass in general but affect the final results to a marginal extent as the dry matter potentially produced per unit surface is relatively independent of the herbaceous plant li et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis is presented in appendix a to further corroborate this observation the choice of plants to use in the design of urban greening depends anyway on a number of factors not considered here when the plant reaches maturity we assume it is cut down to the height of 3 cm which is the minimum height suggested from the swat the flow of heat through the soil layer is only relevant to compute indicators of potential energy saving in the cooling of buildings in our exercise it was computed with reference to the scheme of a green roof covering a building with an internal temperature tint 20 c and a transmittance of the roof structure underlying the soil equal to 0 30 w m 2 k 1 the latter can be regarded as a typical european value european insulation manufacturers associations 2017 anyway the results related to temperature differences do not significantly change by changing the inner building temperature tint 2 4 definition of performance indicators and development of meta models for each of the 671 functional urban areas we computed the following performance indicators for the different soil thicknesses and vegetation types with reference to a 1 m2 urban area undergoing greening the average yearly reduction of runoff rr assuming runoff for the urban surface prior to greening equals the average yearly rainfall rav y difference in ground surface temperature δtext expressed in c and averaged over summer months between the soil vegetated surface tgreen and the surface prior to greening tgrey dry biomass production cb espressed in kg m 2 y 1 an indicator of the potential benefit for the cooling of buildings this was defined as the difference in temperature at the outer skin of the roof beneath the soil layer δtint expressed in c and averaged over summer months between the temperature computed for a grey surface tgrey and the temperature at the bottom of the soil tbase in case of greening the indicator δtint is proportional to the change in heat flow from the outside to the inside of a building through a soil covered roof hence to the change in energy required for cooling if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled for each of the above indicators we developed regression equations using weather forcing variables as predictors in particular we considered the annual average of the following variables fig 1 yearly average precipitation rav y mm i e cumulated value in one average year that ranged between 200 and 1600 mm fig 1a average daily short wave radiation rad w m2 that ranged between 100 and 240 w m2 yearly average temperature tmed c ranging between 3 and 20 c yearly average potential evapotranspiration et0av y mm i e cumulated value in one average year that ranged between 400 and 1400 mm fig 1b the humidity index hi r av y et0av y ranges between 0 24 and 2 64 yearly average actual evapotranspiration aet av y mm computed by averaging the daily values obtained with the hydrological model mentioned above and ranging between 150 and 550 mm for a soil 0 30 m thick and with herbaceous plants fig 1c average actual evapotranspiration during summer months aet av s mm ranging between 20 and 250 mm the above predictors can be easily obtained from weather observations with the exception of actual evapotranspiration the latter derives from a water balance and entails a more complex calculation its long term annual average aetav y however can be easily estimated from et0av y and rav y according to a budyko approach budyko 1974 this assumes that the long term annual average aet is essentially a property of the climate and allows its ready calculation as a simple combination of these two predictors in this work we compared aetav y from the daily model simulation with the result of the budyko model finding a good correspondence but with the budyko model predicting aetav y on average 39 higher than the daily step model after dividing the budyko model aetav y by 1 39 the two values can be used interchangeably further details are provided in appendix b we tested linear and non linear univariate regression models by trial and error based on the shape displayed by the scatterplots of the indicators as a function of each of the predictor variables and selected the best performing regressions as suggested meta models with the help of the correlation matrix depicted in table 1 to choose the most appropriate predictors those exhibiting higher r2 value in addition to univariate models we explored how multivariate linear models could improve the prediction of the indicators to this end we tested a few combinations of predictors selected on the basis of correlation with the predictand and or the expected relationship among variables based on the physics of the problem while avoiding use of mutually correlated predictors the mean average error mae between the results obtained from the meta models and those obtained from the full model was calculated as xregr xmod xmod where xmod is the result calculated applying the full integrated model while xregr is the value from the regression equation in an analogous way the improvements in the accuracy from the monovariate to the multivariate model are calculated as xmultiv xmonov xmonov where xmonov is the mae or r2 of the monovariate model 3 results table 1 shows the correlation matrix of the predictands and predictors this shows that rr rav y is well correlated with precipitation rav y and to a lesser extent with et0 cb with et0 and tmed while the high correlation with rad reflects the high correlation between et0 and rad δtext is correlated with aet and to a lesser extent with vap δtint with et0 and hence with also rad in addition rr rav y shows a closer correlation with rav y after logarithmic transformation of both variables and cb and δtint show a closer correlation with the logarithm of et0 for each indicator the best performing univariate models are shown in fig 2 for a soil thickness of 0 30 m while those for different soil thickness are reported in table 2 we use explained variance r2 and mean absolute error mae as performance statistics of the models the multivariate models reported in table 3 were selected by considering the two predictors with highest correlation with each indicator while avoiding use of mutually correlated predictors table 1 multivariate models useful for a more accurate prediction reduce the mae between 0 2 and 1 3 percentage points with an r2 increase between 2 and 9 percentage points at 30 cm thickness with a maximum of mae improvement of 31 for the biomass estimation at 10 cm soil thickness the yearly average runoff reduction decreases as the yearly average precipitation increases fig 2a the term 1 rr rav y corresponds to the runoff coefficient of the greened surface and ranges between 20 and 60 as one would expect shafique et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 a monovariate model in this case would yield r2 0 67 and mae 8 4 while the elicited multivariate model for t 0 30 m yields r 2 0 69 and mae 8 tables 2 and 3 the reduction of land surface temperature δtext shows a good correlation with the yearly average value of the actual evapotranspiration aetav y the equation that relates δtext to aetav y is depicted in fig 2b for soil thickness 0 30 m and in table 2 for other conditions the temperature decrease from grey surface to green surface ranges between 2 and 5 c although the r2 value is around 0 65 the error percentage between the theoretical value calculated from the daily model and the value estimated by the regression equation is 5 7 so that this equation can be used in practical applications for soil thickness of 0 30 m the discrepancy between the theoretical value and the value predicted by the multivariate equation one is 5 contrary to δtext the difference of temperature at the outer layer of a roof underneath soil δtint is not well correlated with aet but it is well explained by et0 fig 2c this occurs because the temperature at the bottom of the soil layer t base remains relatively stable during the year so that δtint mainly depends on the grey surface temperature tgrey the latter mainly depends on the climate of which et0 compounding radiation humidity wind intensity and air temperature is an indicator the correlation between tgrey and et0 exhibits r 2 0 90 while between tbase and et0 r 2 0 70 and no correlation with aet in the case of thinner soil t 0 05 m the soil temperature tbase variation during the year is obviously higher nevertheless the et0 influence on tgrey and tbase remains more significant than the aet effect on tbase for t 0 05 m because aet reduces with soil thickness correlation between tbase and et0 is r 2 0 88 at 5 cm thickness considering the soil thickness of 0 30 m the discrepancy between the theoretical value and the multivariate analysis value is 6 2 with r2 higher than 0 69 overall temperature differences increase with rad and this can be seen from the univariate analysis between δt and rad table 1 bulk herbaceous biomass production is predicted between 1 and 4 kg m2 per year 10 40 tons per hectare fig 2d radiation alone explains 77 of the variance of yearly biomass production mae 9 while potential evapotranspiration alone explains 87 of the variance with mae 8 1 see appendix a for more details the meta models perform evenly across the european region this can be appreciated from the scatter plots of fig 2 showing no outliers nor clustered scatter points likewise while urban areas have different extents in different regions the time series that we used to derive our meta models correspond to areas reasonably uniformly distributed in space corroborating the generalizability of our results finally we correlated the equation coefficients of the monovariate meta models to soil thickness in order to provide general equations by plotting these coefficients versus the soil thickness table 2 it is possible to see that above 30 cm thickness the coefficients do not change significantly or the slope of the monotonic function progressively reduces logarithmic equations were selected to interpolate the coefficients r 2 0 9 with the exception of the intercept of the meta model for δtint which is clearly asymptotic eq 2 obtaining the following equations that are valid within the range investigated in this work 1 δtext 0 0007 ln t 0 0054 aet 0 23 ln t 1 7589 2 δtint 2 10 ln t 9 13 ln et0 19 9 e 5 86 t 30 3 rr rav y 1 56 ln t 19 267 rav y 0 55 4 cb 0 74 ln t 2 51 ln et0 4 081 ln t 13 475 the above equations give the following mae for the 30 cm soil thickness almost similar to the monovariate models with proper coefficients 6 3 for δtint 5 7 with proper coefficients 9 5 for rr 8 4 with proper coefficients 7 5 for δtint 7 5 with proper coefficients 8 1 for cb 8 1 with proper coefficients eq 2 refers to the reduction of roof temperature in summer with implications on the cooling request in summer analogously green roofs also isolate the building in winter requiring less heat for a building to be warmed from our calculations the average increase of the winter temperature at the external surface of the grey roof tbase is 2 1 c ranging between 6 3 and 2 4 c the negative values mean that the temperature in winter is lower with the green roof thus that the green roof does not reduce the heating request however the negative values only occur in 73 fuas out of 671 and typically in fuas characterized by high et0 and radiation where in winter the frequent sunny days can warm the grey roof surface thus reducing the heating request in these areas we expect the benefits from a reduction of the summer temperature to outweigh the disadvantages from a reduction of the temperature in winter globally justifying the implementation of a green roof for energy purposes 4 discussion in their exploratory intent our calculations are referred to hypothetical situations and as such they cannot be validated however the underlying equations are extensively applied and generally considered realistic especially in the european context moreover we benchmarked our results against the available literature as further discussed below the equations of the swat model as used in our analysis have been applied in malagó et al 2007 for the danube basin in samadi 2017 for the united states and in wang et al 2018 for the tennessee river basin while the hydrological model of pistocchi et al 2008 has been tested against data in various cases across europe pistocchi et al 2008 santi et al 2013 and proven realistic while the regression equations cannot be validated in the stricter sense we nonetheless checked that the variables predicted by the model were in line with available evidence our calculated difference between heat flux to the roof in case of grey surface and heat flux to the soil surface in case of green surface varies between 88 and 173 w m2 coherently with la roche and berardi 2014 and sun et al 2013 where differences between 30 and 340 w m2 were recorded issa et al 2015 found that the average decrease in the roof inner temperature at 0 07 m depth between the green and control roofs ranged from 4 to 7 c while in our calculation the decrease was between 5 and 9 c for a 0 05 m thick soil in xiao et al 2018 a validated estimation of the effect of vegetation density p expressed in percentage thus p ranged between 0 and 100 on the reduction of surface temperature tskin in summer is presented for vienna and madrid temperature is reduced by 3 c for vienna and 3 75 c for madrid as a consequence of the greening of a grey urban surface similar results were obtained by applying our theoretical model a reduction of 3 8 c for vienna and 3 4 c for madrid using a herbaceous crop and a soil 0 30 m thick overall these comparisons show that our model is realistic our predicted runoff reduction between 40 and 80 for t 30 cm compares favorably with soulis et al 2017 predicting 17 100 of runoff reduction for a soil 8 cm thick and 26 83 with our model schultz et al 2018 found an average rr of 33 for a 12 5 cm thick soil while our reduction with 12 5 cm thickness ranged between 27 and 87 and zhang et al 2015 found a water retention between 35 100 with 15 cm soil thickness 28 and 88 with our model shafique et al 2018 calculated a rr between 10 and 60 for a soil thickness of 3 cm comparable with our retention between 24 and 75 for a soil thickness of 5 cm results are also in agreement with johannessen et al 2017 where the warmest and driest locations lower annual precipitation showed highest retention in percentage of annual precipitation 5 conclusions in this contribution we illustrate a method to quantify the beneficial effects of urban greening in terms of runoff reduction biomass growth and surface temperature reduction indicators developing a satisfactory surrogate to a complex model we show that our simple equations relating these indicators to easily accessible environmental variables are consistent with the results one could obtain by applying a complex integrated model with standard parameters the discrepancy compared to more complex model results are below 9 for runoff below 9 for biomass and below 6 for surface temperature therefore the meta models proposed in this paper can be applied to estimate urban greening effects in the european context as a first approximation the proposed equations are empirical hence their validity outside of the range of conditions investigated in this study is questionable however the ample range of latitudes from 35 cyprus to 65 finland and of elevation from below 0 m the netherlands to above 1600 m austria make them arguably suited for applications across all temperate regions the proposed metamodels provide a quick tool for the appraisal of urban development and urban greening strategies water retention by urban green infrastructure may contribute to reducing floods and pollution biomass growth may contribute to carbon sequestration and may yield economically useful production for people berry crops or livestock grass it can also encourage social activities like gardening the reduction of temperature at the bottom of a soil layer on urban surfaces is directly proportional to the cost saving by reduced energy needs for summer cooling if we assume that the building internal volume under the roof is to be cooled the reduction of surface temperatures associated to greening yields also a potential benefit in terms of heat islands mitigation the proposed equations enable a reasonably accurate quantification of all these benefits at a first level of approximation in order to support the planning of resilient cities against the effects of climate changes quaranta et al 2021 present an application of the metamodels for continental scale assessment

competing interest authors declare that they do not have conflict of interest acknowledgements this work was conducted within the research project wefe water energy food ecosystem nexus at the joint research center of european commission appendix a the choice of the herbaceous crop type is not an essential parameter so that large scale analysis can be performed almost neglecting the herbaceous type this is confirmed in table a1 where it can be seen that the effect of lec and rue is negligible in comparison with the effects of soil thickness that was indeed here also investigated in fig a1 alfalfa selected as reference crop was compared with other herbaceous and berry plant to prove the minimal effect of vegetation type on the results in fig a1 the reduction of the roof temperature is shown versus et0 for alfalfa tomato timothy and strawberry parameters based on swat database and on heuvelink 1996 nangare et al 2016 olson 1981 pathak and stoddard 2018 the reduction of the temperature induced by tomato is lower than that induced by the herbaceous plants due to the lower aet of berry plants a portion of water is stored inside the fruit however results of berry crops and that of herbaceous crops are almost similar fig a2 also depicts the wet biomass of tomato and alfalfa versus the radiation fig 2d already shows the herbaceous cb versus et0 and some discussions are provided on the robustness of the estimation bulk herbaceous biomass production is predicted between 1 4 kg m2 per year 10 40 tons per hectare while the berry production between 0 2 and 50 kg m2 including the weight of plants and stems it is worth noting that cb refers to the bulk biomass of the whole plant in the case of tomato the weight of fruits alone is slightly less than one half of the total plant weight heuvelink 1996 radiation alone explains 77 of the variance of yearly biomass production mae 9 while potential evapotranspiration alone explains 79 of the variance with mae 8 1 for alfalfa for tomato radiation explains 78 of the variance with mae 53 when considering the biomass of tomato the highest mae are those whose cb value calculated by the integrated model is below 7 kg m2 if results below cb 7 kg m2 were discarded mae reduces from 38 to 17 tomato results are in agreement with nangare et al 2016 where the lycopersicon esculentum mill was cultivated at an average temperature of 22 c with an average yield of 7 kg m2 of fruits by our model considering that temperature the total biomass would be 24 kg m2 that corresponds to about 10 kg m2 of fruits kuscu et al 2014 measured a fruit yield of 32 tons ha at 14 c of average temperature i e 3 2 kg m2 that corresponds to 6 5 kg m2 of total plant yield our estimation gives a total of 2 3 kg m2 although in this case the discrepancy is higher it must be noted that this yield example is among the less productive ones thus a case that is more difficult to be predicted anyway the order of magnitude which is of our interest in this study is captured appendix b budyko 1974 assumes that the long term aet is essentially a property of the climate hence for our case this allows its readily calculation as a simple combination of the annual average et0 av y and r av y we compared aet av y from the daily model simulation with the result of the budyko model eq a1 finding a good correspondence but with the budyko model predicting aet av y on average 39 higher than the daily step model after dividing the budyko model aet av y by 1 39 the two values can be used interchangeably fig a3 a1 aet r et0 r tanh r et0 1

trajectories of three typhoons and associated river basins new hydrological insights as a result of climate change impacts record breaking disasters with unprecedented heavy rainfalls typhoon intensities and associated extreme river discharges are increasing making it important to develop the real time forecasting tools for extreme river discharges during floods the cdrm accurately projected river mouth discharges from three japanese typhoons hagibis 2019 roke 2011 and chataan 2002 using calibrated parameter sets from each typhoon we found the equifinality issue among the calibrated parameter sets but they showed satisfactory cross validation results with respect to river mouth hydrographs that similar typhoon trajectories were more important for calibration than rainfall intensities and central pressures that this methodology was accurate for typhoons passing within distances lower than 130 km from associated river basins these findings contribute to developing the real time forecasting tools for extreme river discharges during unprecedented heavy rainfall floods keywords projection extreme river discharge typhoon hagibis cdrm hydrological model sce ua optimization method real time flood forecasting 1 introduction as a result of climate change impacts record breaking disasters occur worldwide every year and in japan with unprecedented amounts of heavy rainfall typhoon intensities and associated coastal sea disasters which bring very large quantities of river water as well as nutrient pollution toward river mouths and into coastal sea zones such extreme river water amounts as well as nutrient pollution in coastal zones greatly decrease sea water quality and can negatively impact marine environments for several days or weeks to mitigate the negative impacts of such disasters it is important to develop real time forecasting or nowcasting of extreme river water levels during typhoon induced flood events but these predictions are still not well developed due to the high uncertainty of occurrence and absence of available historical data for unprecedented rainfall events many recent studies have focused on simulating river water or inundation levels during heavy rainfall induced events these studies are classified as follows based on the type of methodology applied the classification includes physically distributed kinematic wave methods chang and huang 2013 tanaka et al 2017 lee et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 fully dynamic wave momentum equation methods li et al 2005 jhong et al 2017 and diffusive wave transfer methods huang et al 2012 pham et al 2018 sayama et al 2020 which have all been frequently used approaches over the past several decades the advantage of using physically distributed models is their accurate interpretation of basin physical processes whereas a disadvantage is the necessity to evaluate large numbers of parameters for making realistic river basin representations also their parameters can sometimes be used for a wide range of river basin cases artificial neural network ann methods are another approach that has been used more recently ouyang 2018 chang et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 these are data driven approaches and do not consider the physical processes of basins with this approach the results can be very accurate in terms of the predictability of the final outputs but they cannot explain the physical processes which led to the final outputs also the same approach cannot be reused for multiple river basins other recently used approaches are based on conceptual distributed rainfall runoff models kimura et al 2018 conceptual lumped rainfall runoff models lee et al 2018 and semi distributed conceptual hydrological models zhang et al 2018 the advantages of using conceptual models are their simplicity and low computing requirements whereas a disadvantage is the necessity to have large amounts of hydrological and meteorological data to evaluate large numbers of parameters to properly describe physical processes most recent studies in the field are focused on ongoing climate change impact assessments related to typhoon induced and related riverine flood disasters or particularly to the disastrous impact of the recent typhoon hagibis among them mok et al 2019 emphasized the increasing impacts of such typhoon induced summer precipitation and associated river discharge events on sediment biogeochemistry near river mouths in china the findings of taniguchi 2016 higashino and stefan 2019 and takata et al 2020 emphasized the increasing importance of developing methods for real time forecasting of extreme flood events to contribute to disaster prevention management of downstream flood prone areas in japan from the meteorological perspective takemi and unuma 2020 found that deep moist absolutely unstable layers high relative humidity throughout the troposphere and an abundant moisture content were triggering factors for formation of the typhoon hagibis tay et al 2020 provided flood and damage proxy maps during and after the typhoon hagibis which were rapidly derived from synthetic aperture radar data by using change detection approaches shimozono et al 2020 evaluated coastal impacts from the typhoon hagibis and found that the typhoon generated the highest level storm surges recorded in the study area thus adding to the importance of comprehensive river ocean modelling on coastal marine environments in order to reduce negative disastrous impacts sayama et al 2020 evaluated the hydrological predictability and discussed possible future nowcasting application of the typhoon hagibis and heavy rainfall event of july 2018 in western japan using uncalibrated rri model although the above mentioned studies greatly contributed to the understanding of the physical connections among unprecedented heavy rainfalls typhoon intensities and associated extreme river discharges none of them quantitatively evaluated the impact of extreme freshwater outflows on the coastal environment during typhoon passage by combining river and ocean models using hourly time step data and remote sensing technology which was a new contribution from troselj et al 2017 with the advances in weather forecasting systems and the specific capability of forecasting typhoon trajectory and intensity they aimed to be able to comprehend freshwater impacts on coastal marine environments in advance of typhoon events they used the hydrological cell distributed runoff model version 3 1 1 cdrm kojima et al 1998 sayama et al 2003 tachikawa et al 2004 sayama and mcdonnell 2009 apip et al 2012 luo et al 2014 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 and calibrated five rainfall runoff parameters e g soil roughness coefﬁcient river roughness coefﬁcient effective porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and effective rainfall which depended upon the properties of each river basin and also on observed hourly rainfall data input to the cdrm model is the uniform effective rainfall in each cell added to the cumulative flow from upstream side cells which is performed by the kinematic wave method they calibrated the parameter sets by using the shuffled complex evolution optimization method developed at the university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 sorooshian et al 1993 duan et al 1994 harada et al 2006 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 with respect to observed hourly discharge data from the station which is located closest to the river mouth however a limitation of their study is that they established a database of calibrated river basin parameter sets for only two extreme typhoon cases with similar trajectories but a database for many more extreme typhoon cases needs to be established for use as a tool for real time forecasting of river water levels during and after extreme flood events furthermore they only qualitatively demonstrated that there was a functional relationship among the distances between typhoon trajectories as well as their minimum central pressures and river basins but they did not quantify the functional relationship in this study the methodology developed in troselj et al 2017 is utilized to project the most recent extreme flood event that occurred in the kanto region of japan during passage of typhoon hagibis in october 2019 this study provides further confirmation of previous findings and adds several new findings therefore this study is an additional contribution that adds new supporting data to support a more comprehensive objective of producing ensemble cases with similar typhoon trajectories the main objective of this study is to present and discuss new supporting data to confirm that parametrized calibration sets for river basins with similar typhoon trajectories can be used for real time forecasting of future typhoon induced extreme water levels and associated unprecedented floods additionally the reasons why different values of parameter sets can provide different outputs with various rainfall inputs were discussed the relative impact of typhoon trajectories rainfall intensities and central pressures in the calibration and validation processes was compared and the functional relationship of distances between the trajectories of typhoons and mean centres of associated river basins was quantified 2 materials and methods the study expands on the work of troselj et al 2017 with new supporting data added it was projected how river mouth discharges for the nine first class rivers by using calibrated parameter sets from troselj et al 2017 for typhoons roke in 2011 and chataan in 2002 could have been real time forecasted or nowcasted during the passage of typhoon hagibis in 2019 and vice versa 2 1 study sites extreme river discharges from typhoon hagibis in october 2019 for nine first class river basins flowing from north eastern japan into the western pacific ocean were projected from south to north these rivers are the tone naka kuji abukuma natori naruse kitakami mabechi and takase rivers arranged by catchment area of the most downstream station with observed discharge data these rivers are classified as follows tone 12458 km2 kitakami 7869 km2 abukuma 5625 km2 naka 2552 km2 mabechi 2024 km2 kuji 1442 km2 naruse 1158 km2 takase 867 km2 and natori 776 km2 fig 1 shows digital elevation maps dem of the nine targeted river basins with their associated mean centres and compares them with the passage tracks of typhoons hagibis roke and chataan these typhoons were chosen for analysis because they all had similar trajectories and rainfall intensity ranges therefore we expect that the physical characteristics of river runoff from these events would be similar so that calibrated river basin parameter sets from one typhoon could be used to forecast river runoff values for other typhoons 2 2 material and datasets observed hourly rainfall data were collected from the online database of the japan meteorological agency jma 2020 observed discharge and dam data were collected from the online database of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2020 discharge stage relationships q h curves were computed to fill in missing data for the target events the computed results of q h curves for every river separately are published in troselj 2016 because of significantly different flow patterns for the low and high waters of the tone river q h curves for tone river were computed twice separately for discharges up to 4000 m3 s using the same formulas as in troselj 2016 and for discharges above that threshold for the discharges above 4000 m3 s a newly computed formula of y 548 65 x2 5793 x 19 385 with r2 0 92 was obtained from the correlation of 9 highest daily observed discharge data in period from 2001 to 2008 hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds datasets for dem flow accumulation acc and flow direction dir were obtained from u s geological survey hydrosheds 2017 with 15 arc seconds about 500 m resolution grid data for all the datasets 2 3 model configurations the abovementioned nine river discharges from typhoon hagibis from october 11 2019 at 12 00 to october 18 2019 at 12 00 all time references are shown in jst time zone were simulated using the cdrm model with a spatial resolution of approximately 500 m 15 arc sec and a 1 h time step depending upon the basin properties calibrated from typhoons roke and chataan and observed rainfall amounts from typhoon hagibis river discharges were in principle simulated for the most downstream discharge stations with available observed data records however if tidal effects were great enough to reduce observed data reliability then the closest upstream discharge station without significant tidal effect was chosen for the observation and simulation location hereafter river mouth the particular river mouth location for each river was noted in corresponding results section for that river for example for tone river which has the biggest tidal effect river mouth was approximately represented with fukawa observation station which is located 76 47 km from the river mouth this is because simulating river discharges on the actual river mouth would need to include other very complex physical processes such as tidal or back water effect which are not desirable in the hydrological modelling so the river mouth discharges were approximated from an observation station relatively close to the actual river mouth but enough far away not to be significantly affected by tidal or backwater effect on this way tidal or back water effect was omitted or greatly reduced from the hydrological modelling and the study could therefore be focused solely on hydrological effects the surface flow of each individual cell in the cdrm model is represented by eq 1 and is calculated by the kinematic wave method tachikawa et al 2004 sasaki 2014 1 δ h δ t δ q δ x r e q f h s n h m where q discharge per unit width h water depth re effective rainfall s slope gradient n equivalent roughness and m slope constant the slope s is obtained from the dem while the equivalent roughness n is generally a value or observations used in the kinematic wave method where it is treated as a model parameter by setting an upper limit the relationship between q and h with applied parametrization simplifications from this study is represented graphically in fig 2 this relationship enables tracking of the rainwater propagation speed in combination with the continuous basic equation eq 1 dam effects for three major rivers e g tone kitakami and abukuma were considered to be the same as in troselj et al 2017 if the simulated inflow to a dam was bigger than the maximum observed outflow mlit 2020 then the outflow from the dam was set to the maximum observed outflow land use and soil depth 1000 mm were assumed to be uniform to simplify the calibration process another assumption was that all water began to flow immediately after reaching the soil because the impact of the capillary subsurface flow layer is assumed to be very minor or insignificant in cases when there were very large rainfall amounts such as those originating from a typhoon with that assumption the number of parameters to be calibrated decreased from seven to five by omitting dm and β see fig 2 the other five model parameters e g soil roughness coefficient n slo river roughness coefficient n riv effective porosity θa saturated hydraulic conductivity ka and effective rainfall f1 were calibrated separately for each river by the sce ua optimization method initial parameter sets and minimal and maximal searching ranges for the sce ua parameter calibrations were determined in the same manner as described in troselj et al 2017 the values were chosen to represent physically realistic bounds of parameters one of calibrated parameters e g effective rainfall is event dependent and therefore by using different spatiotemporal rainfall patterns in the calibration process different combinations of calibrated parameters will come out as the final results for each typhoon event the cdrm model performance was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency accuracy evaluation index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 which was used as the accuracy evaluation index for outflow calibrations eq 2 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q 0 i q i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 where n number of time steps q o i observed discharge rate at time i q i calculated discharge rate at time i and q o average value of the observed discharge rate nse values bigger than 0 7 are generally considered to have satisfactory goodness of fit 2 4 model calibration and validation previously calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan troselj et al 2017 were used to run the cdrmv model with typhoon hagibis rainfall input data and for associated validation of modelled and observed data from the nine first class river mouth discharges from north eastern japan such real time forecasting scenarios were reproduced assuming that input forecasted meteorological data which corresponded to the mlit observed data after the event was available the inverse process was also performed by using calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoon hagibis with rainfall input data from typhoons roke and chataan therefore a total of nine sets of results were produced e g three calibration sets one for each typhoon and six cross validation sets two for each typhoon four of these parameter sets e g two typhoons roke and chataan calibration and two cross validation sets between these typhoons were previously published in troselj et al 2017 additional five parameter sets were newly introduced in this study e g one typhoon s hagibis calibration and four cross validation sets two of them between typhoons hagibis and roke and two of them between typhoons hagibis and chataan 3 results in this section we show the calibrated results for typhoon hagibis and validate them by using river basin calibrated parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan with rainfall from typhoon hagibis and vice versa table 1 shows calibrated parameter values for each of nine target rivers for all three typhoon events considered these calibrated parameter values were used for calibration and validation of each of the three cases of typhoon rainfall and produced a total of nine versions of the results 3 1 typhoon hagibis projection in the following we show calibrated results for typhoon hagibis and validate them by using river basin calibrated parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan with rainfall from typhoon hagibis separately for the eight rivers from south to north and excluding the kitakami river in this subsection we excluded the kitakami river because it is the first river from south to north where the nse values for typhoon hagibis become significantly low so we separately discuss detailed reasons for this later by comparison with typhoons roke and chataan nse values in subsection 3 2 1 table 2 compares nse value for model runs for all rivers with calibrated parameter sets for typhoon hagibis with three different typhoon cases of rainfall datasets 3 1 1 tone river fig 3 shows tone river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at fukawa station located 76 47 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 2 naka river fig 4 shows naka river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at suifu bridge station located 12 4 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 3 kuji river fig 5 shows kuji river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at sakaki bridge station located 4 5 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 4 abukuma river fig

and validation results for typhoon hagibis where observed discharges were summed up from two tributaries namely at hirose bridge located 9 25 km upstream from the river mouth and natori bridge located 8 26 km upstream from the river mouth these tributaries meet at the same point at a location 5 7 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 6 naruse river fig 8 shows naruse river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis where observed discharges were summed up from two tributaries namely noda bridge located 24 6 km upstream from the river mouth and hataya located 13 6 km upstream from the river mouth these tributaries meet at the same point at a location 0 5 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 7 mabechi river fig 9 shows mabechi river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at bridge station located 4 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 8 takase river fig 10 shows takase river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at ueno station located just upstream from lake ogawara which is 27 6 km upstream from the river mouth 3 2 comparisons of typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections in the following we compare typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections we show the results for the kitakami river and total freshwater outflows from all nine rivers to the pacific ocean in the main body detailed results for calibration and validation cases for typhoons roke and chataan at the same locations as in section 3 1 for the other 8 rivers are shown in the supplementary material as supplementary figs a1 a16 tables 3 and 4 compare nse values of model runs for all rivers with typhoon roke and chataan calibrated parameter sets respectively with rainfall datasets for three different typhoon cases 3 2 1 kitakami river in the following we show kitakami river results from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan as well as its peak hourly spatial rainfall distributions fig 11 a c shows kitakami river calibration and validation results for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively for kitakami river calibration observed discharges were added from artificially constructed new and old river mouths which are now separated namely tome located 40 45 km and 32 07 km upstream from the old and new river mouths respectively and wabuchi located 21 78 km upstream from the old river mouth to compare the impacts of these parameter sets values in a wider context we compared them with fig 12 a c which shows peak hour spatial rainfall distributions for the kitakami river basin for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively 3 2 2 total freshwater outflow from all rivers in the following we compare total freshwater outflow results from all nine rivers into the pacific ocean with the rainfall inputs from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan when using each of the three typhoon calibrated parameter sets fig 13 a c shows total freshwater outflow calibration and validation results for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively representative river mouth observed and modelled discharges from each river were taken from the same locations as described in figs 3 11 which are all located close to river mouths then the river discharge values from each of the nine rivers were summed to obtain the total freshwater outflow into the pacific ocean 3 3 typhoon tracks distance sensitivity analysis in this section we show the functional relationship among distances between trajectories of each typhoon see fig 1 dashed lines and their minimum central pressures compared to mean centres of the associated river basins see fig 1 black dots 3 3 1 typhoon hagibis distance sensitivity analysis fig 14 shows distance comparisons between the trajectories of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon hagibis projections with typhoons hagibis roke and chataan calibrated parameter sets see table 2 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 3 3 2 typhoon roke distance sensitivity analysis fig 15 shows distance comparisons between the trajectory of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon roke projections with typhoons roke hagibis and chataan calibrated parameter sets see table 3 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 3 3 3 typhoon chataan distance sensitivity analysis fig 16 shows distance comparisons between the trajectories of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon chataan projections with typhoons chataan hagibis and roke calibrated parameter sets see table 4 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 4 discussions we discuss the parametrization and metrics of our results in terms of nse accuracy evaluation indexes of river mouth modelled and observed discharges mlit 2020 for each of the nine rivers considered starting from the southernmost tone river table 1 suggests that calibrated parameter sets for river basins are event dependent which is known as the equifinality issue in calibration of hydrological models beven 2006 quality of our calibration process can only be properly evaluated by simultaneous combination of five parameters and how they interact together to forecast river mouth hydrographs but not by extracting a single parameter and evaluating its values in three different parameter sets for example when used parameters are evaluated one by one then bigger soil roughness coefficient bigger river roughness coefficient smaller effective porosity bigger saturated hydraulic conductivity and bigger effective rainfall are altogether contributory to bigger river mouth discharge thus if we evaluate only one parameter and conclude that results are not reasonable based on value of that one particular parameter it is misleading way because we need to evaluate all five parameters as a whole therefore we evaluated these calibrated parameter sets by cross validating all three typhoon events with respect to river mouth hydrographs to demonstrate highly accurate results when using our methodology nse values from table 2 suggest that hagibis calibration always produced very good results which was expected because it represented the case with direct calibration of parameters using rainfall data from the same event roke s validation produced better results than chataan s validation mainly because roke s trajectory was closer to hagibis trajectory than chataan s additionally nse values from both validation cases rapidly decreased as the trajectory distance from river basins for typhoon hagibis increased for the kitakami mabechi and takase rivers detailed reasons for such results will be discussed in this chapter tables 3 and 4 further confirm that the cdrm model calibrated with the sce ua optimization method could produce results with very high nse calibration values however more important for the application of our study is the quality of nse validation values by using calibrated parameter sets from one typhoon but rainfall data from a different typhoon in that respect typhoons roke and chataan calibrations produced similar nse values for typhoon hagibis validation for the six southernmost rivers when all typhoons were relatively close to river basins however typhoon roke calibration produced much better results for typhoon hagibis validation for the three northernmost rivers compared to typhoon chataan calibration with nse values of 0 50 0 57 and 0 81 roke and 0 02 0 30 and 0 66 chataan respectively this is probably because typhoon roke followed similar trajectory angles and distances like typhoon hagibis for the three northernmost rivers see fig 1 dashed lines while typhoon chataan suddenly changed its trajectory angle in that area which therefore caused its calibration parameters to be less reliable for predicting river discharges from other typhoons we conclude that parameter sets calibrated with typhoon hagibis could also have been used retroactively to project river mouth discharges from typhoons roke and hagibis for the six southernmost rivers with high accuracy therefore the calibrated parameter sets could have been used for cross validation and cross prediction of river mouth water levels and discharges for the six southernmost rivers from all three typhoon cases with satisfactory accuracy 4 1 typhoon hagibis projection in the following we discuss accuracy of calibrated and validated results for typhoon hagibis for each river separately and for all rivers comprehensively the typhoon hagibis calibration results see table 2 showed high goodness of fit with nse values of 0 91 1 00 for seven southernmost rivers whereas nse values were lower 0 85 and 0 73 respectively for mabechi and takase rivers which are located further away from the typhoon track similarly the validation results with typhoon roke for six the southernmost rivers were extremely high from 0 88 to 0 94 however the validation results with typhoon chataan for six the southernmost rivers were slightly lower from 0 61 to 0 89 but still in satisfactory range to put these results into context we can compare them with the only other hydrological study about typhoon hagibis sayama et al 2020 nse values from their study were 0 50 0 46 and 0 86 0 10 in model setup without and with unsaturated flow component which is lower accuracy than in this study however in their study the used rri model was not calibrated whereas in our study we calibrated the cdrmv model so this difference in accuracy values can be attributed to the applied calibration method we highlight two main takeaways from this discussion that distances between calibrated and validated typhoon tracks are very important central track distances between typhoons roke and hagibis tracks is smaller than between typhoons chataan and hagibis and that distances between the calibrated typhoon central track and associated river basin should not be too big because when they become too big then accuracy of calibrated and validated results gets rapidly decreased e g like for the three northernmost rivers in this study these takeaways are quantified and discussed in more details in the subsection 4 3 4 2 comparisons of typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections in the following we discuss accuracy of calibrated and cross validated results from typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections for the kitakami river and total freshwater outflows from all nine rivers to the pacific ocean 4 2 1 kitakami river in the following we discuss with the particular example of kitakami river how different values of parameter sets can sometimes produce very different river discharge outputs with various rainfall inputs we discuss kitakami river results separately from the other rivers because this is first river from south to north where the nse values for typhoon hagibis became significantly low and were much different than for those of typhoons roke and chataan thus we tried to determine the reasons for these results based on fig 11 we point out that the calibration process by using the proposed methodology provided satisfactory nse results e g 0 91 0 97 and 0 91 for the hagibis roke and chataan cases respectively but for validation cases satisfactory nse results were provided only for cross validation of roke and chataan e g 0 81 and 0 75 respectively for every 4 cross validation cases with hagibis nse results were significantly lower which means that the reproducibility of river discharges was not reliable furthermore the hydrograph peaks for all calibration and validation cases of hagibis occurred earlier than those for the other two typhoons this was especially extreme in the chataan projection where the hagibis validation case peak occurred immediately after the first small rainfall event instead of after the second larger rainfall event which would be expected intuitively and which occurred in the chataan calibration and roke validation cases if we compare these results with all parameter sets from all three typhoons see table 1 we can see that hagibis parametrization had nearly minimum values for the soil roughness coefficient 0 10 and river roughness coefficient 0 03 and maximum values for saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 50 all of which contributed to rapid water flow progression throughout the basin however roke and chataan exhibited nearly maximum values for soil roughness coefficient e g 1 00 and 1 00 respectively and river roughness coefficient e g 0 10 and 0 08 respectively and average to minimum values of saturated hydraulic conductivity e g 0 29 and 0 10 respectively which were values that contributed to slow water flow progression throughout the basin based on fig 12 we note that the kitakami river basin is very elongated in the south north direction which makes it more challenging for calibration than the other river basins considered additionally we point out that the hagibis case rainfall within the kitakami river basin was spatially distributed very non homogeneously with much bigger values of up to 45 mm h only at the southern end closer to the river mouth but with much smaller values of 5 10 mm h at the northern end however the roke and chataan rainfall cases were more homogeneously distributed throughout the river basin with bigger values of 15 26 mm h extending from the south into the middle of the river basin for roke and with bigger values of 15 32 mm h within the middle of the river basin for chataan these findings may indicate that the sce ua optimization method had a tendency to calibrate parameters in a manner that the river water progressed too quickly from the northern part of the basin to produce satisfactory discharge values at the river mouth hagibis calibration nse 0 91 for cases when the spatial distribution of increased rainfall was not homogeneous throughout a river basin the sce ua optimization method produced unrealistic parametrization values however for the roke and chataan parametrizations the rainfall was more homogenously distributed throughout the kitakami river basin so their calibrated parameter sets described the river basin much more realistically than the hagibis calibrated parameter set furthermore this phenomenon was observed solely for the kitakami river basin because it was the only river where the spatial rainfall distributions were non homogeneous for typhoon hagibis but were homogeneous for typhoons roke and chataan in all other river basins rainfall distributions were more homogeneously distributed during all three typhoon events 4 2 2 total freshwater outflow from all rivers in the following we discuss the accuracy of this study results for projecting total freshwater outflow results from all nine rivers into the pacific ocean with the rainfall inputs from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan when using each of the three typhoon calibrated parameter sets especially considering the relative magnitudes of freshwater outflows which these typhoons discharged into the pacific ocean based on fig 13 we point out that our projections provided extremely high nse values of 0 97 0 99 and 0 98 for the hagibis roke and chataan calibration cases respectively when considering total freshwater outflow from all rivers into the pacific ocean this indicated that our methodology could be applied very accurately to separately reproduce the total freshwater budget for each typhoon furthermore our projections provided very high nse values when validating calibrated parameter sets with rainfall from different typhoons e g from 0 83 to 0 95 for six validation cases these results indicated very high ability for predicting total freshwater budgets from different typhoons it is important to note that cross validations of the hagibis and roke cases projected extremely high nse values of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively while cross validations with the chataan cases projected lower values e g 0 83 to 0 88 but were still in a satisfactory nse range we conclude that the accuracy of river discharge reproducibility from past similar extreme event parametrizations increased with decreasing distances of given typhoon trajectories because typhoons hagibis and roke were closer to calibrated river basins and to each other than typhoon chataan furthermore we highlighted the magnitudes of peak observed total freshwater discharges from three typhoons which were approximately 33 000 23 000 and 29 000 m3 s for hagibis roke and chataan respectively however despite the fact that the total freshwater discharge from chataan was closer to hagibis than to roke cross validations of hagibis and roke provided higher accuracy results than any cross validations with chataan this indicates that the trajectories of calibrated typhoon cases see fig 1 dashed lines are more important for projections of another typhoons than the rainfall intensities for those cases when intensities are in the extreme range we also showed that calibrated parameter sets from roke could be very accurately used to project river discharge values from hagibis despite the fact that hagibis exhibited approximately 10 000 m3 s 70 higher peak observed total freshwater outflow than roke this is important because developing a methodology that can project or predict extreme unprecedented river discharges is currently one of the most important challenges in hydrology 4 3 typhoon tracks distance sensitivity analysis in the following we quantify and discuss the functional relationship in terms of accuracy of calibrated and validated results for each river basin when considering the associated nse values of each typhoon we discuss the nse values in terms of distances between trajectories of each typhoon and their minimum central pressures compared to mean centres of the associated river basins based on fig 14 we point out that the typhoon hagibis validation results were significant for the six southernmost river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 100 km and central pressure was lower than 970 hpa the results significantly decreased with longer distances but central pressures did not change significantly across the entire domain hagibis projections using roke parameter sets were always more accurate than using chataan parameter sets based on fig 15 we point out that typhoon roke validation results were significant for all river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 130 km and central pressure was below 978 hpa roke projections using hagibis parameter sets were more accurate for the six southernmost rivers whereas using chataan parameter sets were more accurate for the three northernmost rivers when the track of chataan was closer to the river basins than the track of hagibis based on fig 16 we point out that the typhoon chataan validation results were significant for the seven southernmost river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 130 km and central pressure was below 974 hpa chataan projections using hagibis parameter sets were similar to those when using roke parameter sets because they both had shorter distances from river basins than typhoon chataan based on figs 14 16 we point out that central pressure values from the three typhoons were in similar ranges e g values from 962 to 978 hpa throughout the entire domain but did not fluctuate significantly however results were very accurate for all cases when trajectories of each typhoon compared to mean centres of the associated river basins were lower than 130 km we therefore conclude that trajectories of calibrated typhoon cases were more important for projections of other typhoons than their central pressure values for cases when the central pressures of associated typhoons were in similar ranges based on this finding we assume that the same conclusions could also be made for cases in which the central pressures of associated typhoons are not in a similar range but their trajectories are similar for example if one typhoon is calibrated in its ascending stage but the other in its descending stage 5 conclusions the main findings of this study confirm with new data that the methodology developed in troselj et al 2017 can be successfully used to project river discharges for future unprecedented typhoons by showing its applicability to another recent extreme precipitation event namely typhoon hagibis extreme discharge events have many uncertainties and differences among their physical processes however we emphasized their similarities by calibrating river basin responses to particular typhoon induced rainfall events and then used the calibrated basin parameter sets to forecast river discharges for future events with similar forecasted rainfall patterns an additional minor finding of this study is that similar typhoon trajectories are much more important for calibration and validation processes than rainfall intensity and central pressure the proposed methodology is very accurate when applied to typhoons with similar trajectories passing within distances lower than 130 km between typhoon trajectories and the mean centres of associated river basins additionally we highlighted that all three typhoons had similar central pressure ranges e g approximately 10 hpa differences which certainly contributed to their reproducibility by using calibrated parameter sets from other typhoons we showed that the methodology and model used in this study has the capability of simulating extreme discharge events by conducting calibrations using previous extreme typhoon events with similar trajectories when using calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan for projection of typhoon hagibis the calibrated nse values were mostly bigger than 0 8 and 0 9 respectively exceptions were the most northern rivers namely kitakami mabechi and takase which did not show significant goodness of fit due to their locations being more than 130 km away from the trajectory of typhoon hagibis these results suggest that the cdrm model that is calibrated for the typhoons roke or chataan cases can be successfully applied to forecast river runoff values from other similar extreme precipitation events and furthermore the newly calibrated parameter sets from typhoon hagibis can be used as an additional real time forecasting tool therefore if the proposed methodology is applied to produce ensembles of calibrated parameter sets from similar historical typhoons it can serve as an accurate tool for real time forecasting of river discharges from extreme typhoon events when this study results are to be used for future real time forecasting of river discharges then we recommend two ways of using the three calibrated parameter sets if the goal of the future real time forecasting is to get the most accurate river discharges forecast then the calibrated parameter set from one of three typhoons with the closest track distance compared to the forecasted typhoon should be used however if real time forecasting of the worst case flood scenario is desirable on the way to have future forecast on the safer side another way could be to use ensemble of all three typhoon cases and choose the case which produces the biggest river discharges as the representative case there are several limitations of this study we applied uniform land use values for all river basins which may be improved in future studies for more realistic representations of river basin surface processes furthermore similar to the findings from troselj et al 2017 we found the equifinality issue by evaluating our calibrated parameter sets however we cross validated three calibrated parameter sets with rainfall from other typhoon events with respect to river mouth hydrographs to demonstrate highly accurate results when using our methodology we additionally confirmed the findings from troselj et al 2017 in which the proposed methodology can be successfully used to predict runoff values from other extreme precipitation events with similar physical characteristics however we showed that the sce ua optimization method calibrates unrealistic parametrization values in cases when the spatial distributions of increased rainfall are very nonhomogeneous throughout the river basin which was the case for typhoon hagibis calibration of the kitakami river basin it is also important to highlight that typhoons have unique features such as intense and high rainfall intensities and clear and stable trajectories which make them different from other mechanisms of rainfall occurrences in terms of projecting typhoon induced river discharges therefore a subject of discussion in future studies should be whether the methodology used in this study can be successfully applied to other types of spatial and temporal rainfall distributions that are different from typhoons in future works the proposed methodology should be applied to more river basins and more typhoon events per river basin to produce ensembles of calibrated parameter sets from similar historical typhoons these ensembles should then be used as tools to develop innovative real time river discharge and flood forecasting applications for future unprecedented extreme typhoon events furthermore hourly real time forecasted river mouth discharges during and after typhoon hagibis can be coupled with coastal ocean models to project associated coastal ocean disasters which occur during the passage of a typhoon and induce extreme river discharges declaration of

projected river mouth discharges from three japanese typhoons hagibis 2019 roke 2011 and chataan 2002 using calibrated parameter sets from each typhoon we found the equifinality issue among the calibrated parameter sets but they showed satisfactory cross validation results with respect to river mouth hydrographs that similar typhoon trajectories were more important for calibration than rainfall intensities and central pressures that this methodology was accurate for typhoons passing within distances lower than 130 km from associated river basins these findings contribute to developing the real time forecasting tools for extreme river discharges during unprecedented heavy rainfall floods keywords projection extreme river discharge typhoon hagibis cdrm hydrological model sce ua optimization method real time flood forecasting 1 introduction as a result of climate change impacts record breaking disasters occur worldwide every year and in japan with unprecedented amounts of heavy rainfall typhoon intensities and associated coastal sea disasters which bring very large quantities of river water as well as nutrient pollution toward river mouths and into coastal sea zones such extreme river water amounts as well as nutrient pollution in coastal zones greatly decrease sea water quality and can negatively impact marine environments for several days or weeks to mitigate the negative impacts of such disasters it is important to develop real time forecasting or nowcasting of extreme river water levels during typhoon induced flood events but these predictions are still not well developed due to the high uncertainty of occurrence and absence of available historical data for unprecedented rainfall events many recent studies have focused on simulating river water or inundation levels during heavy rainfall induced events these studies are classified as follows based on the type of methodology applied the classification includes physically distributed kinematic wave methods chang and huang 2013 tanaka et al 2017 lee et al 2019 tanaka et al 2020 fully dynamic wave momentum equation methods li et al 2005 jhong et al 2017 and diffusive wave transfer methods huang et al 2012 pham et al 2018 sayama et al 2020 which have all been frequently used approaches over the past several decades the advantage of using physically distributed models is their accurate interpretation of basin physical processes whereas a disadvantage is the necessity to evaluate large numbers of parameters for making realistic river basin representations also their parameters can sometimes be used for a wide range of river basin cases artificial neural network ann methods are another approach that has been used more recently ouyang 2018 chang et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 these are data driven approaches and do not consider the physical processes of basins with this approach the results can be very accurate in terms of the predictability of the final outputs but they cannot explain the physical processes which led to the final outputs also the same approach cannot be reused for multiple river basins other recently used approaches are based on conceptual distributed rainfall runoff models kimura et al 2018 conceptual lumped rainfall runoff models lee et al 2018 and semi distributed conceptual hydrological models zhang et al 2018 the advantages of using conceptual models are their simplicity and low computing requirements whereas a disadvantage is the necessity to have large amounts of hydrological and meteorological data to evaluate large numbers of parameters to properly describe physical processes most recent studies in the field are focused on ongoing climate change impact assessments related to typhoon induced and related riverine flood disasters or particularly to the disastrous impact of the recent typhoon hagibis among them mok et al 2019 emphasized the increasing impacts of such typhoon induced summer precipitation and associated river discharge events on sediment biogeochemistry near river mouths in china the findings of taniguchi 2016 higashino and stefan 2019 and takata et al 2020 emphasized the increasing importance of developing methods for real time forecasting of extreme flood events to contribute to disaster prevention management of downstream flood prone areas in japan from the meteorological perspective takemi and unuma 2020 found that deep moist absolutely unstable layers high relative humidity throughout the troposphere and an abundant moisture content were triggering factors for formation of the typhoon hagibis tay et al 2020 provided flood and damage proxy maps during and after the typhoon hagibis which were rapidly derived from synthetic aperture radar data by using change detection approaches shimozono et al 2020 evaluated coastal impacts from the typhoon hagibis and found that the typhoon generated the highest level storm surges recorded in the study area thus adding to the importance of comprehensive river ocean modelling on coastal marine environments in order to reduce negative disastrous impacts sayama et al 2020 evaluated the hydrological predictability and discussed possible future nowcasting application of the typhoon hagibis and heavy rainfall event of july 2018 in western japan using uncalibrated rri model although the above mentioned studies greatly contributed to the understanding of the physical connections among unprecedented heavy rainfalls typhoon intensities and associated extreme river discharges none of them quantitatively evaluated the impact of extreme freshwater outflows on the coastal environment during typhoon passage by combining river and ocean models using hourly time step data and remote sensing technology which was a new contribution from troselj et al 2017 with the advances in weather forecasting systems and the specific capability of forecasting typhoon trajectory and intensity they aimed to be able to comprehend freshwater impacts on coastal marine environments in advance of typhoon events they used the hydrological cell distributed runoff model version 3 1 1 cdrm kojima et al 1998 sayama et al 2003 tachikawa et al 2004 sayama and mcdonnell 2009 apip et al 2012 luo et al 2014 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 and calibrated five rainfall runoff parameters e g soil roughness coefﬁcient river roughness coefﬁcient effective porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and effective rainfall which depended upon the properties of each river basin and also on observed hourly rainfall data input to the cdrm model is the uniform effective rainfall in each cell added to the cumulative flow from upstream side cells which is performed by the kinematic wave method they calibrated the parameter sets by using the shuffled complex evolution optimization method developed at the university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 sorooshian et al 1993 duan et al 1994 harada et al 2006 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 with respect to observed hourly discharge data from the station which is located closest to the river mouth however a limitation of their study is that they established a database of calibrated river basin parameter sets for only two extreme typhoon cases with similar trajectories but a database for many more extreme typhoon cases needs to be established for use as a tool for real time forecasting of river water levels during and after extreme flood events furthermore they only qualitatively demonstrated that there was a functional relationship among the distances between typhoon trajectories as well as their minimum central pressures and river basins but they did not quantify the functional relationship in this study the methodology developed in troselj et al 2017 is utilized to project the most recent extreme flood event that occurred in the kanto region of japan during passage of typhoon hagibis in october 2019 this study provides further confirmation of previous findings and adds several new findings therefore this study is an additional contribution that adds new supporting data to support a more comprehensive objective of producing ensemble cases with similar typhoon trajectories the main objective of this study is to present and discuss new supporting data to confirm that parametrized calibration sets for river basins with similar typhoon trajectories can be used for real time forecasting of future typhoon induced extreme water levels and associated unprecedented floods additionally the reasons why different values of parameter sets can provide different outputs with various rainfall inputs were discussed the relative impact of typhoon trajectories rainfall intensities and central pressures in the calibration and validation processes was compared and the functional relationship of distances between the trajectories of typhoons and mean centres of associated river basins was quantified 2 materials and methods the study expands on the work of troselj et al 2017 with new supporting data added it was projected how river mouth discharges for the nine first class rivers by using calibrated parameter sets from troselj et al 2017 for typhoons roke in 2011 and chataan in 2002 could have been real time forecasted or nowcasted during the passage of typhoon hagibis in 2019 and vice versa 2 1 study sites extreme river discharges from typhoon hagibis in october 2019 for nine first class river basins flowing from north eastern japan into the western pacific ocean were projected from south to north these rivers are the tone naka kuji abukuma natori naruse kitakami mabechi and takase rivers arranged by catchment area of the most downstream station with observed discharge data these rivers are classified as follows tone 12458 km2 kitakami 7869 km2 abukuma 5625 km2 naka 2552 km2 mabechi 2024 km2 kuji 1442 km2 naruse 1158 km2 takase 867 km2 and natori 776 km2 fig 1 shows digital elevation maps dem of the nine targeted river basins with their associated mean centres and compares them with the passage tracks of typhoons hagibis roke and chataan these typhoons were chosen for analysis because they all had similar trajectories and rainfall intensity ranges therefore we expect that the physical characteristics of river runoff from these events would be similar so that calibrated river basin parameter sets from one typhoon could be used to forecast river runoff values for other typhoons 2 2 material and datasets observed hourly rainfall data were collected from the online database of the japan meteorological agency jma 2020 observed discharge and dam data were collected from the online database of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2020 discharge stage relationships q h curves were computed to fill in missing data for the target events the computed results of q h curves for every river separately are published in troselj 2016 because of significantly different flow patterns for the low and high waters of the tone river q h curves for tone river were computed twice separately for discharges up to 4000 m3 s using the same formulas as in troselj 2016 and for discharges above that threshold for the discharges above 4000 m3 s a newly computed formula of y 548 65 x2 5793 x 19 385 with r2 0 92 was obtained from the correlation of 9 highest daily observed discharge data in period from 2001 to 2008 hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds datasets for dem flow accumulation acc and flow direction dir were obtained from u s geological survey hydrosheds 2017 with 15 arc seconds about 500 m resolution grid data for all the datasets 2 3 model configurations the abovementioned nine river discharges from typhoon hagibis from october 11 2019 at 12 00 to october 18 2019 at 12 00 all time references are shown in jst time zone were simulated using the cdrm model with a spatial resolution of approximately 500 m 15 arc sec and a 1 h time step depending upon the basin properties calibrated from typhoons roke and chataan and observed rainfall amounts from typhoon hagibis river discharges were in principle simulated for the most downstream discharge stations with available observed data records however if tidal effects were great enough to reduce observed data reliability then the closest upstream discharge station without significant tidal effect was chosen for the observation and simulation location hereafter river mouth the particular river mouth location for each river was noted in corresponding results section for that river for example for tone river which has the biggest tidal effect river mouth was approximately represented with fukawa observation station which is located 76 47 km from the river mouth this is because simulating river discharges on the actual river mouth would need to include other very complex physical processes such as tidal or back water effect which are not desirable in the hydrological modelling so the river mouth discharges were approximated from an observation station relatively close to the actual river mouth but enough far away not to be significantly affected by tidal or backwater effect on this way tidal or back water effect was omitted or greatly reduced from the hydrological modelling and the study could therefore be focused solely on hydrological effects the surface flow of each individual cell in the cdrm model is represented by eq 1 and is calculated by the kinematic wave method tachikawa et al 2004 sasaki 2014 1 δ h δ t δ q δ x r e q f h s n h m where q discharge per unit width h water depth re effective rainfall s slope gradient n equivalent roughness and m slope constant the slope s is obtained from the dem while the equivalent roughness n is generally a value or observations used in the kinematic wave method where it is treated as a model parameter by setting an upper limit the relationship between q and h with applied parametrization simplifications from this study is represented graphically in fig 2 this relationship enables tracking of the rainwater propagation speed in combination with the continuous basic equation eq 1 dam effects for three major rivers e g tone kitakami and abukuma were considered to be the same as in troselj et al 2017 if the simulated inflow to a dam was bigger than the maximum observed outflow mlit 2020 then the outflow from the dam was set to the maximum observed outflow land use and soil depth 1000 mm were assumed to be uniform to simplify the calibration process another assumption was that all water began to flow immediately after reaching the soil because the impact of the capillary subsurface flow layer is assumed to be very minor or insignificant in cases when there were very large rainfall amounts such as those originating from a typhoon with that assumption the number of parameters to be calibrated decreased from seven to five by omitting dm and β see fig 2 the other five model parameters e g soil roughness coefficient n slo river roughness coefficient n riv effective porosity θa saturated hydraulic conductivity ka and effective rainfall f1 were calibrated separately for each river by the sce ua optimization method initial parameter sets and minimal and maximal searching ranges for the sce ua parameter calibrations were determined in the same manner as described in troselj et al 2017 the values were chosen to represent physically realistic bounds of parameters one of calibrated parameters e g effective rainfall is event dependent and therefore by using different spatiotemporal rainfall patterns in the calibration process different combinations of calibrated parameters will come out as the final results for each typhoon event the cdrm model performance was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency accuracy evaluation index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 sasaki 2014 troselj et al 2017 which was used as the accuracy evaluation index for outflow calibrations eq 2 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q 0 i q i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 where n number of time steps q o i observed discharge rate at time i q i calculated discharge rate at time i and q o average value of the observed discharge rate nse values bigger than 0 7 are generally considered to have satisfactory goodness of fit 2 4 model calibration and validation previously calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan troselj et al 2017 were used to run the cdrmv model with typhoon hagibis rainfall input data and for associated validation of modelled and observed data from the nine first class river mouth discharges from north eastern japan such real time forecasting scenarios were reproduced assuming that input forecasted meteorological data which corresponded to the mlit observed data after the event was available the inverse process was also performed by using calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoon hagibis with rainfall input data from typhoons roke and chataan therefore a total of nine sets of results were produced e g three calibration sets one for each typhoon and six cross validation sets two for each typhoon four of these parameter sets e g two typhoons roke and chataan calibration and two cross validation sets between these typhoons were previously published in troselj et al 2017 additional five parameter sets were newly introduced in this study e g one typhoon s hagibis calibration and four cross validation sets two of them between typhoons hagibis and roke and two of them between typhoons hagibis and chataan 3 results in this section we show the calibrated results for typhoon hagibis and validate them by using river basin calibrated parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan with rainfall from typhoon hagibis and vice versa table 1 shows calibrated parameter values for each of nine target rivers for all three typhoon events considered these calibrated parameter values were used for calibration and validation of each of the three cases of typhoon rainfall and produced a total of nine versions of the results 3 1 typhoon hagibis projection in the following we show calibrated results for typhoon hagibis and validate them by using river basin calibrated parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan with rainfall from typhoon hagibis separately for the eight rivers from south to north and excluding the kitakami river in this subsection we excluded the kitakami river because it is the first river from south to north where the nse values for typhoon hagibis become significantly low so we separately discuss detailed reasons for this later by comparison with typhoons roke and chataan nse values in subsection 3 2 1 table 2 compares nse value for model runs for all rivers with calibrated parameter sets for typhoon hagibis with three different typhoon cases of rainfall datasets 3 1 1 tone river fig 3 shows tone river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at fukawa station located 76 47 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 2 naka river fig 4 shows naka river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at suifu bridge station located 12 4 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 3 kuji river fig 5 shows kuji river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at sakaki bridge station located 4 5 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 4 abukuma river fig 6 shows abukuma river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at iwanuma station located 8 07 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 5 natori river fig 7 shows natori river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis where observed discharges were summed up from two tributaries namely at hirose bridge located 9 25 km upstream from the river mouth and natori bridge located 8 26 km upstream from the river mouth these tributaries meet at the same point at a location 5 7 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 6 naruse river fig 8 shows naruse river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis where observed discharges were summed up from two tributaries namely noda bridge located 24 6 km upstream from the river mouth and hataya located 13 6 km upstream from the river mouth these tributaries meet at the same point at a location 0 5 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 7 mabechi river fig 9 shows mabechi river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at bridge station located 4 km upstream from the river mouth 3 1 8 takase river fig 10 shows takase river calibration and validation results for typhoon hagibis at ueno station located just upstream from lake ogawara which is 27 6 km upstream from the river mouth 3 2 comparisons of typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections in the following we compare typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections we show the results for the kitakami river and total freshwater outflows from all nine rivers to the pacific ocean in the main body detailed results for calibration and validation cases for typhoons roke and chataan at the same locations as in section 3 1 for the other 8 rivers are shown in the supplementary material as supplementary figs a1 a16 tables 3 and 4 compare nse values of model runs for all rivers with typhoon roke and chataan calibrated parameter sets respectively with rainfall datasets for three different typhoon cases 3 2 1 kitakami river in the following we show kitakami river results from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan as well as its peak hourly spatial rainfall distributions fig 11 a c shows kitakami river calibration and validation results for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively for kitakami river calibration observed discharges were added from artificially constructed new and old river mouths which are now separated namely tome located 40 45 km and 32 07 km upstream from the old and new river mouths respectively and wabuchi located 21 78 km upstream from the old river mouth to compare the impacts of these parameter sets values in a wider context we compared them with fig 12 a c which shows peak hour spatial rainfall distributions for the kitakami river basin for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively 3 2 2 total freshwater outflow from all rivers in the following we compare total freshwater outflow results from all nine rivers into the pacific ocean with the rainfall inputs from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan when using each of the three typhoon calibrated parameter sets fig 13 a c shows total freshwater outflow calibration and validation results for typhoons hagibis roke and chataan respectively representative river mouth observed and modelled discharges from each river were taken from the same locations as described in figs 3 11 which are all located close to river mouths then the river discharge values from each of the nine rivers were summed to obtain the total freshwater outflow into the pacific ocean 3 3 typhoon tracks distance sensitivity analysis in this section we show the functional relationship among distances between trajectories of each typhoon see fig 1 dashed lines and their minimum central pressures compared to mean centres of the associated river basins see fig 1 black dots 3 3 1 typhoon hagibis distance sensitivity analysis fig 14 shows distance comparisons between the trajectories of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon hagibis projections with typhoons hagibis roke and chataan calibrated parameter sets see table 2 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 3 3 2 typhoon roke distance sensitivity analysis fig 15 shows distance comparisons between the trajectory of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon roke projections with typhoons roke hagibis and chataan calibrated parameter sets see table 3 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 3 3 3 typhoon chataan distance sensitivity analysis fig 16 shows distance comparisons between the trajectories of each typhoon and mean centres of the associated river basins and associated nse values for typhoon chataan projections with typhoons chataan hagibis and roke calibrated parameter sets see table 4 and typhoon minimum central pressures for given locations 4 discussions we discuss the parametrization and metrics of our results in terms of nse accuracy evaluation indexes of river mouth modelled and observed discharges mlit 2020 for each of the nine rivers considered starting from the southernmost tone river table 1 suggests that calibrated parameter sets for river basins are event dependent which is known as the equifinality issue in calibration of hydrological models beven 2006 quality of our calibration process can only be properly evaluated by simultaneous combination of five parameters and how they interact together to forecast river mouth hydrographs but not by extracting a single parameter and evaluating its values in three different parameter sets for example when used parameters are evaluated one by one then bigger soil roughness coefficient bigger river roughness coefficient smaller effective porosity bigger saturated hydraulic conductivity and bigger effective rainfall are altogether contributory to bigger river mouth discharge thus if we evaluate only one parameter and conclude that results are not reasonable based on value of that one particular parameter it is misleading way because we need to evaluate all five parameters as a whole therefore we evaluated these calibrated parameter sets by cross validating all three typhoon events with respect to river mouth hydrographs to demonstrate highly accurate results when using our methodology nse values from table 2 suggest that hagibis calibration always produced very good results which was expected because it represented the case with direct calibration of parameters using rainfall data from the same event roke s validation produced better results than chataan s validation mainly because roke s trajectory was closer to hagibis trajectory than chataan s additionally nse values from both validation cases rapidly decreased as the trajectory distance from river basins for typhoon hagibis increased for the kitakami mabechi and takase rivers detailed reasons for such results will be discussed in this chapter tables 3 and 4 further confirm that the cdrm model calibrated with the sce ua optimization method could produce results with very high nse calibration values however more important for the application of our study is the quality of nse validation values by using calibrated parameter sets from one typhoon but rainfall data from a different typhoon in that respect typhoons roke and chataan calibrations produced similar nse values for typhoon hagibis validation for the six southernmost rivers when all typhoons were relatively close to river basins however typhoon roke calibration produced much better results for typhoon hagibis validation for the three northernmost rivers compared to typhoon chataan calibration with nse values of 0 50 0 57 and 0 81 roke and 0 02 0 30 and 0 66 chataan respectively this is probably because typhoon roke followed similar trajectory angles and distances like typhoon hagibis for the three northernmost rivers see fig 1 dashed lines while typhoon chataan suddenly changed its trajectory angle in that area which therefore caused its calibration parameters to be less reliable for predicting river discharges from other typhoons we conclude that parameter sets calibrated with typhoon hagibis could also have been used retroactively to project river mouth discharges from typhoons roke and hagibis for the six southernmost rivers with high accuracy therefore the calibrated parameter sets could have been used for cross validation and cross prediction of river mouth water levels and discharges for the six southernmost rivers from all three typhoon cases with satisfactory accuracy 4 1 typhoon hagibis projection in the following we discuss accuracy of calibrated and validated results for typhoon hagibis for each river separately and for all rivers comprehensively the typhoon hagibis calibration results see table 2 showed high goodness of fit with nse values of 0 91 1 00 for seven southernmost rivers whereas nse values were lower 0 85 and 0 73 respectively for mabechi and takase rivers which are located further away from the typhoon track similarly the validation results with typhoon roke for six the southernmost rivers were extremely high from 0 88 to 0 94 however the validation results with typhoon chataan for six the southernmost rivers were slightly lower from 0 61 to 0 89 but still in satisfactory range to put these results into context we can compare them with the only other hydrological study about typhoon hagibis sayama et al 2020 nse values from their study were 0 50 0 46 and 0 86 0 10 in model setup without and with unsaturated flow component which is lower accuracy than in this study however in their study the used rri model was not calibrated whereas in our study we calibrated the cdrmv model so this difference in accuracy values can be attributed to the applied calibration method we highlight two main takeaways from this discussion that distances between calibrated and validated typhoon tracks are very important central track distances between typhoons roke and hagibis tracks is smaller than between typhoons chataan and hagibis and that distances between the calibrated typhoon central track and associated river basin should not be too big because when they become too big then accuracy of calibrated and validated results gets rapidly decreased e g like for the three northernmost rivers in this study these takeaways are quantified and discussed in more details in the subsection 4 3 4 2 comparisons of typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections in the following we discuss accuracy of calibrated and cross validated results from typhoon hagibis roke and chataan projections for the kitakami river and total freshwater outflows from all nine rivers to the pacific ocean 4 2 1 kitakami river in the following we discuss with the particular example of kitakami river how different values of parameter sets can sometimes produce very different river discharge outputs with various rainfall inputs we discuss kitakami river results separately from the other rivers because this is first river from south to north where the nse values for typhoon hagibis became significantly low and were much different than for those of typhoons roke and chataan thus we tried to determine the reasons for these results based on fig 11 we point out that the calibration process by using the proposed methodology provided satisfactory nse results e g 0 91 0 97 and 0 91 for the hagibis roke and chataan cases respectively but for validation cases satisfactory nse results were provided only for cross validation of roke and chataan e g 0 81 and 0 75 respectively for every 4 cross validation cases with hagibis nse results were significantly lower which means that the reproducibility of river discharges was not reliable furthermore the hydrograph peaks for all calibration and validation cases of hagibis occurred earlier than those for the other two typhoons this was especially extreme in the chataan projection where the hagibis validation case peak occurred immediately after the first small rainfall event instead of after the second larger rainfall event which would be expected intuitively and which occurred in the chataan calibration and roke validation cases if we compare these results with all parameter sets from all three typhoons see table 1 we can see that hagibis parametrization had nearly minimum values for the soil roughness coefficient 0 10 and river roughness coefficient 0 03 and maximum values for saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 50 all of which contributed to rapid water flow progression throughout the basin however roke and chataan exhibited nearly maximum values for soil roughness coefficient e g 1 00 and 1 00 respectively and river roughness coefficient e g 0 10 and 0 08 respectively and average to minimum values of saturated hydraulic conductivity e g 0 29 and 0 10 respectively which were values that contributed to slow water flow progression throughout the basin based on fig 12 we note that the kitakami river basin is very elongated in the south north direction which makes it more challenging for calibration than the other river basins considered additionally we point out that the hagibis case rainfall within the kitakami river basin was spatially distributed very non homogeneously with much bigger values of up to 45 mm h only at the southern end closer to the river mouth but with much smaller values of 5 10 mm h at the northern end however the roke and chataan rainfall cases were more homogeneously distributed throughout the river basin with bigger values of 15 26 mm h extending from the south into the middle of the river basin for roke and with bigger values of 15 32 mm h within the middle of the river basin for chataan these findings may indicate that the sce ua optimization method had a tendency to calibrate parameters in a manner that the river water progressed too quickly from the northern part of the basin to produce satisfactory discharge values at the river mouth hagibis calibration nse 0 91 for cases when the spatial distribution of increased rainfall was not homogeneous throughout a river basin the sce ua optimization method produced unrealistic parametrization values however for the roke and chataan parametrizations the rainfall was more homogenously distributed throughout the kitakami river basin so their calibrated parameter sets described the river basin much more realistically than the hagibis calibrated parameter set furthermore this phenomenon was observed solely for the kitakami river basin because it was the only river where the spatial rainfall distributions were non homogeneous for typhoon hagibis but were homogeneous for typhoons roke and chataan in all other river basins rainfall distributions were more homogeneously distributed during all three typhoon events 4 2 2 total freshwater outflow from all rivers in the following we discuss the accuracy of this study results for projecting total freshwater outflow results from all nine rivers into the pacific ocean with the rainfall inputs from typhoons hagibis roke and chataan when using each of the three typhoon calibrated parameter sets especially considering the relative magnitudes of freshwater outflows which these typhoons discharged into the pacific ocean based on fig 13 we point out that our projections provided extremely high nse values of 0 97 0 99 and 0 98 for the hagibis roke and chataan calibration cases respectively when considering total freshwater outflow from all rivers into the pacific ocean this indicated that our methodology could be applied very accurately to separately reproduce the total freshwater budget for each typhoon furthermore our projections provided very high nse values when validating calibrated parameter sets with rainfall from different typhoons e g from 0 83 to 0 95 for six validation cases these results indicated very high ability for predicting total freshwater budgets from different typhoons it is important to note that cross validations of the hagibis and roke cases projected extremely high nse values of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively while cross validations with the chataan cases projected lower values e g 0 83 to 0 88 but were still in a satisfactory nse range we conclude that the accuracy of river discharge reproducibility from past similar extreme event parametrizations increased with decreasing distances of given typhoon trajectories because typhoons hagibis and roke were closer to calibrated river basins and to each other than typhoon chataan furthermore we highlighted the magnitudes of peak observed total freshwater discharges from three typhoons which were approximately 33 000 23 000 and 29 000 m3 s for hagibis roke and chataan respectively however despite the fact that the total freshwater discharge from chataan was closer to hagibis than to roke cross validations of hagibis and roke provided higher accuracy results than any cross validations with chataan this indicates that the trajectories of calibrated typhoon cases see fig 1 dashed lines are more important for projections of another typhoons than the rainfall intensities for those cases when intensities are in the extreme range we also showed that calibrated parameter sets from roke could be very accurately used to project river discharge values from hagibis despite the fact that hagibis exhibited approximately 10 000 m3 s 70 higher peak observed total freshwater outflow than roke this is important because developing a methodology that can project or predict extreme unprecedented river discharges is currently one of the most important challenges in hydrology 4 3 typhoon tracks distance sensitivity analysis in the following we quantify and discuss the functional relationship in terms of accuracy of calibrated and validated results for each river basin when considering the associated nse values of each typhoon we discuss the nse values in terms of distances between trajectories of each typhoon and their minimum central pressures compared to mean centres of the associated river basins based on fig 14 we point out that the typhoon hagibis validation results were significant for the six southernmost river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 100 km and central pressure was lower than 970 hpa the results significantly decreased with longer distances but central pressures did not change significantly across the entire domain hagibis projections using roke parameter sets were always more accurate than using chataan parameter sets based on fig 15 we point out that typhoon roke validation results were significant for all river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 130 km and central pressure was below 978 hpa roke projections using hagibis parameter sets were more accurate for the six southernmost rivers whereas using chataan parameter sets were more accurate for the three northernmost rivers when the track of chataan was closer to the river basins than the track of hagibis based on fig 16 we point out that the typhoon chataan validation results were significant for the seven southernmost river basins in the range when its distances from the typhoon were lower than 130 km and central pressure was below 974 hpa chataan projections using hagibis parameter sets were similar to those when using roke parameter sets because they both had shorter distances from river basins than typhoon chataan based on figs 14 16 we point out that central pressure values from the three typhoons were in similar ranges e g values from 962 to 978 hpa throughout the entire domain but did not fluctuate significantly however results were very accurate for all cases when trajectories of each typhoon compared to mean centres of the associated river basins were lower than 130 km we therefore conclude that trajectories of calibrated typhoon cases were more important for projections of other typhoons than their central pressure values for cases when the central pressures of associated typhoons were in similar ranges based on this finding we assume that the same conclusions could also be made for cases in which the central pressures of associated typhoons are not in a similar range but their trajectories are similar for example if one typhoon is calibrated in its ascending stage but the other in its descending stage 5 conclusions the main findings of this study confirm with new data that the methodology developed in troselj et al 2017 can be successfully used to project river discharges for future unprecedented typhoons by showing its applicability to another recent extreme precipitation event namely typhoon hagibis extreme discharge events have many uncertainties and differences among their physical processes however we emphasized their similarities by calibrating river basin responses to particular typhoon induced rainfall events and then used the calibrated basin parameter sets to forecast river discharges for future events with similar forecasted rainfall patterns an additional minor finding of this study is that similar typhoon trajectories are much more important for calibration and validation processes than rainfall intensity and central pressure the proposed methodology is very accurate when applied to typhoons with similar trajectories passing within distances lower than 130 km between typhoon trajectories and the mean centres of associated river basins additionally we highlighted that all three typhoons had similar central pressure ranges e g approximately 10 hpa differences which certainly contributed to their reproducibility by using calibrated parameter sets from other typhoons we showed that the methodology and model used in this study has the capability of simulating extreme discharge events by conducting calibrations using previous extreme typhoon events with similar trajectories when using calibrated river basin parameter sets from typhoons roke and chataan for projection of typhoon hagibis the calibrated nse values were mostly bigger than 0 8 and 0 9 respectively exceptions were the most northern rivers namely kitakami mabechi and takase which did not show significant goodness of fit due to their locations being more than 130 km away from the trajectory of typhoon hagibis these results suggest that the cdrm model that is calibrated for the typhoons roke or chataan cases can be successfully applied to forecast river runoff values from other similar extreme precipitation events and furthermore the newly calibrated parameter sets from typhoon hagibis can be used as an additional real time forecasting tool therefore if the proposed methodology is applied to produce ensembles of calibrated parameter sets from similar historical typhoons it can serve as an accurate tool for real time forecasting of river discharges from extreme typhoon events when this study results are to be used for future real time forecasting of river discharges then we recommend two ways of using the three calibrated parameter sets if the goal of the future real time forecasting is to get the most accurate river discharges forecast then the calibrated parameter set from one of three typhoons with the closest track distance compared to the forecasted typhoon should be used however if real time forecasting of the worst case flood scenario is desirable on the way to have future forecast on the safer side another way could be to use ensemble of all three typhoon cases and choose the case which produces the biggest river discharges as the representative case there are several limitations of this study we applied uniform land use values for all river basins which may be improved in future studies for more realistic representations of river basin surface processes furthermore similar to the findings from troselj et al 2017 we found the equifinality issue by evaluating our calibrated parameter sets however we cross validated three calibrated parameter sets with rainfall from other typhoon events with respect to river mouth hydrographs to demonstrate highly accurate results when using our methodology we additionally confirmed the findings from troselj et al 2017 in which the proposed methodology can be successfully used to predict runoff values from other extreme precipitation events with similar physical characteristics however we showed that the sce ua optimization method calibrates unrealistic parametrization values in cases when the spatial distributions of increased rainfall are very nonhomogeneous throughout the river basin which was the case for typhoon hagibis calibration of the kitakami river basin it is also important to highlight that typhoons have unique features such as intense and high rainfall intensities and clear and stable trajectories which make them different from other mechanisms of rainfall occurrences in terms of projecting typhoon induced river discharges therefore a subject of discussion in future studies should be whether the methodology used in this study can be successfully applied to other types of spatial and temporal rainfall distributions that are different from typhoons in future works the proposed methodology should be applied to more river basins and more typhoon events per river basin to produce ensembles of calibrated parameter sets from similar historical typhoons these ensembles should then be used as tools to develop innovative real time river discharge and flood forecasting applications for future unprecedented extreme typhoon events furthermore hourly real time forecasted river mouth discharges during and after typhoon hagibis can be coupled with coastal ocean models to project associated coastal ocean disasters which occur during the passage of a typhoon and induce extreme river discharges declaration of

bb db eb ac ab and gb rating and were not suitable for drinking but were suitable for bathing this new scale can be used by international institutions to mark and monitor the quality of water resources in all countries in order to assess the efforts made by each country to protect and purify its water resources this scale is particularly suitable for african countries where water resources are often polluted on the physico chemical and microbiological levels keywords drinking and bathing water overall quality evaluation multivariate analysis hounsinou scale benin 1 introduction a lack of management has already led to contamination and overexploitation of aquifers in some areas and could result in additional water supply problems land subsidence and the deterioration of groundwater dependent ecosystems once groundwater is contaminated its quality cannot be restored and it is very expensive and hard to clean up barbieri et al 2018 groundwater supplies more than 50 of the world s drinking water demand erickson et al 2019 due to climate change precipitation and associated groundwater recharge is decreasing in dry season and in rain season precipitation and associated groundwater is increasing additionally rapid population growth leads to an increase in water demand wu et al 2020 according to unicef and who 2017 nearly 850 million people worldwide are facing a crisis of access to safe drinking water rakib et al 2020 today providing or accessing safe drinking water has become one of the most important goals of governments jehan et al 2019 the chemical composition and quality of water is not only a function of hydrological factors but also affected by factors such as geological and lithological characteristics of aquifers water rock or sediment interactions and human factors such as agricultural activities population growth rapid industrialization growth and climate change singh et al 2005 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 trabelsi and zouari 2019 amiri et al 2020 many researchers have used the capabilities of multivariate statistical techniques to study changes in the chemical composition of groundwater for example mohapatra et al 2011 biswas et al 2012 nagaraju et al 2016 amiri et al 2017 khelif and boudoukha 2018 loh et al 2019 amiri et al 2020 given the importance of groundwater as one of the most important sources of drinking water in the world in recent years many studies have focused on groundwater quality for drinking and human health for example alomirah et al 2020 herojeet et al 2020 twana et al 2020 bastani and harter 2019 ravindra et al 2019 dippong et al 2019 ravindra and mor 2019 khalid 2019 kamrani et al 2016 saha et al 2019 ricolfi et al 2020 therefore the qualitative protection of groundwater resources is a serious challenge and a public duty that must be addressed by all countries to prevent future critical situations to this end assessment of water quality is necessary several authors have evaluated the quality or pollution of surface water and groundwater using quality index or pollution index the organic pollution index depends on the levels of ammonium nitrite and phosphate ions and dbo5 in water five content classes are defined for each of these parameters the opi is the average of the class numbers for each parameter the values of the opi allow the organic pollution of water to be divided into 5 levels to assess the level of organic pollution of surface water or groundwater the organic pollution index opi has been used by several authors including bahroun 2007 bahroun and bousnoubra 2011 bouzidi 2001 drouiche et al 2013 fawzi et al 2001 mounjid et al 2014 nehar et al 2014 nicolas 1996 rasmont 2006 samia 2006 touzin and roy 2008 the microbiological quality index mqi depends on the concentrations in the water of total coliforms fecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci five concentration classes are defined for each of these parameters the iqm is the average of the class numbers for each parameter the mqi values allow the microbiological pollution of water to be divided into 5 quality classes corresponding to standard colors to assess the microbiological quality of water the microbiological quality index mqi has been used by several authors including kherifi and bousnoubra 2012 sender et al 1987 silvestri et al 1997 hounsinou et al 2015b water quality index wqi computation involves four steps parameter selection development of sub indices assignment of weights and aggregation of sub indices to produce an overall index wqi helps to reveal the temporal and spatial variation of water quality bharti and katyal 2011 to assess the chemical quality of water the water quality index wqi has been used by several authors including akoteyon et al 2010 yidana and yidana 2010 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 partey et al 2010 celik and yildirim 2006 mishra et al 2005 edmunds et al 2003 shah et al 2008 sunitha et al 2014 none of these water pollution index or water quality index on their own reflects the overall quality chemical and microbiological of the water this is why we have developed a binary scale which more accurately indicates the chemical and microbiological quality of water regardless of its source and which facilitates communication with the public on the possible uses of this water the hounsinou scale separately indicates the chemical and microbiological qualities of water this constitutes the innovation and the advantage of this scale compared to the water quality indices used until today in this study the chemical and the microbiological quality of groundwater resources in the monitoring network designed in abomey calavi municipality was investigated so far no comprehensive study focusing on the the chemical and the microbiological quality of groundwater resources and their fitness for drinking and bathing has been conducted in this study the chemical and the microbiological status of groundwater of abomey calavi municipality as well as the potential of human health risk due to water consumption and bathing is considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographic location abomey calavi is located in the southern part of the republic of benin in the department of atlantic between latitudes 6 20 23 4 and 6 42 6 6 north and longitudes 2 14 13 8 and 2 25 7 8 east abomey calavi include seventy 70 villages and cities grouped in nine 9 counties which are abomey calavi center godomey akassato zinvié ouedo togba hevié kpanroun and glo djigbé fig 1 abomey calavi located in the southern part of the republic of benin and atlantic department is bordered to the north by the municipality of zé south by the atlantic ocean east by the municipalities of so ava and cotonou and west by the municipalities of tori bossito and ouidah it is the largest municipality in the atlantic department it covers a surface area of 536 km2 representing 20 of the surface area of the department of atlantic and 0 48 of the national surface area of benin hounsinou 2020 the town of abomey calavi is at the edge of the largest water lagoon of benin republic which is the lake nokoué indeed 20 km long east west and 11 km wide north south lake nokoué is approximately 160 km2 the largest lake of benin republic and the most important economically due to its proximity to cotonou the biggest city of benin republic hounsinou 2020 lake nokoué and atlantic ocean significantly influence the groundwater pollution hounsinou 2020 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the hydrographic network of abomey calavi consists essentially of two bodies of water such as lake nokoue and djonou lagoon the town has a coastline juxtaposed to the coastal lagoon lagoon of togbin marshes streams and wetlands the study area covers two main types of geological formations fig 2 quaternary formations and tertiary formations quaternary formations that are sandy deposits of the coastal strip the lagoon deposits of clay and sand and alluvial deposits consisted of sand and clay coarse sand on the coastline has a thickness of about 6 m with a porosity exceeding 40 dégbé 2004 up coast marine gray silt fine sand has a thickness of 15 m and a porosity of around 35 dégbé 2004 finally the clay gravelly sands from the alluvium follow and whose characteristics are fairly similar to the ordinary sands of the coastline the tertiary formations consist mainly of clay and sand of the continental terminal there are three aquifers on the set the aquifer of shallow continental terminal 120 m deep the aquifer layer paleocene at the depth of 320 m the aquifer of the maastrichtian 1500 m deep the drinking water of the municipality of abomey calavi is captured by drilling into the aquifer of the continental terminal dégbé 2004 hounsinou 2012 2020 according to boukari and alassane 2007 and hounsinou 2020 the hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer are such that the transmissivity and storage coefficient values range from 1 5 to 8 103 m2 s and 1 6 1011 and 24 103 aquifer of the continental terminal respectively flows are very variable but their values are often approximately up to 5 l s 2 1 3 climatic regime the study area is located in the intertropical zone in this zone the climate is of the subequatorial type characterized by two rainy seasons and two dry seasons distributed in time as follows hounsinou 2012 september to november small rainy season november to march great dry season march to july great rainy season july to september small dry season the average annual rainfall over the period 1970 2020 is 1300 mm 2 2 material and methods of chemical and microbiological analyzes we measured physico chemical and microbiological parameters of 68 wells the depth of the wells varies from 30 91 m to 103 21 m for each wells water we measured 23 physico chemical parameters and 3 microbiological parameters groundwater samples were collected from deep wells using standard sampling procedures apha 1985 iso 1993 before collecting the samples groundwater was purged out for several minutes to collect a representative groundwater sample and avoid stagnant water from the pumping system aullón alcaine et al 2020 at each sampling location samples were stored in two polyethylene bottles and were divided into two groups including non acidified for anion analysis and acidified with a few drops of hno3 for analysis of cations and trace elements the collected samples were stored at 4 c until delivery to the laboratory for analyses the physicochemical parameters and their measurement methods are presented in table 1 three microbiological parameters were evaluated namely total coliforms fecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci the equipment consists of autoclaves incubators rapid e coli to identify total coliforms and fecal coliforms and slatnez bathley to identify intestinal enterococci for this study we applied the method by incorporation into an agar described in the book le rodier 1984 the physico chemical analyzes were done at the applied hydrology laboratory of the university of abomey calavi in benin the microbiological analyzes were done at the water and food quality control laboratory public hygiene service directorate of basic hygiene and sanitation in benin weighted arithmetic sums of the values of the physicochemical and microbiological parameters and of the who standards are used to calculate the chemical water quality index cwqi and the microbiological water quality index mwqi the marking of water on the hounsinou scale consists of two alphabetical letters assigned respectively to the cwqi table 2 and mwqi of this water cwqi computation involves several steps parameter selection determination of the ideal values of the parameters development of sub indices assignment of weights and aggregation of sub indices to produce an overall index 2 2 1 selection of the parameters to be used for the calculation of the cwqi in a study region there are water parameters whose values generally are in according with the required standards apart from these parameters for the calculation of the cwqi use as many physicochemical parameters as possible 2 2 2 the ideal value vi of a water parameter regarding the quality of drinking water according to a popular belief we need the mineral salts contained in the water we drink in fact to be assimilated by the body ions must be enveloped chelated by organic molecules these chelated ions are only found in our food not in drinking water vegetable broth fruits dairy products and meat constitute the source of assimilable mineral salts if we could assimilate the calcium or magnesium contained in water containing a lot of limestone that would be the end of diseases such as osteoporosis coxarthrosis likewise consuming ferruginous water should put an end to the anemia medical practice does not seem to confirm these claims the uptake of mineral salts in drinking water only really takes place during a prolonged water fast exceeding one week this is the reason why during fasting it is best to avoid drinking weakly mineralized water hounsinou 2012 the ideal content of a mineral salt in drinking water is vi 0 mg l for most drinking water parameters there is a maximum allowable value and no minimum required value for all these parameters as for mineral salts their ideal content in drinking water is 0 for some parameters of the drinking water a minimum value and a maximum value are required the ideals values of these parameters are the averages between the minima and the maxima allowables of the values of these parameters in the drinking water this is the case with ph and dissolved oxygen according to who standards at 25 c the ph of drinking water should be between 6 5 and 8 5 so for the ph of water at 25 c vi 6 5 8 5 2 7 the ideal ph value of water depends on its temperature fig 3 the starting point for establishing the ph scale is pure water pure water has been assigned the characteristic of neutral water dissociates as follows 2h2o h3o oh table 2 the equilibrium constant for water is equal to kw h30 oh l 10 14 where log kw pkw log h30 log oh l 14 pkw ph poh 14 since pure water breaks down into an equal number of h30 and oh ions the concentration of h30 is 10 7 and the concentration of oh is 10 7 and ph poh 7 pure water therefore has a ph 7 however this notation is not complete since the equilibrium kw constant depends on the temperature according to the equation of marshall and franck 1981 log kw 4 098 3245 2 t 2 2362 105 t2 3 984 107 t3 13 957 1262 3 t 8 5641 105 t2 log d where kw is in mol kg 1 and d is the vapor pressure in g cm 3 it should be noted that the ph of pure water is 7 at 25 c ideals values vi of the ph of drinking water is phi 0 5 pkw in the graph below some ideals values of water appear at different temperatures 2 2 3 development of cwqi sub indices the value of the nth parameter of the measured water is denoted by vn the maximum or minimum admissible value of the nth physico chemical parameter of water is called the tolerated standard value and noted sn quality rating for the nth water quality physico chemical parameter of the water is denoted by qn such that qn 100 vn vi sn vi in the case where for this nth parameter there is a maximum and a minimum admissibles values if vn is inferior to vi then sn is equal to the minimum admissible value and if vn is superior or equal to vi then sn is equal to the maximum admissible value vi being the ideal value of the nth parameter the unit weight wn is calculated by a value inversely proportional to the recommended standard value sn of the corresponding parameter wn k sn where k constant of proportionality k 1 ʃ 1 sn 2 2 4 cwqi expression cwqi ʃ qn wn ʃ wn this classification is inspired by the classification used by akoteyon 2013 and sunitha et al 2014 2 2 5 development of the mwqi the new microbiological water quality index mwqi is based on the contents per milliliter of water of total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc and intestinal enterococci ie table 3 w m q i 1 3 10 9 c t 20 c f 1000 e i 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical parameters of groundwater to know whether water is drinkable or to determine its degree of pollution the physico chemical and microbiological parameters of the water must be measured and interpreted all water quality parameters are listed in who standards 2006 depending on the nature rainwater surface water or underground water and depending on the study area some ions or molecules are rare or absent in the soil and in the water these parameters may not be measured when assessing water quality for this study we measured 20 physico chemical and 3 microbiological parameters of 68 wells 3 1 1 ph the ph of groundwater is linked to the nature of the rocks the ph of water is also linked to its temperature the ph varied between 4 98 and 7 67 with a mean value of 5 55 fig 4 this acidity is probably due to the geological nature of soil it confirms the results of bossou 2002 dégbé 2004 gomez 2009 hounsinou 2012 and hounsinou et al 2015a only 11 76 of the ph

several chemicals parameters of the wells water studied aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water namely ph ec na k total iron nh4 hco3 cl and no3 which aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water respectively in the proportions 88 24 97 06 1 47 10 12 20 53 2 97 1 47 1 47 and 1 47 3 1 23 total coliforms tc the group of total coliforms includes two groups of bacteria one is coliform mainly of faecal origin or faecal coliforms mainly hosts of the digestive tract of humans and warm blooded animals the other of non faecal origin is part of aquatic bacterial communities comes from seepage water or telluric comes from the earth the total coliforms content varied between 0 ml and 98 ml with a mean value of 11 61 ml fig 26 7 35 of the total coliforms contents measured aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water these are samples of wells numbers 3 7 39 55 and 56 3 1 24 fecal coliforms fc the advantage of detecting fecal coliforms as organisms indicating faecal pollution consists in the fact that their survival in the environment is generally equivalent to that of pathogenic bacteria and that their density is generally proportional to the degree of pollution produced by faeces ceaeq 2000 all the well water studied didn t contain fecal coliforms per ml 3 1 25 intestinal enterococci ie detection of ie in well water may indicate faecal contamination or surface water infiltration they can be an indicator of pathogenic bacteria because of their inability to multiply in the aquatic environment and of viruses because of their strong resistance surviving longer in an aquatic environment than fecal coliforms leclerc and mossel 1989 all the well water studied did not contain intestinal enterococci per ml for each well water that we studied at least one physicochemical or microbiological parameter does not in accordance with who standards the high levels of na and cl in the groundwater that we studied are due to the sedimentary rocks of the study area and also to the saline intrusion of the waters of lake nokoué and marine intrusion into the groundwater hounsinou 2020 the presence of total coliforms in the groundwater indicates bacteriological pollution of the groundwater in the study area by surface water traditional methods of assessing water quality are based on the comparison of experimentally determined parameter values with existing guidelines this method allows proper identification of contamination sources essential for checking legal compliance boyacioglu 2007 any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards is not safe to drink only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water 3 2 multivariate analysis of groundwater parameters conductivity is strongly related to tds fig 27 the curve tds f ec is a portion of a straight line which passes through the origin of the axis so tds a ec where for the well waters that we have studied a 0 5 tds 0 5 ec for the wells water we studied this result is consistent with a study carried out in 2012 in the region on shallow groundwater according to this study published in 2015 the tds is perfectly bound to the conductivity for all wells studied the tds mg l measured is equal at 0 56 times the conductivity in μs cm measured hounsinou et al 2015a a previous study using the piper diagram showed that the chlorinated facies concerns 93 33 of the water in the region there are two variants the chlorinated sodic potassic waters overwhelmingly and chlorinated sulfated magnesia waters the facies bicarbonate calcium and magnesium concerns 6 66 of samples the bicarbonated sodic potassic facies of a well in glo djigbé is a singular case hounsinou et al 2015c hounsinou 2020 chloride ions are the most important anions in most of the wells studied the most important cations associated with chlorides are sodium and potassium the chemical facies mainly encountered in the wells water studied is the sodium potassium chloride facies this confirms the results of oga 1998 which found in ivory cost that the groundwater of the sedimentary basin mainly presents a sodium potassium chloride facies the abundance of sodium and chloride ions in groundwater in the study area is of marine origin this interpretation is consistent with the proximity to the sea and the heavy rainfall in the study region indeed the municipality of abomey calavi being a coastal municipality there are quantity of precipitating vapor of mainly oceanic origin rich in na and cl coming from the evaporation of sea water rich rainwater in na and cl will reach underground aquifers by infiltration hounsinou et al 2015c the abundance of na and cl ions in groundwater in the study area is also comme from marine intrusion into these groundwater hounsinou 2020 the comparative study of each water parameter with who standards does not give the overall level of pollution of this water hence the usefulness of water quality index 3 3 groundwater quality index the parameters used to determine the chemical quality of groundwater in the municipality of abomey calavi ː ph tds

microbiological class a waters are drinkable only sample water with total rating aa ba ca da and ea are drinkable water intended for bathing must not be microbiologically polluted or must only be slightly microbiologically polluted only water of microbiological classes a b and c may be used for bathing the global quality classification of groundwater samples from monitoring wells in the study area are shown in table 7 it is not enough that water does not immediately make us sick to be considered drinkable any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards is not safe to drink only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water so the overall water quality in the area isn t good only sample water with total rating aa on the hounsinou scale is drinkable 8 82 of the well water studied has ba ca and ea ratings and are suitable for drinking and bathing 91 18 of the well water studied has cb bb db eb ac ab and gb ratings and aren t suitable for drinking but suitable for bathing the use of this new scale is that it provides a useful and effective method of assessing the suitability of water quality for various purposes it is also used to communicate information on the overall water quality using two letters compared to the water quality indices that have been used so far this new scale is better at assessing the chemical and microbiological quality of water more accurately and consistently around the world 4 conclusion it is not enough that water does not immediately make us sick to be considered drinkable any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards isn t safe to drink several chemicals parameters of the wells water studied aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water

only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water the rating of water on the hounsinou scale consists of two alphabetic letters indicating respectively the chemical quality index and the microbiological quality index of this water the determination of the quality of groundwater in the municipality of abomey calavi using this scale show that 8 82 of the wells water studied is suitable for drinking and bathing and 91 18 of the wells water studied are not suitable for drinking but are suitable for bathing compared to the water quality index that have been used so far this new scale is better because it is more precise serves to give to the public more complete information on the quality of water and is uniformly applicable everywhere in the world this new scale can be used by international institutions to rate and monitor the quality of water resources in all countries in order to assess the efforts made by countries to protect and clean up their water resources declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article

bb db eb ac ab and gb rating and were not suitable for drinking but were suitable for bathing this new scale can be used by international institutions to mark and monitor the quality of water resources in all countries in order to assess the efforts made by each country to protect and purify its water resources this scale is particularly suitable for african countries where water resources are often polluted on the physico chemical and microbiological levels keywords drinking and bathing water overall quality evaluation multivariate analysis hounsinou scale benin 1 introduction a lack of management has already led to contamination and overexploitation of aquifers in some areas and could result in additional water supply problems land subsidence and the deterioration of groundwater dependent ecosystems once groundwater is contaminated its quality cannot be restored and it is very expensive and hard to clean up barbieri et al 2018 groundwater supplies more than 50 of the world s drinking water demand erickson et al 2019 due to climate change precipitation and associated groundwater recharge is decreasing in dry season and in rain season precipitation and associated groundwater is increasing additionally rapid population growth leads to an increase in water demand wu et al 2020 according to unicef and who 2017 nearly 850 million people worldwide are facing a crisis of access to safe drinking water rakib et al 2020 today providing or accessing safe drinking water has become one of the most important goals of governments jehan et al 2019 the chemical composition and quality of water is not only a function of hydrological factors but also affected by factors such as geological and lithological characteristics of aquifers water rock or sediment interactions and human factors such as agricultural activities population growth rapid industrialization growth and climate change singh et al 2005 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 trabelsi and zouari 2019 amiri et al 2020 many researchers have used the capabilities of multivariate statistical techniques to study changes in the chemical composition of groundwater for example mohapatra et al 2011 biswas et al 2012 nagaraju et al 2016 amiri et al 2017 khelif and boudoukha 2018 loh et al 2019 amiri et al 2020 given the importance of groundwater as one of the most important sources of drinking water in the world in recent years many studies have focused on groundwater quality for drinking and human health for example alomirah et al 2020 herojeet et al 2020 twana et al 2020 bastani and harter 2019 ravindra et al 2019 dippong et al 2019 ravindra and mor 2019 khalid 2019 kamrani et al 2016 saha et al 2019 ricolfi et al 2020 therefore the qualitative protection of groundwater resources is a serious challenge and a public duty that must be addressed by all countries to prevent future critical situations to this end assessment of water quality is necessary several authors have evaluated the quality or pollution of surface water and groundwater using quality index or pollution index the organic pollution index depends on the levels of ammonium nitrite and phosphate ions and dbo5 in water five content classes are defined for each of these parameters the opi is the average of the class numbers for each parameter the values of the opi allow the organic pollution of water to be divided into 5 levels to assess the level of organic pollution of surface water or groundwater the organic pollution index opi has been used by several authors including bahroun 2007 bahroun and bousnoubra 2011 bouzidi 2001 drouiche et al 2013 fawzi et al 2001 mounjid et al 2014 nehar et al 2014 nicolas 1996 rasmont 2006 samia 2006 touzin and roy 2008 the microbiological quality index mqi depends on the concentrations in the water of total coliforms fecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci five concentration classes are defined for each of these parameters the iqm is the average of the class numbers for each parameter the mqi values allow the microbiological pollution of water to be divided into 5 quality classes corresponding to standard colors to assess the microbiological quality of water the microbiological quality index mqi has been used by several authors including kherifi and bousnoubra 2012 sender et al 1987 silvestri et al 1997 hounsinou et al 2015b water quality index wqi computation involves four steps parameter selection development of sub indices assignment of weights and aggregation of sub indices to produce an overall index wqi helps to reveal the temporal and spatial variation of water quality bharti and katyal 2011 to assess the chemical quality of water the water quality index wqi has been used by several authors including akoteyon et al 2010 yidana and yidana 2010 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 partey et al 2010 celik and yildirim 2006 mishra et al 2005 edmunds et al 2003 shah et al 2008 sunitha et al 2014 none of these water pollution index or water quality index on their own reflects the overall quality chemical and microbiological of the water this is why we have developed a binary scale which more accurately indicates the chemical and microbiological quality of water regardless of its source and which facilitates communication with the public on the possible uses of this water the hounsinou scale separately indicates the chemical and microbiological qualities of water this constitutes the innovation and the advantage of this scale compared to the water quality indices used until today in this study the chemical and the microbiological quality of groundwater resources in the monitoring network designed in abomey calavi municipality was investigated so far no comprehensive study focusing on the the chemical and the microbiological quality of groundwater resources and their fitness for drinking and bathing has been conducted in this study the chemical and the microbiological status of groundwater of abomey calavi municipality as well as the potential of human health risk due to water consumption and bathing is considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geographic location abomey calavi is located in the southern part of the republic of benin in the department of atlantic between latitudes 6 20 23 4 and 6 42 6 6 north and longitudes 2 14 13 8 and 2 25 7 8 east abomey calavi include seventy 70 villages and cities grouped in nine 9 counties which are abomey calavi center godomey akassato zinvié ouedo togba hevié kpanroun and glo djigbé fig 1 abomey calavi located in the southern part of the republic of benin and atlantic department is bordered to the north by the municipality of zé south by the atlantic ocean east by the municipalities of so ava and cotonou and west by the municipalities of tori bossito and ouidah it is the largest municipality in the atlantic department it covers a surface area of 536 km2 representing 20 of the surface area of the department of atlantic and 0 48 of the national surface area of benin hounsinou 2020 the town of abomey calavi is at the edge of the largest water lagoon of benin republic which is the lake nokoué indeed 20 km long east west and 11 km wide north south lake nokoué is approximately 160 km2 the largest lake of benin republic and the most important economically due to its proximity to cotonou the biggest city of benin republic hounsinou 2020 lake nokoué and atlantic ocean significantly influence the groundwater pollution hounsinou 2020 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the hydrographic network of abomey calavi consists essentially of two bodies of water such as lake nokoue and djonou lagoon the town has a coastline juxtaposed to the coastal lagoon lagoon of togbin marshes streams and wetlands the study area covers two main types of geological formations fig 2 quaternary formations and tertiary formations quaternary formations that are sandy deposits of the coastal strip the lagoon deposits of clay and sand and alluvial deposits consisted of sand and clay coarse sand on the coastline has a thickness of about 6 m with a porosity exceeding 40 dégbé 2004 up coast marine gray silt fine sand has a thickness of 15 m and a porosity of around 35 dégbé 2004 finally the clay gravelly sands from the alluvium follow and whose characteristics are fairly similar to the ordinary sands of the coastline the tertiary formations consist mainly of clay and sand of the continental terminal there are three aquifers on the set the aquifer of shallow continental terminal 120 m deep the aquifer layer paleocene at the depth of 320 m the aquifer of the maastrichtian 1500 m deep the drinking water of the municipality of abomey calavi is captured by drilling into the aquifer of the continental terminal dégbé 2004 hounsinou 2012 2020 according to boukari and alassane 2007 and hounsinou 2020 the hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer are such that the transmissivity and storage coefficient values range from 1 5 to 8 103 m2 s and 1 6 1011 and 24 103 aquifer of the continental terminal respectively flows are very variable but their values are often approximately up to 5 l s 2 1 3 climatic regime the study area is located in the intertropical zone in this zone the climate is of the subequatorial type characterized by two rainy seasons and two dry seasons distributed in time as follows hounsinou 2012 september to november small rainy season november to march great dry season march to july great rainy season july to september small dry season the average annual rainfall over the period 1970 2020 is 1300 mm 2 2 material and methods of chemical and microbiological analyzes we measured physico chemical and microbiological parameters of 68 wells the depth of the wells varies from 30 91 m to 103 21 m for each wells water we measured 23 physico chemical parameters and 3 microbiological parameters groundwater samples were collected from deep wells using standard sampling procedures apha 1985 iso 1993 before collecting the samples groundwater was purged out for several minutes to collect a representative groundwater sample and avoid stagnant water from the pumping system aullón alcaine et al 2020 at each sampling location samples were stored in two polyethylene bottles and were divided into two groups including non acidified for anion analysis and acidified with a few drops of hno3 for analysis of cations and trace elements the collected samples were stored at 4 c until delivery to the laboratory for analyses the physicochemical parameters and their measurement methods are presented in table 1 three microbiological parameters were evaluated namely total coliforms fecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci the equipment consists of autoclaves incubators rapid e coli to identify total coliforms and fecal coliforms and slatnez bathley to identify intestinal enterococci for this study we applied the method by incorporation into an agar described in the book le rodier 1984 the physico chemical analyzes were done at the applied hydrology laboratory of the university of abomey calavi in benin the microbiological analyzes were done at the water and food quality control laboratory public hygiene service directorate of basic hygiene and sanitation in benin weighted arithmetic sums of the values of the physicochemical and microbiological parameters and of the who standards are used to calculate the chemical water quality index cwqi and the microbiological water quality index mwqi the marking of water on the hounsinou scale consists of two alphabetical letters assigned respectively to the cwqi table 2 and mwqi of this water cwqi computation involves several steps parameter selection determination of the ideal values of the parameters development of sub indices assignment of weights and aggregation of sub indices to produce an overall index 2 2 1 selection of the parameters to be used for the calculation of the cwqi in a study region there are water parameters whose values generally are in according with the required standards apart from these parameters for the calculation of the cwqi use as many physicochemical parameters as possible 2 2 2 the ideal value vi of a water parameter regarding the quality of drinking water according to a popular belief we need the mineral salts contained in the water we drink in fact to be assimilated by the body ions must be enveloped chelated by organic molecules these chelated ions are only found in our food not in drinking water vegetable broth fruits dairy products and meat constitute the source of assimilable mineral salts if we could assimilate the calcium or magnesium contained in water containing a lot of limestone that would be the end of diseases such as osteoporosis coxarthrosis likewise consuming ferruginous water should put an end to the anemia medical practice does not seem to confirm these claims the uptake of mineral salts in drinking water only really takes place during a prolonged water fast exceeding one week this is the reason why during fasting it is best to avoid drinking weakly mineralized water hounsinou 2012 the ideal content of a mineral salt in drinking water is vi 0 mg l for most drinking water parameters there is a maximum allowable value and no minimum required value for all these parameters as for mineral salts their ideal content in drinking water is 0 for some parameters of the drinking water a minimum value and a maximum value are required the ideals values of these parameters are the averages between the minima and the maxima allowables of the values of these parameters in the drinking water this is the case with ph and dissolved oxygen according to who standards at 25 c the ph of drinking water should be between 6 5 and 8 5 so for the ph of water at 25 c vi 6 5 8 5 2 7 the ideal ph value of water depends on its temperature fig 3 the starting point for establishing the ph scale is pure water pure water has been assigned the characteristic of neutral water dissociates as follows 2h2o h3o oh table 2 the equilibrium constant for water is equal to kw h30 oh l 10 14 where log kw pkw log h30 log oh l 14 pkw ph poh 14 since pure water breaks down into an equal number of h30 and oh ions the concentration of h30 is 10 7 and the concentration of oh is 10 7 and ph poh 7 pure water therefore has a ph 7 however this notation is not complete since the equilibrium kw constant depends on the temperature according to the equation of marshall and franck 1981 log kw 4 098 3245 2 t 2 2362 105 t2 3 984 107 t3 13 957 1262 3 t 8 5641 105 t2 log d where kw is in mol kg 1 and d is the vapor pressure in g cm 3 it should be noted that the ph of pure water is 7 at 25 c ideals values vi of the ph of drinking water is phi 0 5 pkw in the graph below some ideals values of water appear at different temperatures 2 2 3 development of cwqi sub indices the value of the nth parameter of the measured water is denoted by vn the maximum or minimum admissible value of the nth physico chemical parameter of water is called the tolerated standard value and noted sn quality rating for the nth water quality physico chemical parameter of the water is denoted by qn such that qn 100 vn vi sn vi in the case where for this nth parameter there is a maximum and a minimum admissibles values if vn is inferior to vi then sn is equal to the minimum admissible value and if vn is superior or equal to vi then sn is equal to the maximum admissible value vi being the ideal value of the nth parameter the unit weight wn is calculated by a value inversely proportional to the recommended standard value sn of the corresponding parameter wn k sn where k constant of proportionality k 1 ʃ 1 sn 2 2 4 cwqi expression cwqi ʃ qn wn ʃ wn this classification is inspired by the classification used by akoteyon 2013 and sunitha et al 2014 2 2 5 development of the mwqi the new microbiological water quality index mwqi is based on the contents per milliliter of water of total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc and intestinal enterococci ie table 3 w m q i 1 3 10 9 c t 20 c f 1000 e i 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical parameters of groundwater to know whether water is drinkable or to determine its degree of pollution the physico chemical and microbiological parameters of the water must be measured and interpreted all water quality parameters are listed in who standards 2006 depending on the nature rainwater surface water or underground water and depending on the study area some ions or molecules are rare or absent in the soil and in the water these parameters may not be measured when assessing water quality for this study we measured 20 physico chemical and 3 microbiological parameters of 68 wells 3 1 1 ph the ph of groundwater is linked to the nature of the rocks the ph of water is also linked to its temperature the ph varied between 4 98 and 7 67 with a mean value of 5 55 fig 4 this acidity is probably due to the geological nature of soil it confirms the results of bossou 2002 dégbé 2004 gomez 2009 hounsinou 2012 and hounsinou et al 2015a only 11 76 of the ph

several chemicals parameters of the wells water studied aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water namely ph ec na k total iron nh4 hco3 cl and no3 which aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water respectively in the proportions 88 24 97 06 1 47 10 12 20 53 2 97 1 47 1 47 and 1 47 3 1 23 total coliforms tc the group of total coliforms includes two groups of bacteria one is coliform mainly of faecal origin or faecal coliforms mainly hosts of the digestive tract of humans and warm blooded animals the other of non faecal origin is part of aquatic bacterial communities comes from seepage water or telluric comes from the earth the total coliforms content varied between 0 ml and 98 ml with a mean value of 11 61 ml fig 26 7 35 of the total coliforms contents measured aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water these are samples of wells numbers 3 7 39 55 and 56 3 1 24 fecal coliforms fc the advantage of detecting fecal coliforms as organisms indicating faecal pollution consists in the fact that their survival in the environment is generally equivalent to that of pathogenic bacteria and that their density is generally proportional to the degree of pollution produced by faeces ceaeq 2000 all the well water studied didn t contain fecal coliforms per ml 3 1 25 intestinal enterococci ie detection of ie in well water may indicate faecal contamination or surface water infiltration they can be an indicator of pathogenic bacteria because of their inability to multiply in the aquatic environment and of viruses because of their strong resistance surviving longer in an aquatic environment than fecal coliforms leclerc and mossel 1989 all the well water studied did not contain intestinal enterococci per ml for each well water that we studied at least one physicochemical or microbiological parameter does not in accordance with who standards the high levels of na and cl in the groundwater that we studied are due to the sedimentary rocks of the study area and also to the saline intrusion of the waters of lake nokoué and marine intrusion into the groundwater hounsinou 2020 the presence of total coliforms in the groundwater indicates bacteriological pollution of the groundwater in the study area by surface water traditional methods of assessing water quality are based on the comparison of experimentally determined parameter values with existing guidelines this method allows proper identification of contamination sources essential for checking legal compliance boyacioglu 2007 any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards is not safe to drink only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water 3 2 multivariate analysis of groundwater parameters conductivity is strongly related to tds fig 27 the curve tds f ec is a portion of a straight line which passes through the origin of the axis so tds a ec where for the well waters that we have studied a 0 5 tds 0 5 ec for the wells water we studied this result is consistent with a study carried out in 2012 in the region on shallow groundwater according to this study published in 2015 the tds is perfectly bound to the conductivity for all wells studied the tds mg l measured is equal at 0 56 times the conductivity in μs cm measured hounsinou et al 2015a a previous study using the piper diagram showed that the chlorinated facies concerns 93 33 of the water in the region there are two variants the chlorinated sodic potassic waters overwhelmingly and chlorinated sulfated magnesia waters the facies bicarbonate calcium and magnesium concerns 6 66 of samples the bicarbonated sodic potassic facies of a well in glo djigbé is a singular case hounsinou et al 2015c hounsinou 2020 chloride ions are the most important anions in most of the wells studied the most important cations associated with chlorides are sodium and potassium the chemical facies mainly encountered in the wells water studied is the sodium potassium chloride facies this confirms the results of oga 1998 which found in ivory cost that the groundwater of the sedimentary basin mainly presents a sodium potassium chloride facies the abundance of sodium and chloride ions in groundwater in the study area is of marine origin this interpretation is consistent with the proximity to the sea and the heavy rainfall in the study region indeed the municipality of abomey calavi being a coastal municipality there are quantity of precipitating vapor of mainly oceanic origin rich in na and cl coming from the evaporation of sea water rich rainwater in na and cl will reach underground aquifers by infiltration hounsinou et al 2015c the abundance of na and cl ions in groundwater in the study area is also comme from marine intrusion into these groundwater hounsinou 2020 the comparative study of each water parameter with who standards does not give the overall level of pollution of this water hence the usefulness of water quality index 3 3 groundwater quality index the parameters used to determine the chemical quality of groundwater in the municipality of abomey calavi ː ph tds

the corresponding classes are shown in table 5 3 4 rating and overall quality of samples from monitoring wells in abomey calavi the rating of a water on the hounsinou scale consists of two alphabetic letters assigned respectively to the cwqi and mwqi of this water table 6 the ideal chemical class for drinking water should be a waters of chemical classes b c d and e are acceptable as drinkable only microbiological class a waters are drinkable only sample water with total rating aa ba ca da and ea are drinkable water intended for bathing must not be microbiologically polluted or must only be slightly microbiologically polluted only water of microbiological classes a b and c may be used for bathing the global quality classification of groundwater samples from monitoring wells in the study area are shown in table 7 it is not enough that water does not immediately make us sick to be considered drinkable any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards is not safe to drink only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water so the overall water quality in the area isn t good only sample water with total rating aa on the hounsinou scale is drinkable 8 82 of the well water studied has ba ca and ea ratings and are suitable for drinking and bathing 91 18 of the well water studied has cb bb db eb ac ab and gb ratings and aren t suitable for drinking but suitable for bathing the use of this new scale is that it provides a useful and effective method of assessing the suitability of water quality for various purposes it is also used to communicate information on the overall water quality using two letters compared to the water quality indices that have been used so far this new scale is better at assessing the chemical and microbiological quality of water more accurately and consistently around the world 4 conclusion it is not enough that water does not immediately make us sick to be considered drinkable any water that does not meet one or more of the who standards isn t safe to drink several chemicals parameters of the wells water studied aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water namely ph ec na k total iron nh4 hco3 cl and no3 which aren t in accordance with who standards for drinkable water respectively in the proportions 88 24 97 06 1 47 10 12 20 53 2 97 1 47 1 47 and 1 47 only the parameters of 8 82 of the well water studied comply with all who standards for drinking water the rating of water on the hounsinou scale consists of two alphabetic letters indicating respectively the chemical quality index and the microbiological quality index of this water the determination of the quality of groundwater in the municipality of abomey calavi using this scale show that 8 82 of the wells water studied is suitable for drinking and bathing and 91 18 of the wells water studied are not suitable for drinking but are suitable for bathing compared to the water quality index that have been used so far this new scale is better because it is more precise serves to give to the public more complete information on the quality of water and is uniformly applicable everywhere in the world this new scale can be used by international institutions to rate and monitor the quality of water resources in all countries in order to assess the efforts made by countries to protect and clean up their water resources declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article
