18200,electrocoagulation is a burgeoning technology now being considered for niche water treatment applications although much research has been conducted to determine the efficacy of electrocoagulation to remove various contaminants the more fundamental electrochemical aspects of the technology are often overlooked this research provides insight into the fundamental relationship of water flow electrochemical metal dissolution and current density distribution through computational fluid dynamic cfd models mathematical models and in situ current density distribution identification experiments theoretically it was determined that current distributed along the electrode was inversely proportional to the water flowrate the turbulent flow through the ec reactor was simulated with varying inter electrode gaps and flowrates while the average velocity segments across the electrode surface was calculated corresponding to the same segments used to experimentally determine the current distribution through the cfd models and current distribution determining technique it was observed that current density was distributed unevenly and followed the trend predicted by theory areas of lower current density were generally accompanied by higher velocity flow more uniform current was yielded with larger inter electrode gaps due to the greater flow uniformity while operating with a 1 mm gap the current and water velocity varied across the electrode by δ27 6 ma cm2 and δ0 220 m s and was minimized to δ3 6 ma cm2 and δ0 062 m s at a 10 mm gap although current uniformity was increased the overall current density decreased significantly due to the greater ohmic resistance associated with the larger gap the removal of natural organic matter was reduced as much as 79 when the inter electrode gap was reduced from 10 to 1 mm graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocoagulation current distribution determination computation fluid dynamic model water treatment natural organic matter electrochemical process 1 introduction many electrochemical technologies for water treatment applications are beginning to gain momentum for future integration into mainstream water treatment processes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 electrocoagulation ec has shown promise as an alternative treatment process to conventional chemical coagulation for certain drinking water municipal and industrial wastewater treatment applications ec eliminates the chemical supply chain required for conventional coagulation as coagulant chemicals are electrochemically synthesized in situ and on demand by applying current with an external power supply to an electrochemical cell the two half cell reactions of anodic metal dissolution and cathodic reduction of water facilitate the overall production of metal hydroxide and metal oxide species i e the coagulant chemicals as current provided to the cell increases the rate of anodic metal dissolution and water reduction at the cathode surface increases thereby resulting in the increased formation of coagulant to date much of the ec research has concentrated on the technology s ability to remove various target contaminants including both organic and inorganic compounds while investigating the effect of various process variables such as metal loading coagulant dose delaire et al 2017 dubrawski et al 2013b dubrawski and mohseni 2013a fuente et al 2019 charge loading addy 2008 fuente et al 2019 holt et al 2002 vik et al 1984 zhu et al 2007 ph delaire et al 2017 gilhotra et al 2018 mameri et al 2001 1998 pan et al 2016

hakizimana et al 2017 mcbeath et al 2018 an additional variable that has been widely investigated is the effect of current density on the efficacy of the ec process many researchers have investigated the effect of current density on the removal of various wastewater contaminants during an ec process the effect of current density on the removal of organic dyes found in textile wastewaters was found to be minimal but a proportional increase of dye removal and current density increase was yielded kim et al 2002 other researchers observed a significant increase in dye removal with increasing current density papadopoulos et al 2019 the increased reduction of sulfide and chemical oxygen demand from spent caustic wastewater was also observed with an increase of current density ben hariz et al 2013 in both studies current density was controlled by changing the applied current as opposed to changing the electrode surface area at constant current operation because of this the implications of increased coagulant formation and dosing on greater contaminant removal at higher current densities is unknown the effect of current density on the ec process has also been widely investigated for drinking water treatment applications researchers mameri et al mameri et al 2001 1998 and zhu et al 2007 found that current density had little effect on the removal of fluoride from groundwater in both studies researchers attributed the increased reduction of fluoride at greater current densities to the increased coagulant formation at the higher metal loading associated with greater current density current density was also found to greatly affect the efficacy of ec to remove arsenic from groundwater but in this case arsenic removal capacity decreased with increasing current density addy 2008 other research has observed the opposite effect for arsenic removal however this was once again likely due to the increased metal loading that accompanied the increase in applied current kobya et al 2016 some batch scale experiments have shown that the removal of natural organic matter from synthetic and raw surface water also increased when current density was reduced dubrawski 2012 dubrawski and mohseni 2013b when a similar process was scaled up to a continuous flow operation the effect was minimized and no clear trend was observed between current density and the removal capacity of natural organic matter mcbeath et al 2015 current density has also been found to have an effect on local ph near the electrode as well as dissolved oxygen do concentration subsequently effecting the speciation of iron hydroxide coagulants which are formed during the ec process dubrawski and mohseni 2013a although the effect of current density has been extensively investigated along with other process variables not a lot of efforts have been directed towards understanding the fundamental electrochemical and transport phenomena ultimately governing the distribution of current on the electrode surface in particular there has been a lack of research to understand the relationship between the variable movement of water across an ec electrode surface and its subsequent effect on the current density distribution in nearly all prior ec research it is assumed that current density remains constant over the entire electrode surface during galvanostatic operation like other electrochemical processes under most conditions this is likely not realized due to many factors including electrolyte water velocity variations across the electrode surface the degradation of the sacrificial anode can occur due to three main reasons electrochemical oxidation discussed here chemical dissolution and mechanical erosion in the presence of an oxidation current the rate of the two other phenomena are negligible when compared to electrochemical oxidation therefore we associate the distribution of the anode degradation to the inhomogeneity in the electric current distribution in some previous studies current density has been modeled for an ec process and was determined to be an important factor for evaluating the electrode arrangement and geometry for energy consumptions as it was not uniformly distributed vázquez et al 2014 it has also been previously shown through modeling that this uneven distribution of current and potential across an ec electrode can impact coagulant formation ultimately affecting the performance of ec vázquez et al 2012a computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling has also been used for the determination of electrolyte flow variations within an ec reactor observing high variations of fluid velocity within the reactors as a result of many factors including cell geometry and configuration martinez delgadillo et al 2012 vázquez et al 2014 in general cfd modeling is a widely used tool in electrochemical engineering to understand electrolyte mass transport phenomena phenomenological research on the ec processes have shed light on the mixing choudhary and mathur 2017 and process gilhotra et al 2018 safonyk et al 2019 optimization approaches recent numerical studies on electrocoagulation have focused on the role of the reactor configuration on the electric field and mass transport and the role of local reaction conditions on the same electrode plate has not been investigated song et al 2018 in order to understand the variation of current distribution across an electrode surface this research employed an in situ technique to measure and map current density distribution additionally water flow patterns through the ec reactor were obtained through cfd modeling in order to provide insight towards the fluid and current flow relationship aside from yielding a fundamental understanding of current and mass transport considerations for improved and predictable ec operations as well as providing a novel process application for identifying current distribution in an ec reactor results could lead to improved current density distribution and consequently improved reactor design a key factor for the design of an energy efficient and consequently more economical ec reactor and process vázquez et al 2012b without evenly distributed current on the electrode surface premature exhaustions at areas characterized by high current density will occur and relatively under used portions in areas of low current density in order for ec to be considered and adopted as a potential alternative water treatment technology optimum electrode performance at an industrial scale needs to be demonstrated and efficient and optimized utilization of the entire electrode is required finally ec s ability to remove natural organic matter nom a common drinking water contaminant in surface water supplies was evaluated at the same conditions investigated with cfd and current distribution experiments 2 material and methods 2 1 materials anode electrodes were made of a1008 cold rolled steel iron containing trace amounts of carbon manganese phosphorus and sulfur cathode electrodes were made of austenitic face centered cubic crystal stainless steel alloy containing trace amounts of chromium and nickel both the anode and cathode electrodes were 16 gauge thickness 1 519 mm and had a single side active surface area of 310 8 cm2 250 124 3 mm distilled water with dissolved nacl to a concentration of 0 3225 g l was used for the inlet waters for all current density distribution experiments for all conditions tested this water matrix was chosen in order to match the synthetic surface water used in the subsequent electrocoagulation treatment experiments described in section 3 3 all experiments were investigated at 1 35 and 10 l min for three different inter electrode gaps 1 2 and 10 mm 2 2 electrocoagulation reactor and process the ec reactor used was originally designed to maximize flow distribution across the electrode surface and used for pilot scale research investigating nom arsenic and manganese removal from raw surface and groundwater supplies to promote water flow uniformity a baffle was integrated into the inlet of the reactor whereby liquid entering the ec unit must first rise and fall over a baffle spanning the entire width of the reactor upon passing over the inlet baffle water enters the main chamber of the reactor where the electrodes are housed the main section of the reactor accommodates removable electrode holders which have machined slits with varied spacing corresponding to the inter electrode gaps required when electrodes are installed into the reactor depending on the number of cells to be used during ec operation flow blockers can be inserted between the outermost electrodes and the walls of the reactor to direct water solely through the electro active volumes of the reactor see fig s1 brass busbars are used for configurations implementing two or more cells in order to have a single electrical connection to all electrodes water travels upwards through the electrodes and spills over an additional baffle prior to exiting the ec reactor see fig s2 the reactor electrode holder inserts and flow blockers were constructed entirely of inert acrylic inlet water was pumped to the reactor using a masterflex i p drive and i p high performance head peristaltic pump experiments were performed at potentiostatic conditions constant voltage until a stable current was reached and stabilized for at least 30 s using a keithley 2260b 30 72 dc power supply during ec operations voltage and current data were displayed and collected via a custom labview program at a sampling rate of 5 8 hz although the ec reactor was designed to accommodate various cell configurations all current density determination experiments were single cell conditions using the partial electrode approach 2 3 partial electrode approach to determine the variation of current over the electrode surface area during ec operation a method utilized for the determination of current distribution in proton exchange membrane fuel cells was utilized i e the partial membrane electrode assembly approach stumper et al 1998 with this partial electrode current determination method portions of the electrode surface were masked using an electrically inert polyimide adhesive membrane kapton to test independent segments of the electrode potentiostatic constant voltage electrolysis is performed in order to generate polarization curves for each individually unmasked segment of the electrode the specific performance of the various regions tested could be determined through the difference of each polarization curve generated the intervals between each potential tested depended on the linearity of the polarization curve non linear regions of the polarization curve were examined at small voltage intervals while linear regions of the curve could be tested at larger voltage intervals in this investigation both vertical and horizontal segments of the electrodes were investigated at three inter electrode gaps 1 2 and 10 mm and two flow rates 1 35 and 10 l min using the same synthetic water matrix described previously in section 2 1 for all conditions investigated the potentiostatic experiments were performed for seven different electrode configurations for each condition investigated one configuration included the utilization of the entire electrode area i e the standard single cell ec configuration for the six other configurations electrodes were masked vertically and horizontally to expose equal ¼ ½ and ¾ segments of the electrode as shown in fig 1 for all segments tested both the anode and cathode were masked symmetrically mirror images to ensure the same exposed surface area on both electrodes all configurations and potentials were tested in duplicates at each voltage a constant current was reached polarization data for iron dissolution was collected using the two electrode cell setup under the assumption that cathodic potential due to hydrogen evolution is negligible especially at low current densities this is because the exchange current density for iron oxidation is known to be more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrogen evolution reaction the near negligible overpotential associated with hydrogen evolution has been evidenced in previous work which generated tafel plots for a similar ec setup dubrawski et al 2014 as well as other modeling work which demonstrated that cell potential was largely due to the anodic metal dissolution reaction mechelhoff 2009 the voltage and current data were used to generate polarization curves for each electrode configuration yielding average current densities for each exposed segment ¼ ½ ¾ vertical and horizontal the individual performance for each horizontal and vertical quarter segments of the electrode could then be determined by the difference of each polarization curve all current density and water velocity distribution figures appearing in the following sections will follow the convention shown in fig 1 whereby the reactor s water inlet is found in the bottom left corner of the electrode and the water outlet is situated at the top right corner of the electrode 2 4 computational fluid dynamic model to compliment experimental current density data obtained from the partial electrode approach cfd models were constructed to understand water flow variations in the ec reactor at 1 35 and 10 l min flow rates for the 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gap settings the 3 dimensional water velocity distribution was simulated in the reactor using the cfd module in comsol multiphysics software the flow turbulence was modeled using the k ε method launder and spalding 1974 the reactor entrance was modeled as an inlet with known mass flow rate and the outlet was modeled as an outlet with constant hydrostatic pressure p ρ w g h the reactor walls were modeled as a no slip boundary u 0 where u is the velocity vector the open boundary of water with air was modeled as a slip boundary n u 0 i e tangential flow velocity along the water air boundary the water hydrodynamics were assumed to be independent of the electrostatic interactions with the charged walls because the electrostatic interaction of the walls with polar uncharged water is limited to the 10 nm layer adjacent to that nouri khorasani et al 2014 a distance 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the inter electrode gap therefore no electrostatic simulation was performed or coupled to the cfd simulation the presence of ions and hydrogen gas have a negligible influence on the water velocity distribution two possible effects of ions present in water include the effect on the viscosity and the local charge ion interactions in the electrolyte since the total ion concentration in drinking water is low both of these effects can be neglected the effect of hydrogen bubbles on the water velocity distribution has also been neglected whereas the presence of bubbles can cause turbulence in an otherwise laminar flow in the presence of turbulence the momentum of hydrogen bubbles would be small compared to water eddies furthermore from a computational perspective simulating two phase flow between two real size electrodes describing the growth and detachment of hydrogen bubbles on the cathode and coupling to the water flow between the two electrodes is both computationally demanding and physically incompletely defined several parameters such as the nucleation site density of the cathode the onset of hydrogen supersaturation before bubble nucleation the shape and detachment size of the growing bubble make it very difficult to explicitly simulate the effect of hydrogen bubbles in this system for these reasons we limited the scope of simulation to the distribution of liquid water between two vertically oriented electrodes 2 5 electrocoagulation water treatment process ec water treatment experiments for nom removal section 3 3 were undertaken using the same reactor and conditions i e flow rate electrode surface area and materials inter electrode gaps used in the current density distribution determination experiments the effectiveness of the ec to remove nom was evaluated by monitoring the reduction of dissolved organic carbon doc pre and post ec electrolysis during laboratory scale low flow rate 1 35 l min experiments synthetic surface water was used with a technical grade humic acid sigma aldrich surrogate in place of nom synthetic waters were used for laboratory scale experiments in order to maintain controlled conditions for a better analysis and understanding of the process in order to evaluate ec performance at a high flow rate 10 l min field studies were performed using a mobile water treatment plant raw water from a small community s water supply priest lake located on texada island british columbia canada was treated this surface water supply is characterized by high nom concentrations see table 1 real waters were utilized for high flow rate experiments for two primary reason 1 to deal with the extremely large volumes of water required to properly assess the steady state performance of the electrocoagulation process and 2 to assess the technologies viability in a real applied context prior to doc analysis both synthetic and raw water samples untreated and treated were filtered using a 0 45 μm pvdf syringe filter doc was analyzed using a shimadzu asi v total organic carbon analyzer utilizing the non purgeable organic carbon method no pre treatment to raw or synthetic waters were conducted prior to the ec process all of the same conditions used for the current distribution determination experiments were investigated for nom removal 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps except for 10 mm gap experiments at 10 l min as the power required exceeded the limitations of the dc power supply this problem affected high flow rate experiments because conductivity of the raw surface water was lower than that of the synthetic water used in low flow rate laboratory experiments using synthetic water see table 1 unlike the current distribution experiments ec water treatment experiments were conducted under galvanostatic operations constant current in order to operate under constant metal loading conditions the metal loading conditions tested during ec water treatment experiments were consistent within the voltage range investigated during current distribution tests the same metal loading conditions were analyzed at both low and high flow rates a full analysis of results at various other conditions for low and high flow rate have been described and published elsewhere mcbeath et al 2018 2015 3 results and discussions 3 1 theoretical current density distribution the inherent rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction her in the electrocoagulation cell exhibited by the exchange current density is 4 times faster than that in iron reduction anson 1961 zeng and zhang 2010 the inherent her rate is also faster than that of the coagulation reaction rate constant vasudevan and oturan 2014 since the oh production in the cell is fast compared to both iron oxidation and coagulation one can estimate that the distribution of oh is equal to its equilibrium value at the anode reaction plane and the coagulation reaction would be first order with respect to fe2 concentration for this reason we can correlate the local rate of water treatment to the local fe2 concentration current density inhomogeneity in the electrocoagulation cell stems from the variation in the electrochemical equilibrium potential across the electrode non uniform distribution of fe2 ions in the reactor leads to a variation in the galvanic anode potential e a across the anode electrode this variation is described by the nernst equation for the half cell reaction in the reduction direction 1 e a e q e a 0 r t 2 f ln f e 2 where fe 2 is the iron cation concentration on the anode reaction plane mol l 1 e a 0 is the standard half cell potentials for the anodic reaction 0 44 v bard et al 1985 r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is temperature k and f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol 1 both anode and cathode potentials can be assumed constant across the electrodes because both electrodes are thick solid conductive metals the variation in e a leads to a distribution in the local overpotential on the anode electrode despite the anode potential being constant 2 η e l e c e a e a e q e e c e q η a η c e a 0 r t 2 f ln f e 2 η c equation 2 shows that the local overpotential of an electrolytic cell such as an electrocoagulation cell is directly related to the local fe2 concentration a mole balance over fe 2 at steady state in the cell reveals the relationship between the operational conditions and the exit fe 2 3 n i n n o u t n g e n n c o n s 0 4 f e 2 i n u h i n δ f e 2 u h i n δ j a 2 f k δ a f e 2 0 where the subscripts denote the fe2 inlet in untreated water outlet from the reactor generation from fe oxidation reaction and consumption by the coagulation reaction first order kinetics u is the flow velocity m s 1 and h i n is the reactor inlet height m k is the coagulation rate constant s 1 δ is the inter electrode gap m and a is the electrode area m2 solving equation 4 for fe 2 yields 5 f e 2 f e 2 i n j 2 f a h i n δ 1 u 1 k a h i n 1 u equation 5 shows the dependence of the fe2 in the reactor to the reactor structure and operating conditions substituting equation 5 in equation 1 shows the relation between the shift in local equilibrium potential and the operating conditions 6 e a 0 44 r t 2 f ln f e 2 i n j 2 f a h i n δ 1 u 1 k a h i n 1 u fig 2 shows that increasing the flow velocity in the cell to 1 m s 1 decreases the fe2 and the galvanic anode potential to 10 5 m and 0 57 v respectively consequently the overall cell overpotential required to achieve a given current increases as shown in equation 2 similar mole balance can be applied to different segments in the cell however the local fe2 depends on the local fe2 in from the neighboring sub cell components 3 2 water velocity and current density distribution equation 6 shows that water flow velocity across the electrode surface is inversely proportional to the equilibrium anode potential and local fe2 concentration while the absolute flow rate of the process may remain constant i e 1 35 l min or 10 l min local fluid velocity variations across the electrode surface will exist due to reactor design fundamentally it is areas of the electrode which are dominated by higher current density that will have lower concentrations of fe2 as described by the le chatelier principle it is therefore expected that local variations of current density across the electro active area of the electrocoagulation reactor will exist whereby certain areas of the electrode may be dominated by higher or lower current and iron dissolution cfd simulation results show that the flow pattern across the electrode is in the turbulent flow region this observation validates our assumption of the negligible effect of hydrogen bubbles on the hydrodynamics in the system due to the bubbles relatively smaller momentum compared to turbulent water eddies in general current density data collected using the partial electrode approach at 1 35 l min flow rates agreed well with the local water velocity variations generated with the cfd models at an equal applied cell potential the average velocity decreases with an increasing inter electrode gap similarly the average current density decreases with inter electrode gap current is expected to decrease at a constant voltage when the inter electrode gap increases due to ohmic losses as a result of the increased resistance associated with the electrolyte water however a direct relationship between the average current density and velocity agrees with the predictions of equations 5 and 6 water velocity variations decreased with increasing inter electrode gap as did the variations associated with current density the absolute range in variation of both current density and water velocity greatly reduced with an increasing inter electrode gap δ27 6 δ13 7 and δ3 6 ma cm2 range from the minimum and maximum recorded current densities and δ0 220 δ0 123 and δ0 062 m s range in water velocity for 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps respectively see fig 3 it can be observed that current density is greater in the top left corner area of the electrode current density versus minimum current density where velocity is seen to be minimized flow rate versus maximum flow rate and a general trend of higher current density inversely related to water velocity was observed see fig 4 the discrepancy between the trends in local and the average current density distribution in the cell likely stems from the contribution of the inlet local fe2 in in the cell shown in equation 5 higher up sub cell components have fe2 carried over with the water convection whereas sub cell elements closer to the inlet have lower fe2 in with slightly decreased absolute variations in both current density and water velocity the same trends observed at 1 mm gap existed with a 2 mm inter electrode gap like 1 mm gap some outliers existed at 2 mm however electrode segments with higher current densities were observed to be accompanied decreasing water velocity see fig 5 one potential reason for discrepancy between the cfd and experimental results could be the changing nature of the areas of electrode with low flow rate in these areas a layer of oxide can grow on the surface change the inherent fe oxidation reaction rate and lead to additional mass transport resistance for fe2 inside the oxide layer when the inter electrode gap was increased to 10 mm water flow variations were greatly reduced similarly current density variations over the active area were also greatly reduced yielding a much more uniform current density distribution see fig 6 although current density was more uniformly distributed at an inter electrode gap of 10 mm it was at the expense of significantly reduced current densities and consequently higher energy requirements table 2 shows the range of potentials and currents investigated and the electrolyte resistance associated with each inter electrode gap 1 2 and 10 mm as well as the process energy requirements per cubic meter of water being treated the current density data obtained for the three inter electrode gaps investigated can be used for further analysis and understanding of local fe2 dissolution rates this information could be useful for all ec research as metal loading is always reported generally as the overall metal dissolution rate under the assumption of evenly distributed current across the electrode surface which as been demonstrated to not be valid as the inter electrode gap increases the cell potential increases significantly as a result of increased electrolyte resistance as described by ohm s law v i r as the gap increases from 1 2 10 mm the electrolyte resistance increases from 0 81 0 88 3 57 ω respectively although a more uniform current density distribution would be preferred in practice the increased resistance and consequently lower current density associated with the larger inter electrode gap results in a much more energy intensive process at a constant current 2 a and therefore a constant metal loading e g coagulant dosing rate the energy required to treat a cubic meter of water increases from 0 066 kwh m3 at 1 mm to 0 191 kwh m3 at 10 mm consequently electrocoagulation reactor design would require the consideration of the inter electrode to minimize both current water velocity variations and ohmic losses a design incorporating evenly distributed flow consequentially resulting in decreased current density variations while minimizing the inter electrode gap for reduced resistance when large variations within the electrode exist areas characterized by high current density will be depleted at an increased rate thereby minimizing the lifetime of an electrode as holes failures or losses to the power supply connection points could arise in general current density distribution was observed to become more uniformly distributed as the inter electrode gap increased the same trend was seen with water flow velocity indicating that uniform use of the sacrificial anode in a water treatment process would be greatly affected by reactor design parameters an ideal and economical process would have even dissolution of the electrode thereby maximizing the usage of the sacrificial anode material higher operating costs would be associated with the aforementioned localized and premature failure points as large underutilized areas of the electrode would remain at the end of an anode s lifetime when the flow rate was increased to 10 l min current density and water velocity relationships were not as evident as those yielded during 1 35 l min experiments one clear trend consistent with 1 35 l min experiments was the increase of water flow uniformity and the consequentially improved current density distribution with increasing inter electrode gaps once again this was observed when analyzing the absolute variation of both current density and water velocity at 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps see fig 7 the absolute range of current density and water velocity variations for 1 2 and 10 mm gaps was 75 0 31 7 and 6 5 ma cm2 and 3 5 1 7 and 0 5 m s respectively clearly highlighting the greatly increased uniformity of both current and flow as the inter electrode gap increases as is the case with 1 35 l min flow rate experiments this phenomenon can be attributed to the chamber volumes volume within the electro active area of the reactor when operating at a 1 mm inter electrode gap the chamber volume is 31 1 cm3 as the inter electrode gap increases to 2 and 10 mm the volume increases to 62 2 and 310 8 cm3 respectively because of the different chamber volumes there is an average reactor residence time of 0 187 0 373 and 1 865 s for 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gap conditions respectively see table s1 at larger inter electrode gaps with greater reactor chamber volumes and residence times improvement in current distribution will be achieved due to more uniform velocity profiles it should also be noted that the increase in inter electrode gap also increases the electrical resistance as described by ohm s law accounting for the decrease in current density despite improved current uniformity as previously described for low flow operation see table 2 in addition to the inverse relationship between flow velocity and fe2 concentrations reductions in current density performance at a high flow rate may also suggest a reduction in the current due to increased resistance increased resistance loss can be due to a number of variables but those that may be more likely to occur during higher flow rate experiments include a decrease in the active electrode area and or the increase of gas blinding walsh 1993 gas bubbles may enter the electro active area of the reactor through the electrochemical synthesis of h2 and or o2 at the cathode and anode respectively or enter with the water being pumped into the reactor the introduction of gas into the reactor may be more likely to happen at a higher flow rate due to aeration as water travels through the reactor inlet channel baffle and electro active area much more vigorously when compared to the fully developed laminar flow observed in the low flow rate experiments a simple way of avoiding increased resistance and consequently decreased current density at greater inter electrode gaps would be to increase the conductivity of the water by salt addition thereby lowering electrolyte resistance however this would be impractical in a drinking water treatment process as the ions would have to be removed in downstream processing typically an energy and economically expensive process therefore in order to maximize the operating efficiency of ec the process must place high importance on two reactor design considerations i homogeneous flow across the electrode surfaces and ii maximizing current density and consequently energy efficiency homogeneous flow across the electrode surface will increase current density distribution uniformity which promotes the even dissolution of iron and maximizes the lifetime of consumable electrodes while increasing the inter electrode gap was found to increase current density distribution homogeneity it also yielded decreases in overall current density and therefore iron dissolution through increased electrolyte resistance making the process much more energy intensive once again when the reactor design accounts for evenly distributed flow minimization of electrical resistance with electrode configuration and decreased inter electrode gaps can be implemented without sacrificing current density distribution and energy consumption 3 3 electrocoagulation drinking water treatment metal loading has been shown to be an important factor dictating the effectiveness of ec to remove a number of contaminants holt et al 2002 kim et al 2002 mameri et al 2001 1998 zhu et al 2007 including nom dubrawski and mohseni 2013b jiang et al 2002 vik et al 1984 experiments at both low and high flow rates were conducted at very similar metal loadings at an operating current of 2 0 and 16 0 a metal loading values of 25 7 and 27 8 mg l were achieved at 1 35 and 10 l min respectively although two different water matrices were used during low and high flow rate experiments respectively see section 2 5 the same trends in contaminant removal were observed at both conditions doc reductions were observed to significantly increase with decreasing inter electrode gap for both 1 35 and 10 l min operations fig 8 while local variations of both current density and fluid velocity were observed to greatly increase with decreasing inter electrode gaps indicating more unfavorable process conditions with respect to the electrochemical efficiency of electrode exhaustion these conditions provided greater removal of organic matter as the inter electrode gap decreased from 10 2 and 1 mm the doc was observed to increase 16 29 and 46 respectively while areas on the electrode with greater current density will be more rapidly exhausted leading to uneven electrode dissolution conditions provided a greater capacity to reduce doc which can be attributed to the effect of current density on the speciation of iron hydroxide coagulants which have varying affinities to function as coagulants dubrawski and mohseni 2013a other variables that will differ when changing the inter electrode gap that can influence the selectivity of iron hydroxide species synthesis include anode potential and fe ii fe iii ratio as well as the ph and concentration of dissolved oxygen cornell and schwertmann 2003 the do can vary even in synthetic water matrices during experimental investigations due to both atmospheric influx as well as the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode surface localized ph can also vary due to current density whereby higher current results in greater ph previous studies have been conducted by this group investigating the iron speciation under a 99 99 n2 blanket to prevent an atmospheric influx of do while monitoring it s concentration in the water dubrawski and mohseni 2013a in low do conditions green rust was found to form resulting in favorable nom removal while higher do conditions led to lepidocrocite γ feooh and decreased nom removal while the current study did not include a speciation analysis it would be important to control and monitor do and ph for such an investigation the same trends in doc reduction with respect to the inter electrode gaps were yielded when varying the metal loading in addition to 25 7 mg l metal loadings of 38 3 and 51 1 mg l were investigated by applying a constant current of 3 0 and 4 0 a respectively as expected doc was observed to reduce as the dosing of coagulant metal loading increased however greater reductions were yielded when operating at smaller inter electrode gaps see fig 9 particularly for higher metal loadings of 38 3 and 51 1 mg l 1 mm inter electrode gap experiments yielded doc reductions 79 and 59 greater respectively and 75 and 56 greater at 2 mm respectively again while larger inter electrode gaps did provide greater current distribution and water velocity distribution it resulted in greatly decreased pollutant removal as seen in fig 9 at all three metal loadings investigated significant decreases in doc were achieved as the inter electrode gap decreased from 10 to 2 and 1 mm this difference in contaminant removal was particularly evident at greater metal loadings experiments whereby a 10 mm gap yielded less than 10 and 30 reductions of doc when operating at 38 3 and 51 1 mg l dosing respectively when inter electrode gaps were decreased to 1 and 2 mm these same metal loading conditions provided over 80 reductions of doc these results highlight the tradeoff that arises when increasing the inter electrode gap although larger gaps provide more evenly distributed fluid flow and consequently more homogeneously distributed current density natural organic matter removal is significantly hindered like due to lower current density and iron dissolution moreover this increased current distribution was at the expense of a greatly decreased overall current density resulting in a much more energy intensive process the combination of the current density fluid dynamics and treatment investigations highlights the importance of further research to refine the ec process while treatment results highlight ec s efficiency of removing nom from surface waters the electrochemical and transport phenomena studies emphasize the importance of reactor design a paradox can exist in the conditions which yield the required pollutant removal at low energy requirements with those that provide a robust system which maximizes the efficient utilization of the entire electrode surface although the latter is overlooked by most ec research to date its consideration will be required in order for the technology to be widely considered by industry for a drinking water treatment application 4 conclusion in summary an in situ technique for the determination of current density distribution for an ec process was employed in conjunction with mathematical and computational fluid dynamic modeling for iron dissolution and water velocity variation analysis respectively the current density data agreed well with the models whereby areas of high current density were inversely correlated to areas of low velocity fluid flow and consequently increased fe2 dissolution as the inter electrode gap increased water velocity variations significantly decreased resulting in significantly increased current density uniformity from the current distribution data a more accurate view of iron dissolution performance is attained whereby local fe2 dissolution rates could be determined as opposed to overall metal loading rates typically reported in ec literature during 1 mm inter electrode gap operations current and water velocity variations were δ27 6 ma cm2 and δ0 220 m s respectively when the inter electrode gap increased to 10 mm this variance decreased to δ3 6 ma cm2 and δ0 062 m s this increased current uniformity did have consequences on the overall achievable current density however due to the greatly increased ohmic resistance associated with the larger gap in addition to decreased current density the associated increase in electrical potential greatly increases operating energy requirements furthermore nom removal suffered at larger inter electrode gaps whereby doc removal was observed to

18200,electrocoagulation is a burgeoning technology now being considered for niche water treatment applications although much research has been conducted to determine the efficacy of electrocoagulation to remove various contaminants the more fundamental electrochemical aspects of the technology are often overlooked this research provides insight into the fundamental relationship of water flow electrochemical metal dissolution and current density distribution through computational fluid dynamic cfd models mathematical models and in situ current density distribution identification experiments theoretically it was determined that current distributed along the electrode was inversely proportional to the water flowrate the turbulent flow through the ec reactor was simulated with varying inter electrode gaps and flowrates while the average velocity segments across the electrode surface was calculated corresponding to the same segments used to experimentally determine the current distribution through the cfd models and current distribution determining technique it was observed that current density was distributed unevenly and followed the trend predicted by theory areas of lower current density were generally accompanied by higher velocity flow more uniform current was yielded with larger inter electrode gaps due to the greater flow uniformity while operating with a 1 mm gap the current and water velocity varied across the electrode by δ27 6 ma cm2 and δ0 220 m s and was minimized to δ3 6 ma cm2 and δ0 062 m s at a 10 mm gap although current uniformity was increased the overall current density decreased significantly due to the greater ohmic resistance associated with the larger gap the removal of natural organic matter was reduced as much as 79 when the inter electrode gap was reduced from 10 to 1 mm graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocoagulation current distribution determination computation fluid dynamic model water treatment natural organic matter electrochemical process 1 introduction many electrochemical technologies for water treatment applications are beginning to gain momentum for future integration into mainstream water treatment processes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 electrocoagulation ec has shown promise as an alternative treatment process to conventional chemical coagulation for certain drinking water municipal and industrial wastewater treatment applications ec eliminates the chemical supply chain required for conventional coagulation as coagulant chemicals are electrochemically synthesized in situ and on demand by applying current with an external power supply to an electrochemical cell the two half cell reactions of anodic metal dissolution and cathodic reduction of water facilitate the overall production of metal hydroxide and metal oxide species i e the coagulant chemicals as current provided to the cell increases the rate of anodic metal dissolution and water reduction at the cathode surface increases thereby resulting in the increased formation of coagulant to date much of the ec research has concentrated on the technology s ability to remove various target contaminants including both organic and inorganic compounds while investigating the effect of various process variables such as metal loading coagulant dose delaire et al 2017 dubrawski et al 2013b dubrawski and

hakizimana et al 2017 mcbeath et al 2018 an additional variable that has been widely investigated is the effect of current density on the efficacy of the ec process many researchers have investigated the effect of current density on the removal of various wastewater contaminants during an ec process the effect of current density on the removal of organic dyes found in textile wastewaters was found to be minimal but a proportional increase of dye removal and current density increase was yielded kim et al 2002 other researchers observed a significant increase in dye removal with increasing current density papadopoulos et al 2019 the increased reduction of sulfide and chemical oxygen demand from spent caustic wastewater was also observed with an increase of current density ben hariz et al 2013 in both studies current density was controlled by changing the applied current as opposed to changing the electrode surface area at constant current operation because of this the implications of increased coagulant formation and dosing on greater contaminant removal at higher current densities is unknown the effect of current density on the ec process has also been widely investigated for drinking water treatment applications researchers mameri et al mameri et al 2001 1998 and zhu et al 2007 found that current density had little effect on the removal of fluoride from groundwater in both studies researchers attributed the increased reduction of fluoride at greater current densities to the increased coagulant formation at the higher metal loading associated with greater current density current density was also found to greatly affect the efficacy of ec to remove arsenic from groundwater but in this case arsenic removal capacity decreased with increasing current density addy 2008 other research has observed the opposite effect for arsenic removal however this was once again likely due to the increased metal loading that accompanied the increase in applied current kobya et al 2016 some batch scale experiments have shown that the removal of natural organic matter from synthetic and raw surface water also increased when current density was reduced dubrawski 2012 dubrawski and mohseni 2013b when a similar process was scaled up to a continuous flow operation the effect was minimized and no clear trend was observed between current density and the removal capacity of natural organic matter mcbeath et al 2015 current density has also been found to have an effect on local ph near the electrode as well as dissolved oxygen do concentration subsequently effecting the speciation of iron hydroxide coagulants which are formed during the ec process dubrawski and mohseni 2013a although the effect of current density has been extensively investigated along with other process variables not a lot of efforts have been directed towards understanding the fundamental electrochemical and transport phenomena ultimately governing the distribution of current on the electrode surface in particular there has been a lack of research to understand the relationship between the variable movement of water across an ec electrode surface and its subsequent effect on the current density distribution in nearly all prior ec research it is assumed that current density remains constant over the entire electrode surface during galvanostatic operation like other electrochemical processes under most conditions this is likely not realized due to many factors including electrolyte water velocity variations across the electrode surface the degradation of the sacrificial anode can occur due to three main reasons electrochemical oxidation discussed here chemical dissolution and mechanical erosion in the presence of an oxidation current the rate of the two other phenomena are negligible when compared to electrochemical oxidation therefore we associate the distribution of the anode degradation to the inhomogeneity in the electric current distribution in some previous studies current density has been modeled for an ec process and was determined to be an important factor for evaluating the electrode arrangement and geometry for energy consumptions as it was not uniformly distributed vázquez et al 2014 it has also been previously shown through modeling that this uneven distribution of current and potential across an ec electrode can impact coagulant formation ultimately affecting the performance of ec vázquez et al 2012a computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling has also been used for the determination of electrolyte flow variations within an ec reactor observing high variations of fluid velocity within the reactors as a result of many factors including cell geometry and configuration martinez delgadillo et al 2012 vázquez et al 2014 in general cfd modeling is a widely used tool in electrochemical engineering to understand electrolyte mass transport phenomena phenomenological research on the ec processes have shed light on the mixing choudhary and mathur 2017 and process gilhotra et al 2018 safonyk et al 2019 optimization approaches recent numerical studies on electrocoagulation have focused on the role of the reactor configuration on the electric field and mass transport and the role of local reaction conditions on the same electrode plate has not been investigated song et al 2018 in order to understand the variation of current distribution across an electrode surface this research employed an in situ technique to measure and map current density distribution additionally water flow patterns through the ec reactor were obtained through cfd modeling in order to provide insight towards the fluid and current flow relationship aside from yielding a fundamental understanding of current and mass transport considerations for improved and predictable ec operations as well as providing a novel process application for identifying current distribution in an ec reactor results could lead to improved current density distribution and consequently improved reactor design a key factor for the design of an energy efficient and consequently more economical ec reactor and process vázquez et al 2012b without evenly distributed current on the electrode surface premature exhaustions at areas characterized by high current density will occur and relatively under used portions in areas of low current density in order for ec to be considered and adopted as a potential alternative water treatment technology optimum electrode performance at an industrial scale needs to be demonstrated and efficient and optimized utilization of the entire electrode is required finally ec s ability to remove natural organic matter nom a common drinking water contaminant in surface water supplies was evaluated at the same conditions investigated with cfd and current distribution experiments 2 material and methods 2 1 materials anode electrodes were made of a1008 cold rolled steel iron containing trace amounts of carbon manganese phosphorus and sulfur cathode electrodes were made of austenitic face centered cubic crystal stainless steel alloy containing trace amounts of chromium and nickel both the anode and cathode electrodes were 16 gauge thickness 1 519 mm and had a single side active surface area of 310 8 cm2 250 124 3 mm distilled water with dissolved nacl to a concentration of 0 3225 g l was used for the inlet waters for all current density distribution experiments for all conditions tested this water matrix was chosen in order to match the synthetic surface water used in the subsequent electrocoagulation treatment experiments described in section 3 3 all experiments were investigated at 1 35 and 10 l min for three different inter electrode gaps 1 2 and 10 mm 2 2 electrocoagulation reactor and process the ec reactor used was originally designed to maximize flow distribution across the electrode surface and used for pilot scale research investigating nom arsenic and manganese removal from raw surface and groundwater supplies to promote water flow uniformity a baffle was integrated into the inlet of the reactor whereby liquid entering the ec unit must first rise and fall over a baffle spanning the entire width of the reactor upon passing over the inlet baffle water enters the main chamber of the reactor where the electrodes are housed the main section of the reactor accommodates removable electrode holders which have machined slits with varied spacing corresponding to the inter electrode gaps required when electrodes are installed into the reactor depending on the number of cells to be used during ec operation flow blockers can be inserted between the outermost electrodes and the walls of the reactor to direct water solely through the electro active volumes of the reactor see fig s1 brass busbars are used for configurations implementing two or more cells in order to have a single electrical connection to all electrodes water travels upwards through the electrodes and spills over an additional baffle prior to exiting the ec reactor see fig s2 the reactor electrode holder inserts and flow blockers were constructed entirely of inert acrylic inlet water was pumped to the reactor using a masterflex i p drive and i p high performance head peristaltic pump experiments were performed at potentiostatic conditions constant voltage until a stable current was reached and stabilized for at least 30 s using a keithley 2260b 30 72 dc power supply during ec operations voltage and current data were displayed and collected via a custom labview program at a sampling rate of 5 8 hz although the ec reactor was designed to accommodate various cell configurations all current density determination experiments were single cell conditions using the partial electrode approach 2 3 partial electrode approach to determine the variation of current over the electrode surface area during ec operation a method utilized for the determination of current distribution in proton exchange membrane fuel cells was utilized i e the partial membrane electrode assembly approach stumper et al 1998 with this partial electrode current determination method portions of the electrode surface were masked using an electrically inert polyimide adhesive membrane kapton to test independent segments of the electrode potentiostatic constant voltage electrolysis is performed in order to generate polarization curves for each individually unmasked segment of the electrode the specific performance of the various regions tested could be determined through the difference of each polarization curve generated the intervals between each potential tested depended on the linearity of the polarization curve non linear regions of the polarization curve were examined at small voltage intervals while linear regions of the curve could be tested at larger voltage intervals in this investigation both vertical and horizontal segments of the electrodes were investigated at three inter electrode gaps 1 2 and 10 mm and two flow rates 1 35 and 10 l min using the same synthetic water matrix described previously in section 2 1 for all conditions investigated the potentiostatic experiments were performed for seven different electrode configurations for each condition investigated one configuration included the utilization of the entire electrode area i e the standard single cell ec configuration for the six other configurations electrodes were masked vertically and horizontally to expose equal ¼ ½ and ¾ segments of the electrode as shown in fig 1 for all segments tested both the anode and cathode were masked symmetrically mirror images to ensure the same exposed surface area on both electrodes all configurations and potentials were tested in duplicates at each voltage a constant current was reached polarization data for iron dissolution was collected using the two electrode cell setup under the assumption that cathodic potential due to hydrogen evolution is negligible especially at low current densities this is because the exchange current density for iron oxidation is known to be more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrogen evolution reaction the near negligible overpotential associated with hydrogen evolution has been evidenced in previous work which generated tafel plots for a similar ec setup dubrawski et al 2014 as well as other modeling work which demonstrated that cell potential was largely due to the anodic metal dissolution reaction mechelhoff 2009 the voltage and current data were used to generate polarization curves for each electrode configuration yielding average current densities for each exposed segment ¼ ½ ¾ vertical and horizontal the individual performance for each horizontal and vertical quarter segments of the electrode could then be determined by the difference of each polarization curve all current density and water velocity distribution figures appearing in the following sections will follow the convention shown in fig 1 whereby the reactor s water inlet is found in the bottom left corner of the electrode and the water outlet is situated at the top right corner of the electrode 2 4 computational fluid dynamic model to compliment experimental current density data obtained from the partial electrode approach cfd models were constructed to understand water flow variations in the ec reactor at 1 35 and 10 l min flow rates for the 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gap settings the 3 dimensional water velocity distribution was simulated in the reactor using the cfd module in comsol multiphysics software the flow turbulence was modeled using the k ε method launder and spalding 1974 the reactor entrance was modeled as an inlet with known mass flow rate and the outlet was modeled as an outlet with constant hydrostatic pressure p ρ w g h the reactor walls were modeled as a no slip boundary u 0 where u is the velocity vector the open boundary of water with air was modeled as a slip boundary n u 0 i e tangential flow velocity along the water air boundary the water hydrodynamics were assumed to be independent of the electrostatic interactions with the charged walls because the electrostatic interaction of the walls with polar uncharged water is limited to the 10 nm layer adjacent to that nouri khorasani et al 2014 a distance 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the inter electrode gap therefore no electrostatic simulation was performed or coupled to the cfd simulation the presence of ions and hydrogen gas have a negligible influence on the water velocity distribution two possible effects of ions present in water include the effect on the viscosity and the local charge ion interactions in the electrolyte since the total ion concentration in drinking water is low both of these effects can be neglected the effect of hydrogen bubbles on the water velocity distribution has also been neglected whereas the presence of bubbles can cause turbulence in an otherwise laminar flow in the presence of turbulence the momentum of hydrogen bubbles would be small compared to water eddies furthermore from a computational perspective simulating two phase flow between two real size electrodes describing the growth and detachment of hydrogen bubbles on the cathode and coupling to the water flow between the two electrodes is both computationally demanding and physically incompletely defined several parameters such as the nucleation site density of the cathode the onset of hydrogen supersaturation before bubble nucleation the shape and detachment size of the growing bubble make it very difficult to explicitly simulate the effect of hydrogen bubbles in this system for these reasons we limited the scope of simulation to the distribution of liquid water between two vertically oriented electrodes 2 5 electrocoagulation water treatment process ec water treatment experiments for nom removal section 3 3 were undertaken using the same reactor and conditions i e flow rate electrode surface area and materials inter electrode gaps used in the current density distribution determination experiments the effectiveness of the ec to remove nom was evaluated by monitoring the reduction of dissolved organic carbon doc pre and post ec electrolysis during laboratory scale low flow rate 1 35 l min experiments synthetic surface water was used with a technical grade humic acid sigma aldrich surrogate in place of nom synthetic waters were used for laboratory scale experiments in order to maintain controlled conditions for a better analysis and understanding of the process in order to evaluate ec performance at a high flow rate 10 l min field studies were performed using a mobile water treatment plant raw water from a small community s water supply priest lake located on texada island british columbia canada was treated this surface water supply is characterized by high nom concentrations see table 1 real waters were utilized for high flow rate experiments for two primary reason 1 to deal with the extremely large volumes of water required to properly assess the steady state performance of the electrocoagulation process and 2 to assess the technologies viability in a real applied context prior to doc analysis both synthetic and raw water samples untreated and treated were filtered using a 0 45 μm pvdf syringe filter doc was analyzed using a shimadzu asi v total organic carbon analyzer utilizing the non purgeable organic carbon method no pre treatment to raw or synthetic waters were conducted prior to the ec process all of the same conditions used for the current distribution determination experiments were investigated for nom removal 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps except for 10 mm gap experiments at 10 l min as the power required exceeded the limitations of the dc power supply this problem affected high flow rate experiments because conductivity of the raw surface water was lower than that of the synthetic water used in low flow rate laboratory experiments using synthetic water see table 1 unlike the current distribution experiments ec water treatment experiments were conducted under galvanostatic operations constant current in order to operate under constant metal loading conditions the metal loading conditions tested during ec water treatment experiments were consistent within the voltage range investigated during current distribution tests the same metal loading conditions were analyzed at both low and high flow rates a full analysis of results at various other conditions for low and high flow rate have been described and published elsewhere mcbeath et al 2018 2015 3 results and discussions 3 1 theoretical current density distribution the inherent rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction her in the electrocoagulation cell exhibited by the exchange current density is 4 times faster than that in iron reduction anson 1961 zeng and zhang 2010 the inherent her rate is also faster than that of the coagulation reaction rate constant vasudevan and oturan 2014 since the oh production in the cell is fast compared to both iron oxidation and coagulation one can estimate that the distribution of oh is equal to its equilibrium value at the anode reaction plane and the coagulation reaction would be first order with respect to fe2 concentration for this reason we can correlate the local rate of water treatment to the local fe2 concentration current density inhomogeneity in the electrocoagulation cell stems from the variation in the electrochemical equilibrium potential across the electrode non uniform distribution of fe2 ions in the reactor leads to a variation in the galvanic anode potential e a across the anode electrode this variation is described by the nernst equation for the half cell reaction in the reduction direction 1 e a e q e a 0 r t 2 f ln f e 2 where fe 2 is the iron cation concentration on the anode reaction plane mol l 1 e a 0 is the standard half cell potentials for the anodic reaction 0 44 v bard et al 1985 r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is temperature k and f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol 1 both anode and cathode potentials can be assumed constant across the electrodes because both electrodes are thick solid conductive metals the variation in e a leads to a distribution in the local overpotential on the anode electrode despite the anode potential being constant 2 η e l e c e a e a e q e e c e q η a η c e a 0 r t 2 f ln f e 2 η c equation 2 shows that the local overpotential of an electrolytic cell such as an electrocoagulation cell is directly related to the local fe2 concentration a mole balance over fe 2 at steady state in the cell reveals the relationship between the operational conditions and the exit fe 2 3 n i n n o u t n g e n n c o n s 0 4 f e 2 i n u h i n δ f e 2 u h i n δ j a 2 f k δ a f e 2 0 where the subscripts denote the fe2 inlet in untreated water outlet from the reactor generation from fe oxidation reaction and consumption by the coagulation reaction first order kinetics u is the flow velocity m s 1 and h i n is the reactor inlet height m k is the coagulation rate constant s 1 δ is the inter electrode gap m and a is the electrode area m2 solving equation 4 for fe 2 yields 5 f e 2 f e 2 i n j 2 f a h i n δ 1 u 1 k a h i n 1 u equation 5 shows the dependence of the fe2 in the reactor to the reactor structure and operating conditions substituting equation 5 in equation 1 shows the relation between the shift in local equilibrium potential and the operating conditions 6 e a 0 44 r t 2 f ln f e 2 i n j 2 f a h i n δ 1 u 1 k a h i n 1 u fig 2 shows that increasing the flow velocity in the cell to 1 m s 1 decreases the fe2 and the galvanic anode potential to 10 5 m and 0 57 v respectively consequently the overall cell overpotential required to achieve a given current increases as shown in equation 2 similar mole balance can be applied to different segments in the cell however the local fe2 depends on the local fe2 in from the neighboring sub cell components 3 2 water velocity and current density distribution equation 6 shows that water flow velocity across the electrode surface is inversely proportional to the equilibrium anode potential and local fe2 concentration while the absolute flow rate of the process may remain constant i e 1 35 l min or 10 l min local fluid velocity variations across the electrode surface will exist due to reactor design fundamentally it is areas of the electrode which are dominated by higher current density that will have lower concentrations of fe2 as described by the le chatelier principle it is therefore expected that local variations of current density across the electro active area of the electrocoagulation reactor will exist whereby certain areas of the electrode may be dominated by higher or lower current and iron dissolution cfd simulation results show that the flow pattern across the electrode is in the turbulent flow region this observation validates our assumption of the negligible effect of hydrogen bubbles on the hydrodynamics in the system due to the bubbles relatively smaller momentum compared to turbulent water eddies in general current density data collected using the partial electrode approach at 1 35 l min flow rates agreed well with the local water velocity variations generated with the cfd models at an equal applied cell potential the average velocity decreases with an increasing inter electrode gap similarly the average current density decreases with inter electrode gap current is expected to decrease at a constant voltage when the inter electrode gap increases due to ohmic losses as a result of the increased resistance associated with the electrolyte water however a direct relationship between the average current density and velocity agrees with the predictions of equations 5 and 6 water velocity variations decreased with increasing inter electrode gap as did the variations associated with current density the absolute range in variation of both current density and water velocity greatly reduced with an increasing inter electrode gap δ27 6 δ13 7 and δ3 6 ma cm2 range from the minimum and maximum recorded current densities and δ0 220 δ0 123 and δ0 062 m s range in water velocity for 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps respectively see fig 3 it can be observed that current density is greater in the top left corner area of the electrode current density versus minimum current density where velocity is seen to be minimized flow rate versus maximum flow rate and a general trend of higher current density inversely related to water velocity was observed see fig 4 the discrepancy between the trends in local and the average current density distribution in the cell likely stems from the contribution of the inlet local fe2 in in the cell shown in equation 5 higher up sub cell components have fe2 carried over with the water convection whereas sub cell elements closer to the inlet have lower fe2 in with slightly decreased absolute variations in both current density and water velocity the same trends observed at 1 mm gap existed with a 2 mm inter electrode gap like 1 mm gap some outliers existed at 2 mm however electrode segments with higher current densities were observed to be accompanied decreasing water velocity see fig 5 one potential reason for discrepancy between the cfd and experimental results could be the changing nature of the areas of electrode with low flow rate in these areas a layer of oxide can grow on the surface change the inherent fe oxidation reaction rate and lead to additional mass transport resistance for fe2 inside the oxide layer when the inter electrode gap was increased to 10 mm water flow variations were greatly reduced similarly current density variations over the active area were also greatly reduced yielding a much more uniform current density distribution see fig 6 although current density was more uniformly distributed at an inter electrode gap of 10 mm it was at the expense of significantly reduced current densities and consequently higher energy requirements table 2 shows the range of potentials and currents investigated and the electrolyte resistance associated with each inter electrode gap 1 2 and 10 mm as well as the process energy requirements per cubic meter of water being treated the current density data obtained for the three inter electrode gaps investigated can be used for further analysis and understanding of local fe2 dissolution rates this information could be useful for all ec research as metal loading is always reported generally as the overall metal dissolution rate under the assumption of evenly distributed current across the electrode surface which as been demonstrated to not be valid as the inter electrode gap increases the cell potential increases significantly as a result of increased electrolyte resistance as described by ohm s law v i r as the gap increases from 1 2 10 mm the electrolyte resistance increases from 0 81 0 88 3 57 ω respectively although a more uniform current density distribution would be preferred in practice the increased resistance and consequently lower current density associated with the larger inter electrode gap results in a much more energy intensive process at a constant current 2 a and therefore a constant metal loading e g coagulant dosing rate the energy required to treat a cubic meter of water increases from 0 066 kwh m3 at 1 mm to 0 191 kwh m3 at 10 mm consequently electrocoagulation reactor design would require the consideration of the inter electrode to minimize both current water velocity variations and ohmic losses a design incorporating evenly distributed flow consequentially resulting in decreased current density variations while minimizing the inter electrode gap for reduced resistance when large variations within the electrode exist areas characterized by high current density will be depleted at an increased rate thereby minimizing the lifetime of an electrode as holes failures or losses to the power supply connection points could arise in general current density distribution was observed to become more uniformly distributed as the inter electrode gap increased the same trend was seen with water flow velocity indicating that uniform use of the sacrificial anode in a water treatment process would be greatly affected by reactor design parameters an ideal and economical process would have even dissolution of the electrode thereby maximizing the usage of the sacrificial anode material higher operating costs would be associated with the aforementioned localized and premature failure points as large underutilized areas of the electrode would remain at the end of an anode s lifetime when the flow rate was increased to 10 l min current density and water velocity relationships were not as evident as those yielded during 1 35 l min experiments one clear trend consistent with 1 35 l min experiments was the increase of water flow uniformity and the consequentially improved current density distribution with increasing inter electrode gaps once again this was observed when analyzing the absolute variation of both current density and water velocity at 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gaps see fig 7 the absolute range of current density and water velocity variations for 1 2 and 10 mm gaps was 75 0 31 7 and 6 5 ma cm2 and 3 5 1 7 and 0 5 m s respectively clearly highlighting the greatly increased uniformity of both current and flow as the inter electrode gap increases as is the case with 1 35 l min flow rate experiments this phenomenon can be attributed to the chamber volumes volume within the electro active area of the reactor when operating at a 1 mm inter electrode gap the chamber volume is 31 1 cm3 as the inter electrode gap increases to 2 and 10 mm the volume increases to 62 2 and 310 8 cm3 respectively because of the different chamber volumes there is an average reactor residence time of 0 187 0 373 and 1 865 s for 1 2 and 10 mm inter electrode gap conditions respectively see table s1 at larger inter electrode gaps with greater reactor chamber volumes and residence times improvement in current distribution will be achieved due to more uniform velocity profiles it should also be noted that the increase in inter electrode gap also increases the electrical resistance as described by ohm s law accounting for the decrease in current density despite improved current uniformity as previously described for low flow operation see table 2 in addition to the inverse relationship between flow velocity and fe2 concentrations reductions in current density performance at a high flow rate may also suggest a reduction in the current due to increased resistance increased resistance loss can be due to a number of variables but those that may be more likely to occur during higher flow rate experiments include a decrease in the active electrode area and or the increase of gas blinding walsh 1993 gas bubbles may enter the electro active area of the reactor through the electrochemical synthesis of h2 and or o2 at the cathode and anode respectively or enter with the water being pumped into the reactor the introduction of gas into the reactor may be more likely to happen at a higher flow rate due to aeration as water travels through the reactor inlet channel baffle and electro active area much more vigorously when compared to the fully developed laminar flow observed in the low flow rate experiments a simple way of avoiding increased resistance and consequently decreased current density at greater inter electrode gaps would be to increase the conductivity of the water by salt addition thereby lowering electrolyte resistance however this would be impractical in a drinking water treatment process as the ions would have to be removed in downstream processing typically an energy and economically expensive process therefore in order to maximize the operating efficiency of ec the process must place high importance on two reactor design considerations i homogeneous flow across the electrode surfaces and ii maximizing current density and consequently energy efficiency homogeneous flow across the electrode surface will increase current density distribution uniformity which promotes the even dissolution of iron and maximizes the lifetime of consumable electrodes while increasing the inter electrode gap was found to increase current density distribution homogeneity it also yielded decreases in overall current density and therefore iron dissolution through increased electrolyte resistance making the process much more energy intensive once again when the reactor design accounts for evenly distributed flow minimization of electrical resistance with electrode configuration and decreased inter electrode gaps can be implemented without sacrificing current density distribution and energy consumption 3 3 electrocoagulation drinking water treatment metal loading has been shown to be an important factor dictating the effectiveness of ec to remove a number of contaminants holt et al 2002 kim et al 2002 mameri et al 2001 1998 zhu et al 2007 including nom dubrawski and mohseni 2013b jiang et al 2002 vik et al 1984 experiments at both low and high flow rates were conducted at very similar metal loadings at an operating current of 2 0 and 16 0 a metal loading values of 25 7 and 27 8 mg l were achieved at 1 35 and 10 l min respectively although two different water matrices were used during low and high flow rate experiments respectively see section 2 5 the same trends in contaminant removal were observed at both conditions doc reductions were observed to significantly increase with decreasing inter electrode gap for both 1 35 and 10 l min operations fig 8 while local variations of both current density and fluid velocity were observed to greatly increase with decreasing inter electrode gaps indicating more unfavorable process conditions with respect to the electrochemical efficiency of electrode exhaustion these conditions provided greater removal of organic matter as the inter electrode gap decreased from 10 2 and 1 mm the doc was observed to increase 16 29 and 46 respectively while areas on the electrode with greater current density will be more rapidly exhausted leading to uneven electrode dissolution conditions provided a greater capacity to reduce doc which can be attributed to the effect of current density on the speciation of iron hydroxide coagulants which have varying affinities to function as coagulants dubrawski and mohseni 2013a other variables that will differ when changing the inter electrode gap that can influence the selectivity of iron hydroxide species synthesis include anode potential and fe ii fe iii ratio as well as the ph and concentration of dissolved oxygen cornell and schwertmann 2003 the do can vary even in synthetic water matrices during experimental investigations due to both atmospheric influx as well as the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode surface localized ph can also vary due to current density whereby higher current results in greater ph previous studies have been conducted by this group investigating the iron speciation under a 99 99 n2 blanket to prevent an atmospheric influx of do while monitoring it s concentration in the water dubrawski and mohseni 2013a in low do conditions green rust was found to form resulting in favorable nom removal while higher do conditions led to lepidocrocite γ feooh and decreased nom removal while the current study did not include a speciation analysis it would be important to control and monitor do and ph for such an investigation the same trends in doc reduction with respect to the inter electrode gaps were yielded when varying the metal loading in addition to 25 7 mg l metal loadings of 38 3 and 51 1 mg l were investigated by applying a constant current of 3 0 and 4 0 a respectively as expected doc was observed to reduce as the dosing of coagulant metal loading increased however greater reductions were yielded when operating at smaller inter electrode gaps see fig 9 particularly for higher metal loadings of 38 3 and 51 1 mg l 1 mm inter electrode gap experiments yielded doc reductions 79 and 59 greater respectively and 75 and 56 greater at 2 mm respectively again while larger inter electrode gaps did provide greater current distribution and water velocity distribution it resulted in greatly decreased pollutant removal as seen in fig 9 at all three metal loadings investigated significant decreases in doc were achieved as the inter electrode gap decreased from 10 to 2 and 1 mm this difference in contaminant removal was particularly evident at greater metal loadings experiments whereby a 10 mm gap yielded less than 10 and 30 reductions of doc when operating at 38 3 and 51 1 mg l dosing respectively when inter electrode gaps were decreased to 1 and 2 mm these same metal loading conditions provided over 80 reductions of doc these results highlight the tradeoff that arises when increasing the inter electrode gap although larger gaps provide more evenly distributed fluid flow and consequently more homogeneously distributed current density natural organic matter removal is significantly hindered like due to lower current density and iron dissolution moreover this increased current distribution was at the expense of a greatly decreased overall current density resulting in a much more energy intensive process the combination of the current density fluid dynamics and treatment investigations highlights the importance of further research to refine the ec process while treatment results highlight ec s efficiency of removing nom from surface waters the electrochemical and transport phenomena studies emphasize the importance of reactor design a paradox can exist in the conditions which yield the required pollutant removal at low energy requirements with those that provide a robust system which maximizes the efficient utilization of the entire electrode surface although the latter is overlooked by most ec research to date its consideration will be required in order for the technology to be widely considered by industry for a drinking water treatment application 4 conclusion in summary an in situ technique for the determination of current density distribution for an ec process was employed in conjunction with mathematical and computational fluid dynamic modeling for iron dissolution and water velocity variation analysis respectively the current density data agreed well with the models whereby areas of high current density were inversely correlated to areas of low velocity fluid flow and consequently increased fe2 dissolution as the inter electrode gap increased water velocity variations significantly decreased resulting in significantly increased current density uniformity from the current distribution data a more accurate view of iron dissolution performance is attained whereby local fe2 dissolution rates could be determined as opposed to overall metal loading rates typically reported in ec literature during 1 mm inter electrode gap operations current and water velocity variations were δ27 6 ma cm2 and δ0 220 m s respectively when the inter electrode gap increased to 10 mm this variance decreased to δ3 6 ma cm2 and δ0 062 m s this increased current uniformity did have consequences on the overall achievable current density however due to the greatly increased ohmic resistance associated with the larger gap in addition to decreased current density the associated increase in electrical potential greatly increases operating energy requirements furthermore nom removal suffered at larger inter electrode gaps whereby doc removal was observed to increase from 16 29 and 46 during 10 2 and 1 mm operations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

18201,river water quality is one of the main challenges that societies face during the 21st century accurate and reliable real time prediction of water quality is an effective adaptation measure to counteract water quality issues such as accidental spill and harmful algae blooms to improve accuracy and skill of water quality forecasts along the yeongsan river in south korea three different ensemble data assimilation da methods have been investigated the traditional ensemble kalman filter enkf and two related algorithms dud enkf and enkf gs that offer either possibilities to improve initial conditions for non linear models or reduce computation time important for real time forecasting by using a smaller time lagged ensemble to estimate the kalman gain twin experiments assimilating synthetic observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations with relatively small ensemble sizes showed that all three da methods improved forecast accuracy and skill with only subtle difference between the methods they all improved the model accuracy at downstream locations with very similar performances but due to spurious correlation the accuracy at upstream locations was somewhat deteriorated the experiments also showed no clear trend of improvement by increasing the ensemble size from 8 to 64 the real world experiments assimilating real observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations showed that less improvement was achieved compared to the twin experiments further improvement of the model accuracy may be achieved with different state variable definitions use of different perturbation and error modelling settings and or better calibration of the deterministic water quality model graphical abstract image 1 keywords water

ensemble data assimilation methods for improving initial conditions at the start of the river water quality forecasts i e algal species along the yeongsan river in south korea like any ensemble based method the enkf suffers from sampling error due to limited ensemble size the enkf with gain smoother enkf gs is proposed to reduce this error sørensen et al 2004 an additional benefit could be that this method can possibly reduce the computational costs by using a smaller time lagged ensemble the enkf is also known to give inconsistency when model or observational operators are non linear the dud enkf verlaan 2009 dud stands for doesn t use derivatives is an ensemble variational combined method that aims to combine the strength of the enkf and variational approach to give consistent results for a review about ensemble variational method we refer to bannister 2017 to test the different data assimilation methods for improving the real time water quality forecasts in the yeongsan river basin the three methods have been implemented in an idealized situation where true model state error structure and statistics are assumed to be known twin experiments in this setting it is possible to study the properties of each method and compare the different methods assuming that the error model used in the twin experiments is sufficiently representing the actual model error the best performing filter is then implemented with actual observations i e setup for real world experiments due to the limited number of observations about once a week accuracy evaluation can only be done at analyses times at time steps where observations are available in the real world experiments the forecast accuracy and skill of algae concentrations along the yeongsan river in south korea has been explored for the summer of 2015 to obtain the best performing method 2 material methods 2 1 study area the yeongsan river is one of the four major rivers in korea and located in the south western part of south korea fig 1 yongchubong peak 560 m is the source of the river with a length of approximately 130 km and covering an area of 3468 km2 the river runs through damyang gwangju naju and yeongam and eventually flows into the yellow sea at mokpo the watershed of yeongsan river is relatively warm with high precipitation in summer months annual average temperature is 13 8 c with a mean temperature of 0 6 c in january and 26 2 c in august annual precipitation is 1 391 mm where 50 60 of annual precipitation falls in summer the land use is made up of 8 1 of urban and built up land 25 3 of paddy and wetland 17 5 of agricultural land 45 6 of forest and 3 4 of water and other land four large agricultural reservoirs damyang gwangju jangsung and naju reservoirs lie within the river basin in the mainstream two weirs seongchon and juksan weirs see fig 1 were installed as part of the four rivers restoration project in 2009 upstream of the seongchon weir there are two large sewage treatment plants gwangju 1 and gwangju 2 with an average water discharge of 7 6 m3 s 1 i e 15 6 of the total flow of the yeongsan river in 2015 2016 these stp s have a significant influence on the river s water quality 2 2 forecasting system and linked models the simulation of water temperature nutrients and algae concentrations for both historical simulations and 7 day forecasts is performed in real time using the water quality forecast system wqfs implemented in delft fews werner et al 2013 that connects the hspf models for the upstream watersheds with the efdc models for the main streams of all 4 major rivers in south korea including the yeongsan river used here as test case 2 2 1 water quality forecast system the water quality forecast system wqfs runs a daily scheduled workflow that performs all the necessary steps to perform a forecast import monitoring and forecasting data pre process the data to meet the model demands and execute the hspf and efdc models kim et al 2014a a forecast run is preceded by an ensemble run which generates the initial model conditions based on real time monitoring data and data assimilation techniques the wqfs connects historical and forecasted meteorological data korean meteorological administration numerical weather prediction gridded data and telemetry data for water level flow rates and water quality substances with the two models the wqfs database also connects the simulated flow and water quality constituents at the outlets of the hspf subbasins yeongsan tributaries to the efdc grid representing the yeongsan mainstream adapter i collects hspf model results into the wqfs database next delft fews wqfs maps the hspf outlet results to efdc tributary locations and adapter ii picks up and prepares these mapped results into efdc native input files important constituents for the modelling and forecasting of algae that simulated with the models are nitrogen phosphate water temperature and chlorophyll a the openda model wrapper connecting wqfs with efdc is responsible for providing the real time in stream weekly measurements to the efdc model at the monitoring and assimilation stations see fig 1 and applying the data assimilation algorithms the ensemble kalman filter and its two variants were applied in the efdc model simulation using the openda model wrapper the ensemble simulation of the model was achieved by perturbing efdc s boundary forcing 1 the meteorological input and 2 the outputs of the hspf model at the sub watershed outlets i e tributaries of the yeongsan river and based on error models see par 2 4 2 a simple schematic diagram to describe the entire framework of the modelling and data assimilation is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf the hspf model barnwell 1980 tippet et al 2003 a semi distributed watershed model developed by the united states environmental protection agency simulates integrated land and soil contaminant runoff processes for pervious and impervious surfaces and one dimensional in stream sediment and chemical processes the yeongsan basin is represented by 109 subbasins and the hspf model provides results for 14 tributaries discharge and 1 downstream tidal boundary water level the hspf model output variables are converted to all the 21 water quality variables needed for the efdc model boundary inputs loos et

hamrick and mills 2000 bai and lung 2005 zou et al 2006 kim et al 2017 simulates river hydrodynamics geochemical processes and algal dynamics with the hydrodynamics and the water quality sub models in this study the efdc model is forced by water quality boundary conditions for 14 tributaries and by meteorological forecasts at 1 station gwangju for algal dynamics three different algal species i e diatom green algae and cyanobacteria were simulated there are 12 monitoring stations that can be used for data assimilation see table 1 the performance of the deterministic model implemented for yeongsan river is shown in fig 3 where water temperature tw m is well captured by the deterministic model for all locations the nitrate no3n m and phosphate po4p m levels are more difficult to simulate accurately related to the nutrient levels also chlorophyll a cloa m tends to deviate from observed values 2 3 ensemble data assimilation methods 2 3 1 enkf an enkf is a variant of kalman filter where the forecast error covariances are computed by using an ensemble of forecasts evensen 2003 the method is very simple to implement hence it gains popularity as in any ensemble based methods model forecast in enkf uncertainty is represented as forecast ensemble ξ 1 f ξ n f where ξ i f is model state forecast of ensemble member i defining the ensemble average as 1 ξ f 1 n i 1 n ξ i f and the square root of the covariance matrix af by 2 a f 1 n 1 ξ 1 f ξ f ξ n f ξ f the forecast error covariance is approximated by 3 p f a f a f in the analysis step each member of the forecasts ensemble is updated according to the following 4 ξ i a ξ i f k y o h ξ i f ν i where y o is observation h observational operator ν i observational error and k is kalman gain given by 5 k p f h h p f h r 1 where r is observational error covariance 2 3 2 enkf gs as any ensemble based methods the enkf suffers from sampling error one possible way to reduce this error is to smoothen the kalman gain sørensen et al 2004 6 k s t k 1 s k s t k 1 s k t k s 0 1 where k t k is an instantaneous kalman gain at time t k computed using equation 5 while k s the smoothed kalman gain in the analysis step the smoothed kalman gain k s is used to update each member of the forecasts ensemble the smoothing parameter s is a scalar parameter determining how long a kalman gain will still have effect in determining a kalman gain in the next analysis time the smoothing in equation 6 reduces the statistical error of estimating the kalman gain it is expected to give a good performance even with small ensemble sizes for operational purposes it is a desirable property since it may reduce the computational costs this method is however only applicable for systems with a fixed measurement network moreover the introduction of the smoothing parameter introduces an extra tuning parameter 2 3 3 dud enkf if a model and observational operators are non linear the kalman filter output analysis can be inconsistent with the model this is not the case for the variational data assimilation methods ensemble based variational methods which try to combine the strengths of the ensemble and variational methods have been developed for example mlef hamrick and mills 2000 khadr and elshemy 2017 peters and meybeck 2000 zupanski 2005 etkf 3dvar wang et al 2008 etc verlaan 2009 proposed the dud enkf method in this method like the enkf forecast ensemble is generated by propagating each member of the analysis ensemble at analysis step each member of the analysis ensemble is determined by minimizing a quadratic cost function using the dud method ralston and jennrich 1978 in a variational estimation problem an analysis step can be formulated as a minimization problem of the following cost function 7 j x 1 2 x x f p f 1 x x f 1 2 y o h x r 1 y o h x in an ensemble based variational method the minimizing analysis state is defined as 8 x ξ f a f w where a f is defined earlier in equation 2 and w the minimizing variable in the incremental form of the cost function 9 j i n c r w 1 2 a f w p f 1 a f w 1 2 y o h ξ f a f w r 1 y o h ξ f a f w in dud enkf the following minimization problem 10 j i w 1 2 w w 1 2 y o h ξ i f a f w ν i r 1 y o h ξ i f a f w ν i is solved iteratively using dud to obtain w ˆ i for each ensemble member i the analysis state is then obtained by the following equation 11 ξ i a ξ f a f w ˆ dud is expected to perform better for non linear models and non linear observational operators 2 3 4 discussion on parameters all the ensemble methods above share the same parameters model and observational error statistics and ensemble size model error is described in section 2 4 1 both model and observational error statistics can be determined by using all knowledge about the source of uncertainties perhaps the most important source of observational error is the representativeness error that arises from the finite grid size of the model in practice both model and observational error statistics are determined empirically a good understanding of the various sources of uncertainty can be used to make an initial guess the parameters can be tuned with various values around the initial guess the ensemble size is determined as a tread off between the computational time and the desirable output uncertainty in general the larger the ensemble size the smaller the uncertainty but large ensemble size means expensive computational cost for enkf gs there is an extra parameter the temporal smoothing factor s a pragmatic approach has been taken in study to determine the parameter empirically 2 3 5 discussion on computational costs in general the computational costs of the enkf based algorithms are o nn2 where n is number state variables and n is the number of ensemble members e g tippet et al 2003 the gain smoother in enkf gs requires a relatively minimal computational cost making it comparable to enkf the dud enkf involves iterative procedures that lead to more expensive computational costs in our experiments where each method is used with 8 ensemble members the computational costs per one week simulation are as follows enkf 1 2 h week enkf gs 1 2 h week and dud enkf 1 5 h week here all the ensemble members are executed serially one after the other it is possible to reduce the computational costs for example by running all the ensemble members in parallel 2 4 experimental setup 2 4 1 error modelling to use a kalman filter one needs to make a stochastic extension of the underlying model in ensemble kalman filter this is done by adding an error term to each variable considered as a source of uncertainty of the model leading to ensemble expression of modelling uncertainty here the four major sub watershed outlets tributaries 1 3 4 and 6 see fig 1 which cover about 77 of total flow of yeongsan river are considered as the source of model uncertainties at each location the following variables are considered uncertain algal diatoms algal greens algal cyanobacteria phosphate discharge and solar radiation the error models at these sub watershed outlets were established for each of the five variables algal diatoms algal greens algal cyanobacteria phosphate and discharge by simply assuming that the error of the hspf model outputs forms a normal distribution with its mean being the model output and the variance proportional to the model output the error model for solar radiation is established by the same method with the hspf model output when the perturbation is made based on the error models the temporal correlation of the error of each variable is modelled as an auto regressive model ar1 in this study we assumed that the correlation for different variables and for different locations is negligible the observational errors are assumed to be white noise with a standard deviation proportional to the actual observed data moreover the observational errors of different parameters and different locations are assumed to be independent of each other 2 4 2 state vector although the main interest is algal bloom prediction the dynamics of algae is also affected by the other water quality variables therefore we include all water quality variables of the efdc model in the definition of the state vector those variables are algal cyanobacteria algal diatoms algal greens refractory particulate organic carbon labile particulate organic carbon dissolved carbon refractory particulate organic phosphorus dissolved phosphorus phosphate refractory particulate organic nitrogen labile particulate organic nitrogen dissolved nitrogen ammonia nitrate and dissolved oxygen moreover the ar1 error terms described earlier are also included in the state vector to have a consistent model state estimate all these variables will be updated when a measurement data is assimilated note that we deliberately exclude water temperature from the state vector this is because we have observed that the covariance between water temperature and other water quality variables is not represented well by the underlying model used in this study as the result including water temperature in data assimilation will deteriorate its accuracy instead of improving it 2 4 3 setup of twin and real world experiments in this study we performed a number of twin experiments for which synthetic observations are used instead of the real observations such a twin experiment allows testing of the data assimilation implementations in an idealized situation remy et al 2002 robinson and lermusiaux 2002 irrgang et al 2017 the synthetic observations were prepared by first generating true results i e one realization of the underlying stochastic model obtained by drawing a realization of the error models and using them to force the water quality model the output is available for all model variables at all locations in the model area and considered to be the true results to account for the observational errors the synthetic observations were generated by drawing realizations of observational error and adding them to the true results at observation locations the synthetic observations were generated with an interval of 7 days to mimic the real situation fig 4 by first generating a truth model as one realization of the stochastic model and adding noise representing observational errors on the output at the observation locations starting with twin experiments offers a number of advantages firstly it can show whether data assimilation works for the underlying model we can examine how the effect of data assimilation progresses in time this is especially useful in our study since the real observations are only available with an interval of seven days while in real world experiments the effect of data assimilation can be evaluated only at the time intervals where observations are available twin experiments can give information on the accuracy improvement at all time steps and for locations where no observation is available because the truth model is known secondly because we can choose to specify the filter parameters exactly as used to generate the synthetic observations twin experiments give also an idea about the best effect we can expect from implementing data assimilation for our model thirdly this idealized situation also offers a framework in which we can compare the performance of the different methods with each other in real world situation the actual parameters e g model and observations error variances and correlation time are unknown and different methods may require different tuning of the parameters in order to get its best performance in the experiments we assimilated all the three algae species and phosphate as these are expected to have significant effect on improving the forecast accuracy of algal growth we designed three sets of experiments which are performed for the year 2015 first in order to make the results easier to analyse a twin experiment where synthetic data from only one upstream location 5004a10 located about 500 m upstream location of seongchon weir is assimilated an upstream location is chosen since considering the flow direction the data assimilation is expected to give effect on a larger area downstream with this setup the properties of the three different methods are explored and the results are compared with each other because the effect of data assimilation is among others dependent on the number and locations of assimilation stations the second twin experiment is performed where data from all stations along the main river are assimilated the third experiment is performed to test what effect the number of ensemble members has on the performance of applying enkf the truth in the twin experiment is constructed with the same yeongsan efdc model and forcing data used in the real world experiment using the same noise settings we assume there is some trend similarity between the synthetic and actual data and therefore we choose the data assimilation algorithm with the best performance in the twin experiments for usage in the real world experiment where real observations are assimilated in the efdc model for the period january 2015 august 2016 note that this assumption of trend similarity might be violated when the model is performing poorly but that would be the case irrespective of the algorithm selected 3 results and discussion 3 1 twin experiments 3 1 1 assimilating one station fig 5 shows time series of the truth and the deterministic model as well as the output of the three filters at the assimilation station 5004a10 this figure shows that all data assimilation methods successfully bring the model closer to the truth some differences are observed between the results of the various filters these differences are due to the different ways of how each method makes use of the ensemble to make the state estimates and also due to different realizations of the model and observational errors however these differences are practically insignificant note that the results of enkf gs shown in fig 5 are obtained with a smoothing parameter s 0 5 day this value is determined by tuning best guess and appeared to be the best value in this twin experiment fig 6 illustrates the effect of data assimilation at other locations one located upstream of the assimilation station 5001a80 the other downstream 5006a35 for practical reason we show here only the results for green algae similar patterns are also observed for other parameters this figure clearly shows that data assimilation works well for downstream locations but less well for the upstream locations this is discussed in the next paragraphs in order to gain information about how the effect of data assimilation develops in time fig 7 shows the rmse as a function of forecast horizon here t 0 represents analysis times and t 0 represent other time levels between two analysis times 7 days 168 h the rmse is computed here by averaging over all 50 analysis cycles over 2015 at the assimilation station the most accurate results are obtained at the analysis times the effect degrades gradually afterwards accuracy improvement at downstream locations lasts longer there the improvement is due to immediate impact of assimilating observation at analysis times as well as due to the updated model state affecting the downstream area in subsequent time steps at upstream locations however only at the location 5001a80 nearby the assimilation station the forecast accuracy is initially improved the accuracy degrades however faster than at downstream locations and after four days it becomes even worse than the deterministic forecasts at further upstream locations data assimilation degrades the forecast accuracy this is the area where error is assumed to enter the model thus the ensemble correlation is dominated by the assigned errors at these tributaries rather than model dynamics they have only little correlation with the assimilation station this shows that even in an idealized situation like in these experiments the methods suffer from the inherent problem of spurious correlation due to the use of a small ensemble size e g sørensen et al 2004 a summary of the data assimilation performance is shown in fig 8 here the rmse is computed over the whole study period based on the difference between the truth and the model output with and without filters applied fig 8 clearly shows that all data assimilation methods improve the model accuracy at the assimilation station and all other locations downstream of it at some locations the accuracy improvement can even reach more than 50 the methods however degrade the accuracy at most of the upstream locations for most parameters a possible explanation is that the correlation between model errors at downstream locations and at the assimilation location is determined almost entirely by the model as no error source from the tributaries enters downstream of the assimilation station the only error process affecting this area is the error term of solar radiation that affects the whole area all together in the same way it is likely that the assimilated variables at the assimilation station are highly correlated with those at downstream locations in this case it is easy to estimate the correlation even with a small ensemble size like in these experiments on the other hand variables at locations upstream of the assimilation station are perturbed by random noise representing model errors the variables at the assimilation station are not only determined by the underlying model but also determined as a function of randomly perturbed variables at the four upstream locations as a result the random noise reduces the correlation between the variables at the upstream locations and those at the assimilation station estimating a small correlation is more difficult statistically a small ensemble like in the performed experiments causes spurious correlation which in turn degrades the accuracy of the filter moreover the error terms at the four major sub watershed outlets are also updated by the filters it is likely that updating the ar1 error terms suffers from the spurious correlation contributing to deterioration of filter accuracy in the area upstream of the assimilation station the dud enkf is expected to work better for systems with non linear model and observational operators the dud enkf performs equally well as enkf this indicates a linearity of model and observation in these experiments the observational operator is also linear it simply selects four state variables that correspond to the observations at the assimilation station moreover all variables of interest are assimilated while the variables at the assimilation station are highly correlated linear with the same variables downstream hence enkf is sufficient in that case and no method can improve upon it enkf gs is expected to give a better result than enkf in cases where the kalman gain is almost constant in time since it is unknown to what degree the error covariance hence k in this study can be considered as constant we have tuned the smoothing factor s and found that s 0 5 day the enkf gs performs the best when increasing the smoothing factor e g 0 9 to include more observations over a longer period the rmse is increased because the applied kalman gain is no longer supported by the observations low time correlation however for the present setup where observation is only available once in 7 days the kalman gain from an analysis time will have very little impact on the kalman gain at the next analysis time in our experiment the expected gain by the enkf gs is cancelled out by the sparse number of observations where the gain is already absent a more frequent observation is needed for the smoothing to have impact since there is no evidence that the enkf gs or dud enkf method is better than enkf we have chosen to use enkf in the next experiments enkf is also more preferred than the others since it is simpler and offers flexibility to work with varying observation network frequency 3 1 2 assimilating more stations ideally assimilating data from more stations will lead to more accurate results to gain insight an experiment is performed where observation data from all 12 stations along the main river are assimilated here an enkf with 8 members is used fig 9 summarizes the results of this experiment the following holds for all parameters except for algal diatoms fig 9 shows that by assimilating observations from all stations significant accuracy improvement is gained in the four upstream locations on the downstream locations small differences are found with the results of enkf with one assimilation station the correlation structure in this area merely determined by the model dynamics is apparently so easy to estimate that data from one station contains sufficient information about it using more observations in the downstream area doesn t help to get a more accurate result except for phosphate for which small improvement is found at some locations for algal diatoms fig 9 shows that the accuracy obtained by assimilating data from all locations is worse than assimilating data from one location the standard deviation for algal diatoms is larger than for other variables therefore this variable will gain larger updates than the others when the correlation is not accurately estimated this variable will suffer the most from an incorrect update this is likely to be caused by the spurious correlation another possible reason is that the number of observations 4 variables times 12 locations is larger than number of ensemble members this may cause a too small degrees of freedom number fahimuddin et al 2008 or may lead to filter divergence kepert 2004 this suggests that the ensemble size should be much larger than the number of observations for an enkf to obtain an accurate solution 3 1 3 enkf with larger ensemble it is known that the performance of any ensemble based method is dependent on the ensemble size to gain insight about the effect of ensemble size on the performance of the enkf we have performed some experiments with ensemble size of 8 16 32 and 64 see fig 10 since we are aiming for an operational use of the filter we limit our study to these ensemble sizes here only one station is used for data assimilation fig 10 shows no clear trend of improvement obtained by increasing the ensemble size the differences are practically insignificant this is likely due to the fact that for the downstream area the error correlation between the assimilation and validation stations is that high that a small ensemble is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of the covariance and hence the state the results may also be affected by sample variations statistically better results can be obtained by repeating the experiments many times we expect that improvement will be obtained when a much larger ensemble is used for our operational purpose it is sufficient to show that even with a small ensemble size data assimilation successfully improves the forecast accuracy 3 2 real world experiment the results of the twin experiments suggest that enkf with 8 members performs the best considering the relative comparable performances and the practicalities it offers relative low computational cost and its applicability for varying observation network this setup is therefore used in the real world experiment where real observations are used for data assimilation in the first experiment enkf all in fig 11 we use exactly the same setup as in the first twin experiment i e one assimilation station except that here real measurements of phosphate and chlorophyll a are assimilated instead of synthetic data the results are presented in fig 11 which shows the rmse of the model observation residuals over the study period note that measurements at different locations are available at different time levels the rmse residuals presented here were calculated over all available observation times which for non assimilation stations are not necessarily equal to analysis times fig 11 shows that at the assimilation station the enkf has successfully brought the model closer to observations for all variables except algal greens unlike in the twin experiment with real observations the results of enkf are at many locations other than the assimilation station worse than the deterministic results for algal cyanobacteria the effect of enkf varies at some locations it improves the accuracy at some other locations it has almost no effect and at the rest of the locations it degrades the accuracy for algal diatoms at most locations the output of the enkf is more accurate than the deterministic run except for one downstream location and two upstream locations for algal greens the enkf improves the accuracy at the 5 most downstream locations and degrades the accuracy at all other locations including the assimilation station for phosphate the results of enkf are less accurate than the deterministic run at most locations except for three locations one upstream location the assimilation station and the location directly downstream of the assimilation station the only difference between the twin and real world experiments is the type of observations being assimilated synthetic versus real observations this suggests that the correlation structure estimated by the ensemble may not be representative for the actual correlation between variables and locations in the field one possible reason is that the deterministic model still cannot sufficiently represent the actual dynamics of the water quality this can be seen by comparing the deterministic results with the measurements see fig 3 and suggests that the deterministic model itself requires improvement recalibration another possibility is the use of a small ensemble causing wrong estimates of correlation especially between variables that are actually weakly or not correlated to test this a second experiment was set up enkf chlfa in fig 11 to investigate our assumption that the correlation between phosphate and chlorophyll a is actually small so that it will be hard to estimate both variables accurately with a small ensemble in this second experiment we have excluded phosphate measurements and only chlorophyll a measurements are assimilated the results of the experiment 2 are shown in fig 11 enkf chlfa as expected at location 5004a10 the accuracy of phosphate estimates is a little less than when phosphate measurements are also assimilated but it is still slightly more accurate than the deterministic run moreover at many other locations the results for phosphate are more accurate than when phosphate is also assimilated fig 11 also shows that at the assimilation station the enkf results of the three algal species are more accurate than the deterministic and the enkf results where phosphate is also assimilated i e experiment 1 the accuracy for algal greens at all stations downstream is improved for algal cyanobacteria it can be seen that by assimilating only the three algal measurements the enkf gives a better result than when also phosphate is assimilated moreover the estimates of algal diatoms become now more accurate than the deterministic runs everywhere this result indicates that there is indeed a problem with estimating the correlation with phosphate to further understand the behaviour and improve the accuracy of the enkf for this model we have executed two other experiments it is known that any ensemble method will suffer from spurious correlation due to the use of a small ensemble size using a very large ensemble size is not an option for us considering the goal of using the system in an operational setting we have therefore opted for the use of covariance regularization in a third experiment the covariance regularization is intended for removing the spurious correlation here we use the regularization technique based on bootstrapping zhang and oliver 2011 as shown in fig 11 enkf chlfa loc the use of regularization has improved the enkf performance at many locations relative to the results of enkf without regularization in the previous three experiments the system error is modelled as an ar1 process in this case the error term is included in the state vector and updated in the analysis step by the kalman filter since the noise process has small correlations with the observed variables at assimilation stations it is likely that the update actually worsen the estimate of the noise term to check this we have performed a fourth experiment in which the system error is simply modelled as a white noise process the results of experiment 4 enkf chfla white noise in fig 11 show that at some upstream locations especially for algal greens the enkf performance is improved significantly with respect to the second experiment i e system error modelled as an ar1 process at other locations and parameters the performance is either unaffected or slightly degraded in terms of water temperature however the results are significantly better than at all locations not shown in the experiments with other settings note that although water temperature is not included in the state vector it is still affected by the enkf update via the noise term of solar radiation these results indicate that with only 8 members it is difficult for the enkf to estimate the noise term of for example solar radiation accurately overall the results of the various experiments suggest to further investigate the approach for error modelling here the question is which variables at which locations should be included in the sources of uncertainty also this study has shown that the choice of error model structure has impact in the performance of data assimilation it is therefore recommended to investigate the use of different perturbation and error modelling settings and to search for a better definition of the state vector and which observed variables to assimilate 4 conclusions in this paper we present the application of various ensemble based data assimilation methods enkf enkf gs and dud enkf for improving the accuracy of water quality forecasting along the yeongsan river south korea the core points of this work elaborated on further below are twin experiments show improved model accuracy the performance of the three methods has only subtle differences upstream locations suffer from spurious correlation improvement at downstream locations is already achieved with a small ensemble size real world experiments show both improvement up to 30 for algal diatoms and deterioration in performance when applying data assimilation techniques the deterministic model seems to contain a significant systematic error hampering large improvements in the real world experiment the methods are generally applicable for other rivers but performance relies on the quality of the underlying model and measurements the comparison of the three different methods is performed in the framework of twin experiments where all the kalman filter parameters are specified equal to the true model that generated the synthetic observations in the experiments each method is run with an ensemble of 8 members and assimilates the synthetic observations phosphate and the three algal species of one assimilation station the twin experiments show that data assimilation has successfully improved the model accuracy at some locations the improvement can even reach more than 50 at the locations upstream of the assimilation location however the accuracy is less than the deterministic forecast this is mainly due to spurious correlation that occurs from estimating the error terms in the upstream area using a small ensemble 8 members the results of the twin experiments also indicate that the performance of the three methods has only subtle differences therefore one cannot argue that one method is superior to the others because all methods perform equally well for the water quality model in our study we chose to use the enkf already operational in wqfs for the subsequent twin and real world experiments we performed a twin experiment to investigate if assimilating measurements from all available 12 monitoring stations will further improve the results it turns out that due to the limited ensemble size the results are less accurate than when measurements from one station are assimilated in the view of operational purposes we have tested ensembles sizes of 8 16 32 and 64 members to explore its effect on the accuracy of the enkf expecting a more accurate result from larger ensemble this twin experiment revealed no clear trend that the filter accuracy is improved with ensemble size the correlation between state variables at the assimilation station and downstream locations is likely large so that it can be estimated accurately with a small ensemble as a result improvement in model results at downstream locations is already achieved with a small ensemble of 8 members nevertheless we expect that the accuracy will be improved when using a much larger ensemble but because of computational constraints in an operational setting we did not perform experiments with ensembles larger than 64 members in the real world experiments with enkf using real measurements and using exactly the same assimilation setting as in the twin experiment with one assimilation station the enkf has improved the accuracy of algal diatoms at most locations where largest improvement of about 30 is obtained at the assimilation station accuracy improvements are also obtained for algal greens and algal cyanobacteria for a number of locations however at many other locations the performance of the enkf is worse than the model output obtained without data assimilation this suggests that the correlation structure estimated from the ensemble is not representative for the real world situation we have investigated several other real world experiments to gain more understanding and to further improve the performance of the enkf based on our hypothesis that the method likely suffers from spurious correlation especially for estimating correlation between the three algal species and phosphate we have performed a real world experiment where measured phosphate is excluded from assimilation the results for this experiment are more accurate at many locations compared to enkf that assimilates both measured phosphate and chlorophyll a the experiment for investigating the impact of using covariance regularization and of modelling system error as white noise also showed a positive impact on the enkf accuracy for further study we recommend to investigate 1 a better definition of the state variables to be included in the data assimilation 2 a different error model structure and 3 the selection of perturbed variables an important step would be to also improve the deterministic model systematically the model seems to contain a significant systematic error a recalibration prior to data assimilation is expected to make the filter perform better while the ensemble data assimilation methods for improving water quality forecasting presented here were only tested for one south korean river and using one water quality model efdc the methods are generally applicable for other rivers and can be used in combination with other hydrodynamic water quality models the result of such an assimilation depends on the quality of the underlying model and the availability and quality of measurements as shown in this manuscript we expect that given the availability of high quality measurements and a good model state updating will provide the best estimate of the river system state and therefore will very likely improve forecast quality accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18201,river water quality is one of the main challenges that societies face during the 21st century accurate and reliable real time prediction of water quality is an effective adaptation measure to counteract water quality issues such as accidental spill and harmful algae blooms to improve accuracy and skill of water quality forecasts along the yeongsan river in south korea three different ensemble data assimilation da methods have been investigated the traditional ensemble kalman filter enkf and two related algorithms dud enkf and enkf gs that offer either possibilities to improve initial conditions for non linear models or reduce computation time important for real time forecasting by using a smaller time lagged ensemble to estimate the kalman gain twin experiments assimilating synthetic observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations with relatively small ensemble sizes showed that all three da methods improved forecast accuracy and skill with only subtle difference between the methods they all improved the model accuracy at downstream locations with very similar performances but due to spurious correlation the accuracy at upstream locations was somewhat deteriorated the experiments also showed no clear trend of improvement by increasing the ensemble size from 8 to 64 the real world experiments assimilating real observations of three algae species and phosphate concentrations showed that less improvement was achieved compared to the twin experiments further improvement of the model accuracy may be achieved with different state variable definitions use of different perturbation and error modelling settings and or better calibration of the deterministic water quality model graphical abstract image 1 keywords water

dud enkf verlaan 2009 dud stands for doesn t use derivatives is an ensemble variational combined method that aims to combine the strength of the enkf and variational approach to give consistent results for a review about ensemble variational method we refer to bannister 2017 to test the different data assimilation methods for improving the real time water quality forecasts in the yeongsan river basin the three methods have been implemented in an idealized situation where true model state error structure and statistics are assumed to be known twin experiments in this setting it is possible to study the properties of each method and compare the different methods assuming that the error model used in the twin experiments is sufficiently representing the actual model error the best performing filter is then implemented with actual observations i e setup for real world experiments due to the limited number of observations about once a week accuracy evaluation can only be done at analyses times at time steps where observations are available in the real world experiments the forecast accuracy and skill of algae concentrations along the yeongsan river in south korea has been explored for the summer of 2015 to obtain the best performing method 2 material methods 2 1 study area the yeongsan river is one of the four major rivers in korea and located in the south western part of south korea fig 1 yongchubong peak 560 m is the source of the river with a length of approximately 130 km and covering an area of 3468 km2 the river runs through damyang gwangju naju and yeongam and eventually flows into the yellow sea at mokpo the watershed of yeongsan river is relatively warm with high precipitation in summer months annual average temperature is 13 8 c with a mean temperature of 0 6 c in january and 26 2 c in august annual precipitation is 1 391 mm where 50 60 of annual precipitation falls in summer the land use is made up of 8 1 of urban and built up land 25 3 of paddy and wetland 17 5 of agricultural land 45 6 of forest and 3 4 of water and other land four large agricultural reservoirs damyang gwangju jangsung and naju reservoirs lie within the river basin in the mainstream two weirs seongchon and juksan weirs see fig 1 were installed as part of the four rivers restoration project in 2009 upstream of the seongchon weir there are two large sewage treatment plants gwangju 1 and gwangju 2 with an average water discharge of 7 6 m3 s 1 i e 15 6 of the total flow of the yeongsan river in 2015 2016 these stp s have a significant influence on the river s water quality 2 2 forecasting system and linked models the simulation of water temperature nutrients and algae concentrations for both historical simulations and 7 day forecasts is performed in real time using the water quality forecast system wqfs implemented in delft fews werner et al 2013 that connects the hspf models for the upstream watersheds with the efdc models for the main streams of all 4 major rivers in south korea including the yeongsan river used here as test case 2 2 1 water quality forecast system the water quality forecast system wqfs runs a daily scheduled workflow that performs all the necessary steps to perform a forecast import monitoring and forecasting data pre process the data to meet the model demands and execute the hspf and efdc models kim et al 2014a a forecast run is preceded by an ensemble run which generates the initial model conditions based on real time monitoring data and data assimilation techniques the wqfs connects historical and forecasted meteorological data korean meteorological administration numerical weather prediction gridded data and telemetry data for water level flow rates and water quality substances with the two models the wqfs database also connects the simulated flow and water quality constituents at the outlets of the hspf subbasins yeongsan tributaries to the efdc grid representing the yeongsan mainstream adapter i collects hspf model results into the wqfs database next delft fews wqfs maps the hspf outlet results to efdc tributary locations and adapter ii picks up and prepares these mapped results into efdc native input files important constituents for the modelling and forecasting of algae that simulated with the models are nitrogen phosphate water temperature and chlorophyll a the openda model wrapper connecting wqfs with efdc is responsible for providing the real time in stream weekly measurements to the efdc model at the monitoring and assimilation stations see fig 1 and applying the data assimilation algorithms the ensemble kalman filter and its two variants were applied in the efdc model simulation using the openda model wrapper the ensemble simulation of the model was achieved by perturbing efdc s boundary forcing 1 the meteorological input and 2 the outputs of the hspf model at the sub watershed outlets i e tributaries of the yeongsan river and based on error models see par 2 4 2 a simple schematic diagram to describe the entire framework of the modelling and data assimilation is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf the hspf

this study the efdc model is forced by water quality boundary conditions for 14 tributaries and by meteorological forecasts at 1 station gwangju for algal dynamics three different algal species i e diatom green algae and cyanobacteria were simulated there are 12 monitoring stations that can be used for data assimilation see table 1 the performance of the deterministic model implemented for yeongsan river is shown in fig 3 where water temperature tw m is well captured by the deterministic model for all locations the nitrate no3n m and phosphate po4p m levels are more difficult to simulate accurately related to the nutrient levels also chlorophyll a cloa m tends to deviate from observed values 2 3 ensemble data assimilation methods 2 3 1 enkf an enkf is a variant of kalman filter where the forecast error covariances are computed by using an ensemble of forecasts evensen 2003 the method is very simple to implement hence it gains popularity as in any ensemble based methods model forecast in enkf uncertainty is represented as forecast ensemble ξ 1 f ξ n f where ξ i f is model state forecast of ensemble member i defining the ensemble average as 1 ξ f 1 n i 1 n ξ i f and the square root of the covariance matrix af by 2 a f 1 n 1 ξ 1 f ξ f ξ n f ξ f the forecast error covariance is approximated by 3 p f a f a f in the analysis step each member of the forecasts ensemble is updated according to the following 4 ξ i a ξ i f k y o h ξ i f ν i where y o is observation h observational operator ν i observational error and k is kalman gain given by 5 k p f h h p f h r 1 where r is observational error covariance 2 3 2 enkf gs as any ensemble based methods the enkf suffers from sampling error one possible way to reduce this error is to smoothen the kalman gain sørensen et al 2004 6 k s t k 1 s k s t k 1 s k t k s 0 1 where k t k is an instantaneous kalman gain at time t k computed using equation 5 while k s the smoothed kalman gain in the analysis step the smoothed kalman gain k s is used to update each member of the forecasts ensemble the smoothing parameter s is a scalar parameter determining how long a kalman gain will still have effect in determining a kalman gain in the next analysis time the smoothing in equation 6 reduces the statistical error of estimating the kalman gain it is expected to give a good performance even with small ensemble sizes for operational purposes it is a desirable property since it may reduce the computational costs this method is however only applicable for systems with a fixed measurement network moreover the introduction of the smoothing parameter introduces an extra tuning parameter 2 3 3 dud enkf if a model and observational operators are non linear the kalman filter output analysis can be inconsistent with the model this is not the case for the variational data assimilation methods ensemble based variational methods which try to combine the strengths of the ensemble and variational methods have been developed for example mlef hamrick and mills 2000 khadr and elshemy 2017 peters and meybeck 2000 zupanski 2005 etkf 3dvar wang et al 2008 etc verlaan 2009 proposed the dud enkf method in this method like the enkf forecast ensemble is generated by propagating each member of the analysis ensemble at analysis step each member of the analysis ensemble is determined by minimizing a quadratic cost function using the dud method ralston and jennrich 1978 in a variational estimation problem an analysis step can be formulated as a minimization problem of the following cost function 7 j x 1 2 x x f p f 1 x x f 1 2 y o h x r 1 y o h x in an ensemble based variational method the minimizing analysis state is defined as 8 x ξ f a f w where a f is defined earlier in equation 2 and w the minimizing variable in the incremental form of the cost function 9 j i n c r w 1 2 a f w p f 1 a f w 1 2 y o h ξ f a f w r 1 y o h ξ f a f w in dud enkf the following minimization problem 10 j i w 1 2 w w 1 2 y o h ξ i f a f w ν i r 1 y o h ξ i f a f w ν i is solved iteratively using dud to obtain w ˆ i for each ensemble member i the analysis state is then obtained by the following equation 11 ξ i a ξ f a f w ˆ dud is expected to perform better for non linear models and non linear observational operators 2 3 4 discussion on parameters all the ensemble methods above share the same parameters model and observational error statistics and ensemble size model error is described in section 2 4 1 both model and observational error statistics can be determined by using all knowledge about the source of uncertainties perhaps the most important source of observational error is the representativeness error that arises from the finite grid size of the model in practice both model and observational error statistics are determined empirically a good understanding of the various sources of uncertainty can be used to make an initial guess the parameters can be tuned with various values around the initial guess the ensemble size is determined as a tread off between the computational time and the desirable output uncertainty in general the larger the ensemble size the smaller the uncertainty but large ensemble size means expensive computational cost for enkf gs there is an extra parameter the temporal smoothing factor s a pragmatic approach has been taken in study to determine the parameter empirically 2 3 5 discussion on computational costs in general the computational costs of the enkf based algorithms are o nn2 where n is number state variables and n is the number of ensemble members e g tippet et al 2003 the gain smoother in enkf gs requires a relatively minimal computational cost making it comparable to enkf the dud enkf involves iterative procedures that lead to more expensive computational costs in our experiments where each method is used with 8 ensemble members the computational costs per one week simulation are as follows enkf 1 2 h week enkf gs 1 2 h week and dud enkf 1 5 h week here all the ensemble members are executed serially one after the other it is possible to reduce the computational costs for example by running all the ensemble members in parallel 2 4 experimental setup 2 4 1 error modelling to use a kalman filter one needs to make a stochastic extension of the underlying model in ensemble kalman filter this is done by adding an error term to each variable considered as a source of uncertainty of the model leading to ensemble expression of modelling uncertainty here the four major sub watershed outlets tributaries 1 3 4 and 6 see fig 1 which cover about 77 of total flow of yeongsan river are considered as the source of model uncertainties at each location the following variables are considered uncertain algal diatoms algal greens algal cyanobacteria phosphate discharge and solar radiation the error models at these sub watershed outlets were established for each of the five variables algal diatoms algal greens algal cyanobacteria phosphate and discharge by simply assuming that the error of the hspf model outputs forms a normal distribution with its mean being the model output and the variance proportional to the model output the error model for solar radiation is established by the same method with the hspf model output when the perturbation is made based on the error models the temporal correlation of the error of each variable is modelled as an auto regressive model ar1 in this study we assumed that the correlation for different variables and for different locations is negligible the observational errors are assumed to be white noise with a standard deviation proportional to the actual observed data moreover the observational errors of different parameters and different locations are assumed to be independent of each other 2 4 2 state vector although the main interest is algal bloom prediction the dynamics of algae is also affected by the other water quality variables therefore we include all water quality variables of the efdc model in the definition of the state vector those variables are algal cyanobacteria algal diatoms algal greens refractory particulate organic carbon labile particulate organic carbon dissolved carbon refractory particulate organic phosphorus dissolved phosphorus phosphate refractory particulate organic nitrogen labile particulate organic nitrogen dissolved nitrogen ammonia nitrate and dissolved oxygen moreover the ar1 error terms described earlier are also included in the state vector to have a consistent model state estimate all these variables will be updated when a measurement data is assimilated note that we deliberately exclude water temperature from the state vector this is because we have observed that the covariance between water temperature and other water quality variables is not represented well by the underlying model used in this study as the result including water temperature in data assimilation will deteriorate its accuracy instead of improving it 2 4 3 setup of twin and real world experiments in this study we performed a number of twin experiments for which synthetic observations are used instead of the real observations such a twin experiment allows testing of the data assimilation implementations in an idealized situation remy et al 2002 robinson and lermusiaux 2002 irrgang et al 2017 the synthetic observations were prepared by first generating true results i e one realization of the underlying stochastic model obtained by drawing a realization of the error models and using them to force the water quality model the output is available for all model variables at all locations in the model area and considered to be the true results to account for the observational errors the synthetic observations were generated by drawing realizations of observational error and adding them to the true results at observation locations the synthetic observations were generated with an interval of 7 days to mimic the real situation fig 4 by first generating a truth model as one realization of the stochastic model and adding noise representing observational errors on the output at the observation locations starting with twin experiments offers a number of advantages firstly it can show whether data assimilation works for the underlying model we can examine how the effect of data assimilation progresses in time this is especially useful in our study since the real observations are only available with an interval of seven days while in real world experiments the effect of data assimilation can be evaluated only at the time intervals where observations are available twin experiments can give information on the accuracy improvement at all time steps and for locations where no observation is available because the truth model is known secondly because we can choose to specify the filter parameters exactly as used to generate the synthetic observations twin experiments give also an idea about the best effect we can expect from implementing data assimilation for our model thirdly this idealized situation also offers a framework in which we can compare the performance of the different methods with each other in real world situation the actual parameters e g model and observations error variances and correlation time are unknown and different methods may require different tuning of the parameters in order to get its best performance in the experiments we assimilated all the three algae species and phosphate as these are expected to have significant effect on improving the forecast accuracy of algal growth we designed three sets of experiments which are performed for the year 2015 first in order to make the results easier to analyse a twin experiment where synthetic data from only one upstream location 5004a10 located about 500 m upstream location of seongchon weir is assimilated an upstream location is chosen since considering the flow direction the data assimilation is expected to give effect on a larger area downstream with this setup the properties of the three different methods are explored and the results are compared with each other because the effect of data assimilation is among others dependent on the number and locations of assimilation stations the second twin experiment is performed where data from all stations along the main river are assimilated the third experiment is performed to test what effect the number of ensemble members has on the performance of applying enkf the truth in the twin experiment is constructed with the same yeongsan efdc model and forcing data used in the real world experiment using the same noise settings we assume there is some trend similarity between the synthetic and actual data and therefore we choose the data assimilation algorithm with the best performance in the twin experiments for usage in the real world experiment where real observations are assimilated in the efdc model for the period january 2015 august 2016 note that this assumption of trend similarity might be violated when the model is performing poorly but that would be the case irrespective of the algorithm selected 3 results and discussion 3 1 twin experiments 3 1 1 assimilating one station fig 5 shows time series of the truth and the deterministic model as well as the output of the three filters at the assimilation station 5004a10 this figure shows that all data assimilation methods successfully bring the model closer to the truth some differences are observed between the results of the various filters these differences are due to the different ways of how each method makes use of the ensemble to make the state estimates and also due to different realizations of the model and observational errors however these differences are practically insignificant note that the results of enkf gs shown in fig 5 are obtained with a smoothing parameter s 0 5 day this value is determined by tuning best guess and appeared to be the best value in this twin experiment fig 6 illustrates the effect of data assimilation at other locations one located upstream of the assimilation station 5001a80 the other downstream 5006a35 for practical reason we show here only the results for green algae similar patterns are also observed for other parameters this figure clearly shows that data assimilation works well for downstream locations but less well for the upstream locations this is discussed in the next paragraphs in order to gain information about how the effect of data assimilation develops in time fig 7 shows the rmse as a function of forecast horizon here t 0 represents analysis times and t 0 represent other time levels between two analysis times 7 days 168 h the rmse is computed here by averaging over all 50 analysis cycles over 2015 at the assimilation station the most accurate results are obtained at the analysis times the effect degrades gradually afterwards accuracy improvement at downstream locations lasts longer there the improvement is due to immediate impact of assimilating observation at analysis times as well as due to the updated model state affecting the downstream area in subsequent time steps at upstream locations however only at the location 5001a80 nearby the assimilation station the forecast accuracy is initially improved the accuracy degrades however faster than at downstream locations and after four days it becomes even worse than the deterministic forecasts at further upstream locations data assimilation degrades the forecast accuracy this is the area where error is assumed to enter the model thus the ensemble correlation is dominated by the assigned errors at these tributaries rather than model dynamics they have only little correlation with the assimilation station this shows that even in an idealized situation like in these experiments the methods suffer from the inherent problem of spurious correlation due to the use of a small ensemble size e g sørensen et al 2004 a summary of the data assimilation performance is shown in fig 8 here the rmse is computed over the whole study period based on the difference between the truth and the model output with and without filters applied fig 8 clearly shows that all data assimilation methods improve the model accuracy at the assimilation station and all other locations downstream of it at some locations the accuracy improvement can even reach more than 50 the methods however degrade the accuracy at most of the upstream locations for most parameters a possible explanation is that the correlation between model errors at downstream locations and at the assimilation location is determined almost entirely by the model as no error source from the tributaries enters downstream of the assimilation station the only error process affecting this area is the error term of solar radiation that affects the whole area all together in the same way it is likely that the assimilated variables at the assimilation station are highly correlated with those at downstream locations in this case it is easy to estimate the correlation even with a small ensemble size like in these experiments on the other hand variables at locations upstream of the assimilation station are perturbed by random noise representing model errors the variables at the assimilation station are not only determined by the underlying model but also determined as a function of randomly perturbed variables at the four upstream locations as a result the random noise reduces the correlation between the variables at the upstream locations and those at the assimilation station estimating a small correlation is more difficult statistically a small ensemble like in the performed experiments causes spurious correlation which in turn degrades the accuracy of the filter moreover the error terms at the four major sub watershed outlets are also updated by the filters it is likely that updating the ar1 error terms suffers from the spurious correlation contributing to deterioration of filter accuracy in the area upstream of the assimilation station the dud enkf is expected to work better for systems with non linear model and observational operators the dud enkf performs equally well as enkf this indicates a linearity of model and observation in these experiments the observational operator is also linear it simply selects four state variables that correspond to the observations at the assimilation station moreover all variables of interest are assimilated while the variables at the assimilation station are highly correlated linear with the same variables downstream hence enkf is sufficient in that case and no method can improve upon it enkf gs is expected to give a better result than enkf in cases where the kalman gain is almost constant in time since it is unknown to what degree the error covariance hence k in this study can be considered as constant we have tuned the smoothing factor s and found that s 0 5 day the enkf gs performs the best when increasing the smoothing factor e g 0 9 to include more observations over a longer period the rmse is increased because the applied kalman gain is no longer supported by the observations low time correlation however for the present setup where observation is only available once in 7 days the kalman gain from an analysis time will have very little impact on the kalman gain at the next analysis time in our experiment the expected gain by the enkf gs is cancelled out by the sparse number of observations where the gain is already absent a more frequent observation is needed for the smoothing to have impact since there is no evidence that the enkf gs or dud enkf method is better than enkf we have chosen to use enkf in the next experiments enkf is also more preferred than the others since it is simpler and offers flexibility to work with varying observation network frequency 3 1 2 assimilating more stations ideally assimilating data from more stations will lead to more accurate results to gain insight an experiment is performed where observation data from all 12 stations along the main river are assimilated here an enkf with 8 members is used fig 9 summarizes the results of this experiment the following holds for all parameters except for algal diatoms fig 9 shows that by assimilating observations from all stations significant accuracy improvement is gained in the four upstream locations on the downstream locations small differences are found with the results of enkf with one assimilation station the correlation structure in this area merely determined by the model dynamics is apparently so easy to estimate that data from one station contains sufficient information about it using more observations in the downstream area doesn t help to get a more accurate result except for phosphate for which small improvement is found at some locations for algal diatoms fig 9 shows that the accuracy obtained by assimilating data from all locations is worse than assimilating data from one location the standard deviation for algal diatoms is larger than for other variables therefore this variable will gain larger updates than the others when the correlation is not accurately estimated this variable will suffer the most from an incorrect update this is likely to be caused by the spurious correlation another possible reason is that the number of observations 4 variables times 12 locations is larger than number of ensemble members this may cause a too small degrees of freedom number fahimuddin et al 2008 or may lead to filter divergence kepert 2004 this suggests that the ensemble size should be much larger than the number of observations for an enkf to obtain an accurate solution 3 1 3 enkf with larger ensemble it is known that the performance of any ensemble based method is dependent on the ensemble size to gain insight about the effect of ensemble size on the performance of the enkf we have performed some experiments with ensemble size of 8 16 32 and 64 see fig 10 since we are aiming for an operational use of the filter we limit our study to these ensemble sizes here only one station is used for data assimilation fig 10 shows no clear trend of improvement obtained by increasing the ensemble size the differences are practically insignificant this is likely due to the fact that for the downstream area the error correlation between the assimilation and validation stations is that high that a small ensemble is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of the covariance and hence the state the results may also be affected by sample variations statistically better results can be obtained by repeating the experiments many times we expect that improvement will be obtained when a much larger ensemble is used for our operational purpose it is sufficient to show that even with a small ensemble size data assimilation successfully improves the forecast accuracy 3 2 real world experiment the results of the twin experiments suggest that enkf with 8 members performs the best considering the relative comparable performances and the practicalities it offers relative low computational cost and its applicability for varying observation network this setup is therefore used in the real world experiment where real observations are used for data assimilation in the first experiment enkf all in fig 11 we use exactly the same setup as in the first twin experiment i e one assimilation station except that here real measurements of phosphate and chlorophyll a are assimilated instead of synthetic data the results are presented in fig 11 which shows the rmse of the model observation residuals over the study period note that measurements at different locations are available at different time levels the rmse residuals presented here were calculated over all available observation times which for non assimilation stations are not necessarily equal to analysis times fig 11 shows that at the assimilation station the enkf has successfully brought the model closer to observations for all variables except algal greens unlike in the twin experiment with real observations the results of enkf are at many locations other than the assimilation station worse than the deterministic results for algal cyanobacteria the effect of enkf varies at some locations it improves the accuracy at some other locations it has almost no effect and at the rest of the locations it degrades the accuracy for algal diatoms at most locations the output of the enkf is more accurate than the deterministic run except for one downstream location and two upstream locations for algal greens the enkf improves the accuracy at the 5 most downstream locations and degrades the accuracy at all other locations including the assimilation station for phosphate the results of enkf are less accurate than the deterministic run at most locations except for three locations one upstream location the assimilation station and the location directly downstream of the assimilation station the only difference between the twin and real world experiments is the type of observations being assimilated synthetic versus real observations this suggests that the correlation structure estimated by the ensemble may not be representative for the actual correlation between variables and locations in the field one possible reason is that the deterministic model still cannot sufficiently represent the actual dynamics of the water quality this can be seen by comparing the deterministic results with the measurements see fig 3 and suggests that the deterministic model itself requires improvement recalibration another possibility is the use of a small ensemble causing wrong estimates of correlation especially between variables that are actually weakly or not correlated to test this a second experiment was set up enkf chlfa in fig 11 to investigate our assumption that the correlation between phosphate and chlorophyll a is actually small so that it will be hard to estimate both variables accurately with a small ensemble in this second experiment we have excluded phosphate measurements and only chlorophyll a measurements are assimilated the results of the experiment 2 are shown in fig 11 enkf chlfa as expected at location 5004a10 the accuracy of phosphate estimates is a little less than when phosphate measurements are also assimilated but it is still slightly more accurate than the deterministic run moreover at many other locations the results for phosphate are more accurate than when phosphate is also assimilated fig 11 also shows that at the assimilation station the enkf results of the three algal species are more accurate than the deterministic and the enkf results where phosphate is also assimilated i e experiment 1 the accuracy for algal greens at all stations downstream is improved for algal cyanobacteria it can be seen that by assimilating only the three algal measurements the enkf gives a better result than when also phosphate is assimilated moreover the estimates of algal diatoms become now more accurate than the deterministic runs everywhere this result indicates that there is indeed a problem with estimating the correlation with phosphate to further understand the behaviour and improve the accuracy of the enkf for this model we have executed two other experiments it is known that any ensemble method will suffer from spurious correlation due to the use of a small ensemble size using a very large ensemble size is not an option for us considering the goal of using the system in an operational setting we have therefore opted for the use of covariance regularization in a third experiment the covariance regularization is intended for removing the spurious correlation here we use the regularization technique based on bootstrapping zhang and oliver 2011 as shown in fig 11 enkf chlfa loc the use of regularization has improved the enkf performance at many locations relative to the results of enkf without regularization in the previous three experiments the system error is modelled as an ar1 process in this case the error term is included in the state vector and updated in the analysis step by the kalman filter since the noise process has small correlations with the observed variables at assimilation stations it is likely that the update actually worsen the estimate of the noise term to check this we have performed a fourth experiment in which the system error is simply modelled as a white noise process the results of experiment 4 enkf chfla white noise in fig 11 show that at some upstream locations especially for algal greens the enkf performance is improved significantly with respect to the second experiment i e system error modelled as an ar1 process at other locations and parameters the performance is either unaffected or slightly degraded in terms of water temperature however the results are significantly better than at all locations not shown in the experiments with other settings note that although water temperature is not included in the state vector it is still affected by the enkf update via the noise term of solar radiation these results indicate that with only 8 members it is difficult for the enkf to estimate the noise term of for example solar radiation accurately overall the results of the various experiments suggest to further investigate the approach for error modelling here the question is which variables at which locations should be included in the sources of uncertainty also this study has shown that the choice of error model structure has impact in the performance of data assimilation it is therefore recommended to investigate the use of different perturbation and error modelling settings and to search for a better definition of the state vector and which observed variables to assimilate 4 conclusions in this paper we present the application of various ensemble based data assimilation methods enkf enkf gs and dud enkf for improving the accuracy of water quality forecasting along the yeongsan river south korea the core points of this work elaborated on further below are twin experiments show improved model accuracy the performance of the three methods has only subtle differences upstream locations suffer from spurious correlation improvement at downstream locations is already achieved with a small ensemble size real world experiments show both improvement up to 30 for algal diatoms and deterioration in performance when applying data assimilation techniques the deterministic model seems to contain a significant systematic error hampering large improvements in the real world experiment the methods are generally applicable for other rivers but performance relies on the quality of the underlying model and measurements the comparison of the three different methods is performed in the framework of twin experiments where all the kalman filter parameters are specified equal to the true model that generated the synthetic observations in the experiments each method is run with an ensemble of 8 members and assimilates the synthetic observations phosphate and the three algal species of one assimilation station the twin experiments show that data assimilation has successfully improved the model accuracy at some locations the improvement can even reach more than 50 at the locations upstream of the assimilation location however the accuracy is less than the deterministic forecast this is mainly due to spurious correlation that occurs from estimating the error terms in the upstream area using a small ensemble 8 members the results of the twin experiments also indicate that the performance of the three methods has only subtle differences therefore one cannot argue that one method is superior to the others because all methods perform equally well for the water quality model in our study we chose to use the enkf already operational in wqfs for the subsequent twin and real world experiments we performed a twin experiment to investigate if assimilating measurements from all available 12 monitoring stations will further improve the results it turns out that due to the limited ensemble size the results are less accurate than when measurements from one station are assimilated in the view of operational purposes we have tested ensembles sizes of 8 16 32 and 64 members to explore its effect on the accuracy of the enkf expecting a more accurate result from larger ensemble this twin experiment revealed no clear trend that the filter accuracy is improved with ensemble size the correlation between state variables at the assimilation station and downstream locations is likely large so that it can be estimated accurately with a small ensemble as a result improvement in model results at downstream locations is already achieved with a small ensemble of 8 members nevertheless we expect that the accuracy will be improved when using a much larger ensemble but because of computational constraints in an operational setting we did not perform experiments with ensembles larger than 64 members in the real world experiments with enkf using real measurements and using exactly the same assimilation setting as in the twin experiment with one assimilation station the enkf has improved the accuracy of algal diatoms at most locations where largest improvement of about 30 is obtained at the assimilation station accuracy improvements are also obtained for algal greens and algal cyanobacteria for a number of locations however at many other locations the performance of the enkf is worse than the model output obtained without data assimilation this suggests that the correlation structure estimated from the ensemble is not representative for the real world situation we have investigated several other real world experiments to gain more understanding and to further improve the performance of the enkf based on our hypothesis that the method likely suffers from spurious correlation especially for estimating correlation between the three algal species and phosphate we have performed a real world experiment where measured phosphate is excluded from assimilation the results for this experiment are more accurate at many locations compared to enkf that assimilates both measured phosphate and chlorophyll a the experiment for investigating the impact of using covariance regularization and of modelling system error as white noise also showed a positive impact on the enkf accuracy for further study we recommend to investigate 1 a better definition of the state variables to be included in the data assimilation 2 a different error model structure and 3 the selection of perturbed variables an important step would be to also improve the deterministic model systematically the model seems to contain a significant systematic error a recalibration prior to data assimilation is expected to make the filter perform better while the ensemble data assimilation methods for improving water quality forecasting presented here were only tested for one south korean river and using one water quality model efdc the methods are generally applicable for other rivers and can be used in combination with other hydrodynamic water quality models the result of such an assimilation depends on the quality of the underlying model and the availability and quality of measurements as shown in this manuscript we expect that given the availability of high quality measurements and a good model state updating will provide the best estimate of the river system state and therefore will very likely improve forecast quality accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18202,the large consumption and discharge of sulfonamides sas have potentially induced antibiotic resistance genes posing inestimable threats to humans and ecosystems in the present study five sas with different substituents were regarded as target compounds to be degraded using the nonradical dominated peroxydisulfate pds activation process by the combination of 1o2 oxidation and direct electron transfer the degradation rates toxicities and pathways of sas largely varied with their substituents for instance sulfathiazole with five membered substituent had the highest degradation rate of 0 19 min 1 which was 3 8 times as the rate of sulfanilamide 0 05 min 1 without substituent then the theoretical calculation was adopted to further confirm that different substituents on the sas could influence the molecular orbital distribution and their stability thus resulting in the different removal rate of sas finally the products of different sas were concisely deduced to take insight into the effects of different substituents on sas degradation pathways it was demonstrated that the geometrical differences among various sas caused by the different substituents contributed to the different degradation pathways of sas representatively the special smiles type rearrangement pathway was occurred in the six membered sas instead of in the five membered sas which inversely resulted in the slower degradation rate of six membered sas than the five membered sas thus the present study provides a valuable insight into the effects of substituents on the degradation rate and transformation pathways of sas in the nonradical pds activation process graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamides substituents nonradical oxidation persulfate dft calculation pathways 1 introduction sulfonamides sas introduced in 1937 are the first effective antibiotics and the most widely used medicines to treat and prevent infections for both humans and animals because of their low cost high chemical stability and broad antibiotic activity doretto et al 2014 however sas cannot be completely metabolized by humans and animals and may be excreted into the aquatic and soil environment nguyen et al 2019 sun et al 2018 long term exposure to sas antibiotics may pose a huge risk on human health owing to the formation and prevalence of sulfonamide resistant genes chen et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 yan et al 2018 for example the national center for toxicological research declares that sulfamethazine is carcinogenic feng et al 2015 further the sulfonamide resistance genes are reported to be the most abundant resistant phenotype in the haihe river of china which may eventually enter humans to interrupt human metabolites dang et al 2017 generally the molecules of sas contain a core sulfanilamide structure and different n bound substituents of five or six membered heterocyclic rings such as isoxazole thiazole pyrimidine etc ji et al 2017 several studies have investigated the oxidative transformations of sas and indicated that the toxicity degradation rates and pathways of sas strongly depend on their substituents batista and nogueira 2012 soriano correa et al 2018 for example the ld50 half lethal dose to mouse of sulfathiazole stz and sulfanilamide sa was reported to be 400 mg kg 1 and 2900 mg kg 1 respectively data from the chemical toxicity database http www drugfuture com toxic which indicates that the substituents can largely influence the toxicity and threats of sas to environment or humans additionally there are some differences in degradation efficiency and mechanism between five membered and six membered sas for example boreen et al observed that the photodegradation rates of sas with six membered heterocyclic substituents were markedly lower than the rates of those containing five membered heterocyclic substituents which indicated that the type of the substituents could cause different reaction rate of sas annel boreen et al 2004 2005 with respect to the degradation pathways for five membered heterocyclic substituents the cleavage of the s n bond on the sulfanilamide group appeared to be the dominant cleavage ji et al 2015 yin et al 2017 in contrast the primary products formed in six membered sas degradation were identified as sulfur dioxide extrusion and smiles type rearrangement products annel boreen et al 2005 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 these results indicated that the sas with different substituents had different transformation pathways which might cause different influences on the aquatic environments thus it is hypothesized that the substituents on the core sulfanilamide structure can make differences in the reactivity and transformation pathways of different structured sas recently the nonradical activation of persulfate process is considered to be a potential process for pollutants removal in aquous environments duan et al 2018a this is because the nonradical dominated systems have several advantages in their adaption to diverse ph circumstances acidic neutral basic resistance to the ubiquitous inorganic ions selectivity to organic pollutants and moderate redox potential chen et al 2018 lee et al 2015 tang et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated that peroxydisulfate pds based nonradical oxidation process can be efficiently used to degrade many pollutants including dyes phenols and phamaceuticals in aquatic environments duan et al 2016 gao et al 2018 guan et al 2019 yin et al 2019 yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018b additionally the nonradical pds oxidation processes also showed good potential for sas degradation kang et al 2016 2018 bib kang et al 2018 bib kang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b however these studies mainly focused on the discussion of persulfate activation process and just took the sas as the normal targets instead of taking deep insight into the different degradation rate and mechanism induced by the various substituents whether the degradation rates and pathways of sas with different substituents in the nonradical pds oxidation processes differs from the traditional radical oxidation process is still unclear thus it is necessary to deeply analyze the effects of substituents on the sas degradation in the pds based nonradical oxidation process for the complete removal and transformation of sas from wastewater to our knowledge no study has comprehensively take insight into the effects of substituents on the reactivity reaction rate and associated mechanism of sas in pds based nonradical oxidation process thus the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the substituents on the degradation performance and pathways of sas by pds nonradical activation process and take insight into the reason and mechanism that cause these differences a nonradical dominated peroxydisulfate activation by reduced graphene oxide rgo system rgo pds was established and demonstrated five representative sas with different substituents including five membered heterocyclic groups sulfamethoxazole smx stz and six membered heterocyclic groups sulfamerazine smr sulfamethazine smt and one free of substituents sa were chosen to investigate the effects of different substituents on the degradation of sas in the pds nonradacal oxidation process firstly the differences in the degradation rate of sas were found to depend on the type of substituents then the dft calculation was adopted to analyze the differences in charge distribution and the reactive sites of various sas to further demonstrate the substituents affecting the reactivity of sas finally the degradation pathways of five sas were concisely proposed to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the sas sa smx stz smr smt over 98 purity pds k2s2o8 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline dmpo were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received without further purification the structures and the relevant data of chosen sas are presented in table 1 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp 99 were purchased from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd methanol ethanol tert butanol tba acetonitrile and formic acid of hplc grade were purchased from tedia and ficher other chemicals of analytical grade or better were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 activation process and analysis the reduced graphene oxide rgo was chosen as the activator for pds in nonradical oxidation by the metal free catalysis duan et al 2018b the preparation and characterization of rgo were descripted in test s1 and fig s1 all the degradation experiments were performed in beakers containing 100 ml solution on magnetic stirrers each run was performed in duplicate and the average values were adopted to ensure reproducibility batch experiments were carried out at a pds concentration of 0 6 mm an rgo dosage of 0 1 g l 1 an initial sas concentration 40 μm and initial ph 5 0 adjusted by 0 1 m of h2so4 and naoh without buffer first the rgo was added into the solution containing the sas and was stirred for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium then the activation process of sas degradation was started by adding a certain amount of pds at each given interval the target reaction solution 1 0 ml was withdrawn immediately quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate and filtered into a vial for uplc analysis according to the methods in our previous study yin et al 2018b the oxidized products were firstly extracted by the solid phase extraction spe process lindsey et al 2001 then the target compounds and their substructures were analyzed using a lc triple tof 5600 ms with an electron spray ionization esi interface the detailed methods of uplc lc ms and spe process are shown in text s2 the nonradical oxidation process was demonstrated by the scavenger quenching studies epr spectra determination and electrochemical analysis 2 3 computational methods theoretical calculations were adopted to reveal the reason for different degradation performance and mechanism of sas caused by the different substituents in the rgo pds system geometry optimization of the sas was simulated using the density functional theory dft method gurkan et al 2012 yin et al 2017 2018a bib yin et al 2017 bib yin et al 2018a the dft calculations on the energy and nbo charge were carried out in a gaussian 09 software using the method of b3lyp 6 31 g combined with the iefpcm solvent model the electron density in homo lumo their energies and the energy gap between homo and lumo δe e lumo e homo are important stability indices which can aid in explaining the effect of the different substituents on sas degradation performance chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019a higher homo energy indicates higher electrophilic reaction activities while lower lumo energy means higher nucleophilic reaction ability in addition a molecule with a smaller gap between homo and lumo is more reactive luo et al 2018 thus the energies of different structured sas are firstly compared to illustrate their different structure reactivity furthermore the different charge distribution of sas caused by different substituents are adopted to predict the possible active sites of different sas by the rgo pds process which gives theoretical direction in proposing the degradation pathways and searching for the different pathways of sas caused by different substituents thus the calculation results can help reveal the differences and similarities in the degradation mechanism of five sas with different substituents 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of sas degradation in the rgo pds process batch experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation performance of five sas sa smx stz smr smt in the rgo pds process all the five sas remained stable in the solution by the inactivated pds results shown in fig s2 a the adsorption equilibrium of the sas on the rgo was reached in 30 min before the access of the pds and the results of adsorption was shown in fig s2 b however in the presence of both rgo and pds the five sas were efficiently degraded in 30 min fig 1 a for instance under the same reaction condition pds 0 6 mm rgo 0 1 g l 1 sas 0 40 μm ph 5 0 and time 30 min the degradation efficiencies of the five sas were all higher than 80 therein the degradation efficiency of sulfathiazole stz was the highest and reached to 99 7 these results indicated that the rgo pds could efficiently removed sas to further confirm the oxidation capacity and application potential of rgo pds on sas degradation smt was chosen as a case to study the effects of rgo dosage pds concentration initial ph and natural inorganic ions in water on the degradation performance discussed in test s3 and shown in fig s3 the results showed the rgo pds process have strong oxidation ability towards pollutants wide adaptability under different environmental conditions and free of natural ions inhibition which indicated that rgo pds process was a stable and efficient technology that potential for the real wastewater treatment additionally to analyze the fate of the sas transformation in the rgo pds system the mineralization of sas wastewater was studied using toc removal rate it can be seen that all the removal rates were greater than 80 of which the highest was 90 1 for stz fig s2 c these results indicated that rgo was appropriate for pds activation not only showing high performance for sas degradation but also enhancing the sas wastewater mineralization to achieve safe transformation thus next the oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process needs to be deeply revealed to analyze the reason for its high performance for sas degradation 3 2 oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process to identify the oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process epr experiments trapped by dmpo and temp were conducted to determine the possible oxidizing species the characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 peaks were observed in the epr spectrum trapped by dmpo in the rgo pds process fig 2 a suggesting that the oh and so4 might be the possible reactive oxidation species generated in rgo pds process in addition temp was chosen as the trapping agent for 1o2 and the characteristic signals of the three line esr spectrum with equal intensities fig 2 b indicate that 1o2 may be another reactive oxidation specie in the rgo pds process thus the epr detection results indicated that the oh so4 and 1o2 might jointly contribute to sas decomposition by rgo pds process to determine the respective contribution of the above mentioned species oh so4 and 1o2 to sas degradation smt was taken as an example to conduct the quenching tests using different scavengers methanol tert butanol tba and nan3 and the analytical method was referred to in our previous study yin et al 2018b fig 2 c showed that the addition of methanol or tba at 0 3 m or 0 6 m had no effect on the sas degradation the degradation curves with methanol and tba were almost the same with the control which indicated that oh and so4 radicals did not contribute to the removal of sas thus the sas degradation in rgo pds process was attributed to the nonradical oxidation of the process significantly nan3 0 6 12 mm could largely inhibit smt degradation which suggested 1o2 was important oxidative specie in the rgo pds process and confirmed the rgo pds process was a nonradical dominated oxidation process to further verify the nonradical oxidation of the rgo pds process ki was used as another radical quencher in the rgo pds system to exclude the contribution of the radicals bounded on the rgo surface because ki can quickly react with the surface bound free radicals to quench the sas degradation process chen et al 2016 feng et al 2017 it can be seen from the results that the ki 5 mm showed a little inhibition on the sas degradation in the rgo pds system which indicated that the radicals bounded on the rgo surface had limited contribution to sas degradation in the rgo pds system these results further demonstrated that the nonradical oxidation process was the dominant oxidation pathway of the rgo pds process that contributes to the sas degradation however nan3 cannot completely quench the oxidation of smt in the rgo pds process which indicates that there may be another nonradical pathway in the rgo pds activation process benefitting the degradation of smt according to the results of recent studies yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a it was concluded that the possible nonradical oxidation pathways of the rgo pds activation process included the following three aspects 1 pds direct oxidation 2 singlet oxygen 1o2 oxidation 3 rgo mediated direct electron transfer between pds and sas pathway 1 had been excluded and pathway 2 had been demonstrated by the above experimental results thus the pathway 3 was proposed to be another nonradical oxidation pathway of the rgo pds activation process the electron transfer nonradical pathway was further identified by electrochemical measurements a smaller semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 2 d demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance of the rgo pds smt system was significantly decreased compared to that of rgo pds moreover an obvious increase of current on the carbon paper electrode occurred during linear sweep voltammetry fig 2 e recorded upon the addition of smt suggesting that a current flow formed from sas to the metastable reactive complex between pds and rgo these results indicated that electron transfer was another important nonradical oxidation pathway of rgo pds activation process this was also found in the research of zhu and lee on carbon materials for pds activation processes yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a above all the rgo pds process was a nonradical dominated oxidation process combined the 1o2 oxidation and rgo mediated direct electron transfer between pds and sas which contributed to the efficient degradation of sas compared with the traditional radical oxidation processes the nonradical processes have the advantages of high selectivity and moderate reaction conditions which might result in the different degradation rates and pathways for various pollutants 3 3 differences in the degradation rates of sas according to the above results the five different sas can be efficiently removed the rgo pds process indicates that the oxidation on the core structure of sulfanilamide plays important role in the sas degradation process for their similar structure h however it can be seen there are some evident differences from the results that differences exist in the sas degradation efficiency from 80 to 99 7 and the degradation rates of the five sas are also not uniform all these five sas have very similar structures and contain the same sulfanilamide structure but have different substituents thus it is hypothesized that the different substituents on the sas can result in varying reactivity of sas which would cause different removal rate and performance of sas degradation by the nonradical rgo pds process to elucidate the above hypothesis the reaction kinetics of sas were further revealed through a pseudo first order reaction model which is shown below 1 ln c 0 c t k obs t where k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate min 1 t represents the reaction time and c 0 and c t stand for the sas concentration at 0 min and t min respectively linear relationships were discovered with high regression coefficients through kinetic modeling analysis fig 1 b the observed rates k obs of sa smx stz smr and smt by the rgo pds process were calculated to be 0 05 0 10 0 19 0 09 and 0 09 min 1 respectively under the same conditions the order of the degradation rate is stz smx smt smr sa sa an h atom substituted on the core sulfanilamide structure is removed with the lowest rate while the rates of sas with substituents smx stz smr and smt are much faster than that of sa for instance the observed rate of stz was 3 8 times to that of sa respectively which indicated the substituents could promote the decomposition of the sas in addition the degradation rates of the six membered heterocyclic substituted sas smr and smt were lower than that of stz that containing five membered heterocyclic substituent which are consistent with boreen s research on the photodegradation of sas annel boreen et al 2004 2005 interestingly the six membered heterocyclic substituted sas smr and smt almost have the same value of reaction rate while the differences of rate value can be clearly found for five membered heterocyclic substituented sas e g smx and stz these results suggested that the substituents have a large influence on the degradation rate of sas molecules thus it is hypothesized that the substituents on the core sulfanilamide structure can make differences in the reactivity reactive sites and pathways of different structured sas therefore next theoretical calculations are firstly used to analyze the effects of different substituents on the reactivity of sas 3 4 effects of the substituents on the reactivity of sas the electron density in homo and lumo and the energy gap between homo and lumo energy δe e lumo e homo are important stability indexes which can be used to explain the effect of the different substituents on sas degradation performance table 2 shows the homo and lumo distribution of sas it can be seen from the results that there are many differences in homo and lumo distribution among sas an uniform electron distributions across the aromatic portions of the molecules were observed from the homos of sa smx smr and smt however for stz the homo distribution was transferred to the thiazole ring additionally the lumo of sa smx and stz also mainly were distributed to the aromatic ring while the lumo distribution of smr and smt changed to the substituted heterocyclic rings these changes in electron distribution would cause the differences in the reactivity of the molecule and their products distribution for example the six membered sas smr and smt showed similar homo and lumo distribution which resulted in the comparative degradation in rgo pds process however the homo and lumo distribution were different in the five membered sas smx and stz which induced the large difference in the degradation rate between smx and stz by rgo pds process in addition according to frontier molecular orbital fmo theory the energy gap between homo and lumo δe e lumo e homo are important stability indices which can aid in explaining the activity and stability of the molecules a smaller value of δe indicates the greater reactivity of the molecule the δe energies of five sas are summarized in table 2 it can be seen from the results that the largest δe was sa while the smallest was stz so stz had the fastest degradation rate and sa had the slowest the comparative δe values of smx smr and smt induced similar degradation rates generally compounds with electron donating substituents are more susceptible to be oxidized than those with electron withdrawing substituents hsu et al 2018 the s atom on the substituents can give more electron density to the sulfanilamide bond thus resulting in the stz being more reactive than smx these results indicated that the activity and stability of sas were relative to the energy gap between their homo and lumo and the degradation rates of the sas showed an inverse relationship with δe moreover the difference in the gap energy among the sas was attributed to the change in the homo and lumo distribution on sas that was caused by the different substituents on sas thus it is demonstrated that the substituents can influence the electron distribution and stability of the sas molecules resulting in the difference in sas degradation rate of sas by the rgo pds process 3 5 prediction of active sites on the sas then the possible reaction sites of five different sas are predicted to reveal the effects of substituents on the reactive sites of different structured sas theoretical calculations were employed to predict the possible active sites of sas in the rgo pds process to give directions for proposing the accurate degradation pathways of sas the rgo pds process is a nonradical oxidation process dominated by the combination of 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer and it has been known that 1o2 would selectively react toward electron donating groups on sas and the electron transfer process was also excited at the electron rich sites of sas gao et al 2018 thus the electron rich sites on sas would be the possible active sites attacked during the rgo pds process and charge distribution was adopted as the descriptor the optimized molecules and calculated charge distribution of five sas are shown in fig 3 and table s1 the 8n 10n 9o and 11o atoms were the similar electron rich sites on sas which might be the sites susceptible to attack in the rgo pds process however the charge values of the 8n and 10n atoms on the sas with substituents were much larger than that on the sa which might induce the degradation rate of sa is much lower than that sas with substituents additionally some nitrogen or carbon atoms on the substituted rings were also the electron rich sites the electron rich sites were distributed on the substituted rings of the sas which indicated that more reactive sites were existed and might also induce the sas with substituent to degrade faster than the sa without substituent moreover these reactive sites on the substituent ring were also not the same which might result in the different degradation rates and pathways of sas this finding further demonstrated that the substituents on sas could attract electrons and influence the charge distribution and stability of sas thus resulting in the different degradation rate of different sas 3 6 effects of the substituents on the degradation pathways of sas finally the oxidized products were concisely determined by using the lc tof ms esi both positive and negative mode and the degradation pathways of five sas were proposed detailedly to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents structural assignments of intermediates were performed by total product ion scans according to the accurate m z values and corresponding ms spectra the detailed data and proposed structures of the products and their ms spectra are shown in tables s2 s6 and figs s4 s8 according to the proposed structure of the possible oxidized products the possible degradation pathways of sas were deduced in fig 4 and fig s9 it can be seen from the results that the same degradation pathways of the five sas were the oxidation of 8n and 10n which contributed to the high degradation rate of sas in the rgo pds process however the five sas have some particular degradation pathways caused by the effects of the substituents compared to sa without substituent other sas with substituents smx stz smr and smt have another pathway through the oxidation of substituted heterocyclic rings which promoted the degradation rate of the sas with substituents more importantly the six membered smt and smr were proposed to decompose through a special so2 extrusion pathway that did not find in the pathways of five membered smx and stz and the sa free of substituent taking smt as an example the special pathway was initiated by an anilinyl radical cation of smt via an electron transfer mechanism fan et al 2015 thereafter the aromatic carbon adjacent to the s n bond in the radical cation possessed a strong positive charge and could be subjected to intermolecular nucleophilic attack while one of the pyrimidine nitrogen served as a nucleophile such an attack led to the intermolecular rearrangement smiles type thus generating an so2 extrusion product the transformation mechanism of the smiles type rearrangement of smt is shown in fig 4 the oxidized products generated via the oxidation of smt a representative sa with six membered heterocyclic ring and smx a representative sa with five membered heterocyclic ring were compared representatively p 214 with m z 199 0979 and chromatographic retention time at 1 720 min were proposed as the product generated from the so2 extrusion in the six membered smt molecule table s6 and fig 4 respectively it is interesting to note that so2 extrusion was not observed in smx with the five membered ring this is mainly attributed to the geometric differences of sas caused by different substituents it can be seen that the so2 extrusion product mainly occurred on the aniline ring c holding the s and the n on the substituents in the five membered ring the distances of the n geometrically away from the aniline ring c holding the s were 4 09 in smx respectively which were longer than the six membered ring of the distance in smt 3 38 between the n of the pyrimidine ring and the aniline ring c holding the s additionally the so2n cn angle in smx is about 133 1 whereas it is 26 1 in smt as measured in the optimized structures see fig 3 thus the further distance and larger angle of the five membered sas would cause too large barrier for the formation of the radical cation of sas to initiate the smiles type rearrangement pathway feng et al 2019 it should be noted that the geometrical differences among various sas are attributed to the different substituents on sas thus it is demonstrated that the substituents on sas can affect the degradation pathways of sas additionally it was reported that the nh so2 r oxidation in sas is faster than the so2 extrusion thus the degradation rate of the sas with the pathway of so2 extrusion might be slower than that without so2 extrusion feng et al 2019 it is inversely explained the reason why the six membered sas has slower degradation rates than five membered sas which is because the six membered sas is removed through a slower so2 extrusion pathway than the five membered sas above all the different substituents on sas played important roles in both the removal rates and the transformation pathways of sas by the rgo pds process simultaneously the different transformation pathways might also inversely influence the removal rate of sas the schematic illustration of the mechanism in the effects of substituents on sas degradation in the rgo pds process is proposed in fig 5 4 conclusions in summary this is the first study toward a comprehensive understanding of the effects of different substituents on the degradation rate and pathways of five sas by pds nonradical oxidation process firstly the differences in the degradation rate of sas are found to depend on the type of substituents the results indicated that the existence of the substituents on sas could promote and influence the degradation rate of sas then the dft calculation is adopted to analyze the differences in charge distribution and the reactive sites of various sas to further demonstrate the substituents affecting the reactivity of sas as confirmed by theoretical calculation the changes in the homo and lumo distribution of sas by different substituents caused the differences in the reactivity of molecules and degradation rate of the reaction finally the degradation pathways of five sas are concisely proposed to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents the geometrical differences among various sas caused by different substituents contributed to the different transformation pathways of sas the six membered sas were degraded through a special so2 extrusion pathway which inversely resulted in the slower degradation rate of six membered sas than the five membered sas this finding may help predict the reactivity and rates of other sas with different types of substructures these analyses from the point view of the effects of substituents on the reactivity and pathways of sas in this study can possibly provide direction for the degradation rates and pathways of sas in other

18202,the large consumption and discharge of sulfonamides sas have potentially induced antibiotic resistance genes posing inestimable threats to humans and ecosystems in the present study five sas with different substituents were regarded as target compounds to be degraded using the nonradical dominated peroxydisulfate pds activation process by the combination of 1o2 oxidation and direct electron transfer the degradation rates toxicities and pathways of sas largely varied with their substituents for instance sulfathiazole with five membered substituent had the highest degradation rate of 0 19 min 1 which was 3 8 times as the rate of sulfanilamide 0 05 min 1 without substituent then the theoretical calculation was adopted to further confirm that different substituents on the sas could influence the molecular orbital distribution and their stability thus resulting in the different removal rate of sas finally the products of different sas were concisely deduced to take insight into the effects of different substituents on sas degradation pathways it was demonstrated that the geometrical differences among various sas caused by the different substituents contributed to the different degradation pathways of sas representatively the special smiles type rearrangement pathway was occurred in the six membered sas instead of in the five membered sas which inversely resulted in the slower degradation rate of six membered sas than the five membered sas thus the present study provides a valuable insight into the effects of substituents on the degradation rate and transformation pathways of sas in the nonradical pds activation process graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamides substituents nonradical oxidation persulfate dft calculation pathways 1 introduction sulfonamides sas introduced in 1937 are the first effective antibiotics and the most widely used medicines to treat and prevent infections for both humans and animals because of their low cost high chemical stability and broad antibiotic activity doretto et al 2014 however sas cannot be completely metabolized by humans and animals and may be excreted into the aquatic and soil environment nguyen et al 2019 sun et al 2018 long term exposure to sas antibiotics may pose a huge risk on human health owing to the formation and prevalence of sulfonamide resistant genes chen et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 yan et al 2018 for example the national center for toxicological research declares that sulfamethazine is carcinogenic feng et al 2015 further the sulfonamide resistance genes are reported to be the most abundant resistant phenotype in the haihe river of china which may eventually enter humans to interrupt human metabolites dang et al 2017 generally the molecules of sas contain a core sulfanilamide structure and different n bound substituents of five or six membered heterocyclic rings such as isoxazole thiazole pyrimidine etc ji et al 2017 several studies have investigated the oxidative transformations of sas and indicated that the toxicity degradation rates and pathways of sas strongly depend on their substituents batista and nogueira 2012 soriano correa et al 2018 for example the ld50 half lethal dose to mouse of sulfathiazole stz and sulfanilamide sa was reported to be 400 mg kg 1 and 2900 mg kg 1 respectively data from the chemical toxicity database http www drugfuture com toxic which indicates that the substituents can largely influence the toxicity and threats of sas to environment or humans additionally there are some differences in degradation efficiency and mechanism between five membered and six membered sas for example boreen et al observed that the photodegradation rates of sas with six membered heterocyclic substituents were markedly lower than the rates of those containing five membered heterocyclic substituents which indicated that the type of the substituents could cause different reaction rate of sas annel boreen et al 2004 2005 with respect to the degradation pathways for five membered heterocyclic substituents the cleavage of the s n bond on the sulfanilamide group appeared to be the dominant cleavage ji et al 2015 yin et al 2017 in contrast the primary products formed in six membered sas degradation were identified as sulfur dioxide extrusion and smiles type rearrangement products annel boreen et al 2005 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 these results indicated that the sas with different substituents had different transformation pathways which might cause different influences on the aquatic environments thus it is hypothesized that the substituents on the core sulfanilamide structure can make differences in the reactivity and transformation pathways of different structured sas recently the nonradical activation of persulfate process is considered to be a potential process for pollutants removal in aquous environments duan et al 2018a this is because the nonradical dominated systems have several advantages in their adaption to diverse ph circumstances acidic neutral basic resistance to the ubiquitous inorganic ions selectivity to organic pollutants and moderate redox potential chen et al 2018 lee et al 2015 tang et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated that peroxydisulfate pds based nonradical oxidation process can be efficiently used to degrade many pollutants including dyes phenols and phamaceuticals in aquatic environments duan et al 2016 gao et al 2018 guan et al 2019 yin et al 2019 yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018b additionally the nonradical pds oxidation processes also showed good potential for sas degradation kang et al 2016 2018 bib kang et al 2018 bib kang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b however these studies mainly focused on the discussion of persulfate activation process and just took the sas as the normal targets instead of taking deep insight into the different degradation rate and mechanism induced by the various substituents whether the degradation rates and pathways of sas with different substituents in the nonradical pds oxidation processes differs from the traditional radical oxidation process is still unclear thus it is necessary to deeply analyze the effects of substituents on the sas degradation in the pds based nonradical oxidation process for the complete removal and transformation of sas from wastewater to our knowledge no study has comprehensively take insight into the effects of substituents on the reactivity reaction rate and associated mechanism of sas in pds based nonradical oxidation process thus the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the substituents on the degradation performance and pathways of sas by pds nonradical activation process and take insight into the reason and mechanism that cause these differences a nonradical dominated peroxydisulfate activation by reduced graphene oxide rgo system rgo pds was established and demonstrated five representative sas with different substituents including five membered heterocyclic groups sulfamethoxazole smx stz and six membered heterocyclic groups sulfamerazine smr sulfamethazine smt and one free of substituents sa were chosen to investigate the effects of different substituents on the degradation of sas in the pds nonradacal oxidation process firstly the differences in the degradation rate of sas were found to depend on the type of substituents then the dft calculation was adopted to analyze the differences in charge distribution and the reactive sites of various sas to further demonstrate the substituents affecting the reactivity of sas finally the degradation pathways of five sas were concisely proposed to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the sas sa smx stz smr smt over 98 purity pds k2s2o8 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline dmpo were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received without further purification the structures and the relevant data of chosen sas are presented in table 1 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp 99 were purchased from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd methanol ethanol tert butanol tba acetonitrile and formic acid of hplc grade were purchased from tedia and ficher other chemicals of analytical grade or better were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 activation process and analysis the reduced graphene oxide rgo was chosen as the activator for pds in nonradical oxidation by the metal free catalysis duan et al 2018b the preparation and characterization of rgo were descripted in test s1 and fig s1 all the degradation experiments were performed in beakers containing 100 ml solution on magnetic stirrers each run was performed in duplicate and the average values were adopted to ensure reproducibility batch experiments were carried out at a pds concentration of 0 6 mm an rgo dosage of 0 1 g l 1 an initial sas concentration 40 μm and initial ph 5 0 adjusted by 0 1 m of h2so4 and naoh without buffer first the rgo was added into the solution containing the sas and was stirred for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium then the activation process of sas degradation was started by adding a certain amount of pds at each given interval the target reaction solution 1 0 ml was withdrawn immediately quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate and filtered into a vial for uplc analysis according to the methods in our previous study yin et al 2018b the oxidized products were firstly extracted by the solid phase extraction spe process lindsey et al 2001 then the target compounds and their substructures were analyzed using a lc triple tof 5600 ms with an electron spray ionization esi interface the detailed methods of uplc lc ms and spe process are shown in text s2 the nonradical oxidation process was demonstrated by the scavenger quenching studies epr spectra determination and electrochemical analysis 2 3 computational methods theoretical calculations were adopted to reveal the reason for different degradation performance and mechanism of sas caused by the different substituents in the rgo pds system geometry optimization of the sas was simulated using the density functional theory dft method gurkan et al 2012 yin et al 2017 2018a bib yin et al 2017 bib yin et al 2018a the dft calculations on the energy and nbo charge were carried out in a gaussian 09 software using the method of b3lyp 6 31 g combined with the iefpcm solvent model the electron density in homo lumo their energies and the energy gap between homo and lumo δe e lumo e homo are important stability indices which can aid in explaining the effect of the different substituents on sas degradation performance chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019a higher homo energy indicates higher electrophilic reaction activities while lower lumo energy means higher nucleophilic reaction ability in addition a molecule with a smaller gap between homo and lumo is more reactive luo et al 2018 thus the energies of different structured sas are firstly compared to illustrate their different structure reactivity furthermore the different charge distribution of sas caused by different substituents are adopted to predict the possible active sites of different sas by the rgo pds process which gives theoretical direction in proposing the degradation pathways and searching for the different pathways of sas caused by different substituents thus the calculation results can help reveal the differences and similarities in the degradation mechanism of five sas with different substituents 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of sas degradation in the rgo pds process batch experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation performance of five sas sa smx stz smr smt in the rgo pds process all the five sas remained stable in the solution by the inactivated pds results shown in fig s2 a the adsorption equilibrium of the sas on the rgo was reached in 30 min before the access of the pds and the results of adsorption was shown in fig s2 b however in the presence of both rgo and pds the five sas were efficiently degraded in 30 min fig 1 a for instance under the same reaction condition pds 0 6 mm rgo 0 1 g l 1 sas 0 40 μm ph 5 0 and time 30 min the degradation efficiencies of the five sas were all higher than 80 therein the degradation efficiency of sulfathiazole stz was the highest and reached to 99 7 these results indicated that the rgo pds could efficiently removed sas to further confirm the oxidation capacity and application potential of rgo pds on sas degradation smt was chosen as a case to study the effects of rgo dosage pds concentration initial ph and natural inorganic ions in water on the degradation performance discussed in test s3 and shown in fig s3 the results showed the rgo pds process have strong oxidation ability towards pollutants wide adaptability under different environmental conditions and free of natural ions inhibition which indicated that rgo pds process was a stable and efficient technology that potential for the real wastewater treatment additionally to analyze the fate of the sas transformation in the rgo pds system the mineralization of sas wastewater was studied using toc removal rate it can be seen that all the removal rates were greater than 80 of which the highest was 90 1 for stz fig s2 c these results indicated that rgo was appropriate for pds activation not only showing high performance for sas degradation but also enhancing the sas wastewater mineralization to achieve safe transformation thus next the oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process needs to be deeply revealed to analyze the reason for its high performance for sas degradation 3 2 oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process to identify the oxidation mechanism of the rgo pds process epr experiments trapped by dmpo and temp were conducted to determine the possible oxidizing species the characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 peaks were observed in the epr spectrum trapped by dmpo in the rgo pds process fig 2 a suggesting that the oh and so4 might be the possible reactive oxidation species generated in rgo pds process in addition temp was chosen as the trapping agent for 1o2 and the characteristic signals of the three line esr spectrum with equal intensities fig 2 b indicate that 1o2 may be another reactive oxidation specie in the rgo pds process thus the epr detection results indicated that the oh so4 and 1o2 might jointly contribute to sas decomposition by rgo pds process to determine the respective contribution of the above mentioned species oh so4 and 1o2 to sas degradation smt was taken as an example to conduct the quenching tests using different scavengers methanol tert butanol tba and nan3 and the analytical method was referred to in our previous study yin et al 2018b fig 2 c showed that the addition of methanol or tba at 0 3 m or 0 6 m had no effect on the sas degradation the degradation curves with methanol and tba were almost the same with the control which indicated that oh and so4 radicals did not contribute to the removal of sas thus the sas degradation in rgo pds process was attributed to the nonradical oxidation of the process significantly nan3 0 6 12 mm could largely inhibit smt degradation which suggested 1o2 was important oxidative specie in the rgo pds process and confirmed the rgo pds process was a nonradical dominated oxidation process to further verify the nonradical oxidation of the rgo pds process ki was used as another radical quencher in the rgo pds system to exclude the contribution of the radicals bounded on the rgo surface because ki can quickly react with the surface bound free radicals to quench the sas degradation process chen et al 2016 feng et al 2017 it can be seen from the results that the ki 5 mm showed a little inhibition on the sas degradation in the rgo pds system which indicated that the radicals bounded on the rgo surface had limited contribution to sas degradation in the rgo pds system these results further demonstrated that the nonradical oxidation process was the dominant oxidation pathway of the rgo pds process that contributes to the sas degradation however nan3 cannot completely quench the oxidation of smt in the rgo pds process which indicates that there may be another nonradical pathway in the rgo pds activation process benefitting the degradation of smt according to the results of recent studies yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a it was concluded that the possible nonradical oxidation pathways of the rgo pds activation process included the following three aspects 1 pds direct oxidation 2 singlet oxygen 1o2 oxidation 3 rgo mediated direct electron transfer between pds and sas pathway 1 had been excluded and pathway 2 had been demonstrated by the above experimental results thus the pathway 3 was proposed to be another nonradical oxidation pathway of the rgo pds activation process the electron transfer nonradical pathway was further identified by electrochemical measurements a smaller semicircle diameter in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 2 d demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance of the rgo pds smt system was significantly decreased compared to that of rgo pds moreover an obvious increase of current on the carbon paper electrode occurred during linear sweep voltammetry fig 2 e recorded upon the addition of smt suggesting that a current flow formed from sas to the metastable reactive complex between pds and rgo these results indicated that electron transfer was another important nonradical oxidation pathway of rgo pds activation process this was also found in the research of zhu and lee on carbon materials for pds activation processes yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2018a above all the rgo pds process was a nonradical dominated oxidation process combined the 1o2 oxidation and rgo mediated direct electron transfer between pds and sas which contributed to the efficient degradation of sas compared with the traditional radical oxidation processes the nonradical processes have the advantages of high selectivity and moderate reaction conditions which might result in the different degradation rates and pathways for various pollutants 3 3 differences in the degradation rates of sas according to the above results the five different sas can be efficiently removed the rgo pds process indicates that the oxidation on the core structure of sulfanilamide plays important role in the sas degradation process for their similar structure h however it can be seen there are some evident differences from the results that differences exist in the sas degradation efficiency from 80 to 99 7 and the degradation rates of the five sas are also not uniform all these five sas have very similar structures and contain the same sulfanilamide structure but have different substituents thus it is hypothesized that the different substituents on the sas can result in varying reactivity of sas which would cause different removal rate and performance of sas degradation by the nonradical rgo pds process to elucidate the above hypothesis the reaction kinetics of sas were further revealed through a pseudo first order reaction model which is shown below 1 ln c 0 c t k obs t where k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate min 1 t represents the reaction time and c 0 and c t stand for the sas concentration at 0 min and t min respectively linear relationships were discovered with high regression coefficients through kinetic modeling analysis fig 1 b the observed rates k obs of sa smx stz smr and smt by the rgo pds process were calculated to be 0 05 0 10 0 19 0 09 and 0 09 min 1 respectively under the same conditions the order of the degradation rate is stz smx smt smr sa sa an h atom substituted on the core sulfanilamide structure is removed with the lowest rate while the rates of sas with substituents smx stz smr and smt are much faster than that of sa for instance the observed rate of stz was 3 8 times to that of sa respectively which indicated the substituents could promote the decomposition of the sas in addition the degradation rates of the six membered heterocyclic substituted sas smr and smt were lower than that of stz that containing five membered heterocyclic substituent which are consistent with boreen s research on the photodegradation of sas annel boreen et al 2004 2005 interestingly the six membered heterocyclic substituted sas smr and smt almost have the same value of reaction rate while the differences of rate value can be clearly found for five membered heterocyclic substituented sas e g smx and stz these results suggested that the substituents have a large influence on the degradation rate of sas molecules thus it is hypothesized that the substituents on the core sulfanilamide structure can make differences in the reactivity reactive sites and pathways of different structured sas therefore next theoretical calculations are firstly used to analyze the effects of different substituents on the reactivity of sas 3 4 effects of the substituents on the reactivity of sas the electron density in homo and lumo and the energy gap between homo and lumo energy δe e lumo e homo are important stability indexes which can be used to explain the effect of the different substituents on sas degradation performance table 2 shows the homo and lumo distribution of sas it can be seen from the results that there are many differences in homo and lumo distribution among sas an uniform electron distributions across the aromatic portions of the molecules were observed from the homos of sa smx smr and smt however for stz the homo distribution was transferred to the thiazole ring additionally the lumo of sa smx and stz also mainly were distributed to the aromatic ring while the lumo distribution of smr and smt changed to the substituted heterocyclic rings these changes in electron distribution would cause the differences in the reactivity of the molecule and their products distribution for example the six membered sas smr and smt showed similar homo and lumo distribution which resulted in the comparative degradation in rgo pds process however the homo and lumo distribution were different in the five membered sas smx and stz which induced the large difference in the degradation rate between smx and stz by rgo pds process in addition according to frontier molecular orbital fmo theory the energy gap between homo and lumo δe e lumo e homo are important stability indices which can aid in explaining the activity and stability of the molecules a smaller value of δe indicates the greater reactivity of the molecule the δe energies of five sas are summarized in table 2 it can be seen from the results that the largest δe was sa while the smallest was stz so stz had the fastest degradation rate and sa had the slowest the comparative δe values of smx smr and smt induced similar degradation rates generally compounds with electron donating substituents are more susceptible to be oxidized than those with electron withdrawing substituents hsu et al 2018 the s atom on the substituents can give more electron density to the sulfanilamide bond thus resulting in the stz being more reactive than smx these results indicated that the activity and stability of sas were relative to the energy gap between their homo and lumo and the degradation rates of the sas showed an inverse relationship with δe moreover the difference in the gap energy among the sas was attributed to the change in the homo and lumo distribution on sas that was caused by the different substituents on sas thus it is demonstrated that the substituents can influence the electron distribution and stability of the sas molecules resulting in the difference in sas degradation rate of sas by the rgo pds process 3 5 prediction of active sites on the sas then the possible reaction sites of five different sas are predicted to reveal the effects of substituents on the reactive sites of different structured sas theoretical calculations were employed to predict the possible active sites of sas in the rgo pds process to give directions for proposing the accurate degradation pathways of sas the rgo pds process is a nonradical oxidation process dominated by the combination of 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer and it has been known that 1o2 would selectively react toward electron donating groups on sas and the electron transfer process was also excited at the electron rich sites of sas gao et al 2018 thus the electron rich sites on sas would be the possible active sites attacked during the rgo pds process and charge distribution was adopted as the descriptor the optimized molecules and calculated charge distribution of five sas are shown in fig 3 and table s1 the 8n 10n 9o and 11o atoms were the similar electron rich sites on sas which might be the sites susceptible to attack in the rgo pds process however the charge values of the 8n and 10n atoms on the sas with substituents were much larger than that on the sa which might induce the degradation rate of sa is much lower than that sas with substituents additionally some nitrogen or carbon atoms on the substituted rings were also the electron rich sites the electron rich sites were distributed on the substituted rings of the sas which indicated that more reactive sites were existed and might also induce the sas with substituent to degrade faster than the sa without substituent moreover these reactive sites on the substituent ring were also not the same which might result in the different degradation rates and pathways of sas this finding further demonstrated that the substituents on sas could attract electrons and influence the charge distribution and stability of sas thus resulting in the different degradation rate of different sas 3 6 effects of the substituents on the degradation pathways of sas finally the oxidized products were concisely determined by using the lc tof ms esi both positive and negative mode and the degradation pathways of five sas were proposed detailedly to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents structural assignments of intermediates were performed by total product ion scans according to the accurate m z values and corresponding ms spectra the detailed data and proposed structures of the products and their ms spectra are shown in tables s2 s6 and figs s4 s8 according to the proposed structure of the possible oxidized products the possible degradation pathways of sas were deduced in fig 4 and fig s9 it can be seen from the results that the same degradation pathways of the five sas were the oxidation of 8n and 10n which contributed to the high degradation rate of sas in the rgo pds process however the five sas have some particular degradation pathways caused by the effects of the substituents compared to sa without substituent other sas with substituents smx stz smr and smt have another pathway through the oxidation of substituted heterocyclic rings which promoted the degradation rate of the sas with substituents more importantly the six membered smt and smr were proposed to decompose through a special so2 extrusion pathway that did not find in the pathways of five membered smx and stz and the sa free of substituent taking smt as an example the special pathway was initiated by an anilinyl radical cation of smt via an electron transfer mechanism fan et al 2015 thereafter the aromatic carbon adjacent to the s n bond in the radical cation possessed a strong positive charge and could be subjected to intermolecular nucleophilic attack while one of the pyrimidine nitrogen served as a nucleophile such an attack led to the intermolecular rearrangement smiles type thus generating an so2 extrusion product the transformation mechanism of the smiles type rearrangement of smt is shown in fig 4 the oxidized products generated via the oxidation of smt a representative sa with six membered heterocyclic ring and smx a representative sa with five membered heterocyclic ring were compared representatively p 214 with m z 199 0979 and chromatographic retention time at 1 720 min were proposed as the product generated from the so2 extrusion in the six membered smt molecule table s6 and fig 4 respectively it is interesting to note that so2 extrusion was not observed in smx with the five membered ring this is mainly attributed to the geometric differences of sas caused by different substituents it can be seen that the so2 extrusion product mainly occurred on the aniline ring c holding the s and the n on the substituents in the five membered ring the distances of the n geometrically away from the aniline ring c holding the s were 4 09 in smx respectively which were longer than the six membered ring of the distance in smt 3 38 between the n of the pyrimidine ring and the aniline ring c holding the s additionally the so2n cn angle in smx is about 133 1 whereas it is 26 1 in smt as measured in the optimized structures see fig 3 thus the further distance and larger angle of the five membered sas would cause too large barrier for the formation of the radical cation of sas to initiate the smiles type rearrangement pathway feng et al 2019 it should be noted that the geometrical differences among various sas are attributed to the different substituents on sas thus it is demonstrated that the substituents on sas can affect the degradation pathways of sas additionally it was reported that the nh so2 r oxidation in sas is faster than the so2 extrusion thus the degradation rate of the sas with the pathway of so2 extrusion might be slower than that without so2 extrusion feng et al 2019 it is inversely explained the reason why the six membered sas has slower degradation rates than five membered sas which is because the six membered sas is removed through a slower so2 extrusion pathway than the five membered sas above all the different substituents on sas played important roles in both the removal rates and the transformation pathways of sas by the rgo pds process simultaneously the different transformation pathways might also inversely influence the removal rate of sas the schematic illustration of the mechanism in the effects of substituents on sas degradation in the rgo pds process is proposed in fig 5 4 conclusions in summary this is the first study toward a comprehensive understanding of the effects of different substituents on the degradation rate and pathways of five sas by pds nonradical oxidation process firstly the differences in the degradation rate of sas are found to depend on the type of substituents the results indicated that the existence of the substituents on sas could promote and influence the degradation rate of sas then the dft calculation is adopted to analyze the differences in charge distribution and the reactive sites of various sas to further demonstrate the substituents affecting the reactivity of sas as confirmed by theoretical calculation the changes in the homo and lumo distribution of sas by different substituents caused the differences in the reactivity of molecules and degradation rate of the reaction finally the degradation pathways of five sas are concisely proposed to illustrate the differences in the transformation pathways caused by various substituents the geometrical differences among various sas caused by different substituents contributed to the different transformation pathways of sas the six membered sas were degraded through a special so2 extrusion pathway which inversely resulted in the slower degradation rate of six membered sas than the five membered sas this finding may help predict the reactivity and rates of other sas with different types of substructures these analyses from the point view of the effects of substituents on the reactivity and pathways of sas in this study can possibly provide direction for the degradation rates and pathways of sas in other

18203,often ingredients of personal care products are present in treated wastewaters e g grey water gw and are discharged into aquatic systems conventional treatment of gw does not fully eliminate micropollutants such as the uv filter substance 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa photolysis has been proposed as an alternative treatment method for other micropollutants but it is not clear yet whether it can also be used to eliminate pbsa one goal of this study was to better understand the basic pathways involved in this process it aimed to identify photo transformation products ptps by using in the test conditions an initial concentration of pbsa higher than those expected in the environment the photolysis experiments were carried out using xenon and uv lamps under xenon irradiation only slight primary elimination was found uv irradiation resulted in almost complete primary elimination of pbsa but not in full mineralization four isomeric mono hydroxylated ptps were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms which could be confirmed by other studies a modified luminescent bacteria test lbt with vibrio fischeri was employed to assess acute and chronic toxic effects of the irradiated photolytic mixtures a strong correlation was found between the kinetics of two of the ptps and luminescence inhibition indicating bacterial toxicity using a set of in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models this study also offered new insights concerning the environmental fate and toxicity of the tps of pbsa as the tps generated by uv treatment are more persistent and partly more toxic than pbsa graphical abstract image 1 keywords pbsa photolysis uv treatment quantitative structure activity relationship luminescence inhibition 1 introduction one source of chemicals entering the environment is domestic waste water from households an extensive literature survey by etchepare and van der hoek 2015 revealed that almost 280 organic micropollutants mps originating from personal care products pcps have been detected in grey water gw which comprises 50 70 of domestic wastewater eriksson et al 2002 friedler 2004 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa is one of the most commonly used organic uv filters in pcps as sunscreen and cosmetic formulations and has been found in both influent and effluent of anaerobic and aerobic gw treatment systems with up to 4 9 μg l hernández leal et al 2011 leal et al 2010 furthermore it occurs in wastewater effluent and due to its persistence it is increasingly detected in surface waters fisch et al 2017 rodil et al 2012 pbsa behaves therefore as pseudo persistent pollutant gago ferrero et al 2013 and is present as ubiquitous contaminant in aquatic environments gago ferrero et al 2015 even if pbsa is of high polarity logkow pbsa 0 16 leal et al 2010 and therefore not likely to bioaccumulate strongly compared to other uv filters it was detected in rainbow trout tissue grabicova et al 2013 for decentralized on site gw treatment an anaerobic system followed by an aerobic post treatment unit for water disinfection e g by uv irradiation may be an option to achieve high removal rates of persistent pollutants from gw ghaitidak and yadav 2013 in order to succeed in mps elimination the complete degradation of mps into non toxic compounds or full mineralization has to be ensured using a more targeted treatment to avoid environmental and health problems originating either from transformation products tps or from the incomplete removal of the parent compound kümmerer et al 2019 several studies assessed the photodegradation of pbsa in water by uv irradiation abdelraheem et al 2015 demonstrated photo stability to uv254 nm whereas serpone et al 2002 and ji et al 2013b carried out degradation experiments with uv lamps emitting λ 290 nm with opposite findings zhang et al 2010 reported an elimination of pbsa depending on the ph value by irradiation with a high pressure mercury lamp and a simultaneous formation of tps but until now no study reports the photo treatment of pbsa in water under multiwavelength irradiation λ 200 400 nm or direct photolysis by a xenon arc lamp λ 200 850 nm analyzed and compared the effect of these conditions on pbsa degradation and formation of tps furthermore tps generated by photolytic reactions of mps have mostly unknown properties and toxicity and can be even more toxic than their parent compounds la farré et al 2008 michael et al 2014 santiago morales et al 2013 baumgartner et al 2009 reported for a sunscreen mixture containing pbsa no luminescence inhibiting effect on v fischeri and no changes in luminescence inhibition li after irradiation with artificial sunlight this irradiation experiment was performed with pbsa on microscope slides and it can be assumed that these results are not comparable with photodegradation experiments in aqueous solution in light of the increasing amount and diversity of chemicals and their tps it is questionable whether to deal with different required toxic endpoints especially in case of the absence of an analytical standard kümmerer et al 2019 computational methods such as qsar qspr quantitative structure activity relationships quantitative structure property relationship were increasingly used for the assessment of environmental properties of uv filter tps alfiya et al 2017 jentzsch et al 2016 finally hybrid approaches were conducted in a combination of in vitro and in silico methods to evaluate the toxicity of tps herrmann et al 2016 khaleel et al 2017 2019 on this occasion both the effect by a single tp and the effects of the mixture could be analyzed as it was successfully demonstrated for antibiotics menz et al 2017 in order to provide new data on the degradation behavior and toxicity of pbsa tps this study analyzed the degradation efficiency of pbsa identified occurring phototransformation products ptps and assessed them by a combination of in vitro and in silico methods therefore irradiation experiments xe and uv lamps in aqueous solutions were conducted to examine the primary elimination and quantum yield of pbsa photolysis primary elimination in this context means the complete transformation and or degradation of the parent compound to other compounds the structure elucidation of the ptps was performed by low resolution lc esi msn and confirmed by high resolution lc hrms by accurate mass measurement to assess the change of toxicity irradiated photolytic mixtures were investigated employing a modified luminescent bacteria test with vibrio fischeri finally established qsar models were used for the in silico analysis using structure activity relationships in order to predict further toxic endpoints for each tp to assess changes in toxicity and mutagenicity compared to the parent compound pbsa models such as toxicity to environmental bacteria aua mutagenicity to different salmonella strains ta100 a7b and chromosome aberration in vitro cho cells a7v attribute the observed effects to specific moieties and substructure of tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa cas no

200 600 nm was used the simulation of sun light irradiation was done by a xenon arc lamp txe 150 arc xe lamp consulting peschl mainz germany λ 200 850 nm the experiments were performed using a batch immersion tube photo reactor total volume 1 l filled with 0 8 l of an aqueous pbsa solutions initial concentrations of 10 mg l and 1 mg l respectively freshly prepared with ultrapure water concentrations and matrix were chosen to measure the non purgeable organic carbon npoc to assess the rate of mineralization of pbsa in line with the literature jentzsch et al 2016 khaleel et al 2019 a significantly higher concentration of pbsa was applied during photolysis compared to the concentration of pbsa in gw or surface water to facilitate the identification of tps therefore the initial nominal concentration of pbsa was adjusted either to i 1 mg l 1 in order to investigate the kinetics and to determine the quantum yield or to ii 10mgl 1 in order to identify the tps the experiments were run under constant temperature of 20 c 1 c the lamps were housed in a water cooled quartz glass tube to ensure a stable temperature of 20 c during the experiment the uv lamp was cooled by cooling

fdo 925 wtw weilheim germany and ph sensor sen tix 41 wtw weilheim germany for online monitoring during the entire test the photo degradation experiments were conducted for 240 min uv lamp and 8 h xe

representative results pbsa shows a high absorption in the uv range with its absorption maxima at 205 243 and 302 nm which means that pbsa was expected to have a high degradation rate under the uv irradiation the intensity of light emitted by the uv lamp the xe lamp and the molar absorbance of pbsa are summarized in supplementary material si 1 furthermore the relative emission spectra of both lamps were acquired by an uv vis spectrometer black comet stellarnet tempa usa within a range of λ 190 850 nm with an integration time of 10 ms to calculate the absolute photon flux of the lamps to achieve the molar extinction coefficient of pbsa εpbsa the absorption spectrum of pbsa was measured at different concentrations 1 25 mg l 1 875 mg l 2 5 mg l 3 75 mg l 5 mg l 7 5 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l with an uv vis spectrometer lambda 20 perkinelmer massachusetts usa using quartz cuvettes optical path length 1 cm suprasil hellma mühlheim germany the molar extinction coefficient for each wavelength was calculated according to the beer lambert law e λ ε λ c d the resulting absorptions at the different concentrations correlated linearly the molar extinction coefficient ε λ at the wavelength λ was extracted from the linear curve respectively the calculation of the photon flux of the lamps and the calculation of the quantum yield of pbsa was done according to oecd guideline 316 oecd 2008 the absolute photon flux of the medium pressure hg lamp tq 150 was calculated in the range of 200 350 nm which represents the overlapping range between the absorption spectra of pbsa and the emission

the ptps formed during the irradiation of pbsa solution were separated and their structures were provisionally established using two lc msn analysis systems lc 3d iontrap ms lc itms and lc high

ionization esi source bruker daltonics bremen germany the lc itms was used as a first screening to elucidate and provisionally identify structures of the ptps formed the lc itms was operated in full

scientific dreieich germany the apparent structures of the ptps were checked by accurate mass measurements employing the lc hrms as it provides the empirical ion formula ring double bond equivalent values rdb and mass error calculations for the ptps detailed information about both lc msn systems used and the individual method settings can be found in si 3 the same chromatographic column and method as described in section 2 3 1 were used for both the lc itms and the lc hrms analyses due to the lack of standards for the ptps their individual peak areas were used to monitor their relative course the recovery percentage was calculated using the relation a a0 where a0 is the peak area of the pbsa at time 0 min and a is the peak area of the ptp at certain irradiation time in the photo degradation test 2 3 3 doc analysis in order to determine the extent of pbsa s mineralization during the photo degradation process non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc was measured using a toc

b 11177 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany the classification threshold for positive results was 20 furthermore the growth inhibition after 14 h incubation time was determined to evaluate the impact on bacterial proliferation the irradiated samples were tested without dilution in case of formation of hydrogen peroxide the samples were additionally spiked with catalase before testing to eliminate the hydrogen peroxide to ensure whether the toxic effects origin from the formed ptps for determination of the ec50 for acute and chronic li and growth inhibition gi a dose response test with different concentrations from 5 to 50 mg l of pbsa was performed for acute li after 30 min pbsa did not show any inhibiting effects for all tested concentrations after 14 h and 24 h incubation time for gi and chronic li pbsa also did not show any inhibiting effects for all tested concentrations following these results the start concentration for the photolysis with uv irradiation was set to 100 mg l which equals a starting concentration of 50 mg l in the lbt 2 5 in silico prediction of environmental fate biodegradability and toxicity the combined in vitro in silico toxicity approach proved helpful in identifying which tps need further attention furthermore the application of more than one in silico model made the predictions more reliable if full mineralization is not achieved photo oxidation processes result in the formation of ptps that may imply environmental or health concerns however recalcitrant transformation products can hardly be purchased thus they often are only available by tedious and costly isolation or synthesis as single substance if at all an alternative approach for the assessment of the transformation products toxicity and physical chemical properties is the application of in silico methods the in silico prediction of ready biodegradability and ecotoxicity was assessed by different software models in silico analysis by qsars was performed using

degradation of pbsa under irradiation with xe light the half life of a 1 mg l solution was calculated with 770 2 min si 6 eq 4 the resulting quantum yield si 2 eq 1 was calculated with φpbsa 5 71 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 7 under irradiation with xe irradiation the primary degradation was marginal after 8 h irradiation time 97 0 of the initial concentration of the parent compound pbsa was still present repeating the test with higher initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 accordingly with slightly lower initial ph ph 4 6 corresponding to the acidity of the substance gave similar results with 95 3 parent compound present after 8 h the npoc concentration decreased to 98 after 8 h photolysis time si 5 3 2 uv photo degradation of pbsa under uv irradiation and at initial concentration of 10 mg l 50 of pbsa was eliminated after approximately 30 min after 8 h of the irradiation the concentration was 1 of the initial concentration at the high initial concentration the elimination of pbsa followed a zero order kinetics primary elimination started immediately after starting the photolysis and npoc elimination was only 30 after 240 min fig 1 a the low degree of mineralization on the one hand and the primary elimination of 99 on the other hand indicate the formation of ptps fig 1b shows the course of the ph value and the oxygen concentration from online monitoring during the experiment the decrease of the ph value indicates the formation of acidic degradation products the elimination kinetics at the initial concentration of 1 mg l with an initial ph value of 5 7 used in uv irradiation experiments following a first order model is shown in fig 1c and d for the uv treatment the half life for primary elimination was calculated as t1 2 of 3 33 min the quantum yield was calculated as φpbsa 9 42 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 7 according to si 2 equation 1 this results correspond with the quantum yield of φpbsa 9 74 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 2 9 and φpbsa 2 70 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 6 8 determined by ji et al 2013b claiming a strong ph dependence on the degradation behavior of pbsa ji et al used a high pressure mercury lamp with an emission spectrum of λ 290 nm and a laser λ 266 nm different findings in quantum yield can be attributed to differences in experimental design as different irradiation sources have been used which have a different emission spectrum distribution furthermore the dimension of the used reactor differs and different water matrices have been used the elimination kinetics for pbsa and the corresponding npoc was slower at higher concentration of pbsa likewise the rate constant was decreasing because more intermediates and ptps were formed from uv light with high initial concentration these intermediates are in competition to pbsa and may absorb uv light partially before the uv light can pass through the whole solution herrmann et al 2015 khaleel et al 2016 the decrease of the o2 concentration at the beginning of the process shows the formation of reactive oxygen species ros which oxidize the parent compound the later increase of the o2 concentration to the initial level is due to re saturation of the solution with oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere as the reactor is not gas tight and is not purged during the reaction with inert gas h2o2 formation was checked semi quantitative colorimetrically with peroxide test strips mquant merck germany after 60 min under uv irradiation h2o2 was formed in low concentration 0 5 mg l under xe irradiation no h2o2 formation was found the emission of the xe lamp below 350 nm is compared to the uv lamp marginal there is a minor overlapping of the xe lamp emission with the absorption spectrum of pbsa which results in a low primary degradation si 1 due to the better overlapping of the absorption spectrum of pbsa with the uv lamp emission spectrum and the higher photon flux of the uv lamp the primary elimination by photolysis was more efficient regarding the primary elimination of pbsa itself uv treatment appears to be suitable to degrade pbsa from gw in view of the very low decrease of npoc during uv treatment a more detailed investigation of the formed ptps is necessary they must be identified and characterized in order to further evaluate the treatment process and the associated risks 3 3 occurrence and structural elucidation of ptps during the irradiation experiments four transformation products could be detected these were identified as primarily formed ptps and had the same m z value of 289 respectively however with different retention times indicating the formation of isomers fig 2 shows the extracted ion chromatograms of pbsa top and its ptps bottom from the uv irradiation experiments the course of the relative concentration for the ptpa to ptpd showed a steep slope during the beginning of the uv irradiation experiment fig 3 respectively due to the better intensities at 300 nm the kinetic of ptpb has been monitored at this wavelength instead of 254 nm for all other tps in order to fully understand the course this is not possible at lower signal intensities because the signal to noise ratio is too low at low concentrations and the signal can therefore no longer be evaluated ptpb and ptpd were formed immediately and ptpa and ptpc were formed 20 min only after starting the experiment constantly increasing up to 60 min ptpa ptpb and ptpc and up to 75 min ptpd respectively then decreasing in favour for further transformation ptpa disappears until end of the experiment at 240 min ptpb ptpc and ptpd can still be detected by the end of the experiment these findings confirm the hypothesis that these do not mineralize under irradiation during the xe lamp irradiation experiments with starting concentrations of 10 mg l the same ptps as in uv treatment with same retention times and mass occurred shortly after 1 h and were detectable until the end of the experiment the ptps from xe experiment with an initial concentration of 10 mg l were only detectable under esi ms conditions due to their very low concentrations due to very bad signal noise ratio owing to these low concentrations further monitoring of the course of the formed ptps was not possible the results show that the same ptps emerge during xe irradiation as during uv light irradiation but in much lower trace concentrations possible reason for this could be the very small emission of the xe lamp below 350 nm si 1 to determine the molecular structures of the ptps further investigations with lc ms ms and hrms were done the ptps were assumed to be mono hydroxylated products of the parent compound due to their mass difference of 16m z which can be assumed to be the addition of an oxygen atom in the molecular structure of pbsa i e insertion of oxygen into a c h bond therefore the chemical formula was predicted as c13h10n2o4s the predicted sum formula of the ptps were checked via hrms analysis the acquired masses for the ptps and the parent compound pbsa are listed in table 1 and compared to the calculated mass of the prediction the mass error for each prediction is below 1 mmu so the validity of the predictions can be assumed for the predicted sum formula six isomeric structures for mono hydroxylated products are possible fig 4 ptps were formed by mono hydroxylation of the parent compound pbsa this was also found after indirect photolysis in presence of nitrate by ji et al 2013b however after direct photolysis in milli q water these tps were not found by ji et al 2013b using a high pressure hg lamp in an open pyrex glass cell in another study ji et al 2013a found these tps after photocatalytic treatment of pbsa with tio2 using the same experimental design abdelraheem et al 2016 also detected these tps among others under photocatalytic degradation with h2o2 using monochromatic uv lamp at 254 nm and two low pressure hg lamps the fragmentation of the parent compound as well as for all ptps occurs by loss of the sulfonic acid group as shown in si 7 ms ms further msn experiments did not generate consecutive fragmentation therefore it was not possible to determine which isomer was formed possible positions for hydroxylation are on the benzimidazole substructure tp1 to tp3 and on the phenyl ring in ortho tp4 meta tp5 and para position tp6 furthermore co elution of different isomers might be possible the calculation was done with the logp calculator of the chemsketch software acd 2015 the logp values shown in fig 4 for each tp give an idea about the order of elution tp3 tp5 and tp6 have lower logp values than pbsa therefore earlier elution is likely accordingly tp1 tp2 and tp4 are expected to elute later due to the higher logp values compared to pbsa tp1 and tp2 as well as tp5 and tp6 have similar logp values respectively therefore co elution can be expected for completeness the more dilute photolysis experiments as dilute as 1 mg l initial concentration of pbsa were also checked for tps but no tps were detected under this condition 3 4 toxicity on bacteria during the lbt an increase of acute li after 30 min incubation time was found for the photolysis mixtures after 192 min of irradiation time the increase of inhibition indicated the formation of ptps which have a stronger toxic effect to v fischeri than the parent compound pbsa fig 5 this divergent result to the study of baumgartner et al 2009 who reported no inhibiting effects on v fischeri and no luminescence inhibition after with artificial sun light might result from the use of a different experimental condition as the use of another irradiation source and different application of the irradiated samples on v fischeri in the study of baumgartner et al 2009 the irradiation experiment was performed with pbsa dried on a microscope slide irradiated with a solar spectrum simulator atlas suntest cps harkingen switzerland with and without colipa solar standard filter furthermore baumgartner et al 2009 applied a mixture containing other substances besides pbsa which might also influence the results due to antagonistic effects of other ingredients in the mixture it can be assumed that these results are not comparable with photodegradation experiments in aqueous solution regarding the chronic li and the gi an increase of inhibition was found after 64 min of irradiation time but the classification threshold for positive results 20 was only reached after 192 min li and 256 min gi the increase of inhibition indicated the formation of ptps which have a long term toxic effect to v fischeri and an impact on bacterial proliferation fig 5 shows the course of the ptps during the experiment with a peak area ratio amax a0 pbsa and the corresponding results for li after 30 min and 24 h testing time the kinetic of the ptp formation was compared with the results for short term testing li after 30 min and long term testing 24 h and the gi after 14 h by calculation the pearson correlation coefficient between peak area ratio amax a0 pbsa and the acute and chronical luminescence inhibition table 2 the correlations for tpa and tpc are 0 8 which means the linear correlation between the kinetics of ptp formation and the toxic effects are strong however a significant correlation between the occurrence of a tp and its li does not prove a real causal relationship due to possible synergistic and antagonistic effects of the ptps in the photolytic mixture 3 5 in silico prediction of pbsa and its ptps toxicity and biodegradability the statistical aua model of caseultra software package was used for the prediction of short term bacterial luminescence inhibition in the microtox assay of possible ptps isomers this assay is comparable to the short term endpoint li 30 min of the modified lbt menz et al 2017 the qsar model provided positive predictions not only for pbsa but also for the ptps table 3 inconclusive estimation for tp5 means that unknown structural fragments cover a significant portion of the test chemical and therefore a clear result cannot be provided pbsa and its ptps were predicted to be active because of the presence of the phenyl sub structure id 10 the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety changes the probability for the predicted toxicity tp6 showed with 79 8 the highest probability for bacterial cytotoxicity which based on an additional identified structural alert id 36 the in vitro results showed high correlations between the course of tpa and tpc and the li and the gi fig 5 and table 2 these results indicate that tpa had the structure of tp6 which has on the one hand the highest probability in the aua model and on the other hand has a lower logp value than pbsa and is therefore likely to elute before pbsa for the mono hydroxylation on the benzimidazole sub structure no structural alerts were identified in the chemical structure of pbsa and all ptps bino et al 2017 synthesized 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid designated as tp6 in this study and 2 2 hydroxyphenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid designated as tp4 in this study and studied the antioxidant activities cytotoxicity and phototoxicity using a cell line of human keratinocytes compared to pbsa they found slightly higher antioxidant effectivity for tp4 and tp6 furthermore for tp6 they found higher cytotoxicity ic50 26 4 2 7 μm compared to pbsa ic50 50 μm this result supports the prediction from this study that tp6 might have toxic effects to different end points pbsa and the proposed chemical structures of the ptps were also analyzed regarding structure activity relationships using a combination of different applied models for mutagenicity and genotoxicity a list of all included chemical structures and their predicted mutagenic and genotoxic activities is presented in the si si 9 pbsa is neither known to be mutagenic nor to be genotoxic the applied predictive models also gave no positive alerts for pbsa salmonella ta100 s9 ta100 model salmonella t 5 strains a7b model and chromosome aberration in vitro cho cells a7v model reported inconclusive because the classification threshold of the model was not reached and therefore a clear result cannot be given however some of the ptps were predicted to have mutagenic and genotoxic activities specific models for mutagenicity are positive for tp1 ta100 tp4 gt1 a7b ml mouse lymphoma and tp5 ml mouse lymphoma this indicated that all these ptps may possess new structural features that are linked closely to dna reactivity in particular the statistical model gt1 a7b which includes seven strains of salmonella typhimurium ta 97 98 100 and 1535 1538 identified two alerting substructures of tp4 for bacterial mutagenicity fig 6 and highlighted the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety as alerting structure as recommended by the ich m7 guidelines ema chmp ich 83812 2013 for bacterial mutagenicity mutagenicity in the gt expert model was also predicted but no positive call was found positive alerts for teratogenic effects in mammals rabbit rats mouse for both the parent compound and its ptps were predicted by the respective models a50 a51 a52 and a53 teratogenicity mammal a compound is predicted as either biodegradable or non biodegradable depending on certain activating and deactivating alerts which are identified by all qsar models both models of the oasis catalogic software for ready biodegradability predicted the output values as 0 5 for pbsa and all ptps si 10 these output values are below the pass criterion for ready biodegradability under miti i test conditions i e the compound is predicted to be non biodegradable accordingly pbsa and the ptps could be categorized as non readily biodegradable chemicals this finding is supported by results of leal et al 2010 who studied the occurrence of xenobiotics in gw including pbsa and their removal in three biological treatment systems leal et al 2010 categorized pbsa as a substance with poor aerobic biodegradability furthermore no removal was found for pbsa in any of the biological treatment systems therefore it is expected to be present in the aquatic environments furthermore the bcf model of caseultra software package for bioconcentration showed higher results for all ptps than pbsa therefore it is likely that the ptps are even more persistent than pbsa 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to determine the fate of pbsa in aqueous solution the identification of resulting transformation products and their evaluation using an in vitro test and different qsar models to gain insights into their toxic properties this evaluation should contribute to a first understanding of the possible effects of uv irradiation used for wastewater treatment the obtained results show that pbsa was not significantly photolyzed by xe irradiation but it was primarily eliminated by uv irradiation the main uv degradation pathway of pbsa is a mono hydroxylation and lead to the formation of four stable ptps the investigated toxicities demonstrate higher effects of the photolysis mixture pbsa and four tps than pbsa itself by luminescent bacteria test with vibrio fischeri this could be also confirmed by in silico predictions and indicated that the tp with a para hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety contributes mainly to the higher probabilities of toxicity additionally the in silico predictions showed for all tps higher probabilities for bioconcentration and same or less for biodegradation than for pbsa therefore it is likely that the photo treatment resulted in even more persistent pollutants in general there were indications that the tps formed by photolysis of pbsa can be toxic e g mutagenic and genotoxic overall the toxicity endpoints of tps mentioned above deserve more attention therefore confirming the predicted toxicity and the possibility of altered genotoxicity of the proposed tps is recommended as soon as adequate amounts of the substances are available for experimental verification the in silico results presented here can give guidance on which compounds to start with the combined in vitro in silico toxicity assessment provides a first indication that photodegradation of pbsa by uv treatment leads to increased toxicity and therefore to a higher risk level due to the formed tps the results of this assessment will be utilized in further studies of the applicability of uv treatment with artificial and ultimately real gw e g to confirm the risk of the tps to the environment or human health

18203,often ingredients of personal care products are present in treated wastewaters e g grey water gw and are discharged into aquatic systems conventional treatment of gw does not fully eliminate micropollutants such as the uv filter substance 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa photolysis has been proposed as an alternative treatment method for other micropollutants but it is not clear yet whether it can also be used to eliminate pbsa one goal of this study was to better understand the basic pathways involved in this process it aimed to identify photo transformation products ptps by using in the test conditions an initial concentration of pbsa higher than those expected in the environment the photolysis experiments were carried out using xenon and uv lamps under xenon irradiation only slight primary elimination was found uv irradiation resulted in almost complete primary elimination of pbsa but not in full mineralization four isomeric mono hydroxylated ptps were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms which could be confirmed by other studies a modified luminescent bacteria test lbt with vibrio fischeri was employed to assess acute and chronic toxic effects of the irradiated photolytic mixtures a strong correlation was found between the kinetics of two of the ptps and luminescence inhibition indicating bacterial toxicity using a set of in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models this study also offered new insights concerning the environmental fate and toxicity of the tps of pbsa as the tps generated by uv treatment are more persistent and partly more toxic than pbsa graphical abstract image 1 keywords pbsa photolysis uv treatment quantitative structure activity relationship luminescence inhibition 1 introduction one source of chemicals entering the environment is domestic waste water from households an extensive literature survey by etchepare and van der hoek 2015 revealed that almost 280 organic micropollutants mps originating from personal care products pcps have been detected in grey water gw which comprises 50 70 of domestic wastewater eriksson et al 2002 friedler 2004 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa is one of the most commonly used organic uv filters in pcps as sunscreen and cosmetic formulations and has been found in both influent and effluent of anaerobic and aerobic gw treatment systems with up to 4 9 μg l hernández leal et al 2011 leal et al 2010 furthermore it occurs in wastewater effluent and due to its persistence it is increasingly detected in surface waters fisch et al 2017 rodil et al 2012 pbsa behaves therefore as pseudo persistent pollutant gago ferrero et al 2013 and is present as ubiquitous contaminant in aquatic environments gago ferrero et al 2015 even if pbsa is of high polarity logkow pbsa 0 16 leal et al 2010 and therefore not likely to bioaccumulate strongly compared to other uv filters it was detected in rainbow trout tissue grabicova et al 2013 for decentralized on site gw treatment an anaerobic system followed by an aerobic post treatment unit for water disinfection e g by uv irradiation may be an option to achieve high removal rates of persistent pollutants from gw ghaitidak and yadav 2013 in order to succeed in mps elimination the complete degradation of mps into non toxic compounds or full mineralization has to be ensured using a more targeted treatment to avoid environmental and health problems originating either from transformation products tps or from the incomplete removal of the parent compound kümmerer et al 2019 several studies assessed the photodegradation of pbsa in water by uv irradiation abdelraheem et al 2015 demonstrated photo stability to uv254 nm whereas serpone et al 2002 and ji et al 2013b carried out degradation experiments with uv lamps emitting λ 290 nm with opposite findings zhang et al 2010 reported an elimination of pbsa depending on the ph value by irradiation with a high pressure mercury lamp and a simultaneous formation of tps but until now no study reports the photo treatment of pbsa in water under multiwavelength irradiation λ 200 400 nm or direct photolysis by a xenon arc lamp λ 200 850 nm analyzed and compared the effect of these conditions on pbsa degradation and formation of tps furthermore tps generated by photolytic reactions of mps have mostly unknown properties and toxicity and can be even more toxic than their parent compounds la farré et al 2008 michael et al 2014 santiago morales et al 2013 baumgartner et al 2009 reported for a sunscreen mixture containing pbsa no luminescence inhibiting effect on v fischeri and no changes in luminescence inhibition li after irradiation with artificial sunlight this irradiation experiment was performed with pbsa on microscope slides and it can be assumed that these results are not comparable with photodegradation experiments in aqueous solution in light of the increasing amount and diversity of chemicals and their tps it is questionable whether to deal with different required toxic endpoints especially in case of the absence of an analytical standard kümmerer et al 2019 computational methods such as qsar qspr quantitative structure activity relationships quantitative structure property relationship were increasingly used for the assessment of environmental properties of uv filter tps alfiya et al 2017 jentzsch et al 2016 finally hybrid approaches were conducted in a combination of in vitro and in silico methods to evaluate the toxicity of tps herrmann et al 2016 khaleel et al 2017 2019 on this occasion both the effect by a single tp and the effects of the mixture could be analyzed as it was successfully demonstrated for antibiotics menz et al 2017 in order to provide new data on the degradation behavior and toxicity of pbsa tps this study analyzed the degradation efficiency of pbsa identified occurring phototransformation products ptps and assessed them by a combination of in vitro and in silico methods therefore irradiation experiments xe and uv lamps in aqueous solutions were conducted to examine the primary elimination and quantum yield of pbsa photolysis primary elimination in this context means the complete transformation and or degradation of the parent compound to other compounds the structure elucidation of the ptps was performed by low resolution lc esi msn and confirmed by high resolution lc hrms by accurate mass measurement to assess the change of toxicity irradiated photolytic mixtures were investigated employing a modified luminescent bacteria test with vibrio fischeri finally established qsar models were used for the in silico analysis using structure activity relationships in order to predict further toxic endpoints for each tp to assess changes in toxicity and mutagenicity compared to the parent compound pbsa models such as toxicity to environmental bacteria aua mutagenicity to different salmonella strains ta100 a7b and chromosome aberration in vitro cho cells a7v attribute the observed effects to specific moieties and substructure of tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa cas no

200 600 nm was used the simulation of sun light irradiation was done by a xenon arc lamp txe 150 arc xe lamp consulting peschl mainz germany λ 200 850 nm the experiments were performed using a batch immersion tube photo reactor total volume 1 l filled with 0 8 l of an aqueous pbsa solutions initial concentrations of 10 mg l and 1 mg l respectively freshly prepared with ultrapure water concentrations and matrix were chosen to measure the non purgeable organic carbon npoc to assess the rate of mineralization of pbsa in line with the literature jentzsch et al 2016 khaleel et al 2019 a significantly higher concentration of pbsa was applied during photolysis compared to the concentration of pbsa in gw or surface water to facilitate the identification of tps therefore the initial nominal concentration of pbsa was adjusted either to i 1 mg l 1 in order to investigate the kinetics and to determine the quantum yield or to ii 10mgl 1 in order to identify the tps the experiments were run under constant temperature of 20 c 1 c the lamps were housed in a water cooled quartz glass tube to ensure a stable temperature of 20 c during the experiment the uv lamp was cooled by cooling

4 5 6 7 and 8 h of sun light irradiation for hplc uv dad and lc msn analyses as well as for dissolved organic carbon doc measurements both experiments have been performed twice to achieve representative results pbsa shows a high absorption in the uv range with its absorption maxima at 205 243 and 302 nm which means that pbsa was expected to have a high degradation rate under the uv irradiation the intensity of light emitted by the uv lamp the xe lamp and the molar absorbance of pbsa are summarized in supplementary material si 1 furthermore the relative emission spectra of both lamps were acquired by an uv vis spectrometer black comet stellarnet tempa usa within a range of λ 190 850 nm with an integration time of 10 ms to calculate the absolute photon flux of the lamps to achieve the molar extinction coefficient of pbsa εpbsa the absorption spectrum of pbsa was measured at different concentrations 1 25 mg l 1 875 mg l 2 5 mg l 3 75 mg l 5 mg l 7 5 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l with an uv vis spectrometer lambda 20 perkinelmer massachusetts usa using quartz cuvettes optical path length 1 cm suprasil hellma mühlheim germany the molar extinction coefficient for each wavelength was calculated according to the beer lambert law e λ ε λ c d the resulting absorptions at the different concentrations correlated linearly the molar extinction coefficient ε λ at the wavelength λ was extracted from the linear curve respectively the calculation of the photon flux of the lamps and the calculation of the quantum yield of pbsa was done according to oecd guideline 316 oecd 2008 the absolute photon flux of the medium pressure hg lamp tq 150 was calculated in the range of 200 350 nm which represents the overlapping range between the absorption spectra of pbsa and the emission

the ptps formed during the irradiation of pbsa solution were separated and their structures were provisionally established using two lc msn analysis systems lc 3d iontrap ms lc itms and lc high

ionization esi source bruker daltonics bremen germany the lc itms was used as a first screening to elucidate and provisionally identify structures of the ptps formed the lc itms was operated in full

scientific dreieich germany the apparent structures of the ptps were checked by accurate mass measurements employing the lc hrms as it provides the empirical ion formula ring double bond equivalent values rdb and mass error calculations for the ptps detailed information about both lc msn systems used and the individual method settings can be found in si 3 the same chromatographic column and method as described in section 2 3 1 were used for both the lc itms and the lc hrms analyses due to the lack of standards for the ptps their individual peak areas were used to monitor their relative course the recovery percentage was calculated using the relation a a0 where a0 is the peak area of the pbsa at time 0 min and a is the peak area of the ptp at certain irradiation time in the photo degradation test 2 3 3 doc analysis in order to determine the extent of pbsa s mineralization during the photo degradation process non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc was measured using a toc

b 11177 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany the classification threshold for positive results was 20 furthermore the growth inhibition after 14 h incubation time was determined to evaluate the impact on bacterial proliferation the irradiated samples were tested without dilution in case of formation of hydrogen peroxide the samples were additionally spiked with catalase before testing to eliminate the hydrogen peroxide to ensure whether the toxic effects origin from the formed ptps for determination of the ec50 for acute and chronic li and growth inhibition gi a dose response test with different concentrations from 5 to 50 mg l of pbsa was performed for acute li after 30 min pbsa did not show any inhibiting effects for all tested concentrations after 14 h and 24 h incubation time for gi and chronic li pbsa also did not show any inhibiting effects for all tested concentrations following these results the start concentration for the photolysis with uv irradiation was set to 100 mg l which equals a starting concentration of 50 mg l in the lbt 2 5 in silico prediction of environmental fate biodegradability and toxicity the combined in vitro in silico toxicity approach proved helpful in identifying which tps need further attention furthermore the application of more than one in silico model made the predictions more reliable if full mineralization is not achieved photo oxidation processes result in the formation of ptps that may imply environmental or health concerns however recalcitrant transformation products can hardly be purchased thus they often are only available by tedious and costly isolation or synthesis as single substance if at all an alternative approach for the assessment of the transformation products toxicity and physical chemical properties is the application of in silico methods the in silico prediction of ready biodegradability and ecotoxicity was assessed by different software models in silico analysis by qsars was performed using

degradation of pbsa under irradiation with xe light the half life of a 1 mg l solution was calculated with 770 2 min si 6 eq 4 the resulting quantum yield si 2 eq 1 was calculated with φpbsa 5 71 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 7 under irradiation with xe irradiation the primary degradation was marginal after 8 h irradiation time 97 0 of the initial concentration of the parent compound pbsa was still present repeating the test with higher initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 accordingly with slightly lower initial ph ph 4 6 corresponding to the acidity of the substance gave similar results with 95 3 parent compound present after 8 h the npoc concentration decreased to 98 after 8 h photolysis time si 5 3 2 uv photo degradation of pbsa under uv irradiation and at initial concentration of 10 mg l 50 of pbsa was eliminated after approximately 30 min after 8 h of the irradiation the concentration was 1 of the initial concentration at the high initial concentration the elimination of pbsa followed a zero order kinetics primary elimination started immediately after starting the photolysis and npoc elimination was only 30 after 240 min fig 1 a the low degree of mineralization on the one hand and the primary elimination of 99 on the other hand indicate the formation of ptps fig 1b shows the course of the ph value and the oxygen concentration from online monitoring during the experiment the decrease of the ph value indicates the formation of acidic degradation products the elimination kinetics at the initial concentration of 1 mg l with an initial ph value of 5 7 used in uv irradiation experiments following a first order model is shown in fig 1c and d for the uv treatment the half life for primary elimination was calculated as t1 2 of 3 33 min the quantum yield was calculated as φpbsa 9 42 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 7 according to si 2 equation 1 this results correspond with the quantum yield of φpbsa 9 74 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 2 9 and φpbsa 2 70 10 4 mol einstein 1 at ph 6 8 determined by ji et al 2013b claiming a strong ph dependence on the degradation behavior of pbsa ji et al used a high pressure mercury lamp with an emission spectrum of λ 290 nm and a laser λ 266 nm different findings in quantum yield can be attributed to differences in experimental design as different irradiation sources have been used which have a different emission spectrum distribution furthermore the dimension of the used reactor differs and different water matrices have been used the elimination kinetics for pbsa and the corresponding npoc was slower at higher concentration of pbsa likewise the rate constant was decreasing because more intermediates and ptps were formed from uv light with high initial concentration these intermediates are in competition to pbsa and may absorb uv light partially before the uv light can pass through the whole solution herrmann et al 2015 khaleel et al 2016 the decrease of the o2 concentration at the beginning of the process shows the formation of reactive oxygen species ros which oxidize the parent compound the later increase of the o2 concentration to the initial level is due to re saturation of the solution with oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere as the reactor is not gas tight and is not purged during the reaction with inert gas h2o2 formation was checked semi quantitative colorimetrically with peroxide test strips mquant merck germany after 60 min under uv irradiation h2o2 was formed in low concentration 0 5 mg l under xe irradiation no h2o2 formation was found the emission of the xe lamp below 350 nm is compared to the uv lamp marginal there is a minor overlapping of the xe lamp emission with the absorption spectrum of pbsa which results in a low primary degradation si 1 due to the better overlapping of the absorption spectrum of pbsa with the uv lamp emission spectrum and the higher photon flux of the uv lamp the primary elimination by photolysis was more efficient regarding the primary elimination of pbsa itself uv treatment appears to be suitable to degrade pbsa from gw in view of the very low decrease of npoc during uv treatment a more detailed investigation of the formed ptps is necessary they must be identified and characterized in order to further evaluate the treatment process and the associated risks 3 3 occurrence and structural elucidation of ptps during the irradiation experiments four transformation products could be detected these were identified as primarily formed ptps and had the same m z value of 289 respectively however with different retention times indicating the formation of isomers fig 2 shows the extracted ion chromatograms of pbsa top and its ptps bottom from the uv irradiation experiments the course of the relative concentration for the ptpa to ptpd showed a steep slope during the beginning of the uv irradiation experiment fig 3 respectively due to the better intensities at 300 nm the kinetic of ptpb has been monitored at this wavelength instead of 254 nm for all other tps in order to fully understand the course this is not possible at lower signal intensities because the signal to noise ratio is too low at low concentrations and the signal can therefore no longer be evaluated ptpb and ptpd were formed immediately and ptpa and ptpc were formed 20 min only after starting the experiment constantly increasing up to 60 min ptpa ptpb and ptpc and up to 75 min ptpd respectively then decreasing in favour for further transformation ptpa disappears until end of the experiment at 240 min ptpb ptpc and ptpd can still be detected by the end of the experiment these findings confirm the hypothesis that these do not mineralize under irradiation during the xe lamp irradiation experiments with starting concentrations of 10 mg l the same ptps as in uv treatment with same retention times and mass occurred shortly after 1 h and were detectable until the end of the experiment the ptps from xe experiment with an initial concentration of 10 mg l were only detectable under esi ms conditions due to their very low concentrations due to very bad signal noise ratio owing to these low concentrations further monitoring of the course of the formed ptps was not possible the results show that the same ptps emerge during xe irradiation as during uv light irradiation but in much lower trace concentrations possible reason for this could be the very small emission of the xe lamp below 350 nm si 1 to determine the molecular structures of the ptps further investigations with lc ms ms and hrms were done the ptps were assumed to be mono hydroxylated products of the parent compound due to their mass difference of 16m z which can be assumed to be the addition of an oxygen atom in the molecular structure of pbsa i e insertion of oxygen into a c h bond therefore the chemical formula was predicted as c13h10n2o4s the predicted sum formula of the ptps were checked via hrms analysis the acquired masses for the ptps and the parent compound pbsa are listed in table 1 and compared to the calculated mass of the prediction the mass error for each prediction is below 1 mmu so the validity of the predictions can be assumed for the predicted sum formula six isomeric structures for mono hydroxylated products are possible fig 4 ptps were formed by mono hydroxylation of the parent compound pbsa this was also found after indirect photolysis in presence of nitrate by ji et al 2013b however after direct photolysis in milli q water these tps were not found by ji et al 2013b using a high pressure hg lamp in an open pyrex glass cell in another study ji et al 2013a found these tps after photocatalytic treatment of pbsa with tio2 using the same experimental design abdelraheem et al 2016 also detected these tps among others under photocatalytic degradation with h2o2 using monochromatic uv lamp at 254 nm and two low pressure hg lamps the fragmentation of the parent compound as well as for all ptps occurs by loss of the sulfonic acid group as shown in si 7 ms ms further msn experiments did not generate consecutive fragmentation therefore it was not possible to determine which isomer was formed possible positions for hydroxylation are on the benzimidazole substructure tp1 to tp3 and on the phenyl ring in ortho tp4 meta tp5 and para position tp6 furthermore co elution of different isomers might be possible the calculation was done with the logp calculator of the chemsketch software acd 2015 the logp values shown in fig 4 for each tp give an idea about the order of elution tp3 tp5 and tp6 have lower logp values than pbsa therefore earlier elution is likely accordingly tp1 tp2 and tp4 are expected to elute later due to the higher logp values compared to pbsa tp1 and tp2 as well as tp5 and tp6 have similar logp values respectively therefore co elution can be expected for completeness the more dilute photolysis experiments as dilute as 1 mg l initial concentration of pbsa were also checked for tps but no tps were detected under this condition 3 4 toxicity on bacteria during the lbt an increase of acute li after 30 min incubation time was found for the photolysis mixtures after 192 min of irradiation time the increase of inhibition indicated the formation of ptps which have a stronger toxic effect to v fischeri than the parent compound pbsa fig 5 this divergent result to the study of baumgartner et al 2009 who reported no inhibiting effects on v fischeri and no luminescence inhibition after with artificial sun light might result from the use of a different experimental condition as the use of another irradiation source and different application of the irradiated samples on v fischeri in the study of baumgartner et al 2009 the irradiation experiment was performed with pbsa dried on a microscope slide irradiated with a solar spectrum simulator atlas suntest cps harkingen switzerland with and without colipa solar standard filter furthermore baumgartner et al 2009 applied a mixture containing other substances besides pbsa which might also influence the results due to antagonistic effects of other ingredients in the mixture it can be assumed that these results are not comparable with photodegradation experiments in aqueous solution regarding the chronic li and the gi an increase of inhibition was found after 64 min of irradiation time but the classification threshold for positive results 20 was only reached after 192 min li and 256 min gi the increase of inhibition indicated the formation of ptps which have a long term toxic effect to v fischeri and an impact on bacterial proliferation fig 5 shows the course of the ptps during the experiment with a peak area ratio amax a0 pbsa and the corresponding results for li after 30 min and 24 h testing time the kinetic of the ptp formation was compared with the results for short term testing li after 30 min and long term testing 24 h and the gi after 14 h by calculation the pearson correlation coefficient between peak area ratio amax a0 pbsa and the acute and chronical luminescence inhibition table 2 the correlations for tpa and tpc are 0 8 which means the linear correlation between the kinetics of ptp formation and the toxic effects are strong however a significant correlation between the occurrence of a tp and its li does not prove a real causal relationship due to possible synergistic and antagonistic effects of the ptps in the photolytic mixture 3 5 in silico prediction of pbsa and its ptps toxicity and biodegradability the statistical aua model of caseultra software package was used for the prediction of short term bacterial luminescence inhibition in the microtox assay of possible ptps isomers this assay is comparable to the short term endpoint li 30 min of the modified lbt menz et al 2017 the qsar model provided positive predictions not only for pbsa but also for the ptps table 3 inconclusive estimation for tp5 means that unknown structural fragments cover a significant portion of the test chemical and therefore a clear result cannot be provided pbsa and its ptps were predicted to be active because of the presence of the phenyl sub structure id 10 the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety changes the probability for the predicted toxicity tp6 showed with 79 8 the highest probability for bacterial cytotoxicity which based on an additional identified structural alert id 36 the in vitro results showed high correlations between the course of tpa and tpc and the li and the gi fig 5 and table 2 these results indicate that tpa had the structure of tp6 which has on the one hand the highest probability in the aua model and on the other hand has a lower logp value than pbsa and is therefore likely to elute before pbsa for the mono hydroxylation on the benzimidazole sub structure no structural alerts were identified in the chemical structure of pbsa and all ptps bino et al 2017 synthesized 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid designated as tp6 in this study and 2 2 hydroxyphenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid designated as tp4 in this study and studied the antioxidant activities cytotoxicity and phototoxicity using a cell line of human keratinocytes compared to pbsa they found slightly higher antioxidant effectivity for tp4 and tp6 furthermore for tp6 they found higher cytotoxicity ic50 26 4 2 7 μm compared to pbsa ic50 50 μm this result supports the prediction from this study that tp6 might have toxic effects to different end points pbsa and the proposed chemical structures of the ptps were also analyzed regarding structure activity relationships using a combination of different applied models for mutagenicity and genotoxicity a list of all included chemical structures and their predicted mutagenic and genotoxic activities is presented in the si si 9 pbsa is neither known to be mutagenic nor to be genotoxic the applied predictive models also gave no positive alerts for pbsa salmonella ta100 s9 ta100 model salmonella t 5 strains a7b model and chromosome aberration in vitro cho cells a7v model reported inconclusive because the classification threshold of the model was not reached and therefore a clear result cannot be given however some of the ptps were predicted to have mutagenic and genotoxic activities specific models for mutagenicity are positive for tp1 ta100 tp4 gt1 a7b ml mouse lymphoma and tp5 ml mouse lymphoma this indicated that all these ptps may possess new structural features that are linked closely to dna reactivity in particular the statistical model gt1 a7b which includes seven strains of salmonella typhimurium ta 97 98 100 and 1535 1538 identified two alerting substructures of tp4 for bacterial mutagenicity fig 6 and highlighted the hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety as alerting structure as recommended by the ich m7 guidelines ema chmp ich 83812 2013 for bacterial mutagenicity mutagenicity in the gt expert model was also predicted but no positive call was found positive alerts for teratogenic effects in mammals rabbit rats mouse for both the parent compound and its ptps were predicted by the respective models a50 a51 a52 and a53 teratogenicity mammal a compound is predicted as either biodegradable or non biodegradable depending on certain activating and deactivating alerts which are identified by all qsar models both models of the oasis catalogic software for ready biodegradability predicted the output values as 0 5 for pbsa and all ptps si 10 these output values are below the pass criterion for ready biodegradability under miti i test conditions i e the compound is predicted to be non biodegradable accordingly pbsa and the ptps could be categorized as non readily biodegradable chemicals this finding is supported by results of leal et al 2010 who studied the occurrence of xenobiotics in gw including pbsa and their removal in three biological treatment systems leal et al 2010 categorized pbsa as a substance with poor aerobic biodegradability furthermore no removal was found for pbsa in any of the biological treatment systems therefore it is expected to be present in the aquatic environments furthermore the bcf model of caseultra software package for bioconcentration showed higher results for all ptps than pbsa therefore it is likely that the ptps are even more persistent than pbsa 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to determine the fate of pbsa in aqueous solution the identification of resulting transformation products and their evaluation using an in vitro test and different qsar models to gain insights into their toxic properties this evaluation should contribute to a first understanding of the possible effects of uv irradiation used for wastewater treatment the obtained results show that pbsa was not significantly photolyzed by xe irradiation but it was primarily eliminated by uv irradiation the main uv degradation pathway of pbsa is a mono hydroxylation and lead to the formation of four stable ptps the investigated toxicities demonstrate higher effects of the photolysis mixture pbsa and four tps than pbsa itself by luminescent bacteria test with vibrio fischeri this could be also confirmed by in silico predictions and indicated that the tp with a para hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety contributes mainly to the higher probabilities of toxicity additionally the in silico predictions showed for all tps higher probabilities for bioconcentration and same or less for biodegradation than for pbsa therefore it is likely that the photo treatment resulted in even more persistent pollutants in general there were indications that the tps formed by photolysis of pbsa can be toxic e g mutagenic and genotoxic overall the toxicity endpoints of tps mentioned above deserve more attention therefore confirming the predicted toxicity and the possibility of altered genotoxicity of the proposed tps is recommended as soon as adequate amounts of the substances are available for experimental verification the in silico results presented here can give guidance on which compounds to start with the combined in vitro in silico toxicity assessment provides a first indication that photodegradation of pbsa by uv treatment leads to increased toxicity and therefore to a higher risk level due to the formed tps the results of this assessment will be utilized in further studies of the applicability of uv treatment with artificial and ultimately real gw e g to confirm the risk of the tps to the environment or human health

18204,the widespread use and release of plastics in nature have raised global concerns about their impact on public health and the environment while much research has been conducted on macro and micro sized plastics the fate of nanoscale plastics remains unexplored in this study the aggregation kinetics and stability of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics were investigated over a wide range of aquatic chemistries ph salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 ionic strength relevant to the natural environment results showed that salt types and ionic strength had significant effects on the stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics while ph had none aggregation and stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment followed colloidal theory dlvo theory and schulze hardy rule similar to other colloidal particles the critical coagulation concentration ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were lower for cacl2 0 1 mm compared to nacl 80 mm and mgcl2 3 mm similarly ccc values of polystyrene nanospheres were 10 mm for cacl2 800 mm for nacl and 25 mm for mgcl2 it implies that cacl2 destabilized both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics more aggressively than nacl and mgcl2 moreover polystyrene nanospheres are more stable in the aquatic environment than polyethylene nanoscale plastics however natural organic matter improved the stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in water primarily due to steric repulsion increasing ccc values to 0 4 mm 120 mm and 8 mm for cacl2 nacl and mgcl2 respectively stability studies with various water conditions demonstrated that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be fairly stable in the natural surface waters conversely synthetic surface water wastewater seawater and groundwater rapidly destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics overall our findings indicate that significant aqueous transport of nanoscale plastics will be possible in natural surface waters graphical abstract image 1 toc art keywords polyethylene polystyrene nanoscale plastics aggregation stability 1 introduction occurrence and accumulation of plastic materials in the environment have recently become a major concern and global environmental threat rillig 2012 the most commonly detected plastics in the environment are polymers with a carbon backbone such as polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps andrady 2011 rochman et al 2013 wright et al 2013 among all polyethylene and polystyrene are most used especially in personal care products kitchen appliances disposable drinking cups packaging material and thus a higher chance of finding their way into the environment lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 gausepohl and nieβner 2001 beach 1972 gouin et al 2015 microbeads used in different personal care products as exfoliants are termed as primary microplastics as they are manufactured explicitly in the micrometer size range and for specific purposes von moos et al 2012 zitko and hanlon 1991 on the other hand secondary microplastics are formed due to the degradation of larger disposed plastics including car tires agricultural plastic mulch microfibers from textiles etc as the usage and disposal of these plastics increased over time the occurrence of plastics in the environment has also accelerated both primary microplastics microbeads are likely to be washed down through drainage systems and into wastewater treatment plants wwtps fendall and sewell 2009 lechner and ramler 2015 according to a study around 8 trillion pieces of microplastics enter the aquatic environment per day through wwtp rochman et al 2015 most current wwtps are not designed to remove micro or nanoscale plastics entirely fendall and sewell 2009 leslie et al 2013 due to their size or density ziajahromi et al 2016b be released into the freshwater environment with effluent carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 and end up in our drinking water which indicates potential consumption of nanoscale plastics by human fendall and sewell 2009 lechner and ramler 2015 leslie et al 2013 mary kosuth et al 2017 moreover micro or nanoscale plastics in the raw wastewater gets retained in sewage sludge magnusson and norén 2014 ziajahromi et al 2016a the widespread application of this sludge to agricultural purposes is likely to pose unknown consequences to human or livestock health nizzetto et al 2016a 2016b irrespective of the source of entry both primary and secondary plastics eventually break down into microplastics law and thompson 2014 via chemical mechanical biological etc processes and eventually to nanoscale plastics through uv radiation mechanical abrasion biological degradation etc corcoran et al 2009 lambert et al 2013 shim et al 2014 this has become a recent concern due to limited information on their behavior and fate in the environment even though there is a disagreement in the size values of different plastics for the current study plastics within the size range of 1 nm to 1 μm are referred to as nanoscale plastics microplastics or its derivatives similar to nanoparticles syberg et al 2015 can penetrate human organs via cell barrier and cause cytotoxicity and metabolic disorders bothun 2008 lewinski et al 2008 liu et al 2018 rasch et al 2010 yousefi and tufenkji 2016 yousefi et al 2016 these micro and nanoscale plastics can also undergo various transformations that can influence their aggregation and deposition behavior and potentially aggravate the associated environmental hazards bouwmeester et al 2015 cózar et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 some previous studies have researched on the behavior of microplastics in soils and waters however to the best of our knowledge the presence and impact of nanoscale plastics 100 nm in natural systems have been neglected which could represent a considerable future challenge for monitoring and risk assessment alimi et al 2018 in the u s there is still a shortcoming on strict regulations on micro and nanoscale plastics whereas in other countries the limit is so high as to be ineffective alimi et al 2018 lechner et al 2014 moreover as the plastic material comes in a wide variety of sizes forms and types varying in specific gravity structure and general characteristics andrady 2011 barany et al 2012 cai et al 2018 lefèvre et al 2009 ohsawa et al 1986 pesudovs 2000 more research needs to be conducted with a wide range of sizes and types of nanoscale plastics similar to nanoparticles nanoscale plastics are also emerging contaminants and parallels were drawn from their detailed characteristics overview in a study hüffer et al 2017 from that study it was evident that fate research of nanoparticles can be transferred to nanoscale plastics especially environmental transformation and transport sample preparation for particle analysis and characterization techniques for nanoparticles can be applied to nanoscale plastics as well previous studies for engineered nanomaterials showed that aggregation with suspended solids and subsequent sedimentation is the most likely removal process for these particles in water praetorius et al 2012 quik et al 2011 2015 therefore here the early stage aggregation kinetics of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics under various environmentally relevant solution chemistries have been investigated these include variations in monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 and mgcl2 salt concentrations and the presence of natural organic matter suwannee river humic acid as mentioned earlier polyethylene and polystyrene are the commonly detected plastic in the environment lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 they were selected for the present study additionally stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics has been determined in columbia river water crw along with synthetic surface water groundwater seawater and wastewater to simulate the aquatic systems this current study on different types of plastics could serve as a fundamental framework to do more research in future with a variety of plastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethylene nanospheres 0 95 g cc density 200 nm 9900nm diameter were purchased from cospheric llc ca usa the surfactant used for the dispersion of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics was sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant oecd 2005 provided by thermo fisher scientific carboxyl modified polystyrene latex 4 w v 0 028 μm were purchased from thermo fisher scientific all aqueous solutions were prepared with milli q deionized water 18 mω water depending on the usage hydrophobic plastics undergo surface functionalization with different functional groups moreover plastics that end up in the aquatic environment might get coated with surfactants as well these surface modifications make plastic hydrophilic in nature and help them for dispersion so plastics in the environment do not remain in their pristine state hence we selected our materials considering these surface modifications in the natural aquatic environment however our study is limited to only spherical particles and particles coated with one specific substance whereas in actual environment the plastics could be coated with a mixture of substances 2 2 preparation of nanoscale plastics dispersion polystyrene latex was purchased in a suspension of de ionized water and was diluted to 40 mg l with di water as a stock solution for subsequent experiments polyethylene nanoscale plastics solution was prepared by mixing polyethylene nanoscale plastics with mq water following the procedure used for nanomaterials islam et al 2003 o connell et al 2002 strano et al 2003b then 0 1 wt sds was added to the solution the mixture was sonicated for 30 min or until the sds powder completely dissolved and polyethylene nanoscale plastics were in suspension the flask was placed in a bath of ice water during sonication in order to prevent the temperature rise of the mixture for homogenous size distribution and to remove the larger sized particles prepared polyethylene nanoscale plastics suspension was filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter so that the filtrate contains small size nanoscale plastics the final concentration of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics stock solution was 40 mg l which was quantified with the calibration curve prepared by uv vis spectroscopy 2 3 selection of surfactant for polyethylene nanoscale plastics dispersion due to the hydrophobic nature of polyethylene nanoscale plastics sds surfactant was used to disperse polyethylene nanoscale plastics mintenig et al 2018 sds is extensively used both for fundamental studies as well as in many industrial applications such as in car wash soap engine degreasers and floor cleaners personal care products etc so it is likely that they will end up in the environment similar to our polyethylene nanoscale plastics and will also interact with them tadros 2006 previous studies with engineered nanoparticles also showed that fate of nanoparticles will be highly dependent both on their released form and on the physicochemical characteristics of the receiving waterbody which could include the presence of sds collin et al 2014 cornelis 2015 goldberg et al 2015 louie et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2014 in particular surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate sds have been studied for their excellent nanotube stabilization separation capabilities and it is also a commonly used surfactant islam et al 2003 o connell et al 2002 strano et al 2003b moreover sds is commonly used as an additive for plastics to do surface functionalization koelmans et al 2015 2005 péron et al 2007 the production of everyday plastics would not be possible without surfactants which are used in both emulsion and suspension polymerization production processes falbe 2012 2 4 aquatic chemistry suwannee river humic acid standard ii international humic substances society was used to prepare the natural organic matter nom suspension at a concentration of 5 mg l toc these noms have been previously used as model or standard substances in many aggregation fate and transport studies chen et al 2006 chowdhury et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2010 calcium chloride cacl2 2h20 cas 10035048 sodium chloride nacl cas 7647 14 5 and magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h20 cas 7791 18 6 were used to prepare salt solutions 1 10 30 50 80 100 120 mm nacl 0 01 0 05 0 08 0 1 0 5 1 mm cacl2 and 0 5 1 3 4 5

from 2 to 10 using naoh and hcl 2 5 characterization of nanoscale plastics to observe the material and aggregate morphology tescan vega 3 scanning electron microscope sem was used to obtain sem images fig 1 ftir measurements were performed directly on polyethylene nanoscale plastics using attenuated total reflection atr mode on a nicolet is50 atr ir with ge crystal fig s1 the ftir analysis method uses infrared light to scan test samples and observe chemical properties ultraviolet uv visible spectroscopy spectra figs s2 and s3 was collected using a perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible absorbance spectrophotometer to monitor both the polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics concentration and changes in light absorption properties electrophoretic mobility epm zeta potential zp and hydrodynamic diameter dh of the particles were measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments inc equipped with a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm nom

kinetics of nanoscale plastics at different aquatic chemistry conditions salt type is and presence of organic matter was determined in terms of hydrodynamic size measurement this change in the size of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was measured with respect to time by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls bouchard et al 2012 both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics concentration of 20 mg l provided a strong dls signal and therefore was used in all aggregation studies polyethylene nanoscale plastics solutions were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter millipore u s a for homogeneous size distribution equal volumes 800 μl of nanoscale plastics suspension and electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 or mgcl2 were pipetted into a quartz cuvette to achieve a specific nanoscale plastics and electrolyte concentration the cuvette was immediately placed in the dls instrument after bath sonicating for 5 s the intensity of scattered light was measured at 173 and the autocorrelation function was allowed to accumulate for 15 s during aggregation study the hydrodynamic diameter dh measurements were conducted over periods ranging from 30 to 300 min the initial aggregation period was defined as the time period from experiment initiation t0 to the time when measured dh values exceeded 1 50 dh initial bouchard et al 2012 the initial aggregation rate constants ka for the nanoscale plastics are proportional to the initial rate of increase of dh with time chen and elimelech 2006 1 k a 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n0 is the initial particle concentration the particle attachment efficiency α is used to quantify particle aggregation kinetics it is defined as the initial aggregation rate constant ka normalized by the aggregation rate

nanoscale plastic across all samples in aggregation experiments was identical equation 2 can be simplified i e n0 drops out and α can be determined directly by normalizing the initial slope of the aggregation profile for a specific background solution chemistry by the initial slope under diffusion limited fast conditions chen and elimelech 2006 note that α is the inverse of the fuchs stability ratio w commonly used in colloidal stability studies critical coagulation concentrations ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were determined from the intersection of extrapolated lines through the diffusion and reaction limited regimes 2 7 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory has been applied to understand the influence of electrostatic and van der waals forces on the interaction among nanoscale plastics with and without nom derjaguin 1954 overbeek 1999a the dlvo theory explains the aggregation of aqueous dispersions quantitatively and describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium it combines the effects of the van der waals attraction and the electrostatic repulsion gregory 2005 dlvo interaction energies between nanoscale plastics separated by a distance h were calculated assuming a sphere sphere geometry by utilizing the following equations elimelech et al 1997 3 v e l 2 π ε

place of surface potentials ψp 100 nm was assumed as characteristic dielectric wavelength λ elimelech et al 1997 2 8 stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in different water conditions the stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in different water conditions was investigated to observe the behavior of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in complex environmental relevant conditions five different types of water were used natural surface water was collected from columbia river water a point near lower granite point wa apart from the natural water the behavior of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in synthetic water was also investigated synthetic surface water yip et al 2011 groundwater bolster et al 1999 and seawater stewart and munjal 1970 were prepared following recipes mentioned in the supplementary information tables s1 and s2 the chemical composition of the synthetic wastewater was based on secondary effluent quality from wastewater treatment plants in california as summarized in table s3 boo et al 2013 sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa purchased from sigma aldrich were used as model polysaccharides and protein foulant respectively for this study detailed characteristics of these waters are provided in the supporting information tables s1 s2 s3 aggregation kinetics of 20 mg l polyethylene nanoscale plastics at these water conditions was determined in terms of hydrodynamic size measurement 2 9 statistical analysis statistical testing was employed for data analysis two sample t tests for hypothesis testing were conducted using originpro 2016 software originlab corporation ma to guarantee the statistical significance of the conclusions probability values p of less than 0 05 were considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of polyethylene nanoscale plastics fig 1 contains a representative sem image of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in miliq water before left image and after right image filter from which the particle size distribution was determined using imagej software the particle size distribution before the filter was determined to be from 300 to 6100 nm from 146 particles which is within the range of the size distribution provided by cospheric llc ca usa after filter larger size particles were filtered evident from the sem images and the particle size distribution was determined to be from 200 to 750 nm from 100 particles which makes a homogeneous size distribution figure s1 shows the characteristics absorbance bands for polyethylene which are located at 2916 cm 1 c h asymmetrical stretching vibration 2855 cm 1 c h symmetrical stretching vibration 1475 cm 1 ch2 scissoring vibration 718 cm 1 ch2 rocking vibration the 1475 cm 1 716 cm 1 peaks are used to identify and quantify the presence of polyethylene d amelia et al 2016 gulmine et al 2002 3 2 electrokinetic and hydrodynamic characterization 3 2 1 influence of ph on surface charge and size epm measurements using zetasizer nano zs fig s4b showed that polyethylene nanoscale plastics remained highly negatively charged over the ph range from 2 to 9 from 2 39 1 22 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 2 44 0 33 μmcm vs at ph 9 at 10 mm nacl this indicates that either polyethylene nanoscale plastics don t have any isoelectric point iep barany et al 2012 lefèvre et al 2009 ohsawa et al 1986 or they have isoelectric point below ph 2 moreover pka for sds is 1 99 due to which isoelectric point was not observed at the studied ph range chakraborty et al 2009 strano et al 2003a and maintaining ph below 2 without sacrificing control of the is 10 mm was not possible the change of hydrodynamic diameter to different ph at 10 mm nacl fig s4a was similar to epm measurements with polyethylene nanoscale plastics size remaining statistically constant from 217 95 24 61 nm to 310 29 165 58 nm from ph 2 to 9 epm measurements of polystyrene nanospheres fig s5b also showed that polystyrene nanospheres are negatively charged over the ph range from 2 to 9 from 0 76 0 10 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 2 52 0 17 μmcm vs at ph 9 at 10 mm nacl and they don t have any isoelectric point iep similar to polyethylene nanoscale plastic absolute values of polystyrene epms increased from ph 2 to ph 5 from 0 76 0 10 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 1 93 0 02 μmcm vs at ph 5 while epms remained very similar from ph 6 to 9 2 87 0 67 μmcm vs to 2 52 0 17 μmcm vs this change in epm with ph fig s5b is due to the dissociable functional groups on polystyrene nanospheres similar to other carbon based materials bouchard et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 the change of hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres fig s5a to different ph at 10 mm nacl was similar to epm measurements with polystyrene hydrodynamic diameter decreasing from ph 2 to ph 5 3700 nm 1100 nm as predicted by colloidal theory verwey and overbeek 1948 then remaining quite constant from ph 5 to 9 900 nm the ph in the aquatic environment usually remains between 5 and 9 crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 as there are no notable changes in electrokinetic and hydrodynamic properties of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics within this range it is likely that ph will not affect the behavior of these nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment thus the aggregation kinetics and stability of nanoscale plastics were investigated at an unadjusted ph 5 0 2 in this study 3 2 2 influence of salt type and ionic strength polyethylene nanoscale plastic is highly negatively charged epm is 4 60 0 44 μmcm vs and zp is 58 7 5 57 mv in mq water this high negative charge indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are electrically stabilized with hydrodynamic diameter of 376 36 34 47 nm due to the large electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics gregory 2005 epm values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics remain highly negative around 5 03 0 19 μmcm vs to 3 95 0 86 μmcm vs at low nacl concentration 1 mm 50 mm fig 2 b epm decreases from 3 95 0 86 μmcm vs to 2 07 0 83 μmcm vs when nacl concentration was increased from 50 mm to 120 mm fig 2b the decrease in surface charge with an increase in ionic strength is due to electrical double layer compression as predicted by dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 verwey and overbeek 1948 similar trends were observed for nanomaterials including go and multiwalled carbon nanotubes as well chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 from 1 to 50 mm nacl hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics remained quite constant 680 nm respectively fig 2a above 50 mm nacl the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics became less negative with is which resulted in a decrease in dh from 679 22 7 45 nm to 282 25 165 08 nm fig 2a this observation deviates from the classical behavior predicted by dlvo theory it is hypothesized that at higher salt levels the dispersion forces on the ions can be dominating when dispersion potentials are accounted for there may be a rise to either accumulation or depletion of ions close to an interface the dispersion potentials may change both in magnitude and sign depending on the optical properties of the interacting surfaces the salt solution and the ions this could give rise to reduced or enhanced double layer forces and result in a reduction of apparent size boström et al 2001 in surface waters the concentration of monovalent ions i e na is less than 10 mm crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 indicating that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be stable in natural aquatic environments dominated by these monovalent cations however ca2 and mg2 influenced the epm and hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics more prominently than monovalent na a notable decrease in epm values was observed for low concentrations of cacl2 from 0 01 mm to 0 05 mm and mgcl2 from 0 5 to 1 mm whereas significant decrease in epm and subsequent electrical double layer compression was not observed for nacl until 80 mm fig 2b this is because of higher electrical double layer compression from divalent ions with respect to monovalent ions as described in classical colloidal theory elimelech et al 1995 ion complexation with sds could be another mechanism for the destabilization of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of ca2 and mg2 sammalkorpi et al 2009 shen et al 2005 yan et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 as is increased from 0 01 mm to 1 mm for cacl2 epm values decreased from 4 85 0 16 μmcm vs to 3 46 0 19 μmcm vs and as is increased from 0 5 mm to 5 mm for mgcl2 epm values decreased from 3 19 0 16 μmcm vs to 0 61 0 37 μmcm vs fig 2b similar trends were observed for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide nanomaterials in the presence of divalent cations chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 however hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was significantly different for cacl2 and mgcl2 as a function of is after 0 08 mm cacl2 and 3 mm mgcl2 increase in hydrodynamic diameter was observed indicating greater effect of divalent cations on polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation fig 2a the average hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres in mq water is 43 62 0 22 nm and electrophoretic mobility epm is 4 51 0 28 μmcm vs this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are negatively charged in water epm decreases to 3 64 0 41 μmcm vs with introduction of 10 mm nacl and decreased further to 2 68 0 11 μmcm vs with increasing nacl concentration fig 3 b the decrease in surface charge with an increase in ionic strength is due to electrical double layer compression as predicted by dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 verwey and overbeek 1948 however from 10 to 150 mm nacl the hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres remained quite constant 42 nm fig 3a which implies that polystyrene nanospheres will be stable in natural aquatic environments even at high nacl concentration both cacl2 and mgcl2 influenced the epm of polystyrene nanospheres more aggressively than monovalent nacl fig 3b minor charge screening of polystyrene nanospheres was observed even as low as 0 5 mm for both cacl2 and mgcl2 while significant electrical double layer compression was not observed for nacl until 150 mm this is because of higher electrical double layer compression from divalent ions with respect to monovalent ions as described in classical colloidal theory elimelech et al 1995 epms and hydrodynamic size of polystyrene nanospheres were quite similar as a function of is for both cacl2 and mgcl2 no notable size increase for polystyrene nanospheres was observed until 1 mm for both divalent ions fig 3a although significant charge screening was observed after 1 mm the hydrodynamic size of polystyrene nanospheres increased a little but not significant for both cacl2 and mgcl2 fig 3a 3 2 3 influence of natural organic matter the effect of nom on the electrokinetic and hydrodynamic properties of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 is reported in table s4 in the supporting information the nom concentration was varied from 0 5 to 5 mg l toc generally in the presence of nom both electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion contribute to the stabilization of colloids chen and elimelech 2007 jiang et al 2017 saleh et al 2008 smith et al 2012 for the present study nom concentration had a negligible effect on the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in all three salt types investigated this suggests that sorbed nom molecules may carry the similar amount of charges to those on the surface of polyethylene nanoscale plastics liu et al 2016 and electrostatic repulsion is not significant enough to cause stabilization however the addition of nom reduced the hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics under all three salt types this indicates that steric repulsion due to the sorption of nom on polyethylene nanoscale plastics which was visible by the change in surface morphology in the sem image in fig s11 may be the dominant mechanism in polyethylene nanoscale plastics stabilization saleh et al 2010 3 3 aggregation kinetics 3 3 1 influence of ionic strength is fig s6 shows the aggregation kinetics profiles of polyethylene nanoscale plastics as a function of nacl concentration attachment efficiency α as a function of salt concentration is shown in fig 4 a which also showed a very distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes this indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation follows derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory overbeek 1999b in the reaction limited regime α increased from approximately 12 100 as nacl concentration increased from 1 to 80 mm is beyond 80 mm did not increase α which indicates that electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics is completely suppressed and the diffusion limited regime starts near 80 mm nacl chowdhury et al 2012 dlvo interaction profiles between polyethylene nanoscale plastics polyethylene nanoscale plastics are generated assuming sphere sphere geometry fig s7 large energy barrier 50 kt observed at 1 mm nacl explains the negligible aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in this condition increased is from 1 mm to 80 mm led to reduced energy barrier which resulted in higher aggregation as observed from aggregation experiments fig 4a indicates the ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics is around 80 mm nacl our study is the first to report the ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics as a result no direct comparison to previously published studies can be made the average hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres in mq water is 43 62 0 22 nm the hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres remained stable at high ionic strength 100 mm nacl with a size of 43 nm fig s8 no aggregation was observed for polystyrene nanospheres even at 200 mm nacl fig s8 from the attachment efficiency values showed in fig 5 a calculated from the aggregation profiles fig s8 we can see that ccc value of polystyrene nanospheres is 800 mm nacl which is 10 times greater than polyethylene nanoscale plastics ccc in nacl dlvo profiles of polystyrene nanospheres fig s9 indicates the presence of high energy barrier even at high ionic strength 200 mm nacl which means greater stability of polystyrene nanospheres at high ionic strength of nacl from these results it can be said that polystyrene nanospheres are more stable than polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cai et al 2018 this may be due to the aromatic content in polystyrenens structure or its surface functionalization bastos and de las nieves 1994 sakota and okaya 1977 sastri 2010 3 3 2 influence of salt types similar to nacl attachment efficiency as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 salt concentration fig 4b c 5b 5c also showed a very distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes for both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics for cacl2 polyethylene nanoscale plastics α increased sharply from 20 to 100 with increasing is from 0 01 to 0 1 mm the ccc value determined from fig 4b is 0 1 mm cacl2 significantly lower than the ccc value for polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cai et al 2018 according to the schulze hardy rule the ccc ratio for nacl and cacl2 should be z 6 for colloids with high surface charge where z is the valence of ca2 ions z 2 gregory 2005 in our study the ratio of ccc values for cacl2 and nacl is proportional to z 9 6 which is quite high compared with the schulz hardy rule it implies that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are sensitive to ca2 cations this could be attributed to the specific adsorption capacity of ca2 ions called bridging effect gutierrez et al 2010 nguyen and chen 2007 pham et al 2009 in a previous study polystyrene nanoscale plastics were stable in wide ionic strength solutions of cacl2 0 1 15 mm cai et al 2018 which again indicates that ccc value 0 1 mm cacl2 of polyethylene nanoscale plastics is notably lower than polystyrene nanoscale plastics on the other hand for mgcl2 minimal aggregation was observed at concentrations below 0 5 mm polyethylene nanoscale plastics α increased sharply from 10 to 100 with increasing is from 0 5 to 3 mm the ccc value determined from fig 4c is 3 mm mgcl2 significantly higher than the ccc value for cacl2 this implies that ca2 is more effective than mg2 in destabilizing polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment the ratio of ccc values for mgcl2 and nacl is proportional to z 4 8 which is reasonable as the schulze hardy rule predicts a proportionality to z 6 for particles of high surface charge also it has also been reported that a much weaker dependence on the counterion charge z 2 exists for particles with low surface charge elimelech et al 1995 overall results suggest that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are more sensitive to divalent cations especially ca2 ions than monovalent cations no aggregation was observed for polystyrene nanospheres even at 3 mm cacl2 and 3 mm mgcl2 as the size of polystyrene nanospheres remains 43 nm figs s8b and s8c with an increase of ionic strength for both cacl2 and mgcl2 significant aggregation of polystyrene nanospheres was observed ccc values were observed to be 10 mm for cacl2 and 25 mm for mgcl2 for polystyrene nanospheres this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are also sensitive to divalent ions especially ca2 cations following schulz hardy rule from these results we can also predict that trivalent cations will affect aggregation and stability of nanoscale plastics in aquatic environment even more than divalent and monovalent cations according to schulz hardy rule which was observed with other nanomaterials too oncsik et al 2014 ruiz cabello et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in contrast to the good stability of polystyrene nanospheres and higher ccc values polyethylene nanoscale plastics undergo obvious aggregation with low ionic strength of nacl and cacl2 this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are more stable than polyethylene nanoscale plastics due to the surface functionalization presence of carboxyl functional groups of polystyrene nanospheres bastos and de las nieves 1994 sakota and okaya 1977 3 3 3 influence of natural organic matter for 80 mm nacl the addition of 5 mg l toc nom reduced α from 100 to 50 fig 4a while α decreased from 100 to 60 for 0 1 mm cacl2 fig 4b the significant decrease in attachment efficiencies is attributed to non dlvo steric interactions imparted by the adsorbed nom saleh et al 2010 there was no significant effect of nom concentration on the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics table s4 indicating that there are no electrostatic interactions between polyethylene nanoscale plastics and nom to cause polyethylene nanoscale plastics stabilization steric stabilization by nom has been observed for multi walled carbon nanotubes and aquatic colloids in a previous study saleh et al 2008 the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of 5 mg l toc nom were 120 mm nacl 1 5 times higher than observed without nom 80 mm nacl 0 4 mm cacl2 4 times higher than observed without nom 0 1 mm cacl2 and 8 mm mgcl2 2 66 times higher than observed without nom 3 mm mgcl2 in the presence of 5 mg l nom the ratio of ccc values between cacl2 and nacl was proportional to z 8 which is quite close to what was observed in the absence of nom similarly the ratio of ccc values between mgcl2 and nacl was proportional to z 4 which is also quite close to what was observed in without nom 3 4 stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in various water conditions initial aggregation studies measure the stability of nanomaterials over concise time frames 3 4 1 aggregation kinetics aggregation kinetics of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were explored in five different types of waters for 60 min to determine the initial stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics fig s12 natural environment is a very complex ecosystem so we mainly used synthetic waters to simulate engineered aquatic environments and to understand the fundamental behavior of these nanoscale plastics however we did use columbia river water as our natural water to observe the changes in the behavior of these nanoscale plastics in natural environment compared to an engineered environment aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was not observed in columbia river water due to low concentration of ca2 4 10 4 mm na 0 17 mm mg2 0 05 mm and the presence of substantial nom 22 05 mg l toc indicating that polyethylene nanoplastics will be highly stable in natural river water on the other hand surface water without nom destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics as it contained 0 33 mm ca2 which is well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 0 1 mm seawater also destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics but faster compared to surface water synthetic seawater contained 10 mm ca2 500 mm na and 54 4 mm mg2 all of which are well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 nacl and mgcl2 synthetic groundwater and wastewater contained 0 68 mm ca2 and 0 5 mm ca2 respectively which is also well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 and this caused significant aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in groundwater and wastewater as well overall the study indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation will be dominated by divalent ions especially cacl2 and the presence of nom 4 conclusions the colloidal stability of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in environmentally relevant conditions was investigated in this study it was found in this study that ph will have a negligible effect on the fate and transport of nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment results indicate that polystyrene plastics are more stable compared to polyethylene nanoscale plastics even at high ionic strength we also found that divalent ions especially cacl2 play significant role in the destabilization while adding nom can increase the stability of nanoscale plastics from the initial aggregation kinetics data it can be anticipated that most of polyethylene nanoscale plastics will settle out during the wastewater treatment process and end up in biosolids sludge and ultimately landfills and as fertilizer whereas for polystyrene heteroaggregation with other suspended particles would be necessary for the plastics to settle due to their density however significant aqueous transport of these nanoscale plastics will be possible in natural surface water therefore it is imperative that different organizations impose laws and regulations to limit or prevent the use of microplastics in commercial products and at the same time people should be educated on the proper management of plastic waste and importance of plastic recycling this fundamental colloidal study with polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics could serve as a basis to do more

18204,the widespread use and release of plastics in nature have raised global concerns about their impact on public health and the environment while much research has been conducted on macro and micro sized plastics the fate of nanoscale plastics remains unexplored in this study the aggregation kinetics and stability of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics were investigated over a wide range of aquatic chemistries ph salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 ionic strength relevant to the natural environment results showed that salt types and ionic strength had significant effects on the stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics while ph had none aggregation and stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment followed colloidal theory dlvo theory and schulze hardy rule similar to other colloidal particles the critical coagulation concentration ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were lower for cacl2 0 1 mm compared to nacl 80 mm and mgcl2 3 mm similarly ccc values of polystyrene nanospheres were 10 mm for cacl2 800 mm for nacl and 25 mm for mgcl2 it implies that cacl2 destabilized both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics more aggressively than nacl and mgcl2 moreover polystyrene nanospheres are more stable in the aquatic environment than polyethylene nanoscale plastics however natural organic matter improved the stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in water primarily due to steric repulsion increasing ccc values to 0 4 mm 120 mm and 8 mm for cacl2 nacl and mgcl2 respectively stability studies with various water conditions demonstrated that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be fairly stable in the natural surface waters conversely synthetic surface water wastewater seawater and groundwater rapidly destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics overall our findings indicate that significant aqueous transport of nanoscale plastics will be possible in natural surface waters graphical abstract image 1 toc art keywords polyethylene polystyrene nanoscale plastics aggregation stability 1 introduction occurrence and accumulation of plastic materials in the environment have recently become a major concern and global environmental threat rillig 2012 the most commonly detected plastics in the environment are polymers with a carbon backbone such as

geckeler 2011 gausepohl and nieβner 2001 beach 1972 gouin et al 2015 microbeads used in different personal care products as exfoliants are termed as primary microplastics as they are manufactured explicitly in the micrometer size range and for specific purposes von moos et al 2012 zitko and hanlon 1991 on the other hand secondary microplastics are formed due to the degradation of larger disposed plastics including car tires agricultural plastic mulch microfibers from textiles etc as the usage and disposal of these plastics increased over time the occurrence of plastics in the environment has also accelerated both primary microplastics microbeads are likely to be washed down through drainage systems and into wastewater treatment plants wwtps fendall and sewell 2009 lechner

agricultural purposes is likely to pose unknown consequences to human or livestock health nizzetto et al 2016a 2016b irrespective of the source of entry both primary and secondary plastics eventually break down into microplastics law and thompson 2014 via chemical mechanical biological etc processes and eventually to nanoscale plastics through uv radiation mechanical abrasion biological degradation etc corcoran et al 2009 lambert et al 2013 shim et al 2014 this has become a recent concern due to limited information on their behavior and fate in the environment even though there is a disagreement in the size values of different plastics for the current study plastics within the size range of 1 nm to 1 μm are referred to as nanoscale plastics microplastics or its derivatives similar to nanoparticles syberg et al 2015 can penetrate human organs via cell barrier and cause cytotoxicity and metabolic disorders bothun 2008 lewinski et al 2008 liu et al 2018 rasch et al 2010 yousefi and tufenkji 2016 yousefi et al 2016 these micro and nanoscale plastics can also undergo various transformations that can influence their aggregation and deposition behavior and potentially aggravate the associated environmental hazards bouwmeester et al 2015 cózar et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 some previous studies have researched on the behavior of microplastics in soils and waters however to the best of our knowledge the presence and impact of nanoscale plastics 100 nm in natural systems have been neglected which could represent a considerable future challenge for monitoring and risk assessment alimi et al 2018 in the u s there is still a shortcoming on strict regulations on micro and nanoscale plastics whereas in other countries the limit is so high as to be ineffective alimi et al 2018 lechner et al 2014 moreover as the plastic material comes in a wide variety of sizes forms and types varying in specific gravity structure and general characteristics andrady 2011 barany et al 2012 cai et al 2018 lefèvre et al 2009 ohsawa et al 1986 pesudovs 2000 more research needs to be conducted with a wide range of sizes and types of nanoscale plastics similar to nanoparticles nanoscale plastics are also emerging contaminants and parallels were drawn from their detailed characteristics overview in a study hüffer et al 2017 from that study it was evident that fate research of nanoparticles can be transferred to nanoscale plastics especially environmental transformation and transport sample preparation for particle analysis and characterization techniques for nanoparticles can be applied to nanoscale plastics as well previous studies for engineered nanomaterials showed that aggregation with suspended solids and subsequent sedimentation is the most likely removal process for these particles in water praetorius et al 2012 quik et al 2011 2015 therefore here the early stage aggregation kinetics of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics under various environmentally relevant solution chemistries have been investigated these include variations in monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 and mgcl2 salt concentrations and the presence of natural organic matter suwannee river humic acid as mentioned earlier polyethylene and polystyrene are the commonly detected plastic in the environment lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 they were selected for the present study additionally stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics has been determined in columbia river water crw along with synthetic surface water groundwater seawater and wastewater to simulate the aquatic systems this current study on different types of plastics could serve as a fundamental framework to do more research in future with a variety of plastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethylene nanospheres 0 95 g cc density 200 nm 9900nm diameter were purchased from cospheric llc ca usa the surfactant used for the dispersion of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics was sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant oecd 2005 provided by thermo fisher scientific carboxyl modified polystyrene latex 4 w v 0 028 μm were purchased from thermo fisher scientific all aqueous solutions were prepared with milli q deionized water 18 mω water depending on the usage hydrophobic plastics undergo surface functionalization with different functional groups moreover plastics that end up in the aquatic environment might get coated with surfactants as well these surface modifications make plastic hydrophilic in nature and help them for dispersion so plastics in the environment do not remain in their pristine state hence we selected our materials considering these surface modifications in the natural aquatic environment however our study is limited to only spherical particles and particles coated with one specific substance whereas in actual environment the plastics could be coated with a mixture of substances 2 2 preparation of nanoscale plastics dispersion polystyrene latex was purchased in a suspension of de ionized water and was diluted to 40 mg l with di water as a stock solution for subsequent experiments polyethylene nanoscale plastics solution was prepared by mixing polyethylene nanoscale plastics with mq water following the procedure used for nanomaterials islam et al 2003 o connell et al 2002 strano et al 2003b then 0 1 wt sds was added to the solution the mixture was sonicated for 30 min or until the sds powder completely dissolved and polyethylene nanoscale plastics were in suspension the flask was placed in a bath of ice water during sonication in order to prevent the temperature rise of the mixture for homogenous size distribution and to remove the larger sized particles prepared polyethylene nanoscale plastics suspension was filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter so that the filtrate contains small size nanoscale plastics the final concentration of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics stock solution was 40 mg l which was quantified with the calibration curve prepared by uv vis spectroscopy 2 3 selection of surfactant for polyethylene nanoscale plastics dispersion due to the hydrophobic nature of polyethylene nanoscale plastics sds surfactant was used to disperse polyethylene nanoscale plastics mintenig et al 2018 sds is extensively used both for fundamental studies as well as in many industrial applications such as in car wash soap engine degreasers and floor cleaners personal care products etc so it is likely that they will end up in the environment similar to our polyethylene nanoscale plastics and will also interact with them tadros 2006 previous studies with engineered nanoparticles also showed that fate of nanoparticles will be highly dependent both on their released form and on the physicochemical characteristics of the receiving waterbody which could include the presence of sds collin et al 2014 cornelis 2015 goldberg et al 2015 louie et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2014 in particular surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate sds have been studied for their excellent nanotube stabilization separation capabilities and it is also a commonly used surfactant islam et al 2003 o connell et al 2002 strano et al 2003b moreover sds is commonly used as an additive for plastics to do surface functionalization koelmans et al 2015 2005 péron et al 2007 the production of everyday plastics would not be possible without surfactants which are used in both emulsion and suspension polymerization production processes falbe 2012 2 4 aquatic chemistry suwannee river humic acid standard ii international humic substances society was used to prepare the natural organic matter nom suspension at a concentration of 5 mg l toc these noms have been previously used as model or standard substances in many aggregation fate and transport studies chen et al 2006 chowdhury et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2010 calcium chloride cacl2 2h20 cas 10035048 sodium chloride nacl cas 7647 14 5 and magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h20 cas 7791 18 6 were used to prepare salt solutions 1 10 30 50 80 100 120 mm nacl 0 01 0 05 0 08 0 1 0 5 1 mm cacl2 and 0 5 1 3 4 5

uses infrared light to scan test samples and observe chemical properties ultraviolet uv visible spectroscopy spectra figs s2 and s3 was collected using a perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible absorbance spectrophotometer to monitor both the polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics concentration and changes in light absorption properties electrophoretic mobility epm zeta potential zp and

kinetics of nanoscale plastics at different aquatic chemistry conditions salt type is and presence of organic matter was determined in terms of hydrodynamic size measurement this change in the size of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was measured with respect to time by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls bouchard et al 2012 both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics concentration of 20 mg l provided a strong dls signal and therefore was used in all aggregation studies polyethylene nanoscale plastics solutions were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter millipore u s a for homogeneous size distribution equal volumes 800 μl of nanoscale plastics suspension and electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 or mgcl2 were pipetted into a quartz cuvette to achieve a specific nanoscale plastics and electrolyte concentration the cuvette was immediately placed in the dls instrument after bath sonicating for 5 s the intensity of scattered light was measured at 173 and the autocorrelation function was allowed to accumulate for 15 s during aggregation study the hydrodynamic diameter dh measurements were conducted over periods ranging from 30 to 300 min the initial aggregation period was defined as the time period from experiment initiation t0 to the time when measured dh values exceeded 1 50 dh initial bouchard et al 2012 the initial aggregation rate constants ka for the nanoscale plastics are proportional to the initial rate of increase of dh with time chen and elimelech 2006 1 k a 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n0 is the initial particle

aggregation profile for a specific background solution chemistry by the initial slope under diffusion limited fast conditions chen and elimelech 2006 note that α is the inverse of the fuchs stability ratio w commonly used in colloidal stability studies critical coagulation concentrations ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were determined from the intersection of extrapolated lines through the diffusion and reaction limited regimes 2 7 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory has been applied to understand the influence of electrostatic and van der waals forces on the interaction among nanoscale plastics with and without nom derjaguin 1954 overbeek 1999a the dlvo theory explains the aggregation of aqueous dispersions quantitatively and describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium it combines the effects of the van der waals attraction and the electrostatic repulsion gregory 2005

stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in different water conditions was investigated to observe the behavior of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in complex environmental relevant conditions five different types of water were used natural surface water was collected from columbia river water a point near lower granite point wa apart from the natural water the behavior of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in synthetic water was also investigated synthetic surface water yip et al 2011 groundwater bolster et al 1999 and seawater stewart and munjal 1970 were prepared following recipes mentioned in the supplementary information tables s1 and s2 the chemical composition of the synthetic wastewater was based on secondary effluent quality from wastewater treatment plants in california as summarized in table s3 boo et al 2013 sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa purchased from sigma aldrich were used as model polysaccharides and protein foulant respectively for this study detailed characteristics of these waters are provided in the supporting information tables s1 s2 s3 aggregation kinetics of 20 mg l polyethylene nanoscale plastics at these water conditions was determined in terms of hydrodynamic size measurement 2 9 statistical analysis statistical testing was employed for data analysis two sample t tests for hypothesis testing were conducted using

particles which is within the range of the size distribution provided by cospheric llc ca usa after filter larger size particles were filtered evident from the sem images and the particle size distribution was determined to be from 200 to 750 nm from 100 particles which makes a homogeneous size distribution figure s1 shows the characteristics absorbance bands for polyethylene which are located at 2916 cm 1 c h asymmetrical stretching vibration 2855 cm 1 c h symmetrical stretching vibration 1475 cm 1 ch2 scissoring vibration 718 cm 1 ch2 rocking vibration the 1475 cm 1 716 cm 1 peaks are used to identify and quantify the presence of polyethylene d amelia et al 2016 gulmine et al 2002 3 2 electrokinetic and hydrodynamic characterization 3 2 1 influence of ph on surface charge and size epm measurements using zetasizer nano zs fig s4b showed that polyethylene nanoscale plastics remained highly negatively charged over the ph range from 2 to 9 from 2 39 1 22 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 2 44 0 33 μmcm vs at ph 9 at 10 mm nacl this indicates that either polyethylene nanoscale plastics don t have any isoelectric point iep barany et al 2012 lefèvre et al 2009 ohsawa et al 1986 or they have isoelectric point below ph 2 moreover pka for sds is 1 99 due to which isoelectric point was not observed at the studied ph range chakraborty et al 2009 strano et al 2003a and maintaining ph below 2 without sacrificing control of the is 10 mm was not possible the change of hydrodynamic diameter to different ph at 10 mm nacl fig s4a was similar to epm measurements with polyethylene nanoscale plastics size remaining statistically constant from 217 95 24 61 nm to 310 29 165 58 nm from ph 2 to 9 epm measurements of polystyrene nanospheres fig s5b also showed that polystyrene nanospheres are negatively charged over the ph range from 2 to 9 from 0 76 0 10 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 2 52 0 17 μmcm vs at ph 9 at 10 mm nacl and they don t have any isoelectric point iep similar to polyethylene nanoscale plastic absolute values of polystyrene epms increased from ph 2 to ph 5 from 0 76 0 10 μmcm vs at ph 2 to 1 93 0 02 μmcm vs at ph 5 while epms remained very similar from ph 6 to 9 2 87 0 67 μmcm vs to 2 52 0 17 μmcm vs this change in epm with ph fig s5b is due to the dissociable functional groups on polystyrene nanospheres similar to other carbon based materials bouchard et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 the change of hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres fig s5a to different ph at 10 mm nacl was similar to epm measurements with polystyrene hydrodynamic diameter decreasing from ph 2 to ph 5 3700 nm 1100 nm as predicted by colloidal theory verwey and overbeek 1948 then remaining quite constant from ph 5 to 9 900 nm the ph in the aquatic environment usually remains between 5 and 9 crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 as there are no notable changes in electrokinetic and hydrodynamic properties of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics within this range it is likely that ph will not affect the behavior of these nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment thus the aggregation kinetics and stability of nanoscale plastics were investigated at an unadjusted ph 5 0 2 in this study 3 2 2 influence of salt type and ionic strength polyethylene nanoscale plastic is highly negatively charged epm is 4 60 0 44 μmcm vs and zp is 58 7 5 57 mv in mq water this high negative charge indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are electrically stabilized with hydrodynamic diameter of 376 36 34 47 nm due to the large electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics gregory 2005 epm values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics remain highly negative around 5 03 0 19 μmcm vs to 3 95 0 86 μmcm vs at low nacl concentration 1 mm 50 mm fig 2 b epm decreases from 3 95 0 86 μmcm vs to 2 07 0 83 μmcm vs when nacl concentration was increased from 50 mm to 120 mm fig 2b the decrease in surface charge with an increase in ionic strength is due to electrical double layer compression as predicted by dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 verwey and overbeek 1948 similar trends were observed for nanomaterials including go and multiwalled carbon nanotubes as well chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 from 1 to 50 mm nacl hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics remained quite constant 680 nm respectively fig 2a above 50 mm nacl the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics became less negative with is which resulted in a decrease in dh from 679 22 7 45 nm to 282 25 165 08 nm fig 2a this observation deviates from the classical behavior predicted by dlvo theory it is hypothesized that at higher salt levels the dispersion forces on the ions can be dominating when dispersion potentials are accounted for there may be a rise to either accumulation or depletion of ions close to an interface the dispersion potentials may change both in magnitude and sign depending on the optical properties of the interacting surfaces the salt solution and the ions this could give rise to reduced or enhanced double layer forces and result in a reduction of apparent size boström et al 2001 in surface waters the concentration of monovalent ions i e na is less than 10 mm crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 indicating that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be stable in natural aquatic environments dominated by these monovalent cations however ca2 and mg2 influenced the epm and hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics more prominently than monovalent na a notable decrease in epm values was observed for low concentrations of cacl2 from 0 01 mm to 0 05 mm and mgcl2 from 0 5 to 1 mm whereas significant decrease in epm and subsequent electrical double layer compression was not observed for nacl until 80 mm fig 2b this is because of higher electrical double layer compression from divalent ions with respect to monovalent ions as described in classical colloidal theory elimelech et al 1995 ion complexation with sds could be another mechanism for the destabilization of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of ca2 and mg2 sammalkorpi et al 2009 shen et al 2005 yan et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 as is increased from 0 01 mm to 1 mm for cacl2 epm values decreased from 4 85 0 16 μmcm vs to 3 46 0 19 μmcm vs and as is increased from 0 5 mm to 5 mm for mgcl2 epm values decreased from 3 19 0 16 μmcm vs to 0 61 0 37 μmcm vs fig 2b similar trends were observed for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide nanomaterials in the presence of divalent cations chowdhury et al 2013 saleh et al 2008 however hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was significantly different for cacl2 and mgcl2 as a function of is after 0 08 mm cacl2 and 3 mm mgcl2 increase in hydrodynamic diameter was observed indicating greater effect of divalent cations on polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation fig 2a the average hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres in mq water is 43 62 0 22 nm and electrophoretic mobility epm is 4 51 0 28 μmcm vs this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are negatively charged in water epm decreases to 3 64 0 41 μmcm vs with introduction of 10 mm nacl and decreased further to 2 68 0 11 μmcm vs with increasing nacl concentration fig 3 b the decrease in surface charge with an increase in ionic strength is due to electrical double layer compression as predicted by dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 verwey and overbeek 1948 however from 10 to 150 mm nacl the hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres remained quite constant 42 nm fig 3a which implies that polystyrene nanospheres will be stable in natural aquatic environments even at high nacl concentration both cacl2 and mgcl2 influenced the epm of polystyrene nanospheres more aggressively than monovalent nacl fig 3b minor charge screening of polystyrene nanospheres was observed even as low as 0 5 mm for both cacl2 and mgcl2 while significant electrical double layer compression was not observed for nacl until 150 mm this is because of higher electrical double layer compression from divalent ions with respect to monovalent ions as described in classical colloidal theory elimelech et al 1995 epms and hydrodynamic size of polystyrene nanospheres were quite similar as a function of is for both cacl2 and mgcl2 no notable size increase for polystyrene nanospheres was observed until 1 mm for both divalent ions fig 3a although significant charge screening was observed after 1 mm the hydrodynamic size of polystyrene nanospheres increased a little but not significant for both cacl2 and mgcl2 fig 3a 3 2 3 influence of natural organic matter the effect of nom on the electrokinetic and hydrodynamic properties of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 is reported in table s4 in the supporting information the nom concentration was varied from 0 5 to 5 mg l toc generally in the presence of nom both electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion contribute to the stabilization of colloids chen and elimelech 2007 jiang et al 2017 saleh et al 2008 smith et al 2012 for the present study nom concentration had a negligible effect on the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in all three salt types investigated this suggests that sorbed nom molecules may carry the similar amount of charges to those on the surface of polyethylene nanoscale plastics liu et al 2016 and electrostatic repulsion is not significant enough to cause stabilization however the addition of nom reduced the hydrodynamic diameter of polyethylene nanoscale plastics under all three salt types this indicates that steric repulsion due to the sorption of nom on polyethylene nanoscale plastics which was visible by the change in surface morphology in the sem image in fig s11 may be the dominant mechanism in polyethylene nanoscale plastics stabilization saleh et al 2010 3 3 aggregation kinetics 3 3 1 influence of ionic strength is fig s6 shows the aggregation kinetics profiles of polyethylene nanoscale plastics as a function of nacl concentration attachment efficiency α as a function of salt concentration is shown in fig 4 a which also showed a very distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes this indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation follows derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory overbeek 1999b in the reaction limited regime α increased from approximately 12 100 as nacl concentration increased from 1 to 80 mm is beyond 80 mm did not increase α which indicates that electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics is completely suppressed and the diffusion limited regime starts near 80 mm nacl chowdhury et al 2012 dlvo interaction profiles between polyethylene nanoscale plastics polyethylene nanoscale plastics are generated assuming sphere sphere geometry fig s7 large energy barrier 50 kt observed at 1 mm nacl explains the negligible aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in this condition increased is from 1 mm to 80 mm led to reduced energy barrier which resulted in higher aggregation as observed from aggregation experiments fig 4a indicates the ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics is around 80 mm nacl our study is the first to report the ccc of polyethylene nanoscale plastics as a result no direct comparison to previously published studies can be made the average hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres in mq water is 43 62 0 22 nm the hydrodynamic diameter of polystyrene nanospheres remained stable at high ionic strength 100 mm nacl with a size of 43 nm fig s8 no aggregation was observed for polystyrene nanospheres even at 200 mm nacl fig s8 from the attachment efficiency values showed in fig 5 a calculated from the aggregation profiles fig s8 we can see that ccc value of polystyrene nanospheres is 800 mm nacl which is 10 times greater than polyethylene nanoscale plastics ccc in nacl dlvo profiles of polystyrene nanospheres fig s9 indicates the presence of high energy barrier even at high ionic strength 200 mm nacl which means greater stability of polystyrene nanospheres at high ionic strength of nacl from these results it can be said that polystyrene nanospheres are more stable than polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cai et al 2018 this may be due to the aromatic content in polystyrenens structure or its surface functionalization bastos and de las nieves 1994 sakota and okaya 1977 sastri 2010 3 3 2 influence of salt types similar to nacl attachment efficiency as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 salt concentration fig 4b c 5b 5c also showed a very distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes for both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics for cacl2 polyethylene nanoscale plastics α increased sharply from 20 to 100 with increasing is from 0 01 to 0 1 mm the ccc value determined from fig 4b is 0 1 mm cacl2 significantly lower than the ccc value for polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of nacl cai et al 2018 according to the schulze hardy rule the ccc ratio for nacl and cacl2 should be z 6 for colloids with high surface charge where z is the valence of ca2 ions z 2 gregory 2005 in our study the ratio of ccc values for cacl2 and nacl is proportional to z 9 6 which is quite high compared with the schulz hardy rule it implies that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are sensitive to ca2 cations this could be attributed to the specific adsorption capacity of ca2 ions called bridging effect gutierrez et al 2010 nguyen and chen 2007 pham et al 2009 in a previous study polystyrene nanoscale plastics were stable in wide ionic strength solutions of cacl2 0 1 15 mm cai et al 2018 which again indicates that ccc value 0 1 mm cacl2 of polyethylene nanoscale plastics is notably lower than polystyrene nanoscale plastics on the other hand for mgcl2 minimal aggregation was observed at concentrations below 0 5 mm polyethylene nanoscale plastics α increased sharply from 10 to 100 with increasing is from 0 5 to 3 mm the ccc value determined from fig 4c is 3 mm mgcl2 significantly higher than the ccc value for cacl2 this implies that ca2 is more effective than mg2 in destabilizing polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment the ratio of ccc values for mgcl2 and nacl is proportional to z 4 8 which is reasonable as the schulze hardy rule predicts a proportionality to z 6 for particles of high surface charge also it has also been reported that a much weaker dependence on the counterion charge z 2 exists for particles with low surface charge elimelech et al 1995 overall results suggest that polyethylene nanoscale plastics are more sensitive to divalent cations especially ca2 ions than monovalent cations no aggregation was observed for polystyrene nanospheres even at 3 mm cacl2 and 3 mm mgcl2 as the size of polystyrene nanospheres remains 43 nm figs s8b and s8c with an increase of ionic strength for both cacl2 and mgcl2 significant aggregation of polystyrene nanospheres was observed ccc values were observed to be 10 mm for cacl2 and 25 mm for mgcl2 for polystyrene nanospheres this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are also sensitive to divalent ions especially ca2 cations following schulz hardy rule from these results we can also predict that trivalent cations will affect aggregation and stability of nanoscale plastics in aquatic environment even more than divalent and monovalent cations according to schulz hardy rule which was observed with other nanomaterials too oncsik et al 2014 ruiz cabello et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in contrast to the good stability of polystyrene nanospheres and higher ccc values polyethylene nanoscale plastics undergo obvious aggregation with low ionic strength of nacl and cacl2 this implies that polystyrene nanospheres are more stable than polyethylene nanoscale plastics due to the surface functionalization presence of carboxyl functional groups of polystyrene nanospheres bastos and de las nieves 1994 sakota and okaya 1977 3 3 3 influence of natural organic matter for 80 mm nacl the addition of 5 mg l toc nom reduced α from 100 to 50 fig 4a while α decreased from 100 to 60 for 0 1 mm cacl2 fig 4b the significant decrease in attachment efficiencies is attributed to non dlvo steric interactions imparted by the adsorbed nom saleh et al 2010 there was no significant effect of nom concentration on the epm of polyethylene nanoscale plastics table s4 indicating that there are no electrostatic interactions between polyethylene nanoscale plastics and nom to cause polyethylene nanoscale plastics stabilization steric stabilization by nom has been observed for multi walled carbon nanotubes and aquatic colloids in a previous study saleh et al 2008 the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the presence of 5 mg l toc nom were 120 mm nacl 1 5 times higher than observed without nom 80 mm nacl 0 4 mm cacl2 4 times higher than observed without nom 0 1 mm cacl2 and 8 mm mgcl2 2 66 times higher than observed without nom 3 mm mgcl2 in the presence of 5 mg l nom the ratio of ccc values between cacl2 and nacl was proportional to z 8 which is quite close to what was observed in the absence of nom similarly the ratio of ccc values between mgcl2 and nacl was proportional to z 4 which is also quite close to what was observed in without nom 3 4 stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in various water conditions initial aggregation studies measure the stability of nanomaterials over concise time frames 3 4 1 aggregation kinetics aggregation kinetics of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were explored in five different types of waters for 60 min to determine the initial stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics fig s12 natural environment is a very complex ecosystem so we mainly used synthetic waters to simulate engineered aquatic environments and to understand the fundamental behavior of these nanoscale plastics however we did use columbia river water as our natural water to observe the changes in the behavior of these nanoscale plastics in natural environment compared to an engineered environment aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics was not observed in columbia river water due to low concentration of ca2 4 10 4 mm na 0 17 mm mg2 0 05 mm and the presence of substantial nom 22 05 mg l toc indicating that polyethylene nanoplastics will be highly stable in natural river water on the other hand surface water without nom destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics as it contained 0 33 mm ca2 which is well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 0 1 mm seawater also destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics but faster compared to surface water synthetic seawater contained 10 mm ca2 500 mm na and 54 4 mm mg2 all of which are well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 nacl and mgcl2 synthetic groundwater and wastewater contained 0 68 mm ca2 and 0 5 mm ca2 respectively which is also well above the ccc values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in cacl2 and this caused significant aggregation of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in groundwater and wastewater as well overall the study indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics aggregation will be dominated by divalent ions especially cacl2 and the presence of nom 4 conclusions the colloidal stability of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in environmentally relevant conditions was investigated in this study it was found in this study that ph will have a negligible effect on the fate and transport of nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment results indicate that polystyrene plastics are more stable compared to polyethylene nanoscale plastics even at high ionic strength we also found that divalent ions especially cacl2 play significant role in the destabilization while adding nom can increase the stability of nanoscale plastics from the initial aggregation kinetics data it can be anticipated that most of polyethylene nanoscale plastics will settle out during the wastewater treatment process and end up in biosolids sludge and ultimately landfills and as fertilizer whereas for polystyrene heteroaggregation with other suspended particles would be necessary for the plastics to settle due to their density however significant aqueous transport of these nanoscale plastics will be possible in natural surface water therefore it is imperative that different organizations impose laws and regulations to limit or prevent the use of microplastics in commercial products and at the same time people should be educated on the proper management of plastic waste and importance of plastic recycling this fundamental colloidal study with polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics could serve as a basis to do more
