16855,nearly half a billion people living in indian cities receive their drinking water from an intermittent water supply iws which can be associated with degraded water quality and risk of waterborne disease the municipal water supply in nagpur india is transitioning from intermittent to continuous supply in phases we conducted cross sectional sampling to compare microbial water quality under iws and continuous water supply cws in nagpur in 2015 and 2017 we collected 146 grab samples and 90 large volume dead end ultrafiltration deuf samples total volume 6 925 liters in addition to measuring traditional water quality parameters we also assayed deuf samples by droplet digital pcr ddpcr for waterborne pathogen gene targets at household taps served by iws we detected targets from enterotoxigenic e coli shigella spp enteroinvasive e coli norovirus gi and gii adenovirus a f cryptosporidium spp and giardia duodenalis we observed a significant increase in the proportion of grab samples positive for culturable e coli p 0 0007 and deuf concentrates positive for waterborne pathogen gene targets p 0 0098 at household taps served by iws compared to those served by cws iws continues to be associated with fecal contamination and in this study with increased prevalence of molecular evidence of waterborne pathogens these findings add mounting evidence that despite the presence of piped on premise infrastructure iws is less likely to meet the requirements for safely managed drinking water as defined by the sustainable development goals importantly these findings

end ultrafiltration ddpcr india microbial water quality drinking water 1 introduction nearly 1 billion people receive their drinking water and the accompanying microbial contamination from an intermittent water supply iws so named because of persistent water supply interruptions bivins et al 2017 the number of people exposed to iws is likely to increase due to urbanization climate change driven water scarcity and deferred investments in infrastructure mitlin et al 2019 iws results from a complex amalgamation of political institutional ecological and infrastructural constraints whose end result is the inability or unwillingness to maintain continuous positive pressure within a piped water distribution network galaitsi et al 2016 kaminsky and kumpel 2018 lapses in positive pressure within the pipelines provide numerous opportunities for microbial contamination and degradation of drinking water quality including intrusion of contaminants during low pressure periods regrowth during stagnation scouring during re pressurization and recontamination during household storage coelho et al 2003 kumpel et al 2016 the contamination of iws with feces could plausibly account for at least 17 2 million waterborne infections and 4 5 million cases of diarrhea per year bivins et al 2017 numerous cross sectional studies have documented the presence of fecal indicators including total coliforms thermotolerant coliforms and e coli associated with iws in various contexts throughout the globe including rural settings urban settings and refugee camps alabdula aly and khan 2017 alazzeh et al 2019 brown et al 2013 matsinhe et al 2014 rubino et al 2018 shaheed et al 2014 however such fecal contamination does not appear to be ubiquitous as a study of an iws in panama documented only 0 9 of grab samples were positive for total coliforms and one grab sample of 423 was positive for e coli by culture erickson et al 2017 during a longitudinal study in india 31 7 of grab samples from an iws were positive for e coli but the proportion of samples positive varied by hydraulic zone within the distribution network kumpel and nelson 2013 the spatial and temporal variation in water quality is likely due to the complex hydraulic conditions which exist within an iws and the distribution of fecal contamination sources within and between settings taylor et al 2018 while many studies have made cross sectional assessments of microbial water quality in an iws only two studies have made direct comparisons of microbial water quality in iws versus cws within the same municipal water system the first found that in four different indian cities a greater proportion of grab samples were free of fecal coliforms after a water distribution zone was temporarily converted to cws compared to the baseline iws condition andey and kelkar 2007 a second study performed in conjunction with a cws pilot project in hubli dharwad found that during contemporaneous sampling from iws zones and cws zones 31 7 of grab samples from iws were positive for e coli while only 0 7 were positive from cws kumpel and nelson 2013 the heterogeneity observed in microbial water quality is also found in the association between iws and diarrheal disease a systematic review found that persons served by iws had 1 61 times greater odds of gastrointestinal illness compared to those served by cws ercumen et al 2014 several cross sectional studies have found significant associations between iws and diarrhea among adults children and residents of refugee camps and slums abu amr and yassin 2008 adane et al 2017 trudeau et al 2018 an ecological study in the democratic republic of the congo documented a significant increase in the incidence of cholera cases following water supply interruption but could not isolate whether these cases were attributable to degraded water quality from the piped supply itself or from households switching to alternative water sources jeandron et al 2015 a longitudinal study of households in peru noted an increase in biomarkers associated with environmental enteropathy ee for children exposed to iws compared to those with cws exum et al 2018 in contrast a longitudinal trial associated with a pilot cws project in hubli dharwad india found no association between iws and diarrhea but did note an association with typhoid fever ercumen et al 2015 iws is especially relevant in india where as of 2005 63 of the population served by a piped supply has water available for 3 or less hours per day desai and vanneman 2005 mckenzie and ray 2009 from 2005 to 2009 the international benchmarking network reported an increase in the mean supply duration from 6 8 hours per day to 10 4 hours per day world bank 2020 other surveys of indian cities have noted an average duration of 4 hours per day and a range of 0 5 to 10 hours per day compared to an asia pacific average of 19 hours per day asian development bank 2007 mckenzie and ray 2009 despite the success of several pilot programs of cws no major city in india yet offers its residents access to cws resulting in at least 460 million urban dwelling persons exposed to iws wsp 2014 the city of nagpur located in eastern maharashtra is now working to become the first major city in india to transition its entire water supply from iws to cws the 2 5 million people living in nagpur exert a daily water demand of 660 million liters which is withdrawn from three surface water sources kanhan river gorewada lake and pench dam treated at five water treatment plants wtps and distributed via a network of master balancing reservoirs mbr elevated service reservoirs esr and a 2 100 km pipeline network john et al 2014 nijhawan et al 2014 in 2007 the nagpur municipal corporation nmc reported an average supply time of 4 3 hours per day unaccounted for water ufw of 51 9 40 of household connections metered and 3 2 staff persons per 1 000 connections asian development bank 2007 from 2009 to 2011 a cws pilot project demonstrated remarkable improvements in service level benchmarks through a 270 million inr usd 4 million improvement package that included 100 metering and replacement of 30 of the pipes in the demonstration zone hastak et al 2017 following the successful demonstration nmc contracted with orange city water ocw to transition the entire water supply from iws to cws beginning in 2011 at an estimated cost of 3 87 billion inr usd 70 5 million with contractual obligations to reduce non revenue water nrw and improve tariff collection efficiency wsp 2014 in association with the transition nmc and the national environmental engineering research institute neeri also implemented a water safety plan wsp for the municipal water supply following the world health organization who wsp manual nijhawan et al 2014 in the period from 2011 to 2016 496 km of pipeline were replaced and cws was implemented in 10 of 64 hydraulically isolated zones which we and ocw refer to as command areas who 2018 two previous studies of drinking water quality in nagpur have noted considerable contamination in the iws water delivery system from treatment to the point of use elala et al 2011 john et al 2014 these studies along with numerous others utilized measurements of fecal indicator bacteria which while informative are only proxies for the presence of waterborne pathogens national research council 2004 a recent qmra noted that the use of indicator bacteria counts and ratios of pathogens to indicators were significant sources of uncertainty in quantifying the burden of diarrheal disease associated with iws bivins et al 2017 reviews of iws have identified uncertainty about the risk posed by pathogens introduced via intrusion as an important opportunity to increase our understanding of iws and health bautista de los santos et al 2019 we leveraged the transition of the nagpur water supply from iws to cws to document water quality differences between the two modes of operation within the same municipal water supply we used traditional culture based and physicochemical measurements along with dead end ultrafiltration deuf and droplet digital pcr ddpcr to assess the water quality with attention towards molecular measures of gene targets associated with waterborne pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design in nagpur the transition from iws officially began in 2011 and called for the entire supply to be converted to cws by 2016 however as of 2017 only 12 of 64 command areas had been converted we originally conceived of the study as a controlled before and after design with cross sectional measurements of water quality in one control iws command area at baseline and endline and concurrent measurement of water quality in one intervention command area that was iws at baseline and cws at endline we initiated the study in 2015 with sampling during june and july in two iws command areas within the nagpur water supply reshim bagh and karve nagar however when we returned in 2017 for the endline sampling delays in the project meant that neither of the command areas had yet converted to cws therefore we adapted our design to a cross sectional study of water quality along the water delivery system with the addition of samples from two command areas laxmi nagar old and khamla as shown in supplemental figure 1 the esrs in both khamla and laxmi nagar old command areas receive treated drinking water from the pench ii wtp via a distribution main that is continuously pressurized from these esrs drinking water is distributed continuously in laxmi nagar old and intermittently in khamla as a result our final study includes cross sectional water quality data from esrs and household taps throughout the water distribution networks in three iws zones khamla karve nagar and reshim bagh one cws zone laxmi nagar old and water quality data through the treatment train at the pench ii wtp raw water post filtration post disinfection with the assistance of utility personnel we selected sampling locations to be spatially representative of each command area approximate sample locations were collected via cell phone gps 5 m and mapped using arcgis desktop 10 7 1 esri redlands ca usa the resulting sample set is a convenience sample constrained by households willingness to provide access to a tap and the logistics of transporting a limited number of ultrafilters from the united states to nagpur 2 2 physicochemical measurements at the time of sample collection we measured total and free chlorine using the us epa dpd colorimetric method with a hach pocket colorimeter ii hach loveland co usa apha awwa wef 2017 we measured temperature ph conductivity and total dissolved solids by electrode using a hanna low range combo tester hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa apha awwa wef 2000 for 2017 samples we measured turbidity in nephelometric turbidity units ntu using a hach 2100q portable turbidimeter hach loveland co usa usepa 1993 for a subset of 2017 samples we measured water service pressure at household taps using a dickson pr125 pressure logger dickson unigage inc addison il usa 2 3 culture based methods for most samples we collected a paired grab sample and large volume deuf sample however due to our limited number of ultrafilters we also occasionally collected grab samples without an accompanying deuf sample in 2015 we collected 300 ml grab samples in whirl pak bags pre dosed with sodium thiosulfate nasco fort atkinson wi usa whereas in 2017 we collected 500 ml grab samples in sterile plastic bottles pre dosed with sodium thiosulfate in both cases grab samples were collected at least 20 minutes after the initiation of the water supply period in the time between collection and processing grab samples were transported on ice and stored at 4 c in 2015 we enumerated e coli in 100 ml 10 ml and 1 ml volumes in duplicate by membrane filtration and selective media incubation per epa method 1604 with modification us epa 2002 we incubated each replicate along with both positive and negative controls at 37 1 c for 24 hours on hicrome m tec agar prior to counting m1571 himedia mumbai india in 2017 we enumerated thermotolerant coliforms and e coli in 100 ml duplicates from each grab sample by membrane filtration followed by incubation at 44 5 1 c for 24 hours on hicrome coliform hiveg agar with sls mv1300 himedia mumbai india following incubation we counted both thermotolerant coliforms and e coli on each plate following the manufacturer s instructions for color based identification with the use of kovac s indole r008 himedia mumbai india to confirm putative e coli colonies we reported the counts in colony forming units cfu per 100 ml in a subset of 2017 grab samples we also enumerated heterotrophs by membrane filtration of 1 ml 500 ul and 250 ul volumes in duplicate followed by incubation at 37 1 c for 24 hours on r2a agar m1205 himedia mumbai india per the manufacturer s instructions 2 4 dead end ultrafiltration we concentrated microorganisms from large volume drinking water samples by deuf following a cdc protocol using rexeed 25s dialyzers asahi kasei kuraray medical company tokyo japan smith and hill 2009 in 2015 we collected 20 liter samples in sterile containers beginning at least 20 minutes after water supply initiation pre dosed with sodium thiosulfate transported them to the lab on ice and performed deuf upon return to the lab while in 2017 we connected to sampling points via sterile masterflex l s 36 platinum cured silicone tubing cole parmer vernon hills il usa and utilized service pressure in the piped network to force the drinking water through the dialyzer when system pressure was inadequate or unavailable such as at the pench ii wtp or sometimes at iws household taps we collected drinking water in sterilized plastic buckets and filtered from the buckets using a geotech geopump geotech denver co usa in all instances we began filtering 20 minutes after the supply cycle started and we recorded the volume of water ultrafiltered using a totalizing flow meter clark solutions hudson ma usa we quenched residual chlorine in the ultrafilter by filtering 500 ml of 1 sodium thiosulfate solution immediately after filtering the sample and transported ultrafilters on ice back to the lab in the lab we backflushed each ultrafilter into a sterile 500 ml bottle using 500 ml of 0 5 tween 80 0 01 napp and 0 001 antifoam y 30 emulsion solution with recovered volumes ranging from 350 to 450 ml smith and hill 2009 in 2017 we enumerated thermotolerant coliforms and e coli in the backflush solution using 1 ml and 100 ul membrane filtration duplicates as previously described 2 5 peg precipitation and ultracentrifugation after culture based enumerations we further concentrated 300 ml of deuf backflush using polyethylene glycol peg precipitation 12 peg 8000 0 6 m nacl and 1 bovine serum albumin solution and centrifugation mull and hill 2012 after overnight incubation at 4 c we aliquoted the 300 ml peg precipitated solution into six 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged them at 10 000 g at 4 c for 30 minutes we poured off the resulting supernatant and resuspended the pelleted material in each tube using 667 ul of 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 01 tween 80 and 0 001 y 30 emulsion solution we then combined the resuspended pellets from each of the six centrifuge tubes the volume of the resulting suspension which we refer to as deuf concentrate was approximately 4 ml we stored the deuf concentrate at 20 c until pre treatment with unex lysis buffer as described in section 2 6 immediately following pre treatment we transported the samples on ice for approximately 36 hours to atlanta ga where they were frozen at 80 c until extracted 2 6 extraction and reverse transcription we extracted nucleic acids from each deuf concentrate using unex buffer microbiologics st cloud mn usa as developed by the cdc hill et al 2015 we added 500 ul of deuf concentrate 500 ul of unex buffer and 5 ul of inforce 3 bovine vaccine zoetis parsippany nj usa our extraction and molecular process control which contains bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv and bovine herpes virus bohv to an sk 38 bead tube bertin corp rockville md usa and completed the lysis purification and elution of nucleic acids following microbiologic s unex protocol for parasites in water samples with each extraction batch we included a negative extraction control and an inforce 3 only control 500 ul of molecular water and 5 ul of inforce 3 we stored the purified nucleic acids from each sample and the controls at 80 c until molecular testing or reverse transcription for rna we performed reverse transcription rt of rna to cdna using a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit with rnase inhibitor per the manufacturer s instructions thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa following rt we stored the resulting cdna at 80 c until ddpcr interrogation was completed within five days 2 7 ddpcr we selected microbial targets for molecular analysis on the basis of diarrheal disease etiologies from several sites in southeast asia as observed in the global enteric multicenter study gems and the malnutrition and enteric disease study mal ed as previously described bivins et al 2020 liu et al 2016 platts mills et al 2018 we selected shigella enteroinvasive e coli eiec and enterotoxigenic e coli with heat stable toxin st etec as bacterial pathogens cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp as protozoan and norovirus gi norovirus gii and adenovirus a f as virus targets we did not select rotavirus due to the concurrent rollout of rotavirus vaccination programs in india nair et al 2019 likely to influence prevalence of infection in nagpur during the period of the study as detailed elsewhere we adapted qpcr assays to ddpcr format and used them to interrogate nucleic acids extracted from each sample for genetic targets associated with the selected waterborne pathogens and fecal indicators e coli and ms2 bivins et al 2020 the relevant genetic thermal cycling and performance information for all the assays used including controls is summarized in supplemental table 1 we performed all ddpcr experiments following the manufacturer s protocol using a qx200 droplet generator px1 pcr plate sealer c1000 touch thermal cycler and qx200 droplet reader bio rad hercules ca usa bio rad 2015 all primers probes and control materials were synthesized by integrated dna technologies idt coralville ia usa with the exception of minor groove binder mgb probes which were synthesized by applied biosystems foster city ca usa for singleplex assays ms2g1 beta giardin we added each primer and the probe to achieve final concentrations of 900 nm and 250 nm respectively while for multiplex probe based assays noro gi noro gii hexon ipah crypto 18s rrna sth we added primers and probes to achieve final concentrations of 650 nm and 250 nm respectively for the ybbw evagreen assay we added each primer to achieve final concentrations of 250 nm the final ddpcr reaction volume was 20 ul including molecular grade water ddpcr supermix for probes 10 ul or ddpcr evagreen supermix 10 ul bio rad hercules ca primers probe and 4 ul of extraction eluate or rt product as appropriate we included negative extraction controls sample blanks no template controls and positive controls in each ddpcr experiment we also included randomly selected technical replicates at a 10 rate on each ddpcr plate we determined the 95 limit of detection 95 lod for each assay by running ten technical replicates along each step of a dilution series of positive control materials we then fit a cumulative gaussian distribution to the observed proportion of technical replicates that were positive along the concentration gradient and used the resulting mean and standard deviation to calculate the 95th percentile of the fitted distribution stokdyk et al 2016 in ddpcr the concentration of a gene target in the reaction mix is estimated by means of a most probable number according to a poisson distribution using the proportion of droplets classified as positive for the target based on their observed fluorescence intensity after thermal cycling pinheiro and emslie 2018 we estimated the copy number of genetic targets in our ddpcr assays using both a manual threshold in quantasoft v1 7 4 bio rad hercules ca usa and a model based classification called umbrella implemented in rstudio version 1 1 456 rstudio team 2015 jacobs et al 2017 to minimize the likelihood of false positives due to droplet misclassification especially of droplets at fluorescence levels between the positive and negative clusters observed in controls we only interpreted samples with two or more positive droplets by either thresholding method as positive for the relevant gene targe the complete microbiology workflow used during the study is summarized in supplemental figure 2 2 8 data analysis we compared count and prevalence data between two groups using mann whitney tests and between multiple groups using kruskal wallis tests with dunn s correction dunn 1964 kruskal and wallis 1952 mann and whitney 1947 we calculated confidence intervals for prevalence data using a brown and wilson hybrid method chick et al 2001 wilson 1927 we assessed correlation between continuous variables using spearman rank correlation coefficients spearman 1904 all statistical analyses and graphs were prepared using graphpad prism version 8 4 3 for windows graphpad software san diego ca usa 3 results during the study we collected a total of 90 paired deuf and grab samples plus an additional 56 grab samples from 23 june to 22 july 2015 we collected 17 paired deuf and grab samples from karve nagar 3 esr 14 tap and 16 from reshim bagh 3 esr 13 tap iws command areas and performed deuf in the lab with an average volume of 18 2 liters range 14 38 22 18 in 2015 we sampled on a weekly basis with collection from each command area on consecutive weekdays from 20 april to 10 october 2017 we collected 21 paired deuf and grab samples from three points in the pench ii wtp 7 raw water 7 post filtration 7 post disinfection 18 paired samples from the iws khamla command area 9 esr 9 tap and 18 paired samples from the cws laxmi nagar old command area 9 esr 9 tap in 2017 to achieve an even distribution of samples over time we collected samples once or twice per month with samples from the pench ii wtp iws command area and cws command area collected during consecutive days of the same week because we performed deuf in the field in 2017 and did not have to transport samples in containers the average volume was 111 0 liters

drinking while all backflush samples were positive for e coli from raw water and post filtration no sample was positive for culturable e coli post disinfection fig 2 a in the iws command area 11 of deuf backflush samples collected at the esr were positive for e coli and 56 at household taps for cws 56 of deuf backflush samples from the esr were positive while none were positive at the household tap e coli counts excluding non detections and tntcs as enumerated via deuf at esrs and taps in the iws and the cws area are shown in fig 2b the differences in the proportion of samples positive and counts were not significant 3 5 ddpcr analysis of deuf samples prior to assaying the deuf concentrate for gene targets we analyzed the cdna from each sample for the brsv process control brsv is a qualitative control where we interpret successful detection via ddpcr to indicate a successful extraction reverse transcription and amplification within the matrix of that sample we detected brsv in each sample and all negative extraction controls were void of the target further we found strong linear agreement between ddpcr quantification of brsv by manual thresholding and umbrella thresholding y 1x 0 412 r2 1 00 as can be seen in supplemental fig 6 for the ms2g1 beta giardin norovirus gi orf1 2 norovirus gii orf1 2 ipah sth and cryptosporidium 18s rrna assays we observed no false positive droplets in negative controls by either thresholding method in the hexon assay we observed one false positive droplet among 265 592 negative control droplets by manual thresholding and zero by umbrella thresholding out of 1 152 total ddpcr wells we only observed large discrepancies between manual and umbrella quantification in 19 2 beta giardin 8 sth and 9 cryptosporidium 18s rrna in each instance the umbrella results for that well were discarded and the manual thresholding results were used for quantification of the target the exception to this agreement was the ybbw assay where large shifts in the background fluorescence levels of samples compared to negative controls caused significant discrepancies between the manual and umbrella thresholding in this instance we discarded the umbrella thresholding entirely and report only the manual thresholding results we assayed deuf concentrates for two gene targets associated with fecal indicators gene target ms2g1 associated with male specific coliphage was detected in only one sample which originated from the cws esr 170 gc l however ybbw a gene associated with e coli was detected in 45 deuf concentrate samples boxplots of the observed ybbw concentration in the pench ii wtp iws and cws sampling locations are shown in supplemental fig 7 after accounting for random variation the counts of ybbw were different only between the raw water and the disinfected drinking water at pench ii wtp p 0 0150 and between the raw water and the water at household taps receiving cws p 0 0037 a comparison of the proportion of deuf backflush samples positive for culturable e coli and the ybbw gene supplemental fig 8 indicates that the gene target was frequently present even when culturable e coli was not however there was only a significant difference in the prevalence for household taps receiving cws p 0 0294 across 21 pairs of culturable e coli and ybbw counts we observed a weak correlation ρ 0 4172 p 0 0599 supplemental fig 9 we detected genetic targets associated with bacterial pathogens in 12 deuf samples we observed ipah associated with shigella and eiec in one sample from a household tap in an iws command area

samples three from iws taps range 250 690 gc l one from an esr 24 gc l and three samples from the pench ii wtp range 26 44 gc l lastly we observed genetic targets associated with protozoan pathogens in 10 deuf concentrate samples we detected beta giardin associated with giardia duodenalis in samples from five iws taps range 23 110 gc l and one esr 79 gc l we detected the 18s rrna gene target associated with cryptosporidium in one iws household tap sample 430 gc l one cws household tap 67 gc l and one pench ii wtp sample 88 gc l the total number of deuf samples positive for each gene target stratified by sampling location are summarized in supplemental table 2 supplemental table 3 summarizes the number of deuf samples positive by ddpcr for each gene target and all gene targets associated with pathogens in iws versus cws command areas the prevalence of gene targets associated with pathogens and an aggregate of all pathogen detections within deuf samples as observed at iws taps versus cws taps are summarized in fig 3 a except for cryptosporidium 18s rrna which was detected in a single sample at both iws and cws taps pathogen associated genetic elements were detected more frequently in iws taps genetic evidence of pathogens was detected in 61 95 ci 45 75 of samples from iws taps and 11 95 ci 0 57 43 of samples from cws taps iws was associated with an increase in the prevalence of aggregate pathogen gene targets compared to cws p 0 0098 as shown in fig 3b the prevalence of pathogen gene targets decreased from pench ii raw water through the treatment train increased from the treatment plant to the esrs and then increased from esr to household taps for cws while increasing from esr to household taps for iws the only statistically significant change was the increased prevalence from the iws esr to iws household taps p 0 0026 across 58 paired observations of free chlorine and ddpcr detected pathogens from both iws and cws distribution networks esrs and household taps free chlorine was not a predictor of pathogen detection log likelihood p 0 94 even when stratified by iws n 43 and cws n 15 free chlorine was not predictive of pathogen positivity iws p 0 95 cws p 0 54 4 discussion 4 1 drinking water quality in iws compared to cws our observations highlight several important features of the quality of drinking water delivered by iws versus cws our data suggest that microbial water quality was degraded in iws zones as mean counts of thermotolerant coliforms and e coli increased from the esr to household taps while in cws they decreased our data also suggest the variance of water quality parameters including free chlorine turbidity and microbial counts at household taps was greater in iws zones compared to cws zones we observed an increase in the proportion of grab samples positive for e coli from taps served by iws versus cws in the indian context our findings are consistent with a previous study of drinking water quality in hubli dharwad that documented significant degradation of drinking water quality in iws zones compared to a cws demonstration zone kumpel and nelson 2013 however e coli detections in grab samples can be difficult to interpret and non specific in regard to drinking water safety in piped water systems especially in settings where e coli has been observed to grow in the environment hatam et al 2020 nowicki et al 2021 4 2 waterborne pathogens in iws vs cws our study is the first to provide observations concerning the presence of genetic targets associated with waterborne pathogens in areas receiving iws versus cws within the same municipal supply we detected targets associated with seven different fecal oral pathogens at taps in iws zones compared to one pathogen target detected at a tap in the cws zone we detected genes associated with bacterial viral and protozoan pathogens indicating that all microbial classes could be associated with waterborne disease transmitted via iws each of the genes we detected is associated with a pathogen that contributes to the burden of diarrheal disease among children in south asia as observed in the mal ed and gems trials liu et al 2016 platts mills et al 2018 we observed that the proportion of samples positive for any pathogen gene target in samples collected from cws taps was less than the proportion from iws taps our observation indicates that cws users in the study context are subject to a decreased likelihood of exposure to waterborne pathogens compared to iws users of course our findings like all environmental surveillance using molecular methods rely upon the implicit assumption that the observed gene counts are positively correlated with viable and infectious organisms within the sample though our data cannot directly indicate viability of pathogens we concurrently detected culturable e coli in many samples from iws taps 4 3 heterogeneity in water quality in iws our findings also emphasize the heterogeneity in drinking water quality in iwss we observed variations in water quality between hydraulically isolated iws zones within the nagpur municipal water supply for example 80 of grab samples were positive for e coli in one iws zone of while only 28 were positive in another this is consistent with previous observations in hubli dharwad kumpel and nelson 2013 meanwhile erickson et al detected culturable total coliforms in only four samples and e coli in only one sample of 423 from an iws in panama 2017 these findings indicate that the microbial quality of water delivered by an iws is likely dependent on context specific variables given the complex hydraulic boundary conditions of iws distribution networks it is likely that these context specific variables must be defined at the level of hydraulic zones within municipal water supplies taylor et al 2018 such variables are likely to include types and density of fecal pollution sources within the zone operations and maintenance of the distribution network and the hydraulic boundary conditions however in contexts where fecal contamination is prevalent iws can make piped water networks efficient transmitters of waterborne disease anandan et al 2021 4 5 policy implications for iws in india our results strongly suggest that in nagpur the conversion from iws to cws effectively reduced fecal contamination in drinking water and genetic elements associated with waterborne pathogens while these results are directly attributable to physical improvements in the water infrastructure it is extremely important to note that these physical improvements flow from improvements in governance and management hastak et al 2017 historically indian utilities have been characterized by inefficiency increasing costs flat revenues with only 20 of connections metered and non revenue water rates of 40 or more nyathikala and kulshrestha 2017 wsp 2014 during the conversion in nagpur increased metering and decreased non revenue water has been critical to the financial solvency of the project and improving compliance with service level benchmarks hastak et al 2017 our findings indicate that in nagpur increased revenue through improved metering and billing is allowing the utility to invest in infrastructure improvements that are subsequently delivering improved drinking water quality to households while many strategies have been proposed for successfully transitioning from iws to cws the experience in nagpur provides a framework for other indian utilities to follow ilaya ayza et al 2018 our findings also indicate that continuity of service at the household tap is an important metric to maximize the water quality improvements of the jal jeevan mission that aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through functional household tap connections ministry of jal shakti 2019 in the near term the health impacts of iws could be reduced through two different approaches one at the municipal level and one at the household level first at the municipal level it may be possible to identify hotspots of fecal contamination within water supply zones and implement wastewater management interventions to reduce the flow of feces into the environment sakomoto et al 2020 for example targeted repairs of failing sewer lines proximate to water lines or extending sewer connections to unsewered sources of fecal contamination could reduce the flow of fecal contaminants into drinking water lines nijhawan et al 2014 replacing segments of sewer lines or failing latrine pits is likely to be more cost effective than the replacement of entire water distribution networks required to reduce non revenue water prior to implementing continuous supply in nagpur we detected genes associated with both zoonotic pathogens cryptosporidium giardia st etec and human specific viruses adenovirus norovirus which suggests the intrusion of feces including human sewage as the source of contamination the prevalence of pathogen associated genes increased significantly only between iws esrs and household taps which further suggests intrusion of sewage even in the cws area of the study further improvements in drinking water quality are possible since over half of tap water samples had free chlorine below the indian standard for drinking water mean turbidity exceeded 1 0 ntu and culturable e coli was detected in one sample importantly our observations in nagpur indicate that free chlorine residual was not predictive of pathogen presence as assessed by ddpcr while genetic material is not indicative of infectious pathogens the effectiveness of chlorination as a strategy to reduce exposures to waterborne pathogens may be limited especially for those more resistant to chlorine such as protozoa and some viruses both of which we detected payment 1999 a second approach is improvement of water quality at the point of use previous studies of microbial water quality in nagpur have documented degradation of water quality from the moment of delivery at the tap to the moment of consumption at the point of use especially in low income households elala et al 2011 john et al 2014 risk assessments of household water treatment indicate that health gains for such treatment technologies are driven by consistent and effective use bivins et al 2019 however in india treatment of drinking water at the household level is low and variable with 25 of households in mumbai 44 in bengaluru and 33 in a delhi slum indicating they treat their drinking water at the household mitlin et al 2019 sangma et al 2019 while household water treatment could be an important temporary solution to decrease waterborne disease associated with iws it is clear that designs must be implemented that balance ease of use and efficacy to maximize benefits li et al 2020 4 6 implications for the sustainable development goals the sustainable development goals sdgs define access to safely managed drinking water services as those that are 1 located on premises 2 available when needed and 3 free from fecal and priority chemical contamination while piped supplies can be configured to provide on premise service iws has important implications for both the availability and contamination of drinking water regarding availability the precise definition of this metric remains ambiguous who defines when drinking water is needed the customer or the service provider or government entities most households receiving iws store their water to ensure availability a behavior known to be associated with increased contamination however in iws availability as modulated by pressurizing the piped network to distribute water is directly linked with fecal contamination a previous analysis found that 50 of drinking water samples from iwss were contaminated with culturable e coli and in the current study 44 of grab samples from household taps receiving iws contained culturable e coli bivins et al 2017 importantly and simultaneously we found that only 4 of grab samples from cws areas contained e coli these observations along with those from other studies indicate that iws especially in settings characterized by prevalent fecal contamination is unlikely to meet the standards for safely managed drinking water piped water service continuity modulates both availability and fecal contamination and should therefore be incorporated into the sdgs 4 4 limitations several limitations constrain this analysis and suggest cautious interpretation first is a relatively small number of total samples despite a large number of deuf samples given the likely large spatial and temporal variability in drinking water quality due to limited time and resources and the logistical constraints of transporting kidney dialysis filters to india we collected only 90 deuf samples and 56 grab samples in the course of our study however these 90 deuf samples represent a total volume of 6 925 liters collected from the nagpur municipal water supply which assuming a 500 ml grab sample volume is equivalent to 13 850 grab samples while the drinking water volume filtered in a single deuf sample is not independent in time and space it does represent a significantly greater proportion of the delivered drinking water than a single grab sample for example we collected 9 deuf samples from cws taps with a total volume of 1 006 liters and did not detect a culturable e coli in that volume a second limitation of our work results from the use of molecular assays to detect gene targets associated with waterborne pathogens while the presence of such genetic material does indicate the presence of a pathogen direct inferences about risk cannot be easily made without accounting for the uncertainty and variability in the relationship between gene target quantities and the infectivity of the pathogen the degree of this uncertainty likely varies based on the microorganism class and the environmental compartment in our study we observed that a gene associated with e coli was weakly correlated with the number of culturable e coli in that sample however we also observed instances where we detected up to hundreds of copies of the gene target in samples where we did not detect culturable e coli given that viruses and protozoa are more resistant to disinfection than bacteria we assume that the same correlation observed for e coli and its genetic material could also apply for gene targets associated with pathogens in those classes korich et al 1990 another limitation is that we conducted sampling in only three different iws zones and one cws zone across two different time periods including two months in 2015 and six months in 2017 although we worked with utility staff to identify zones that were representative of the water supply it is possible that the limited number of zones might constrain the external validity of our findings also during the time frame of sampling the nagpur drinking water supply was undergoing many changes associated with the transition from iws to cws these changes included changes in personnel and operations and management protocols which could confound our findings additionally unlike other regions of india the city of nagpur is well supplied by surface water sources for its drinking water and is not subject to the scarcity that is frequently cited as the reason for iws and could significantly reduce the financial feasibility of conversion projects burt et al 2018 collectively these characteristics of our study design and site may limit the generalizability of our findings lastly a fundamental limitation of both our study and others is that these interventions did not consist solely of changes to the water delivery mode iws to cws kumpel and nelson 2013 these conversions were in the context of large multi million dollar upgrades of the existing pipe networks in the zones receiving cws these upgrades are necessary to prevent the tremendous increases in non revenue water that would accompany pressurization for 24 hours and to repair the extensive pipeline damage that is often associated with iws taylor et al 2019 2018 these conversion projects also included overhauls in the operations and maintenance practices of the entities responsible for the drinking water supply we know of only one study where iws zones were temporarily converted to cws without accompanying distribution line replacements in this study andey and kelkar found great improvement in microbial water quality however this was accompanied by an increase in non revenue water from 19 5 to 47 8 due to increased leakage andey and kelkar 2007 therefore the findings of our study must be interpreted as water quality improvements associated with a conversion from iws to cws accompanied by the repairs to distribution lines necessary to limit non revenue water despite the limitations of the current study our findings provide additional evidence that in certain settings iws is associated with degraded quality of drinking water compared to cws our findings are most relevant to india where some 460 million urban dwellers are served by iws these iws users are likely more frequently exposed to waterborne pathogens via drinking water and are therefore subject to an increased risk of diarrheal disease as a result the ongoing success of transitioning from iws to cws in nagpur and the subsequent reduction in microbial contamination of drinking water at the household level provides a compelling strategy that could be replicated elsewhere 5 conclusions culturable e coli and pathogen gene targets were less prevalent at household taps served by cws than those served by iws at least 460 million urban dwellers in india served by iws are exposed to drinking water that is more likely to be contaminated by waterborne pathogens compared to the few receiving cws the successful transition of water supply zones in nagpur from iws to cws predicated on financial solvency and reduced non revenue water delivers drinking water of improved microbial quality to end users the jal jeevan mission and sustainable development goals should incorporate measures of

16855,nearly half a billion people living in indian cities receive their drinking water from an intermittent water supply iws which can be associated with degraded water quality and risk of waterborne disease the municipal water supply in nagpur india is transitioning from intermittent to continuous supply in phases we conducted cross sectional sampling to compare microbial water quality under iws and continuous water supply cws in nagpur in 2015 and 2017 we collected 146 grab samples and 90 large volume dead end ultrafiltration deuf samples total volume 6 925 liters in addition to measuring traditional water quality parameters we also assayed deuf samples by droplet digital pcr ddpcr for waterborne pathogen gene targets at household taps served by iws we detected targets from enterotoxigenic e coli shigella spp enteroinvasive e coli norovirus gi and gii adenovirus a f cryptosporidium spp and giardia duodenalis we observed a significant increase in the proportion of grab samples positive for culturable e coli p 0 0007 and deuf concentrates positive for waterborne pathogen gene targets p 0 0098 at household taps served by iws compared to those served by cws iws continues to be associated with fecal contamination and in this study with increased prevalence of molecular evidence of waterborne pathogens these findings add mounting evidence that despite the presence of piped on premise infrastructure iws is less likely to meet the requirements for safely managed drinking water as defined by the sustainable development goals importantly these findings

end ultrafiltration ddpcr india microbial water quality drinking water 1 introduction nearly 1 billion people receive their drinking water and the accompanying microbial contamination from an intermittent water supply iws so named because of persistent water supply interruptions bivins et al 2017 the number of people exposed to iws is likely to increase due to urbanization climate change driven water scarcity and deferred investments in infrastructure mitlin et al 2019 iws results from a complex amalgamation of political institutional ecological and infrastructural constraints whose end result is the inability or unwillingness to maintain continuous positive pressure within a piped water distribution network galaitsi et al 2016 kaminsky and kumpel 2018 lapses in positive pressure within the pipelines provide numerous opportunities for microbial contamination and degradation of drinking water quality including intrusion of contaminants during low pressure periods regrowth during stagnation scouring during re pressurization and recontamination during household storage coelho et al 2003 kumpel et al 2016 the contamination of iws with feces could plausibly account for at least 17 2 million waterborne infections and 4 5 million cases of diarrhea per year bivins et al 2017 numerous cross sectional studies have documented the presence of fecal indicators including total coliforms thermotolerant coliforms and e coli associated with iws in various contexts throughout the globe including rural settings urban settings and refugee camps alabdula aly and khan 2017 alazzeh et al 2019 brown et al 2013 matsinhe et al 2014 rubino et al 2018 shaheed et al 2014 however such fecal contamination does not appear to be ubiquitous as a study of an iws in panama documented only 0 9 of grab samples were positive for total coliforms and one grab sample of 423 was positive for e coli by culture erickson et al 2017 during a longitudinal study in india 31 7 of grab samples from an iws were positive for e coli but the proportion of samples positive varied by hydraulic zone within the distribution network kumpel and nelson 2013 the spatial and temporal variation in water quality is likely due to the complex hydraulic conditions which exist within an iws and the distribution of fecal contamination sources within and between settings taylor et al 2018 while many studies have made cross sectional assessments of microbial water quality in an iws only two studies have made direct comparisons of microbial water quality in iws versus cws within the same municipal water system the first found that in four different indian cities a greater proportion of grab samples were free of fecal coliforms after a water distribution zone was temporarily converted to cws compared to the baseline iws condition andey and kelkar 2007 a second study performed in conjunction with a cws pilot project in hubli dharwad found that during contemporaneous sampling from iws zones and cws zones 31 7 of grab samples from iws were positive for e coli while only 0 7 were positive from cws kumpel and nelson 2013 the heterogeneity observed in microbial water quality is also found in the association between iws and diarrheal disease a systematic review found that persons served by iws had 1 61 times greater odds of gastrointestinal illness compared to those served by cws ercumen et al 2014 several cross sectional studies have found significant associations between iws and diarrhea among adults children and residents of refugee camps and slums abu amr and yassin 2008 adane et al 2017 trudeau et al 2018 an ecological study in the democratic republic of the congo documented a significant increase in the incidence of cholera cases following water supply interruption but could not isolate whether these cases were attributable to degraded water quality from the piped supply itself or from households switching to alternative water sources jeandron et al 2015 a longitudinal study of households in peru noted an increase in biomarkers associated with environmental enteropathy ee for children exposed to iws compared to those with cws exum et al 2018 in contrast a longitudinal trial associated with a pilot cws project in hubli dharwad india found no association between iws and diarrhea but did note an association with typhoid fever ercumen et al 2015 iws is especially relevant in india where as of 2005 63 of the population served by a piped supply has water available for 3 or less hours per day desai and vanneman 2005 mckenzie and ray 2009 from 2005 to

2018 two previous studies of drinking water quality in nagpur have noted considerable contamination in the iws water delivery system from treatment to the point of use elala et al 2011 john et al 2014 these studies along with numerous others utilized measurements of fecal indicator bacteria which while informative are only proxies for the presence of waterborne pathogens national research council 2004 a recent qmra noted that the use of indicator bacteria counts and ratios of pathogens to indicators were significant sources of uncertainty in quantifying the burden of diarrheal disease associated with iws bivins et al 2017 reviews of iws have identified uncertainty about the risk posed by pathogens introduced via intrusion as an important opportunity to increase our understanding of iws and health bautista de los santos et al 2019 we leveraged the transition of the nagpur water supply from iws to cws to document water quality differences between the two modes of operation within the same municipal water supply we used traditional culture based and physicochemical measurements along with dead end ultrafiltration deuf and droplet digital pcr ddpcr to assess the water quality with attention towards molecular measures of gene targets associated with waterborne pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design in nagpur the transition from iws officially began in 2011 and called for the entire supply to be converted to cws by 2016 however as of 2017 only 12 of 64 command areas had been converted we originally conceived of the study as a controlled before and after design with cross sectional measurements of water quality in one control iws command area at baseline and endline and concurrent measurement of water quality in one intervention command area that was iws at baseline and cws at endline we initiated the study in 2015 with sampling during june and july in two iws command areas within the nagpur water supply reshim bagh and karve nagar however when we returned in 2017 for the endline sampling delays in the project meant that neither of the command areas had yet converted to cws therefore we adapted our design to a cross sectional study of water quality along the water delivery system with the addition of samples from two command areas laxmi nagar old and khamla as shown in supplemental figure 1 the esrs in both khamla and laxmi nagar old command areas receive treated drinking water from the pench ii wtp via a distribution main that is continuously pressurized from these esrs drinking water is distributed continuously in laxmi nagar old and intermittently in khamla as a result our final study includes cross sectional water quality data from esrs and household taps throughout the water distribution networks in three iws zones khamla karve nagar and reshim bagh one cws zone laxmi nagar old and water quality data through the treatment train at the pench ii wtp raw water post filtration post disinfection with the assistance of utility personnel we selected sampling locations to be spatially representative of each command area approximate sample locations were collected via cell phone gps 5 m and mapped using arcgis

for a subset of 2017 samples we measured water service pressure at household taps using a dickson pr125 pressure logger dickson unigage inc addison il usa 2 3 culture based methods for most samples we collected a paired grab sample and large volume deuf sample however due to our limited number of ultrafilters we also occasionally collected grab samples without an accompanying deuf sample in 2015 we collected 300 ml grab samples in whirl pak bags pre dosed with sodium thiosulfate nasco fort atkinson wi usa whereas in 2017 we collected 500 ml grab samples in sterile plastic bottles pre dosed with

determined the 95 limit of detection 95 lod for each assay by running ten technical replicates along each step of a dilution series of positive control materials we then fit a cumulative gaussian distribution to the observed proportion of technical replicates that were positive along the concentration gradient and used the resulting mean and standard deviation to calculate the 95th percentile of the fitted distribution stokdyk et al 2016 in ddpcr the concentration of a gene target in the reaction mix is estimated by means of a most probable number according to a poisson distribution using the proportion of droplets classified as positive for the target based on their observed fluorescence intensity after thermal cycling pinheiro and emslie 2018 we estimated the copy number of genetic targets in our ddpcr assays using both a manual threshold in quantasoft v1 7 4 bio rad hercules ca usa and a model based classification called umbrella implemented in rstudio version 1 1 456 rstudio team 2015 jacobs et al 2017 to minimize the likelihood of false positives due to droplet misclassification especially of droplets at fluorescence levels between the positive and negative clusters observed in controls we only interpreted samples with two or more positive droplets by either thresholding method as positive for the relevant gene targe the complete microbiology workflow used during

was no difference in the observed hpc at taps receiving iws compared to cws p 0 8761 supplemental figure 5d we discontinued our enumeration of heterotrophs due to the labor intensity of the dilution

prevalence observed in karve nagar p 0 0077 and reshim bagh p 0 0231 we enumerated e coli in deuf backflush from samples collected from the pench ii wtp esrs and household taps receiving iws and cws drinking while all backflush samples were positive for e coli from raw water and post filtration no sample was positive for culturable e coli post disinfection fig 2 a in the iws command area 11 of deuf backflush samples collected at the esr were positive for e coli and 56 at household taps for cws 56 of deuf backflush samples from the esr were positive while none were positive at the household tap e coli counts excluding non detections and tntcs as enumerated via deuf at esrs and taps in the iws and the cws area are shown in fig 2b the differences in the proportion of samples positive and counts were not significant 3 5 ddpcr analysis of deuf samples prior to assaying the deuf concentrate for gene targets we analyzed the cdna from each sample for the brsv process control brsv is a qualitative control where we interpret successful detection via ddpcr to indicate a successful extraction reverse transcription and amplification within the matrix of that sample we detected brsv in each sample and all negative extraction controls were void of the target further we found strong linear agreement between ddpcr quantification of brsv by manual thresholding and umbrella thresholding y 1x 0 412 r2 1 00 as can be seen in supplemental fig 6 for the ms2g1 beta giardin norovirus gi orf1 2 norovirus gii orf1 2 ipah sth and cryptosporidium 18s rrna assays we observed no false positive droplets in negative controls by either thresholding method in the hexon assay we observed one false positive droplet among 265 592 negative control droplets by manual thresholding and zero by umbrella thresholding out of 1 152 total ddpcr wells we only observed large discrepancies between manual and umbrella quantification in 19 2 beta giardin 8 sth and 9 cryptosporidium 18s rrna in each instance the umbrella results for that well were discarded and the manual thresholding results were used for quantification of the target the exception to this agreement was the ybbw assay where large shifts in the background fluorescence levels of samples compared to negative controls caused significant discrepancies between the manual and umbrella thresholding in this instance we discarded the umbrella thresholding entirely and report only the manual thresholding results we assayed deuf concentrates for two gene targets associated with fecal indicators gene target ms2g1 associated with male specific coliphage was detected in only one sample which originated from the cws esr 170 gc l however ybbw a gene associated with e coli was detected in 45 deuf concentrate samples boxplots of the observed ybbw concentration in the pench ii wtp iws and cws sampling locations are shown in supplemental fig 7 after accounting for random variation the counts of ybbw were different only between the raw water and the disinfected drinking water at pench ii wtp p 0 0150 and between the raw water and the water at household taps receiving cws p 0 0037 a comparison of the proportion of deuf backflush samples positive for culturable e coli and the ybbw gene supplemental fig 8 indicates that the gene target was frequently present even when culturable e coli was not however there was only a significant difference in the prevalence for household taps receiving cws p 0 0294 across 21 pairs of culturable e coli and ybbw counts we observed a weak correlation ρ 0 4172 p 0 0599 supplemental fig 9 we detected genetic targets associated with bacterial pathogens in 12 deuf samples we observed ipah associated with shigella and eiec in one sample from a household tap in an iws command area 820 gc l we detected sth associated with etec in 11 deuf samples six from iws household taps range 170 1 400 gc l three from esrs range 72 84 gc l and two from the pench ii wtp range 72 110 gc l for viral pathogens we observed genetic targets in 15 deuf samples we detected the orf1 2 target associated with norovirus gi in samples from three iws household taps range 2 900 19 000 gc l and the orf1 2 target associated with norovirus gii in samples from four iws taps range 3 700 80 000 gc l and one esr 2 600 gc l we detected the hexon gene associated with adenovirus a f in a total of seven samples three from iws taps range 250 690 gc l one from an esr 24 gc l and three samples from the pench ii wtp range 26 44 gc l lastly we observed genetic targets associated with protozoan pathogens in 10 deuf concentrate samples we detected beta giardin associated with giardia duodenalis in samples from five iws taps range 23 110 gc l and one esr 79 gc l we detected the 18s rrna gene target associated with cryptosporidium in one iws household tap sample 430 gc l one cws household tap 67 gc l and one pench ii wtp sample 88 gc l the total number of deuf samples positive for each gene target stratified by sampling location are summarized in supplemental table 2 supplemental table 3 summarizes the number of deuf samples positive by ddpcr for each gene target and all gene targets associated with pathogens in iws versus cws command areas the prevalence of gene targets associated with pathogens and an aggregate of all pathogen detections within deuf samples as observed at iws taps versus cws taps are summarized in fig 3 a except for cryptosporidium 18s rrna which was detected in a single sample at both iws and cws taps pathogen associated genetic elements were detected more frequently in iws taps genetic evidence of pathogens was detected in 61 95 ci 45 75 of samples from iws taps and 11 95 ci 0 57 43 of samples from cws taps iws was associated with an increase in the prevalence of aggregate pathogen gene targets compared to cws p 0 0098 as shown in fig 3b the prevalence of pathogen gene targets decreased from pench ii raw water through the treatment train increased from the treatment plant to the esrs and then increased from esr to household taps for cws while increasing from esr to household taps for iws the only statistically significant change was the increased prevalence from the iws esr to iws household taps p 0 0026 across 58 paired observations of free chlorine and ddpcr detected pathogens from both iws and cws distribution networks esrs and household taps free chlorine was not a predictor of pathogen detection log likelihood p 0 94 even when stratified by iws n 43 and cws n 15 free chlorine was not predictive of pathogen positivity iws p 0 95 cws p 0 54 4 discussion 4 1 drinking water quality in iws compared to cws our observations highlight several important features of the quality of drinking water delivered by iws versus cws our data suggest that microbial water quality was degraded in iws zones as mean counts of thermotolerant coliforms and e coli increased from the esr to household taps while in cws they decreased our data also suggest the variance of water quality parameters including free chlorine turbidity and microbial counts at household taps was greater in iws zones compared to cws zones we observed an increase in the proportion of grab samples positive for e coli from taps served by iws versus cws in the indian context our findings are consistent with a previous study of drinking water quality in hubli dharwad that documented significant degradation of drinking water quality in iws zones compared to a cws demonstration zone kumpel and nelson 2013 however e coli detections in grab samples can be difficult to interpret and non specific in regard to drinking water safety in piped water systems especially in settings where e coli has been observed to grow in the environment hatam et al 2020 nowicki et al 2021 4 2 waterborne pathogens in iws vs cws our study is the first to provide observations concerning the presence of genetic targets associated with waterborne pathogens in areas receiving iws versus cws within the same municipal supply we detected targets associated with seven different fecal oral pathogens at taps in iws zones compared to one pathogen target detected at a tap in the cws zone we detected genes associated with bacterial viral and protozoan pathogens indicating that all microbial classes could be associated with waterborne disease transmitted via iws each of the genes we detected is associated with a pathogen that contributes to the burden of diarrheal disease among children in south asia as observed in the mal ed and gems trials liu et al 2016 platts mills et al 2018 we observed that the proportion of samples positive for any pathogen gene target in samples collected from cws taps was less than the proportion from iws taps our observation indicates that cws users in the study context are subject to a decreased likelihood of exposure to waterborne pathogens compared to iws users of course our findings like all environmental surveillance using molecular methods rely upon the implicit assumption that the observed gene counts are positively correlated with viable and infectious organisms within the sample though our data cannot directly indicate viability of pathogens we concurrently detected culturable e coli in many samples from iws taps 4 3 heterogeneity in water quality in iws our findings also emphasize the heterogeneity in drinking water quality in iwss we observed variations in water quality between hydraulically isolated iws zones within the nagpur municipal water supply for example 80 of grab samples were positive for e coli in one iws zone of while only 28 were positive in another this is consistent with previous observations in hubli dharwad kumpel and nelson 2013 meanwhile erickson et al detected culturable total coliforms in only four samples and e coli in only one sample of 423 from an iws in panama 2017 these findings indicate that the microbial quality of water delivered by an iws is likely dependent on context specific variables given the complex hydraulic boundary conditions of iws distribution networks it is likely that these context specific variables must be defined at the level of hydraulic zones within municipal water supplies taylor et al 2018 such variables are likely to include types and density of fecal pollution sources within the zone operations and maintenance of the distribution network and the hydraulic boundary conditions however in contexts where fecal contamination is prevalent iws can make piped water networks efficient transmitters of waterborne disease anandan et al 2021 4 5 policy implications for iws in india our results strongly suggest that in nagpur the conversion from iws to cws effectively reduced fecal contamination in drinking water and genetic elements associated with waterborne pathogens while these results are directly attributable to physical improvements in the water infrastructure it is extremely important to note that these physical improvements flow from improvements in governance and management hastak et al 2017 historically indian utilities have been characterized by inefficiency increasing costs flat revenues with only 20 of connections metered and non revenue water rates of 40 or more nyathikala and kulshrestha 2017 wsp 2014 during the conversion in nagpur increased metering and decreased non revenue water has been critical to the financial solvency of the project and improving compliance with service level benchmarks hastak et al 2017 our findings indicate that in nagpur increased revenue through improved metering and billing is allowing the utility to invest in infrastructure improvements that are subsequently delivering improved drinking water quality to households while many strategies have been proposed for successfully transitioning from iws to cws the experience in nagpur provides a framework for other indian utilities to follow ilaya ayza et al 2018 our findings also indicate that continuity of service at the household tap is an important metric to maximize the water quality improvements of the jal jeevan mission that aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through functional household tap connections ministry of jal shakti 2019 in the near term the health impacts of iws could be reduced through two different approaches one at the municipal level and one at the household level first at the municipal level it may be possible to identify hotspots of fecal contamination within water supply zones and implement wastewater management interventions to reduce the flow of feces into the environment sakomoto et al 2020 for example targeted repairs of failing sewer lines proximate to water lines or extending sewer connections to unsewered sources of fecal contamination could reduce the flow of fecal contaminants into drinking water lines nijhawan et al 2014 replacing segments of sewer lines or failing latrine pits is likely to be more cost effective than the replacement of entire water distribution networks required to reduce non revenue water prior to implementing continuous supply in nagpur we detected genes associated with both zoonotic pathogens cryptosporidium giardia st etec and human specific viruses adenovirus norovirus which suggests the intrusion of feces including human sewage as the source of contamination the prevalence of pathogen associated genes increased significantly only between iws esrs and household taps which further suggests intrusion of sewage even in the cws area of the study further improvements in drinking water quality are possible since over half of tap water samples had free chlorine below the indian standard for drinking water mean turbidity exceeded 1 0 ntu and culturable e coli was detected in one sample importantly our observations in nagpur indicate that free chlorine residual was not predictive of pathogen presence as assessed by ddpcr while genetic material is not indicative of infectious pathogens the effectiveness of chlorination as a strategy to reduce exposures to waterborne pathogens may be limited especially for those more resistant to chlorine such as protozoa and some viruses both of which we detected payment 1999 a second approach is improvement of water quality at the point of use previous studies of microbial water quality in nagpur have documented degradation of water quality from the moment of delivery at the tap to the moment of consumption at the point of use especially in low income households elala et al 2011 john et al 2014 risk assessments of household water treatment indicate that health gains for such treatment technologies are driven by consistent and effective use bivins et al 2019 however in india treatment of drinking water at the household level is low and variable with 25 of households in mumbai 44 in bengaluru and 33 in a delhi slum indicating they treat their drinking water at the household mitlin et al 2019 sangma et al 2019 while household water treatment could be an important temporary solution to decrease waterborne disease associated with iws it is clear that designs must be implemented that balance ease of use and efficacy to maximize benefits li et al 2020 4 6 implications for the sustainable development goals the sustainable development goals sdgs define access to safely managed drinking water services as those that are 1 located on premises 2 available when needed and 3 free from fecal and priority chemical contamination while piped supplies can be configured to provide on premise service iws has important implications for both the availability and contamination of drinking water regarding availability the precise definition of this metric remains ambiguous who defines when drinking water is needed the customer or the service provider or government entities most households receiving iws store their water to ensure availability a behavior known to be associated with increased contamination however in iws availability as modulated by pressurizing the piped network to distribute water is directly linked with fecal contamination a previous analysis found that 50 of drinking water samples from iwss were contaminated with culturable e coli and in the current study 44 of grab samples from household taps receiving iws contained culturable e coli bivins et al 2017 importantly and simultaneously we found that only 4 of grab samples from cws areas contained e coli these observations along with those from other studies indicate that iws especially in settings characterized by prevalent fecal contamination is unlikely to meet the standards for safely managed drinking water piped water service continuity modulates both availability and fecal contamination and should therefore be incorporated into the sdgs 4 4 limitations several limitations constrain this analysis and suggest cautious interpretation first is a relatively small number of total samples despite a large number of deuf samples given the likely large spatial and temporal variability in drinking water quality due to limited time and resources and the logistical constraints of transporting kidney dialysis filters to india we collected only 90 deuf samples and 56 grab samples in the course of our study however these 90 deuf samples represent a total volume of 6 925 liters collected from the nagpur municipal water supply which assuming a 500 ml grab sample volume is equivalent to 13 850 grab samples while the drinking water volume filtered in a single deuf sample is not independent in time and space it does represent a significantly greater proportion of the delivered drinking water than a single grab sample for example we collected 9 deuf samples from cws taps with a total volume of 1 006 liters and did not detect a culturable e coli in that volume a second limitation of our work results from the use of molecular assays to detect gene targets associated with waterborne pathogens while the presence of such genetic material does indicate the presence of a pathogen direct inferences about risk cannot be easily made without accounting for the uncertainty and variability in the relationship between gene target quantities and the infectivity of the pathogen the degree of this uncertainty likely varies based on the microorganism class and the environmental compartment in our study we observed that a gene associated with e coli was weakly correlated with the number of culturable e coli in that sample however we also observed instances where we detected up to hundreds of copies of the gene target in samples where we did not detect culturable e coli given that viruses and protozoa are more resistant to disinfection than bacteria we assume that the same correlation observed for e coli and its genetic material could also apply for gene targets associated with pathogens in those classes korich et al 1990 another limitation is that we conducted sampling in only three different iws zones and one cws zone across two different time periods including two months in 2015 and six months in 2017 although we worked with utility staff to identify zones that were representative of the water supply it is possible that the limited number of zones might constrain the external validity of our findings also during the time frame of sampling the nagpur drinking water supply was undergoing many changes associated with the transition from iws to cws these changes included changes in personnel and operations and management protocols which could confound our findings additionally unlike other regions of india the city of nagpur is well supplied by surface water sources for its drinking water and is not subject to the scarcity that is frequently cited as the reason for iws and could significantly reduce the financial feasibility of conversion projects burt et al 2018 collectively these characteristics of our study design and site may limit the generalizability of our findings lastly a fundamental limitation of both our study and others is that these interventions did not consist solely of changes to the water delivery mode iws to cws kumpel and nelson 2013 these conversions were in the context of large multi million dollar upgrades of the existing pipe networks in the zones receiving cws these upgrades are necessary to prevent the tremendous increases in non revenue water that would accompany pressurization for 24 hours and to repair the extensive pipeline damage that is often associated with iws taylor et al 2019 2018 these conversion projects also included overhauls in the operations and maintenance practices of the entities responsible for the drinking water supply we know of only one study where iws zones were temporarily converted to cws without accompanying distribution line replacements in this study andey and kelkar found great improvement in microbial water quality however this was accompanied by an increase in non revenue water from 19 5 to 47 8 due to increased leakage andey and kelkar 2007 therefore the findings of our study must be interpreted as water quality improvements associated with a conversion from iws to cws accompanied by the repairs to distribution lines necessary to limit non revenue water despite the limitations of the current study our findings provide additional evidence that in certain settings iws is associated with degraded quality of drinking water compared to cws our findings are most relevant to india where some 460 million urban dwellers are served by iws these iws users are likely more frequently exposed to waterborne pathogens via drinking water and are therefore subject to an increased risk of diarrheal disease as a result the ongoing success of transitioning from iws to cws in nagpur and the subsequent reduction in microbial contamination of drinking water at the household level provides a compelling strategy that could be replicated elsewhere 5 conclusions culturable e coli and pathogen gene targets were less prevalent at household taps served by cws than those served by iws at least 460 million urban dwellers in india served by iws are exposed to drinking water that is more likely to be contaminated by waterborne pathogens compared to the few receiving cws the successful transition of water supply zones in nagpur from iws to cws predicated on financial solvency and reduced non revenue water delivers drinking water of improved microbial quality to end users the jal jeevan mission and sustainable development goals should incorporate measures of

16856,photocatalytic activation of molecular oxygen o2 is a promising way in oxidative degradation of organic pollutants however it suffers from low efficiency mainly due to the limited active sites for o2 activation over traditional photocatalysts therefore we established a single atomic ag g c3n4 saacn catalyst with 10 wt loading of ag single sites for boosting the o2 activation during the degradation of tetracycline tc and 10 wt loading of nanoparticle ag g c3n4 npacn was studied as a comparison when using saacn the accumulative concentration of superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 reached up to 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1h 1 respectively within 120 min 11 7 5 7 and 4 9 times compared with those using npacn representing 17 24 of dissolved o2 was converted to

constants k for degrading the tc were 0 0409 min 1 over saacn and 0 00880 min 1 over npacn respectively mineralization rate 95 7 vs 59 9 after 3 h of degradation moreover the degradation ability of saacn did not decrease in a wide range of ph value 4 10 or under low temperature 10 c besides the high exposure of ag single sites other advances of saacn were 1 o2 was more energetic favorable to adsorb on single atomic ag sites 2 positive ag single sites were easier to obtain the electrons from the surrounding n atoms and facilitated electron transfer towards adsorbed o2 graphical abstract

integrated into traditional water and wastewater treatment plants for intensive environmental remediation under the action of aops precursors including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 guo et al 2019 ozone o3 yu et al 2020 peroxy monosulfate pms chu et al 2019 etc were activated and transformed into reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide o2 via direct chemical reactions or catalytic processes these precursors could provide highly efficient ros generation pathways and the corresponding valid removal methods toward pollutants however using these precursors were still limited by their production cost and difficult storage in the real applications therefore from the viewpoint of sustainable remediation technology it is necessary to develop some green rich and more cheap ros precursors and their corresponding activation technologies recently reports showed that molecular oxygen o2 was a quite potential precursor for generating ros chen et al 2018 shang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 which widely exists in kinds of environmental media generally o2 can be catalytically converted into ros mainly via electron transfer or energy transfer the former way mainly generated o2 h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh while the latter mainly generated the singlet oxygen 1o2 nosaka and nosaka 2017 currently the conversion efficiency of o2 is greatly limited by the strict dynamics and thermodynamics barriers during the electron or energy transfer processes and usually less than 5 o2 in the medium could be catalytically transformed into ros which made the o2 far away from a good ros precursor like h2o2 or o3 etc therefore it is quite necessary to develop the novel and efficient catalysts for activating the o2 into ros and to further understand the mechanism overcome those dynamic or thermodynamic barriers recently single atom catalyst sacs have attracted growing attention in environmental remediation owing to its excellent catalytic activity for example ma et al reported that single cobalt atom could improve the activation of pms and the oxidation of multiple organic pollutants xu et al 2020 sun et al reported that single iron atom could boost fenton like reactions for degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid and phenol yin et al 2019 in these studies sacs have shown great potential in catalytic aops processes especially due to their atomic dispersion of active centers and special electronic structure this may make the sacs as good candidates for efficiently activating the o2 into ros however in the few early reports the conversion efficiency of o2 into ros using sacs is still lower than other ros precursors and the productive concentration of ros is always less than 10 1 mmol l 1 level li et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 further analysis showed that this can be mainly ascribed to the small loading amount of single atomic centers usually less than 1 wt even worse the unclear activation mechanism of o2 over single centers also hindered the rational design of the sacs therefore it is urgent to develop new sacs with high loading of atomic centers for activation of o2 and to further explore its working mechanism in these regards we established a new type of single atomic ag g c3n4 saacn catalyst with a loading of 10 wt ag single sites to boost the photocatalytic activation of o2 for the degradation of tetracycline tc a typical antibiotics pollutant wang et al 2016 xu et al 2019a 2019b 10 wt loading of nanoparticle ag g c3n4 npacn was also synthesized and compared here for saacn the cumulative concentrations of o2 oh 1o2 reached 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively and the conversion efficiency of dissolved o2 into ros was 17 24 while this value is 1 21 when using the npacn when additionally feeding air or o2 the accumulative concentrations of o2 oh 1o2 using saacn were even higher air 4 21 0 97 2 02 mmol l 1 h 1 o2 17 13 1 32 9 00 mmol l 1 h 1 due to the high concentration of ros the saacn achieved an excellent mineralization rate of 95 7 for tc which is much higher than that using npacn 59 9 moreover the mechanism analysis showed that the advances of saacn can be attributed to the optimized adsorption of o2 and the facilitated electron transfer pathway surrounding the ag single sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of catalyst saacn was synthesized via facile thermo polymerization method first a reactive comonomer silver tricyanomethanide agtcm was prepared via the reported method chen et al 2016 then 0 6 g of agtcm was dissolved in 20 ml of ultrapure water together with 6 g of melamine and 30 g of ammonium chloride the mixture was stirred at 70 c until the water was completely removed then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml porcelain crucible with cover and heated at 550 c for 3 h in a muffle furnace the obtained yellow powder was collected by centrifugation and washed with ultrapure water the product was finally dried at 60 c for 24 h in a vacuum oven for comparison g c3n4 cn was synthesized without the addition of agtcm npacn was synthesized with the addition of 0 6 g of ag nanoparticles commercial product xfnano china instead of agtcm 2 2 analytical method the concentration of tc was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 360 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 3200 mapada china salicylic acid was used as the probe for the oh detection xi et al 2004 the reaction of salicylic acid with hydroxyl radicals could produce hydroxylation adduct 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid and phenol shown in figure s1a grootveld and halliwell 1988 teismann and ferger 2000 the concentration of 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid was measured by detecting the absorbance at 330 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer nitro blue tetrazorium nbt 2 2 di p nitrophenyl 5 5 diphenyl 3 3 dimethoxy 4 4 bisphenyleneditetrazolium chloride was used as an indicator to detect o2 goto et al 2004 nosaka and nosaka 2017 yellow nbt with the reduction potential of 0 05 v nosaka and nosaka 2017 was reduced by o2 with the reduction potential of 0 33 v and becomes blue formazan k 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 shown in figure s1b the concentration of nbt was tested at 259 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer the 1o2 was detected by the measurement of decomposition of 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf and molar ratio of chemical reaction of 1o2 and dpbf was 1 1 jiang et al 2020 dpbf concentration was measured at the wavelength of 410 nm the concentration of h2o2 was tested via the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate dpd method zhan et al 2020 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the radicals were detected on an epr spectrometer bruker a200 with applying 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as oh and o2 trapper and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp as 1o2 trapper the identification of tc and its degradation intermediates was performed with ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry uplchrms orbitrap fusion thermo usa ten μl of extract was injected automatically into the uplchrms system with a waters c18 column 150 mm 10 mm 5 μm the eluent was composed of 0 1 of methanoic acid and acetonitrile and the flow rate was 0 2 ml min 1 gradient elution procedures see text s1 the hrms spectra were acquired over the m z range 50 7000 with the positive scan mode the concentration of dissolved oxygen do was determined with a dissolved oxygen meter smart sensor ar8010 china the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were detected via an analytikjena multi n c analyzer other details including materials characterization dft calculation methods gas feeding experiments and details of photocatalytic degradation were given in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure and chemical nature of catalysts the morphology of saacn was observed by transmission electron microscopy tem the tem image figure s2a indicated that the obtained sample possessed a highly open porous structure meanwhile ag nanoparticles were not detected the well dispersed ag atoms could be directly monitored by spherical aberration stem fig 1 a b the ag atoms were confirmed by isolated bright dots in the high magnification haadf stem image as elucidated in fig 1c zone 1 and 2 are enlarged and shown in figure s3a and b the distance between ag atoms was more than 4 0 å which confirmed that ag existed in isolated feature in saacn shang et al 2020 furthermore the tem characterizations of cn and npacn were also exhibited respectively figure s3 and npacn was decorated with nanoparticles with the diameter of 3 5 nm element mapping and eds spectra figure s4 and 5 further demonstrated that cn npacn and saacn were successfully synthesized with uniform element distribution the loading amount of single atomic ag in saacn was as high as 12 4 wt and it was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp table s1 and thermogravimetric tga figure s6 analysis and similar loading amount of ag in npacn 9 1 was achieved the only wide peak detected in x ray diffraction xrd figure s7 pattern of cn illustrated the formation of amorphous carbon nitride li et al 2016 and no obvious difference was found in saacn unlike cn and saacn diffraction peaks of npacn figure s7 matched those of the face centered cubic phase of elemental silver zhou et al 2020b extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs analysis further confirmed the atomic dispersion of silver a notable peak at about 1 4 å was observed in the fourier transformed exafs ft exafs curve for saacn fig 1d which corresponded to ag n scattering paths an ag ag peak at 2 6 å for silver foil standards was not detected in saacn verifying silver single atoms dominated the silver species in saacn quantitative structural parameters for silver in saacn obtained by least squares ft exafs fitting fig 1d figure s8a and b the coordination number of center ag atoms is about 2 9 and the average bond length of ag n is 2 37 å table s2 these results suggest that ag atoms in ag n are nearly coordinated with three n atoms and the corresponding model of atomic structure predicted via dft calculation the structure was proved to be the possibility of the presence of this kind of single atom ag catalyst is exhibited in fig 1d model of atomic structure of ag and ag2o cell and is exhibited in figure s9 as illustrated in fig 1e the edge position of saacn was between ag2o and ag foil demonstrating the average oxidation state of ag was between 0 1 cao et al 2020 due to the powerful resolution in both k and r spaces li et al 2020b xiong et al 2020 the ag kedge wavelet transform wt exafs was employed to investigated the atomic configuration of saacn fig 1f by comprehensive consideration of the ag n ag o and ag ag contributions the wt contour plots in saacn exhibited the maximum peak at 3 8 å 1 in addition compared with the wt signals of ag foil no ag ag coordination was observed in saacn these further identified the isolated feature of ag species in saacn bet surface area of npacn and saacn was 23 37 and 20 61 m2 g 1 respectively figure s10 table s3 no obvious differences were observed the weakening of vibration of cn heterocycles in saacn liu et al 2020 ft ir figure s11 decrease of epr spectra intensity at g 2 0034 n vacancies lv et al 2018 figure s12 of saacn and decrease of id ig of saacn less carbon defect and more sp2 domains zhou et al 2020b raman spectra figure s13 further demonstrated the formation of ag n bonds the positive 0 2 shift of ag 3d spectra 367 78 ev ag 3d5 2 compared with that of npacn 367 58 ev ag 3d5 2 indicated single atomic ag acted as a positively charged center xps figure s14 which was in accordance with the result of xanes especially cnc of n 1s 399 08 ev in saacn shifted towards high binding energy compared with that in cn and npacn 398 55 ev n c 3 of n 1s in saacn shifted towards low binding energy no other shifts were observed in cn bonds indicating the ag n coordination modified the distribution of electron cloud of cn support the totally different distribution of electron cloud in saacn compared with that of cn and npacn may bring amazing catalytic performance hu et al 2020 lv et al 2018 wei et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2020 3 2 reactive oxygen species generation and tetracycline degradation thereafter saacn catalyst was used for the photocatalytic degradation of tc via activation of o2 and cn and npacn was used as comparison in order to confirm the origin of the ros and evaluate the conversion efficiency of o2 over the catalysts various gasses nitrogen air and oxygen were fed into the saacn and npacn system fig 2 a b and c when feeding nitrogen gas none of dissolved oxygen do was detected figure s15 and ros were not found in this system either when feeding air ros of o2 oh and 1o2 can be finely generated with the moderate concentration of do figure s15 while feeding the pure oxygen the ros generation largely increased with the largest amount of do the dramatically different generation amounts of ros in various gas environments indicated that all kinds of the ros here mainly evolved from o2 the possible reason was shown in figure s19 the value of conduction band cb and valence band vb of saacn was 0 82 and 1 58 vnhe respectively cb and vb were calculated via kubelt munk method valence band spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra figure s16 figure s17 and figure s18 photogenerated electrons on cb of saacn could be captured by o2 to generate o2 e o2 o2 0 33 vnhe nosaka and nosaka 2017 as shown in eq 1 in addition the potentials of oh oh e oh oh 2 40 vnhe nosaka and nosaka 2017 were more positive than the vb of saacn which could not oxidize oh into oh therefore the oh probably originated from o2 via a multistep reduction process to produce h2o2 eventually converting into oh eq 1 5 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 concentration of h2o2 was detected figure s20 and it was accordant with the pattern of concentration of other ros meanwhile 1o2 is generated through energy transfer from the excited photocatalysts to the triplet ground state of o2 instead of oxidation of o2 confirmed by the scavenger assisted epr spectra eq 6 figure s21 and s22 1 e o2 o2 2 o2 e h2o h2o2 3 o2 h2o oh oh o2 4 2e o2 h2o h2o2 5 h2o2 e oh oh 6 o2 hv 1o2 thereafter the accurate amount of generated ros was checked fig 2a f when using saacn and within 120 min the amounts of o2 oh and 1o2 were 17 13 1 32 9 00 mmol l 1 h 1 with oxygen feeding respectively which was 4 07 1 36 and 4 47 times compared with feeding air 4 21 0 97 2 02 mmol l 1 h 1 and was 25 84 6 95 and 27 27 times compared with no gas feeding 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1 h 1 furthermore the amounts of ros generated in saacn system were much higher than those in npacn system when using npacn the generated amounts of o2 oh and 1o2 were 1 28 0 11 0 79 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively in oxygen and 0 77 0 09 0 61 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively in air 0 06 0 02 0 07 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively under no gas feeding and no obvious differences were observed in different gas atmosphere this phenomenon obviously exhibited the limited active sites for o2 activation on ag nanoparticles of npacn in our work the detected concentration of ros e g 0 66 mmol l 1 h 1 of o2 in saacn system without air feeding is the accumulative concentration within certain time therefore we further conducted the differentiations of detected concentration of ros which was used to test the ability of ros generation on transient time figure s23 results showed that differentiations of concentration of o2 oh and 1o2 in saacn system were higher than that in npacn system representing the excellent and stable ros generation ability in saacn system besides cn could generate all three ros which amounts were only about 2 of those generated by saacn o2 oh and 1o2 were 0 35 0 06 and 0 36 mmol l 1 h 1 under air feeding respectively figure s24 indicated single atomic ag sites were responsible for the much enhanced activation of o2 generally the o2 molecules can be activated into o2 by accepting an additional electron nosaka and nosaka 2017 in our photocatalytic system the provided electron is anticipated to originate from saacn therefore to trace the evolution of o2 epr trapping measurements were carried out to further identify the photogenerated ros as illustrated in figure s25a signals associated with dmpoooh a spin derivative of dmpo o2 was observed when 5 5 dimethly 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was added to the system confirming the generation of o2 similarly the existence of oh and 1o2 were also confirmed in figure s25b and c to intuitively show the advantages of saacn the generated concentrations of ros in saacn system without gas feeding were compared with several other state of art reports as shown in fig 2g the concentration of oh in saacn system 0 19 mmol l 1 h 1 was more than two times compared with those in other reports when o2 was used as the ros precursor method 3 6 for example was 3 4 times of that using method 3 cao et al 2020 12 3 times of that using method 4 hu et al 2020 and even 10 6 times of that using method 9 yang et al 2020 an ozone activated with thiosulfate reaction with additional of o3 0 06 mmol l 1 3 84 mg l 1 then the conversion efficiency of o2 using saacn within 120 min was calculated via the following formula eq 7 where t was the accumulative time and shown in fig 2h time dependent do concentration was shown in fig 2i and interestingly do sharply decreased when photocatalytic reaction was triggered conversion efficiency of o2 to o2 oh and 1o2 over saacn was 10 25 1 83 5 16 respectively and the total percent to 17 24 compared with other methods cao et al 2020 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a miao et al 2018 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2020 the conversion efficiency of o2 in our work increased more than one magnitude than those in cited reports when o2 was used as the ros precursor here the details were shown in table s4 7 conversion efficiency ros concentration 0 min t min oxygen concentration notably the cumulative ros in saacn system were higher than the maximum cumulative amount of do when feeding air and oxygen it was assumed that activation of o2 can also occurred on the interfaces of gas bubble catalyst this endowed the saacn with a bright prospect for combining with the aeration unit in the sewage treatment plant thereafter tc was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the oxidation ability of the photo generated ros using as prepared catalysts here fig 3 a g as shown in figure s26a neither saacn nor npacn could remove tc in the dark moreover control experiments revealed that tc could not be self degraded under visible light figure s26b fig 3a displays the time profile of tc catalytic degradation over cn npacn and saacn under xe lamp irradiation with a 420 nm cut off it was found that saacn greatly favored the degradation of tc 34 5 of tc degraded within the first 5 min and 83 15 91 10 99 14 of tc degraded within 40 60 120 min respectively the tc degradation efficiency decreased when using cn and npacn only achieving 43 1 and 62 5 respectively within 120 min all the tc degradation curves followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetic rules and the rate constants k were 0 0409 0 00880 and 0 00511 min 1 using the saacn npacn and cn respectively fig 3b although the ag single site photocatalyst saacn exhibited much better than that of ag nanoparticles npacn its degradation rate of tc is not so outstanding like its generation of ros we assume that it was related with concentration of tc ratio of ros and band gap structure figure s27 and table s5 then the total organic carbon toc measurement results fig 3c indicated that about 95 7 of tc could be oxidized to co2 and h2o after 3 h of degradation nitrogen in tc was oxidized to no3 figure s28 revealing the efficient photocatalytic mineralization of tc over saacn meanwhile toc measurement results of npacn system indicated that about 59 9 of tc could be mineralized after 3 h which was much lower than that in saacn system toc removal efficiency in saacn system had much more advantages over reported work table s6 the remarkable mineralization ability towards tc may owe to the abundant ros with diverse species and high concentrations then other parameters e g ph value humic acid temperature etc concerning about the real applications of saacn were studied fig 3d f the results showed that saacn kept good removal efficiency towards tc in wide ranges of ph value which is superior than most other aops methods fig 3d notably the initial within 60 min degradation rate k 0 0535 0 0424 0 0491 0 0430 min 1 when ph was 4 2 8 2 9 1 10 0 respectively even slightly increased especially when ph was 4 2 and 8 2 10 0 the standard ph value here was set to 6 8 and k 0 0409 min 1 it may be attributed to the variation of redox potentials of o2 and h2o 1 when the ph was lower than 4 8 the potentials of o2 o2 got more positive 7 which made o2 easier be reduced to o2 2 the potentials of oh oh decreased when ph increased e oh oh would be 1 65 1 90 vnhe when ph was 8 2 10 0 7 which would be more negative than the vb of saacn 1 92 vnhe endowing saacn the ability to directly oxidize h2o to oh in other words more oh would be generated while additional humic acids resulted in suppressed removal efficiency of tc fig 3e possibly due to the competition reaction with ros between self degradation of humic acid and tc besides the influence of temperature further revealed the relationship between degradation and activation of o2 fig 3f the inspiring increase of degradation rate k 0 0441 min 1 figure s29 at t 10 c temperature at standard reaction condition here was set to 25 c and in which k 0 0409 min 1 which demonstrated the concentration of o2 was important to degradation process do was 0 35 and 0 25 mmol l under 10 c 25 c respectively temperature dependent of do in figure s30 temperature dependent of concentration of ros in figure s31 more dissolved o2 brought more ros otherwise reduction of temperature would lead to slower reaction rate according to the well known arrhenius law likewise when temperature increased degradation rate decreased due to the decreasing of do similarly degradation efficiency of tc using saacn within 120 min was 99 19 99 14 27 01 respectively k 0 0453 min 1 0 0409 min 1 0 0030 min 1 figure s32 when feeding o2 air and n2 where do was 0 57 0 25 0 mmol l respectively fig 2i this result further confirmed the important role of o2 and when there was no o2 holes alone could slightly oxidize tc which was in accordance with the quenching tests below to further discern the main reactive species and advance understanding of the activation mechanism in the saacn system the quenching tests using specific scavengers were performed fig 3g compared with 99 14 of tc degradation efficiency within 120 min when not using any scavenger the additional of tempol o2 scavenger almost completely suppressed the degradation of tc only 7 50 of tc was removed within 120 min additional of cr6 an electron scavenger largely prohibited the degradation of tc 33 01 within 120 min whereas electron alone produced by saacn could not reduce tc figure s33a because the potential of cb of saacn was not negative enough therefore decline of degradation efficiency with quenching electrons may be ascribed to cutting off the pathways for o2 to generate o2 and oh eq 1 5 especially when isopropanol oh scavenger was added degradation efficiency reduced to 36 31 within 120 min which indicated that the oh transferred from the o2 played an important role in the degradation of tc additional of carotene used for quenching 1o2 resulted in only slightly suppressed degradation of tc 72 33 within 120 min this suggested that 1o2 did not act as a key role in this system since restraint on holes may accelerate production of electrons and more oh and o2 would generate minor inhibition over degradation of tc 79 91 within 120 min using edta 2na hole scavenger indicated holes themselves could slightly oxidize tc additional of triethanolamine and ascorbic acid other hole scavenger showed the same phenomenon figure s33b it was determined oh and o2 were primary ros accounting for the tc degradation process in saacn system whereas quenching tests of npacn system confirmed that holes and electrons were the main species figure s34 further indicating concentration of ros in napcn system was much lower and saacn showed good stability for three cycles figure s35a moreover saacn showed limited cytotoxicity to human embryonic kidney hek 293 cells at our working concentration fig 3h especially compared with tio2 nanoparticle a widely applied nano material when the concentration of catalyst was 500 mg l 1 cell livability of tio2 treated 293t cells for 24 h was 41 25 zhu et al 2006 meanwhile that of saacn treated hek 293 cells was 78 11 indicating saacn was more safe than tio2 nanoparticle the concentration of ag leaked from saacn ranging from 0 085 to 1 468 μg l 1 fig 3i less than 0 01 of ag content of saacn and saacn showed good stability for three cycles in figure s35a showed no inactivation activity toward e coli figure s35b saacn was estimated to be environmentally benign generally characterizing the intermediates generated during the tc photocatalytic oxidation could provide insight into its degradation pathway and the corresponding mechanism figure s36 tc photocatalytic oxidation pathway further demonstrated that o2 especially the oh from o2 were the main species in saacn system which was consistent with the results of scavengers experiments 3 3 the activation mechanism of o2 from the above results saacn showed excellent activation efficiency of o2 indicating a great potential for highly efficient generation of ros in future moreover this also brought high oxidative degradation and mineralization efficiency of tc therefore we further analyzed the mechanism of the efficient activation of o2 over monatomic silver catalyst using multiple methods including dft calculations and in situ synchronous illumination xps spectra etc figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 4a and table s7 the adsorption energy de of saacn and npacn is 0 85 and 0 35 ev respectively the higher the negative adsorption energy is the stronger the adsorption capacity of saacn for o2 is and it is more conducive to the subsequent o2 activation it is further qualitatively confirmed by o2 tpd fig 4b the intensity of o2 desorption peak of saacn is significantly larger especially in 146 c indicating a better o2 adsorption capacity on saacn and the subsequently more efficient o2 activation moreover the formation of o2 always stems from an electron transfer process from photocatalyst into the o2 woodham et al 2013 calculation results fig 5a table s8 displayed a partial electron transfer of 0 250 e into adsorbed o2 from saacn higher than that for npacn 0 232 e manifesting saacn possess better ability to activate o2 via electron transfer which can also be qualitatively confirmed by charge density difference fig 5f and g figure s37 the cyan region represents charge depletion and the yellow region indicates charge accumulation concurrently the oo bond length over saacn are activated to 1 31 å close to that of o2 1 26 å zhao et al 2013 which is favorable for the formation of o2 these results further revealed that the single atomic ag sites in saacn possessed better ability to activate o2 then photoluminescence pl spectra was applied to investigate the efficiency of charge separation and lifetime of photogenerated charges fig 5d and e figure s38 the spectra of cn figure s38 and npacn enlarged in fig 5d showed two emission peaks centered at 442 nm and 472 nm while saacn only showed the peak centered at 472 nm the emission peak around 442 nm may be assigned to some defects wang et al 2019 e g nitrogen vacancy further demonstrating existence of ag n bonds in saacn while the emission peak of all three catalysts centered at 472 nm is derived from band to band transition compared with peak intensity of cn and npacn that of saacn was much lower indicating a suppressed photogenerated charge recombination thus the acceptor states induced by single atomic ag do not act as a recombination center but serve as the separation centers to capture the photogenerated electrons ran et al 2015 saacn and npacn are n type semiconductors with electrons as major carriers confirmed by the mott schottky plots in figure s39 as 1 c2 versus potential all the samples show positive slopes then the calculated carrier densities zhang et al 2012 calculation details were shown in si of saacn and npacn are 2 39 1039 2 70 1039 cm 3 respectively the electron density of npacn is a little higher than that of saacn besides saacn showed lower transient photocurrent curves tpc figure s40a and higher interfacial charge transfer resistance from electrode to electrolyte molecules ran et al 2014 electrochemical impedance spectra figure s40b than those of npacn furthermore the charge carrier lifetimes of the samples were also evaluated fig 5c and saacn showed the shortest lifetime 2 02 ns the lower carrier densities and photocurrent and shorter charge carries lifetime of saacn may be attributed to the higher work function 4 36 ev figure s18 than that of npacn 2 90 ev and higher work function represents better ability to hold or catch electron kesavan et al 2021 kim and choi 2021 zhou 2020a since saacn showed less electron generation why o2 was more likely combined with one electron to form more o2 in saacn system we assume that it may be assigned to the better adsorption of single atomic ag sites and o2 dft calculation and o2 tpd in fig 4 and more electrons transfer to adsorbed o2 over saacn dft calculation fig 5a induced by photogenerated electron transfer in the excitation states in saacn when ag o chemical bonds were formed thereafter in situ synchronous illumination xps of the ag 3d and o 1s at 273 k under o2 ambient 1 atm at different exposure time to observe dynamic changes in their chemical states and bonding situation under light excitation were also shown in fig 5b and c amazingly under light irradiation and o2 ambient ag 3d spectra of saacn obviously shifted toward the direction of higher binding energy indicating that there were electrons loss in electron shells of ag atoms and ag would be electron donors meanwhile peak of o 1s spectra 532 28 ev assigned to adsorbed o2 of saacn shifted to lower binding energy indicating that o atom accepted electrons accompanied by the irradiation of light ag transferred electrons to o ag formed a more positive center oxygen formed a more negative center ag and o formed a coordination bond gao et al 2014 368 71 ev ag 3d5 2 531 58 ev o 1s under recovery condition therefore the process of electron transfer was more likely to occur meanwhile interestingly c 1s and n 1s spectra of saacn shifted to higher and lower binding energy respectively accompanied by the significant increase of ratio of the ncn peak in c 1s and cn c bonds in n 1s spectra to other peaks as compared with the ground state figure s41 indicating the formation of cn bonds zhang et al 2020 when terminate the excitation position of peaks of c 1s and n 1s both recovered to those in ground state but varies of ratio of peaks retain it is indicated that photoelectrons were excited from c atoms and transfer to n atom ag o bonds form and thus ag n bonds decrease resulting in the increase of cn bonds since n was photoelectron acceptor and ag was the photoelectron separation center ag single sites were naturally easier to obtain the electrons from the surrounding n atoms and then facilitated electron transfer towards adsorbed o2 as comparison xp spectra of npacn is obtained under the same condition figure s42 and ag 3d spectra of npacn shifted towards high binding energy but no obvious peak shifts were observed in o 1s indicating that electrons of ag in npacn escaped to the outer system instead of activate o2 as the charge density difference fig 5f and g figure s37 showed the charge distribution under unexcited condition when o2 is adsorbed on saacn and npacn charge redistribution mainly occurred at the ag c3n4 and ag o interface region since o ag c3n4 region in saacn was closer than that in npacn the charge transfer would be easier to o2 in saacn when it is excited the schematic diagram of electrons pathways is shown in figure s44 electrons of ag in saacn mainly transfered to adsorbed o2 meanwhile electrons of ag in npacn escaped to the outer system based on results of dft calculations and spectra mentioned above we have proposed the o2 activation pathway over saacn firstly o2 was adsorbed on the ag single atomic sites then under the irradiation of visible light ag donor the electrons and o2 accepted the electrons o2 was transformed to o2 and released o2 would further react with h2o and electrons generating oh and 1o2 all these three ros efficiently removed and mineralized tc 4 conclusion via advanced oxidation technology reactive oxygen species ros can be generated efficiently oxidized and mineralized the degradation resistant organic compounds wang et al 2018 2020b xiao et al 2020 compared with current ros precursors molecular oxygen is very potential due to its high abundance green and economic chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however based on the existing methods the activation efficiency of molecular oxygen is still too low to be applied in this study we demonstrated that photocatalyst with high loading of ag single sites could achieve an outstanding conversion efficiency of molecular oxygen as high as 17 24 which is even higher than that using h2o2 in other reports in a modeling degradation reaction of tc in aqueous solution more than 95 tc could be degraded and oxidized to co2 h2o and nitrates under attacking by continual and high concentration of ros moreover the degradation efficiency using saacn did not decay in a wide ph value range or under low temperature of 10 c our report provided a quite potential material and method for highly efficient converting the o2 into ros and degraded the organic pollutants supporting information additional information about tem images

16856,photocatalytic activation of molecular oxygen o2 is a promising way in oxidative degradation of organic pollutants however it suffers from low efficiency mainly due to the limited active sites for o2 activation over traditional photocatalysts therefore we established a single atomic ag g c3n4 saacn catalyst with 10 wt loading of ag single sites for boosting the o2 activation during the degradation of tetracycline tc and 10 wt loading of nanoparticle ag g c3n4 npacn was studied as a comparison when using saacn the accumulative concentration of superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 reached up to 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1h 1 respectively within 120 min 11 7 5 7 and 4 9 times compared with those using npacn representing 17 24 of dissolved o2 was converted to reactive oxygen species ros when additionally feeding air or o2 the accumulative concentrations of o2 oh 1o2 were even higher air 4 21 0 97 2 02 mmol l 1 h 1 o2 17 13 1 32 9 00 mmol l 1 h 1 the rate constants k for degrading the tc were 0 0409 min 1 over saacn and 0 00880 min 1 over npacn respectively mineralization rate 95 7 vs 59 9 after 3 h of degradation moreover the degradation ability of saacn did not decrease in a wide range of ph value 4 10 or under low temperature 10 c besides the high exposure of ag single sites other advances of saacn were 1 o2 was more energetic favorable to adsorb on single atomic ag sites 2 positive ag single sites were easier to obtain the electrons from the surrounding n atoms and facilitated electron transfer towards adsorbed o2 graphical abstract

integrated into traditional water and wastewater treatment plants for intensive environmental remediation under the action of aops precursors including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 guo et al 2019 ozone o3 yu et al 2020 peroxy monosulfate pms chu et al 2019 etc were activated and transformed into reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide o2 via direct chemical reactions or catalytic processes these precursors could provide highly efficient ros generation pathways and the corresponding valid removal methods toward pollutants however using these precursors were still limited by their production cost and difficult storage in the real applications therefore from the viewpoint of sustainable remediation technology it is necessary to develop some green rich and more cheap ros precursors and their corresponding activation technologies recently reports showed that molecular oxygen o2 was a quite potential precursor for generating ros chen et al 2018 shang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 which widely exists in kinds of environmental media generally o2 can be catalytically converted into ros mainly via electron transfer or energy transfer the former way mainly generated o2 h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh while the latter mainly generated the singlet oxygen 1o2 nosaka and nosaka 2017 currently the conversion efficiency of o2 is greatly limited by the strict dynamics and thermodynamics barriers during the electron or energy transfer processes and usually less than 5 o2 in the medium could be catalytically transformed into ros which made the o2 far away from a good ros precursor like h2o2 or o3 etc therefore it is quite necessary to develop the novel and efficient catalysts for activating the o2 into ros and to further understand the mechanism overcome those dynamic or thermodynamic barriers recently single atom catalyst sacs have attracted growing attention in environmental remediation owing to its excellent catalytic activity for example ma et al reported that single cobalt atom could improve the activation of pms and the oxidation of multiple organic pollutants xu et al 2020 sun et al reported that single iron atom could boost fenton like reactions for degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid and phenol yin et al 2019 in these studies sacs have shown great potential in catalytic aops processes especially due to their atomic dispersion of active centers and special electronic structure this may make the sacs as good candidates for efficiently activating the o2 into ros however in the few early reports the conversion efficiency of o2 into ros using sacs is still lower than other ros precursors and the productive concentration of ros is always less than 10 1 mmol l 1 level li et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 further analysis showed that this can be mainly ascribed to the small loading amount of single atomic centers usually less than 1 wt even worse the unclear activation mechanism of o2 over single centers also hindered the rational design of the sacs therefore it is urgent to develop new sacs with high loading of atomic centers for activation of o2 and to further explore its working mechanism in these regards we established a new type of single atomic ag g c3n4 saacn catalyst with a loading of 10 wt ag single sites to boost the photocatalytic activation of o2 for the degradation of tetracycline tc a typical antibiotics pollutant wang et al 2016 xu et al 2019a 2019b 10 wt loading of nanoparticle ag g c3n4 npacn was also synthesized and compared here for saacn the cumulative concentrations of o2 oh 1o2 reached 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively and the conversion efficiency of dissolved o2 into ros was 17 24 while this value is 1 21 when using the npacn when additionally feeding air or o2 the accumulative concentrations of o2 oh 1o2 using saacn were even higher air 4 21 0 97 2 02 mmol l 1 h 1 o2 17 13 1 32 9 00 mmol l 1 h 1 due to the high concentration of ros the saacn achieved an excellent mineralization rate of 95 7 for tc which is much higher than that using npacn 59 9 moreover the mechanism analysis showed that the advances of saacn can be attributed to the optimized adsorption of o2 and the facilitated electron transfer pathway surrounding the ag single sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of catalyst saacn was synthesized via facile thermo polymerization method first a reactive comonomer silver tricyanomethanide agtcm was prepared via the reported method chen et al 2016 then 0 6 g of agtcm was dissolved in 20 ml of ultrapure water together with 6 g of melamine and 30 g of ammonium chloride the mixture was stirred at 70 c until the water was completely removed then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml porcelain crucible with cover and heated at 550 c for 3 h in a muffle furnace the obtained yellow powder was collected by centrifugation and washed with ultrapure water the product was finally dried at 60 c for 24 h in a vacuum oven for comparison g c3n4 cn was synthesized without the addition of agtcm npacn was synthesized with the addition of 0 6 g of ag nanoparticles commercial product xfnano china instead of agtcm 2 2 analytical method the concentration of tc was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 360 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 3200 mapada china salicylic acid was used as the probe for the oh detection xi et al 2004 the reaction of salicylic acid with hydroxyl radicals could produce hydroxylation adduct 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid and phenol shown in figure s1a grootveld and halliwell 1988 teismann and ferger 2000 the concentration of 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid was measured by detecting the absorbance at 330 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer nitro blue tetrazorium nbt 2 2 di p nitrophenyl 5 5 diphenyl 3 3 dimethoxy 4 4 bisphenyleneditetrazolium chloride was used as an indicator to detect o2 goto et al 2004 nosaka and nosaka 2017 yellow nbt with the reduction potential of 0 05 v nosaka and nosaka 2017 was reduced by o2 with the reduction potential of 0 33 v and becomes blue formazan k 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 shown in figure s1b the concentration of nbt was tested at 259 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer the 1o2 was detected by the measurement of decomposition of 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf and molar ratio of chemical reaction of 1o2 and dpbf was 1 1 jiang et al 2020 dpbf concentration was measured at the wavelength of 410 nm the concentration of h2o2 was tested via the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate dpd method zhan et al 2020 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the radicals were detected on an epr spectrometer bruker a200 with applying 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as oh and o2 trapper and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp as 1o2 trapper the identification of tc and its degradation intermediates was performed with ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry uplchrms orbitrap fusion thermo usa ten μl of extract was injected automatically into the uplchrms system with a waters c18 column 150 mm 10 mm 5 μm the eluent was composed of 0 1 of methanoic acid and acetonitrile and the flow rate was 0 2 ml min 1 gradient elution procedures see text s1 the hrms spectra were acquired over the m z range 50 7000 with the positive scan mode the concentration of dissolved oxygen do was determined with a dissolved oxygen meter smart sensor ar8010 china the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were detected via an analytikjena multi n c analyzer other details including materials characterization dft calculation methods gas feeding experiments and details of photocatalytic degradation were given in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure and chemical nature of catalysts the morphology of saacn was observed by transmission electron microscopy tem the tem image figure s2a indicated that the obtained sample possessed a highly open porous structure meanwhile ag nanoparticles were not detected the well dispersed ag atoms could be directly monitored by spherical aberration stem fig 1 a b the ag atoms were confirmed by isolated bright dots in the high magnification haadf stem image as elucidated in fig 1c zone 1 and 2 are enlarged and shown in figure s3a and b the distance between ag atoms was more than 4 0 å which confirmed that ag existed in isolated feature in saacn shang et al 2020 furthermore the tem characterizations of cn and npacn were also exhibited respectively figure s3 and npacn was decorated with nanoparticles with the diameter of 3 5 nm element mapping and eds spectra figure s4 and 5 further demonstrated that cn npacn and saacn were successfully synthesized with uniform element distribution the loading amount of single atomic ag in saacn was as high as 12 4 wt and it was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp table s1 and thermogravimetric tga figure s6 analysis and similar loading amount of ag in npacn 9 1 was achieved the only wide peak detected in x ray diffraction xrd figure s7 pattern of cn illustrated the formation of amorphous carbon nitride li et al 2016 and no obvious difference was found in saacn unlike cn and saacn diffraction peaks of npacn figure s7 matched those of the face centered cubic phase of elemental silver zhou et al 2020b extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs analysis further confirmed the atomic dispersion of silver a notable peak at about 1 4 å was observed in the fourier transformed exafs ft exafs curve for saacn fig 1d which corresponded to ag n scattering paths an ag ag peak at 2 6 å for silver foil standards was not detected in saacn verifying silver single atoms dominated the silver species in saacn quantitative structural parameters for silver in saacn obtained by least squares ft exafs fitting fig 1d figure s8a and b the coordination number of center ag atoms is about 2 9 and the average bond length of ag n is 2 37 å table s2 these results suggest that ag atoms in ag n are nearly coordinated with three n atoms and the corresponding model of atomic structure predicted via dft calculation the structure was proved to be the possibility of the presence of this kind of single atom ag catalyst is exhibited in fig 1d model of atomic structure of ag and ag2o cell and is exhibited in figure s9 as illustrated in fig 1e the edge position of saacn was between ag2o and ag foil demonstrating the average oxidation state of ag was between 0 1 cao et al 2020 due to the powerful resolution in both k and r spaces li et al 2020b xiong et al 2020 the ag kedge wavelet transform wt exafs was employed to investigated the atomic configuration of saacn fig 1f by comprehensive consideration of the ag n ag o and ag ag contributions the wt contour plots in saacn exhibited the maximum peak at 3 8 å 1 in addition compared with the wt signals of ag foil no ag ag coordination was observed in saacn these further identified the isolated feature of ag species in saacn bet surface area of npacn and saacn was 23 37 and 20 61 m2 g 1 respectively figure s10 table s3 no obvious differences were observed the weakening of vibration of cn heterocycles in saacn liu et al 2020 ft ir figure s11 decrease of epr spectra intensity at g 2 0034 n vacancies lv et al 2018 figure s12 of saacn and decrease of id ig of saacn less carbon defect and more sp2 domains zhou et al 2020b raman spectra figure s13 further demonstrated the formation of ag n bonds the positive 0 2 shift of ag 3d spectra 367 78 ev ag 3d5 2 compared with that of npacn 367 58 ev ag 3d5 2 indicated single atomic ag acted as a positively charged center xps figure s14 which was in accordance with the result of xanes especially cnc of n 1s 399 08 ev in saacn shifted towards high binding energy compared with that in cn and npacn 398 55 ev n c 3 of n 1s in saacn shifted towards low binding energy no other shifts were observed in cn bonds indicating the ag n coordination modified the distribution of electron cloud of cn support the totally different distribution of electron cloud in saacn compared with that of cn and npacn may bring amazing catalytic performance hu et al 2020 lv et al 2018 wei et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2020 3 2 reactive oxygen species generation and tetracycline degradation thereafter saacn catalyst was used for the photocatalytic degradation of tc via activation of o2 and cn and npacn was used as comparison in order to confirm the origin of the ros and evaluate the conversion efficiency of o2 over the catalysts various gasses nitrogen air and oxygen were fed into the saacn and npacn system fig 2 a b and c when feeding nitrogen gas none of dissolved oxygen do was detected figure s15 and ros were not found in this system either when feeding air ros of o2 oh and 1o2 can be finely generated with the moderate concentration of do figure s15 while feeding the pure oxygen the ros generation largely increased with the largest amount of do the dramatically different generation amounts of ros in various gas environments indicated that all kinds of the ros here mainly evolved from o2 the possible reason was shown in figure s19 the value of conduction band cb and valence band vb of saacn was 0 82 and 1 58 vnhe respectively cb and vb were calculated via kubelt munk method valence band spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra figure s16 figure s17 and figure s18 photogenerated electrons on cb of saacn could be captured by o2 to generate o2 e o2 o2 0 33 vnhe nosaka and nosaka 2017 as shown in eq 1 in addition the potentials of oh oh e oh oh 2 40 vnhe nosaka and nosaka 2017 were more positive than the vb of saacn which could not oxidize oh into oh therefore the oh probably originated from o2 via a multistep reduction process to produce h2o2 eventually converting into oh eq 1 5 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 concentration of h2o2 was detected figure s20 and it was accordant with the pattern of concentration of other ros meanwhile 1o2 is generated through energy transfer from the excited photocatalysts to the triplet ground state of o2 instead of oxidation of o2 confirmed by the scavenger assisted epr spectra eq 6 figure s21 and s22 1 e o2 o2 2 o2 e h2o h2o2 3 o2 h2o oh oh o2 4 2e o2 h2o h2o2 5 h2o2 e oh oh 6 o2 hv 1o2 thereafter the accurate amount of generated ros was checked fig 2a f when using saacn and within 120 min the amounts of o2 oh and 1o2 were 17 13 1 32 9 00 mmol l 1 h 1 with oxygen feeding respectively which was 4 07 1 36 and 4 47 times compared with feeding air 4 21 0 97 2 02 mmol l 1 h 1 and was 25 84 6 95 and 27 27 times compared with no gas feeding 0 66 0 19 0 33 mmol l 1 h 1 furthermore the amounts of ros generated in saacn system were much higher than those in npacn system when using npacn the generated amounts of o2 oh and 1o2 were 1 28 0 11 0 79 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively in oxygen and 0 77 0 09 0 61 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively in air 0 06 0 02 0 07 mmol l 1 h 1 respectively under no gas feeding and no obvious differences were observed in different gas atmosphere this phenomenon obviously exhibited the limited active sites for o2 activation on ag nanoparticles of npacn in our work the detected concentration of ros e g 0 66 mmol l 1 h 1 of o2 in saacn system without air feeding is the accumulative concentration within certain time therefore we further conducted the differentiations of detected concentration of ros which was used to test the ability of ros generation on transient time figure s23 results showed that differentiations of concentration of o2 oh and 1o2 in saacn system were higher than that in npacn system representing the excellent and stable ros generation ability in saacn system besides cn could generate all three ros which amounts were only about 2 of those generated by saacn o2 oh and 1o2 were 0 35 0 06 and 0 36 mmol l 1 h 1 under air feeding respectively figure s24 indicated single atomic ag sites were responsible for the much enhanced activation of o2 generally the o2 molecules can be activated into o2 by accepting an additional electron nosaka and nosaka 2017 in our photocatalytic system the provided electron is anticipated to originate from saacn therefore to trace the evolution of o2 epr trapping measurements were carried out to further identify the photogenerated ros as illustrated in figure s25a signals associated with dmpoooh a spin derivative of dmpo o2 was observed when 5 5 dimethly 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was added to the system confirming the generation of o2 similarly the existence of oh and 1o2 were also confirmed in figure s25b and c to intuitively show the advantages of saacn the generated concentrations of ros in saacn system without gas feeding were compared with several other state of art reports as shown in fig 2g the concentration of oh in saacn system 0 19 mmol l 1 h 1 was more than two times compared with those in other reports when o2 was used as the ros precursor method 3 6 for example was 3 4 times of that using method 3 cao et al 2020 12 3 times of that using method 4 hu et al 2020 and even 10 6 times of that using method 9 yang et al 2020 an ozone activated with thiosulfate reaction with additional of o3 0 06 mmol l 1 3 84 mg l 1 then the conversion efficiency of o2 using saacn within 120 min was calculated via the following formula eq 7 where t was the accumulative time and shown in fig 2h time dependent do concentration was shown in fig 2i and interestingly do sharply decreased when photocatalytic reaction was triggered conversion efficiency of o2 to o2 oh and 1o2 over saacn was 10 25 1 83 5 16 respectively and the total percent to 17 24 compared with other methods cao et al 2020 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a miao et al 2018 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2020 the conversion efficiency of o2 in our work increased more than one magnitude than those in cited reports when o2 was used as the ros precursor here the details were shown in table s4 7 conversion efficiency ros concentration 0 min t min oxygen concentration notably the cumulative ros in saacn system were higher than the maximum cumulative amount of do when feeding air and oxygen it was assumed that activation of o2 can also occurred on the interfaces of gas bubble catalyst this endowed the saacn with a bright prospect for combining with the aeration unit in the sewage treatment plant thereafter tc was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the oxidation ability of the photo generated ros using as prepared catalysts here fig 3 a g as shown in figure s26a neither saacn nor npacn could remove tc in the dark moreover control experiments revealed that tc could not be self degraded under visible light figure s26b fig 3a displays the time profile of tc catalytic degradation over cn npacn and saacn under xe lamp irradiation with a 420 nm cut off it was found that saacn greatly favored the degradation of tc 34 5 of tc degraded within the first 5 min and 83 15 91 10 99 14 of tc degraded within 40 60 120 min respectively the tc degradation efficiency decreased when using cn and npacn only achieving 43 1 and 62 5 respectively within 120 min all the tc degradation curves followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetic rules and the rate constants k were 0 0409 0 00880 and 0 00511 min 1 using the saacn npacn and cn respectively fig 3b although the ag single site photocatalyst saacn exhibited much better than that of ag nanoparticles npacn its degradation rate of tc is not so outstanding like its generation of ros we assume that it was related with concentration of tc ratio of ros and band gap structure figure s27 and table s5 then the total organic carbon toc measurement results fig 3c indicated that about 95 7 of tc could be oxidized to co2 and h2o after 3 h of degradation nitrogen in tc was oxidized to no3 figure s28 revealing the efficient photocatalytic mineralization of tc over saacn meanwhile toc measurement results of npacn system indicated that about 59 9 of tc could be mineralized after 3 h which was much lower than that in saacn system toc removal efficiency in saacn system had much more advantages over reported work table s6 the remarkable mineralization ability towards tc may owe to the abundant ros with diverse species and high concentrations then other parameters e g ph value humic acid temperature etc concerning about the real applications of saacn were studied fig 3d f the results showed that saacn kept good removal efficiency towards tc in wide ranges of ph value which is superior than most other aops methods fig 3d notably the initial within 60 min degradation rate k 0 0535 0 0424 0 0491 0 0430 min 1 when ph was 4 2 8 2 9 1 10 0 respectively even slightly increased especially when ph was 4 2 and 8 2 10 0 the standard ph value here was set to 6 8 and k 0 0409 min 1 it may be attributed to the variation of redox potentials of o2 and h2o 1 when the ph was lower than 4 8 the potentials of o2 o2 got more positive 7 which made o2 easier be reduced to o2 2 the potentials of oh oh decreased when ph increased e oh oh would be 1 65 1 90 vnhe when ph was 8 2 10 0 7 which would be more negative than the vb of saacn 1 92 vnhe endowing saacn the ability to directly oxidize h2o to oh in other words more oh would be generated while additional humic acids resulted in suppressed removal efficiency of tc fig 3e possibly due to the competition reaction with ros between self degradation of humic acid and tc besides the influence of temperature further revealed the relationship between degradation and activation of o2 fig 3f the inspiring increase of degradation rate k 0 0441 min 1 figure s29 at t 10 c temperature at standard reaction condition here was set to 25 c and in which k 0 0409 min 1 which demonstrated the concentration of o2 was important to degradation process do was 0 35 and 0 25 mmol l under 10 c 25 c respectively temperature dependent of do in figure s30 temperature dependent of concentration of ros in figure s31 more dissolved o2 brought more ros otherwise reduction of temperature would lead to slower reaction rate according to the well known arrhenius law likewise when temperature increased degradation rate decreased due to the decreasing of do similarly degradation efficiency of tc using saacn within 120 min was 99 19 99 14 27 01 respectively k 0 0453 min 1 0 0409 min 1 0 0030 min 1 figure s32 when feeding o2 air and n2 where do was 0 57 0 25 0 mmol l respectively fig 2i this result further confirmed the important role of o2 and when there was no o2 holes alone could slightly oxidize tc which was in accordance with the quenching tests below to further discern the main reactive species and advance understanding of the activation mechanism in the saacn system the quenching tests using specific scavengers were performed fig 3g compared with 99 14 of tc degradation efficiency within 120 min when not using any scavenger the additional of tempol o2 scavenger almost completely suppressed the degradation of tc only 7 50 of tc was removed within 120 min additional of cr6 an electron scavenger largely prohibited the degradation of tc 33 01 within 120 min whereas electron alone produced by saacn could not reduce tc figure s33a because the potential of cb of saacn was not negative enough therefore decline of degradation efficiency with quenching electrons may be ascribed to cutting off the pathways for o2 to generate o2 and oh eq 1 5 especially when isopropanol oh scavenger was added degradation efficiency reduced to 36 31 within 120 min which indicated that the oh transferred from the o2 played an important role in the degradation of tc additional of carotene used for quenching 1o2 resulted in only slightly suppressed degradation of tc 72 33 within 120 min this suggested that 1o2 did not act as a key role in this system since restraint on holes may accelerate production of electrons and more oh and o2 would generate minor inhibition over degradation of tc 79 91 within 120 min using edta 2na hole scavenger indicated holes themselves could slightly oxidize tc additional of triethanolamine and ascorbic acid other hole scavenger showed the same phenomenon figure s33b it was determined oh and o2 were primary ros accounting for the tc degradation process in saacn system whereas quenching tests of npacn system confirmed that holes and electrons were the main species figure s34 further indicating concentration of ros in napcn system was much lower and saacn showed good stability for three cycles figure s35a moreover saacn showed limited cytotoxicity to human embryonic kidney hek 293 cells at our working concentration fig 3h especially compared with tio2 nanoparticle a widely applied nano material when the concentration of catalyst was 500 mg l 1 cell livability of tio2 treated 293t cells for 24 h was 41 25 zhu et al 2006 meanwhile that of saacn treated hek 293 cells was 78 11 indicating saacn was more safe than tio2 nanoparticle the concentration of ag leaked from saacn ranging from 0 085 to 1 468 μg l 1 fig 3i less than 0 01 of ag content of saacn and saacn showed good stability for three cycles in figure s35a showed no inactivation activity toward e coli figure s35b saacn was estimated to be environmentally benign generally characterizing the intermediates generated during the tc photocatalytic oxidation could provide insight into its degradation pathway and the corresponding mechanism figure s36 tc photocatalytic oxidation pathway further demonstrated that o2 especially the oh from o2 were the main species in saacn system which was consistent with the results of scavengers experiments 3 3 the activation mechanism of o2 from the above results saacn showed excellent activation efficiency of o2 indicating a great potential for highly efficient generation of ros in future moreover this also brought high oxidative degradation and mineralization efficiency of tc therefore we further analyzed the mechanism of the efficient activation of o2 over monatomic silver catalyst using multiple methods including dft calculations and in situ synchronous illumination xps spectra etc figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 4a and table s7 the adsorption energy de of saacn and npacn is 0 85 and 0 35 ev respectively the higher the negative adsorption energy is the stronger the adsorption capacity of saacn for o2 is and it is more conducive to the subsequent o2 activation it is further qualitatively confirmed by o2 tpd fig 4b the intensity of o2 desorption peak of saacn is significantly larger especially in 146 c indicating a better o2 adsorption capacity on saacn and the subsequently more efficient o2 activation moreover the formation of o2 always stems from an electron transfer process from photocatalyst into the o2 woodham et al 2013 calculation results fig 5a table s8 displayed a partial electron transfer of 0 250 e into adsorbed o2 from saacn higher than that for npacn 0 232 e manifesting saacn possess better ability to activate o2 via electron transfer which can also be qualitatively confirmed by charge density difference fig 5f and g figure s37 the cyan region represents charge depletion and the yellow region indicates charge accumulation concurrently the oo bond length over saacn are activated to 1 31 å close to that of o2 1 26 å zhao et al 2013 which is favorable for the formation of o2 these results further revealed that the single atomic ag sites in saacn possessed better ability to activate o2 then photoluminescence pl spectra was applied to investigate the efficiency of charge separation and lifetime of photogenerated charges fig 5d and e figure s38 the spectra of cn figure s38 and npacn enlarged in fig 5d showed two emission peaks centered at 442 nm and 472 nm while saacn only showed the peak centered at 472 nm the emission peak around 442 nm may be assigned to some defects wang et al 2019 e g nitrogen vacancy further demonstrating existence of ag n bonds in saacn while the emission peak of all three catalysts centered at 472 nm is derived from band to band transition compared with peak intensity of cn and npacn that of saacn was much lower indicating a suppressed photogenerated charge recombination thus the acceptor states induced by single atomic ag do not act as a recombination center but serve as the separation centers to capture the photogenerated electrons ran et al 2015 saacn and npacn are n type semiconductors with electrons as major carriers confirmed by the mott schottky plots in figure s39 as 1 c2 versus potential all the samples show positive slopes then the calculated carrier densities zhang et al 2012 calculation details were shown in si of saacn and npacn are 2 39 1039 2 70 1039 cm 3 respectively the electron density of npacn is a little higher than that of saacn besides saacn showed lower transient photocurrent curves tpc figure s40a and higher interfacial charge transfer resistance from electrode to electrolyte molecules ran et al 2014 electrochemical impedance spectra figure s40b than those of npacn furthermore the charge carrier lifetimes of the samples were also evaluated fig 5c and saacn showed the shortest lifetime 2 02 ns the lower carrier densities and photocurrent and shorter charge carries lifetime of saacn may be attributed to the higher work function 4 36 ev figure s18 than that of npacn 2 90 ev and higher work function represents better ability to hold or catch electron kesavan et al 2021 kim and choi 2021 zhou 2020a since saacn showed less electron generation why o2 was more likely combined with one electron to form more o2 in saacn system we assume that it may be assigned to the better adsorption of single atomic ag sites and o2 dft calculation and o2 tpd in fig 4 and more electrons transfer to adsorbed o2 over saacn dft calculation fig 5a induced by photogenerated electron transfer in the excitation states in saacn when ag o chemical bonds were formed thereafter in situ synchronous illumination xps of the ag 3d and o 1s at 273 k under o2 ambient 1 atm at different exposure time to observe dynamic changes in their chemical states and bonding situation under light excitation were also shown in fig 5b and c amazingly under light irradiation and o2 ambient ag 3d spectra of saacn obviously shifted toward the direction of higher binding energy indicating that there were electrons loss in electron shells of ag atoms and ag would be electron donors meanwhile peak of o 1s spectra 532 28 ev assigned to adsorbed o2 of saacn shifted to lower binding energy indicating that o atom accepted electrons accompanied by the irradiation of light ag transferred electrons to o ag formed a more positive center oxygen formed a more negative center ag and o formed a coordination bond gao et al 2014 368 71 ev ag 3d5 2 531 58 ev o 1s under recovery condition therefore the process of electron transfer was more likely to occur meanwhile interestingly c 1s and n 1s spectra of saacn shifted to higher and lower binding energy respectively accompanied by the significant increase of ratio of the ncn peak in c 1s and cn c bonds in n 1s spectra to other peaks as compared with the ground state figure s41 indicating the formation of cn bonds zhang et al 2020 when terminate the excitation position of peaks of c 1s and n 1s both recovered to those in ground state but varies of ratio of peaks retain it is indicated that photoelectrons were excited from c atoms and transfer to n atom ag o bonds form and thus ag n bonds decrease resulting in the increase of cn bonds since n was photoelectron acceptor and ag was the photoelectron separation center ag single sites were naturally easier to obtain the electrons from the surrounding n atoms and then facilitated electron transfer towards adsorbed o2 as comparison xp spectra of npacn is obtained under the same condition figure s42 and ag 3d spectra of npacn shifted towards high binding energy but no obvious peak shifts were observed in o 1s indicating that electrons of ag in npacn escaped to the outer system instead of activate o2 as the charge density difference fig 5f and g figure s37 showed the charge distribution under unexcited condition when o2 is adsorbed on saacn and npacn charge redistribution mainly occurred at the ag c3n4 and ag o interface region since o ag c3n4 region in saacn was closer than that in npacn the charge transfer would be easier to o2 in saacn when it is excited the schematic diagram of electrons pathways is shown in figure s44 electrons of ag in saacn mainly transfered to adsorbed o2 meanwhile electrons of ag in npacn escaped to the outer system based on results of dft calculations and spectra mentioned above we have proposed the o2 activation pathway over saacn firstly o2 was adsorbed on the ag single atomic sites then under the irradiation of visible light ag donor the electrons and o2 accepted the electrons o2 was transformed to o2 and released o2 would further react with h2o and electrons generating oh and 1o2 all these three ros efficiently removed and mineralized tc 4 conclusion via advanced oxidation technology reactive oxygen species ros can be generated efficiently oxidized and mineralized the degradation resistant organic compounds wang et al 2018 2020b xiao et al 2020 compared with current ros precursors molecular oxygen is very potential due to its high abundance green and economic chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however based on the existing methods the activation efficiency of molecular oxygen is still too low to be applied in this study we demonstrated that photocatalyst with high loading of ag single sites could achieve an outstanding conversion efficiency of molecular oxygen as high as 17 24 which is even higher than that using h2o2 in other reports in a modeling degradation reaction of tc in aqueous solution more than 95 tc could be degraded and oxidized to co2 h2o and nitrates under attacking by continual and high concentration of ros moreover the degradation efficiency using saacn did not decay in a wide ph value range or under low temperature of 10 c our report provided a quite potential material and method for highly efficient converting the o2 into ros and degraded the organic pollutants supporting information additional information about tem images

uk pathogen contamination in treated water was verified as the source walker and moore 2015 kinsey et al 2017 more than 5500 patients were killed by e coli infections in 2015 in the uk which lead to high aggregate costs of 2 3 billion to the nhs andrew et al 2018 furthermore concerns over multi drug resistant bacteria in waterborne hcais outbreaks have increased due to the reduction of therapeutic effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infected patients hayward et al 2020 according to the o neill commission in 2016 approximately 700 000 patients die worldwide annually due to infections caused by antibiotic resistant microorganisms with the rate predicted to grow substantially o neill 2016 thus before such pathogens reach patients efforts have focused on controlling the misuse of antibiotics implementing safe practices of better hygiene and improving sources of safe water typically disinfectants are added to remove pathogenic microorganisms and to control microbial growth in treated water chlorination is an established method of disinfection but this practice is limited by the production of toxic by products in cases of hyperchlorination and inefficient

aeruginosa cell counts were determined in colony forming unit cfu ml using serial dilutions and the spread plate method before and after plasma treatment a sample of the effluent was also collected to determine the ph after plasma treatment using universal indicator paper due to the small volumes no change was observed from the original ph of the pbs solution 2 3 operation of the device a gas

uk and images were taken using an acceleration voltage of 2 kv and a working distance of approximately 6 mm 2 8 statistical analysis ibm spss statistic version 24 was used to perform statistical calculations the standard error of the mean is shown on graphs and tables using error bars and lower upper limits respectively ρ values were determined at the 95 confidence level using two way anova post hoc analysis with tukey s test was performed for all data the level of statistical significance was set at ρ 0 05 for the anova and t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial adhesion attachment and colonization of bacteria on the surface of the microchannel introduces the risk of blockage from attached bacteria that initiates aggregation and promotes the formation and growth of biofilms over time kragh et al 2016 this can lead to recontamination of treated water during water distribution for every treatment a control experiment with the inoculated sample flowing into the reactor treated only with the flow of air as the carrier gas but without plasma ignition was carried out no adhesion of large bacterial aggregates was observed on the channel walls but a cloudy appearance was observed in the fluorinated ethylene propylene tubing using e coli inoculated water fig s1 similar results were observed with p aeruginosa bacteria tend to adhere to surfaces forming microcolonies and developing biofilms tuson and weibel 2013 in continuous flowing systems fluid flow can enhance transfer of substrates such as nutrients in the bulk liquid to the adhered bacterial colonies or biofilms taherzadeh et al 2012 this allows the development of colonies and established biofilms on the surface of the channel which may significantly affect the number of bacteria leaving the reactor via the outlet and cause blockages in the microchannel over time the number of bacteria introduced into and removed from the device were counted no blockage was observed after running the inoculated water with both bacteria for 24 h at various liquid flow rates no significant reduction in bacterial counts was observed for both e coli and p aeruginosa ρ 0 05 as the solution containing these bacteria flowed through the reactor fig s2 this could be due to the enhanced fluid velocity and pressure from both air and liquid in the microchannel with small channel diameter on the order of micrometre exerting shear forces on the attaching cells inhibiting cell attachment and thus resulting in detachment of these cells rijnaarts et al 1993 donlan 2002 taherzadeh et al 2012 no fluorescing bacteria were observed on channel walls in areas where the plasma was formed fig s1 d this could be due to multiple processes and reactive species formed during plasma ignition bacteria are killed by the physical and chemical reactions induced by the plasma species such as chemical etching of the cellular surface which disintegrate their bodies and detach them from the surface burts et al 2009 scholtz et al 2015 3 2 plasma treatment of bacteria in monoculture samples planktonic bacterial samples were treated at various residence times by non thermal plasma generated in the microchannel the residence time of the inoculated liquid in the plasma zone was regulated through changing the liquid flow rate entering the microfluidic plasma reactor the surviving cfu ml of the e coli and p aeruginosa as a function of residence time showed that the viability of e coli and p aeruginosa decreased with increasing residence time there was significant difference ρ 0 05 between the untreated and plasma treated bacterial samples at various residence times fig 2 both bacterial strains were 100 inactivated no viable colonies were observed using 35 µl min liquid flow rate with residence time of 5 3 s in the plasma zone however compared to p aeruginosa e coli was inactivated more rapidly no colonies were observed at 4 6 s residence time following 24 h of incubation of collected samples after treatment a statistically significant difference ρ 0 05 was observed between the plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa as monoculture samples at various residence times this result indicated that p aeruginosa may require a higher residence time for further interaction between the bacteria and reactive species formed in the gas and liquid phase during plasma ignition or increased plasma density for a higher rate of inactivation lu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 pai et al 2018 chandana et al 2018 though both e coli and p aeruginosa are gram negative bacteria the outer membrane of p aeruginosa is 10 to 100 fold less permeable than e coli to reactive molecules or species breidenstein et al 2011 gellatly and hancock 2013 and thus may lead to slow transport of reactive species formed in the gas and liquid phase during plasma ignition into the bacteria ziuzina et al 2015 šimončicová et al 2019 after 72 h of incubation post plasma treatment colonies of e coli and p aeruginosa were observed on agar plates with samples treated at residence times of between 1 and 3 s the number of new colonies was low less than 100 cfu ml no new colonies were detected with samples treated with residence times greater than 4 s the differences in the residence time of the sample in plasma between this microfluidic reactor system and plasma reactors reported in literature demonstrate the significance of mass transfer for disinfection by non thermal plasma in shorter periods i e reducing treatment times from minutes and hours to just seconds malik 2010 reported that the surface area to volume ratio of water under treatment affected mass transfer indicating that high treatment efficiency observed using water spray or film was due to their large surface area to volume ratio compared to conventional reactors with liquid depths of cm or mm reducing the channel size down to those found in microfluidic devices in the order of microns increases the surface area to volume ratio as the thickness of the water film is reduced to micrometres this exposes the solution inside the microfluidic reactor to high concentrations of short lived reactive species thus greater mass transfer and penetration of reactive chemicals from gas into liquid was obtained in this continuous flow configuration using the microfluidic reactor compared to bulk reactors in static configuration where the plasma interacts at the interface of the bulk liquid requiring longer distance and diffusion times complete inactivation of bacteria was achieved using air as the carrier gas for non thermal plasma generation previous studies have shown that the antimicrobial effect of different carrier gases is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns higher concentrations of ros with pure o2 where long lived species such as ozone can be generated have been associated to a higher degree of sterilization zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 various studies have shown however that air where both ros and rns are formed can achieve comparative results to those using with pure gases achieving 100 inactivation of bacteria cubas et al 2019 du et al 2012 the use of air is advantageous since it is abundant and a cheap source for plasma generation and is hence a cost effective gas for plasma based water disinfection system as the main components of air are oxygen and nitrogen a combination of ros and rns are formed in plasmas short lived species no oh and superoxide and long lived species nitrates nitrites ammonium induce an anti microbial effect but the full mechanism of the direct oxidative effect induced by each species individually or the synergy of these chemicals combined with the effects of energetic uv radiation and intense electric fields has yet to be understood zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 in the liquid or gas phase ros and rns can induce depolarization as they enter the bacterial cell which leads to membrane permeation and adsorption of short and long lived oxidative species lunov et al 2017 accumulation in the bacterial cell results in oxidative stress and nitration of cell components as a result different types of protein essential for cell functions are damaged and in response signalling pathways get activated which can lead to dna damage cell cycle arrest and triggering of cell death pathways several long living species such as o3 and h2o2 can induce post plasma reactions through the generation of subsequent oh products via dissociation liao et al 2017 lópez et al 2019 3 3 plasma treatment of mixed culture samples a mixture of both e coli and p aeruginosa was used to investigate the efficiency of the microfluidic plasma reactor in treating mixed microbial bacterial cultures reduction in viable bacteria with increasing residence time was observed in the mixed culture sample of e coli and p aeruginosa with initial total concentrations of 7 40 105 cfu ml and 5 40 105 cfu ml respectively no colonies of either bacteria were observed after a residence time of 5 s in the devices with the plasma activated fig 3 the results of plasma treated mixed culture samples showed no statistical difference ρ 0 05 between the amount of surviving e coli and p aeruginosa however compared to the results with monoculture e coli from the previous section several colonies of e coli were observed on agar plates with samples treated to less than 4 s of residence time but all were eliminated after 5 s residence time several papers described inactivation of bacteria after plasma treatment yet few had further examined possible regrowth of colonies after more than 24 h incubation yingguang et al 2011 sanaei and ayan 2015 ercan et al 2018 after 72 h of incubation emerging colonies of e coli and p aeruginosa were observed from samples treated to less than 4 s of residence time in plasma but colony counts of less than 500 cfu ml were recorded no new colonies were detected with residence times of more than 4 s this could be due to the increasing number of bacteria killed with increasing residence time until eventually all bacteria were deactivated the regrowth of small colonies from samples treated with shorter residence times may be indicative of small colony variant scv bacteria or viable but nonculturable vbnc bacteria scv bacteria refers an aberrant form of bacteria generated in response to environmental stress characterized with a slow growth rate reduced metabolic activity and increased resistance to antibiotics which are able to recover over time when provided with essential factors such as nutrients proctor et al 2006 similar to scv bacteria vbnc bacteria which refers to live bacteria in a state of low metabolic activity and cannot be cultured remain a concern for potential risks upon exposure shorter residence times in plasma may not be sufficient to induce the same capacity of oxidative stress compared to higher residence time to effectively kill the bacteria but could potentially reduce their metabolic activity the ability of scv and vbnc bacteria to be resuscitated in favourable conditions such as nutrient availability and temperature increases the risk of colonisation and health problems proctor et al 2006 kriegeskorte et al 2014 ramamurthy et al 2014 3 4 visualisation of bacteria using scanning electron microscopy sem sem analysis was used to visualise the effect of non thermal plasma treatment on the bacteria images of untreated e coli and p aeruginosa confirmed the presence of viable cells with the cell membrane appearing smooth and intact fig 4 a d after plasma treatment both bacterial species showed distinct signs of damage such as cell membranes with a damaged integrity white arrows in fig 4b irregular shape and size white arrows in fig 4c f and dimples on the membrane surface white arrows in fig 4e the appearance of distinct damage on cells after plasma treatment has been previously reported for e coli and p aeruginosa plasma treatment compromises cellular viability that results in rupture of the cell membrane leakage of contents and exposure of genetic material to the surrounding environment affecting metabolic functions and ability to replicate and grow leading to death of the bacteria ziuzina et al 2015 sun et al 2018 the morphology change observed was associated with the electrostatic disruption of the cell membrane by non thermal plasma specifically electrostatic stress caused by charge collection on the outer membrane exceeding the tensile strength of the cell membrane mendis et al 2000 irregular shape and elongation of cell shape were associated with bacterial stress response and prolonged inhibition of division which can lead to cell lysis and death mojsoska et al 2017 jia et al 2019 sem results for shorter residence times showed a mixture of bacteria with intact membranes damaged membranes and subtle morphology changes in line with previous plate assay data regrowth of small colonies observed could be due to treated bacteria with intact membranes that had been damaged by the plasma treatment process but not killed fig 4b e studies have shown that membrane damage does not guarantee cell death and cells can retain their viability in a vbnc or scv state yost and joshi 2015 mojsoska et al 2017 wei and zhao 2018 ye et al 2020 sem images of the bacteria treated for higher residence times showed a mixture of damaged membranes and subtle morphological changes fig 4c f compared to shorter residence times longer residence times showed the absence of bacteria with intact membranes which could be due to more prolonged interaction between the bacteria and reactive species formed in plasma and hence the number of bacteria killed in relation to the antimicrobial activity of non thermal plasma subtle morphology changes such as variation in shapes elongation and dimpling observed after plasma treatment were associated with the progressive damage of the cell architecture that leads to ruptured walls and the release of cellular contents joshi et al 2011 dobrynin et al 2011 yost and joshi 2015 3 5 cell viability a live dead assay was conducted on cells treated with non thermal plasma since sem was limited in determining viability of treated cells plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa were double stained with dna intercalating dyes syto9 propidium iodide pi and observed using an epifluorescence microscope viable control e coli and p aeruginosa showed green fluorescence fig 5 a d while non viable plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa showed red fluorescence fig 5b c e f results showed that plasma affected the permeability of the cell membrane with pi emitting red fluorescence upon binding to the dna the results correlated with the sem results which showed distinct damage of the membrane caused by non thermal plasma treatment such as damage to the membrane dimples or holes which allowed the dna intercalating pi dye to enter the bacteria these morphological changes were related to the decreased viability of bacteria observed after plasma treatment for shorter and higher residence times using the plate assay compared to longer residence time shorter residence time of the bacteria with plasma treatment may not always lead to complete cell death and could potentially induce bacteria into a vbnc or scv state results showed a small fraction of 1 of green fluorescence detected which indicated live cells fig 5b e in samples obtained using shorter residence times this may correspond to some of the bacteria observed to have intact membranes in the sem images which may be in a vbnc or scv state fig 4b e however pi stains nucleic acids in bacteria with damaged membranes but even with damaged membranes some cells are able to maintain their viability sem observation of cell membrane damage is not conclusive evidence of cell death since similar subtle morphological changes were observed for both shorter and longer residence times no green fluorescence was detected in samples treated with higher residence times and after 72 h incubation fig 5c f this correlated with the plate assay where no regrowth of colonies was observed in samples treated with higher residence times and after 72 h incubation the overall effect of non thermal plasma was to progressively induce substantial damage in the cell structure which was residence time dependant a significant decrease in growth viability and culturability was observed with higher residence times compared to shorter residence times 4 conclusion antimicrobial efficacy of a microfluidic plasma reactor was investigated this microfluidic plasma reactor was able to achieve bacterial inactivation following just seconds of treatment both e coli and p aeruginosa showed the same trend with decreasing bacterial viability as residence time in plasma increased using air as the carrier gas effective disinfection of water was achieved full inactivation of both bacteria 108 cfu ml maximum number of each bacteria treated as monoculture and mixed culture was achieved after 5 s of residence time in the plasma region of the microfluidic plasma reactor mixed bacterial culture samples may induce some protection to plasma compared to the monoculture samples compared to e coli p aeruginosa was less susceptible to the plasma treatment the ability of plasma to penetrate the bacteria was confirmed with sem and live dead assays and post treatment culturing up to 72 h sem analysis revealed changes in cell morphology with ruptured cell membranes while live dead assays and post treatment culturing revealed viable and non viable cells after plasma treatment this work demonstrated the potential for using microfluidic non thermal plasma systems for the anti microbial decontamination of water the microfluidic plasma reactor allowed the control of fluid flow dynamics and utilized its inherent advantages such as a large surface area to volume ratio to facilitate improved mass transfer and plasma penetration of water leading to cell damage and reducing the viable bacterial counts by 8 orders of magnitude in seconds the operation of multiple devices in parallel

high aggregate costs of 2 3 billion to the nhs andrew et al 2018 furthermore concerns over multi drug resistant bacteria in waterborne hcais outbreaks have increased due to the reduction of therapeutic effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infected patients hayward et al 2020 according to the o neill commission in 2016 approximately 700 000 patients die worldwide annually due to

aeruginosa cell counts were determined in colony forming unit cfu ml using serial dilutions and the spread plate method before and after plasma treatment a sample of the effluent was also collected to determine the ph after plasma treatment using universal indicator paper due to the small volumes no change was observed from the original ph of the pbs solution 2 3 operation of the device a gas

post hoc analysis with tukey s test was performed for all data the level of statistical significance was set at ρ 0 05 for the anova and t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial adhesion attachment and colonization of bacteria on the surface of the microchannel introduces the risk of blockage from attached bacteria that initiates aggregation and promotes the formation and growth of biofilms over time kragh et al 2016 this can lead to recontamination of treated water during water distribution for every treatment a control experiment with the inoculated sample flowing into the reactor treated only with the flow of air as the carrier gas but without plasma ignition was carried out no adhesion of large bacterial aggregates was observed on the channel walls but a cloudy appearance was observed in the fluorinated ethylene propylene tubing using e coli inoculated water fig s1 similar results were observed with p aeruginosa bacteria tend to adhere to surfaces forming microcolonies and developing biofilms tuson and weibel 2013 in continuous flowing systems fluid flow can enhance transfer of substrates such as nutrients in the bulk liquid to the adhered bacterial colonies or biofilms taherzadeh et al 2012 this allows the development of colonies and established biofilms on the surface of the channel which may significantly affect the number of bacteria leaving the reactor via the outlet and cause blockages in the microchannel over time the number of bacteria introduced into and removed from the device were counted no blockage was observed after running the inoculated water with both bacteria for 24 h at various liquid flow rates no significant reduction in bacterial counts was observed for both e coli and p aeruginosa ρ 0 05 as the solution containing these bacteria flowed through the reactor fig s2 this could be due to the enhanced fluid velocity and pressure from both air and liquid in the microchannel with small channel diameter on the order of micrometre exerting shear forces on the attaching cells inhibiting cell attachment and thus resulting in detachment of these cells rijnaarts et al 1993 donlan 2002 taherzadeh et al 2012 no fluorescing bacteria were observed on channel walls in areas where the plasma was formed fig s1 d this could be due to multiple processes and reactive species formed during plasma ignition bacteria are killed by the physical and chemical reactions induced by the plasma species such as chemical etching of the cellular surface which disintegrate their bodies and detach them from the surface burts et al 2009 scholtz et al 2015 3 2 plasma treatment of bacteria in monoculture samples planktonic bacterial samples were treated at various residence times by non thermal plasma generated in the microchannel the residence time of the inoculated liquid in the plasma zone was regulated through changing the liquid flow rate entering the microfluidic plasma reactor the surviving cfu ml of the e coli and p aeruginosa as a function of residence time showed that the viability of e coli and p aeruginosa decreased with increasing residence time there was significant difference ρ 0 05 between the untreated and plasma treated bacterial samples at various residence times fig 2 both bacterial strains were 100 inactivated no viable colonies were observed using 35 µl min liquid flow rate with residence time of 5 3 s in the plasma zone however compared to p aeruginosa e coli was inactivated more rapidly no colonies were observed at 4 6 s residence time following 24 h of incubation of collected samples after treatment a statistically significant difference ρ 0 05 was observed between the plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa as monoculture samples at various residence times this result indicated that p aeruginosa may require a higher residence time for further interaction between the bacteria and reactive species formed in the gas and liquid phase during plasma ignition or increased plasma density for a higher rate of inactivation lu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 pai et al 2018 chandana et al 2018 though both e coli and p aeruginosa are gram negative bacteria the outer membrane of p aeruginosa is 10 to 100 fold less permeable than e coli to reactive molecules or species breidenstein et al 2011 gellatly and hancock 2013 and thus may lead to slow transport of reactive species formed in the gas and liquid phase during plasma ignition into the bacteria ziuzina et al 2015 šimončicová et al 2019 after 72 h of incubation post plasma treatment colonies of e coli and p aeruginosa were observed on agar plates with samples treated at residence times of between 1 and 3 s the number of new colonies was low less than 100 cfu ml no new colonies were detected with samples treated with residence times greater than 4 s the differences in the residence time of the sample in plasma between this microfluidic reactor system and plasma reactors reported in literature demonstrate the significance of mass transfer for disinfection by non thermal plasma in shorter periods i e reducing treatment times from minutes and hours to just seconds malik 2010 reported that the surface area to volume ratio of water under treatment affected mass transfer indicating that high treatment efficiency observed using water spray or film was due to their large surface area to volume ratio compared to conventional reactors with liquid depths of cm or mm reducing the channel size down to those found in microfluidic devices in the order of microns increases the surface area to volume ratio as the thickness of the water film is reduced to micrometres this exposes the solution inside the microfluidic reactor to high concentrations of short lived reactive species thus greater mass transfer and penetration of reactive chemicals from gas into liquid was obtained in this continuous flow configuration using the microfluidic reactor compared to bulk reactors in static configuration where the plasma interacts at the interface of the bulk liquid requiring longer distance and diffusion times complete inactivation of bacteria was achieved using air as the carrier gas for non thermal plasma generation previous studies have shown that the antimicrobial effect of different carrier gases is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns higher concentrations of ros with pure o2 where long lived species such as ozone can be generated have been associated to a higher degree of sterilization zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 various studies have shown however that air where both ros and rns are formed can achieve comparative results to those using with pure gases achieving 100 inactivation of bacteria cubas et al 2019 du et al 2012 the use of air is advantageous since it is abundant and a cheap source for plasma generation and is hence a cost effective gas for plasma based water disinfection system as the main components of air are oxygen and nitrogen a combination of ros and rns are formed in plasmas short lived species no oh and superoxide and long lived species nitrates nitrites ammonium induce an anti microbial effect but the full mechanism of the direct oxidative effect induced by each species individually or the synergy of these chemicals combined with the effects of energetic uv radiation and intense electric fields has yet to be understood zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 in the liquid or gas phase ros and rns can induce depolarization as they enter the bacterial cell which leads to membrane permeation and adsorption of short and long lived oxidative species lunov et al 2017 accumulation in the bacterial cell results in oxidative stress and nitration of cell components as a result different types of protein essential for cell functions are damaged and in response signalling pathways get activated which can lead to dna damage cell cycle arrest and triggering of cell death pathways several long living species such as o3 and h2o2 can induce post plasma reactions through the generation of subsequent oh products via dissociation liao et al 2017 lópez et al 2019 3 3 plasma treatment of mixed culture samples a mixture of both e coli and p aeruginosa was used to investigate the efficiency of the microfluidic plasma reactor in treating mixed microbial bacterial cultures reduction in viable bacteria with increasing residence time was observed in the mixed culture sample of e coli and p aeruginosa with initial total concentrations of 7 40 105 cfu ml and 5 40 105 cfu ml respectively no colonies of either bacteria were observed after a residence time of 5 s in the devices with the plasma activated fig 3 the results of plasma treated mixed culture samples showed no statistical difference ρ 0 05 between the amount of surviving e coli and p aeruginosa however compared to the results with monoculture e coli from the previous section several colonies of e coli were observed on agar plates with samples treated to less than 4 s of residence time but all were eliminated after 5 s residence time several papers described inactivation of bacteria after plasma treatment yet few had further examined possible regrowth of colonies after more than 24 h incubation yingguang et al 2011 sanaei and ayan 2015 ercan et al 2018 after 72 h of incubation emerging colonies of e coli and p aeruginosa were observed from samples treated to less than 4 s of residence time in plasma but colony counts of less than 500 cfu ml were recorded no new colonies were detected with residence times of more than 4 s this could be due to the increasing number of bacteria killed with increasing residence time until eventually all bacteria were deactivated the regrowth of small colonies from samples treated with shorter residence times may be indicative of small colony variant scv bacteria or viable but nonculturable vbnc bacteria scv bacteria refers an aberrant form of bacteria generated in response to environmental stress characterized with a slow growth rate reduced metabolic activity and increased resistance to antibiotics which are able to recover over time when provided with essential factors such as nutrients proctor et al 2006 similar to scv bacteria vbnc bacteria which refers to live bacteria in a state of low metabolic activity and cannot be cultured remain a concern for potential risks upon exposure shorter residence times in plasma may not be sufficient to induce the same capacity of oxidative stress compared to higher residence time to effectively kill the bacteria but could potentially reduce their metabolic activity the ability of scv and vbnc bacteria to be resuscitated in favourable conditions such as nutrient availability and temperature increases the risk of colonisation and health problems proctor et al 2006 kriegeskorte et al 2014 ramamurthy et al 2014 3 4 visualisation of bacteria using scanning electron microscopy sem sem analysis was used to visualise the effect of non thermal plasma treatment on the bacteria images of untreated e coli and p aeruginosa confirmed the presence of viable cells with the cell membrane appearing smooth and intact fig 4 a d after plasma treatment both bacterial species showed distinct signs of damage such as cell membranes with a damaged integrity white arrows in fig 4b irregular shape and size white arrows in fig 4c f and dimples on the membrane surface white arrows in fig 4e the appearance of distinct damage on cells after plasma treatment has been previously reported for e coli and p aeruginosa plasma treatment compromises cellular viability that results in rupture of the cell membrane leakage of contents and exposure of genetic material to the surrounding environment affecting metabolic functions and ability to replicate and grow leading to death of the bacteria ziuzina et al 2015 sun et al 2018 the morphology change observed was associated with the electrostatic disruption of the cell membrane by non thermal plasma specifically electrostatic stress caused by charge collection on the outer membrane exceeding the tensile strength of the cell membrane mendis et al 2000 irregular shape and elongation of cell shape were associated with bacterial stress response and prolonged inhibition of division which can lead to cell lysis and death mojsoska et al 2017 jia et al 2019 sem results for shorter residence times showed a mixture of bacteria with intact membranes damaged membranes and subtle morphology changes in line with previous plate assay data regrowth of small colonies observed could be due to treated bacteria with intact membranes that had been damaged by the plasma treatment process but not killed fig 4b e studies have shown that membrane damage does not guarantee cell death and cells can retain their viability in a vbnc or scv state yost and joshi 2015 mojsoska et al 2017 wei and zhao 2018 ye et al 2020 sem images of the bacteria treated for higher residence times showed a mixture of damaged membranes and subtle morphological changes fig 4c f compared to shorter residence times longer residence times showed the absence of bacteria with intact membranes which could be due to more prolonged interaction between the bacteria and reactive species formed in plasma and hence the number of bacteria killed in relation to the antimicrobial activity of non thermal plasma subtle morphology changes such as variation in shapes elongation and dimpling observed after plasma treatment were associated with the progressive damage of the cell architecture that leads to ruptured walls and the release of cellular contents joshi et al 2011 dobrynin et al 2011 yost and joshi 2015 3 5 cell viability a live dead assay was conducted on cells treated with non thermal plasma since sem was limited in determining viability of treated cells plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa were double stained with dna intercalating dyes syto9 propidium iodide pi and observed using an epifluorescence microscope viable control e coli and p aeruginosa showed green fluorescence fig 5 a d while non viable plasma treated e coli and p aeruginosa showed red fluorescence fig 5b c e f results showed that plasma affected the permeability of the cell membrane with pi emitting red fluorescence upon binding to the dna the results correlated with the sem results which showed distinct damage of the membrane caused by non thermal plasma treatment such as damage to the membrane dimples or holes which allowed the dna intercalating pi dye to enter the bacteria these morphological changes were related to the decreased viability of bacteria observed after plasma treatment for shorter and higher residence times using the plate assay compared to longer residence time shorter residence time of the bacteria with plasma treatment may not always lead to complete cell death and could potentially induce bacteria into a vbnc or scv state results showed a small fraction of 1 of green fluorescence detected which indicated live cells fig 5b e in samples obtained using shorter residence times this may correspond to some of the bacteria observed to have intact membranes in the sem images which may be in a vbnc or scv state fig 4b e however pi stains nucleic acids in bacteria with damaged membranes but even with damaged membranes some cells are able to maintain their viability sem observation of cell membrane damage is not conclusive evidence of cell death since similar subtle morphological changes were observed for both shorter and longer residence times no green fluorescence was detected in samples treated with higher residence times and after 72 h incubation fig 5c f this correlated with the plate assay where no regrowth of colonies was observed in samples treated with higher residence times and after 72 h incubation the overall effect of non thermal plasma was to progressively induce substantial damage in the cell structure which was residence time dependant a significant decrease in growth viability and culturability was observed with higher residence times compared to shorter residence times 4 conclusion antimicrobial efficacy of a microfluidic plasma reactor was investigated this microfluidic plasma reactor was able to achieve bacterial inactivation following just seconds of treatment both e coli and p aeruginosa showed the same trend with decreasing bacterial viability as residence time in plasma increased using air as the carrier gas effective disinfection of water was achieved full inactivation of both bacteria 108 cfu ml maximum number of each bacteria treated as monoculture and mixed culture was achieved after 5 s of residence time in the plasma region of the microfluidic plasma reactor mixed bacterial culture samples may induce some protection to plasma compared to the monoculture samples compared to e coli p aeruginosa was less susceptible to the plasma treatment the ability of plasma to penetrate the bacteria was confirmed with sem and live dead assays and post treatment culturing up to 72 h sem analysis revealed changes in cell morphology with ruptured cell membranes while live dead assays and

16858,manganese contamination is ubiquitous in ground water water eutrophication also exaggerates manganese release and contamination in surface water however conventional manganese ii removal process through sand filter is low efficiency and long term ripening manganese exceeding standard is still a bottleneck issue for drinking water plants to provide a quick setup and low cost means we invented an accelerated catalytic oxidation filtration process through porous zeolite filter with dynamically coating of manganese oxide nanocatalysts in dynamic filtration process the addition of chlorine less than redox stoichiometric consumption can efficiently remove dissolved manganese ii from contaminated tap water ground water and songhua river water characterization results showed that a continuous manganese iii iv oxide nanosheet catalyst was dynamically in situ growing and assembled into 3d porous superstructure in the reactive zeolite mnox s filter active mn iii species on the edges of mnox s nanosheets were dynamically generated and transferred into stable mn iv species on the layer structured surface the cycling transformation of manganese iii iv species was responsible for the accelerated catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii by chlorine without process changes in drinking water plant the porous zeolite mnox s media could be feasibly integrated onto the existing sand filtration tanks for emergence handling of manganese ii contamination this novel reactive zeolite mnox s filter with higher hydraulic conductivity provides a high efficiency scalable and low cost technique for the manganese ii removal from various of water environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese ii removal chlorine catalytic oxidation zeolite mnox s filter 3d superstructure assembly 1 introduction dissolved mn2 is significantly concerned for drinking water due to its ubiquitous existence in contaminated ground water and surface water ying et al 2017 manganese release by eutrophication is frequently occurred in surface water groundwater recharge by contaminated water exaggerates the complexity of manganese contamination which deteriorates the esthetic quality of drinking water furthermore the abundant manganese intake is harmful to cognitive performance of human body mora et al 2018 rahman et al 2017 the mn2 standard in drinking water has been down regulated to 0 1 mg l in china even 0 01 0 02 mg l to avoid the issue of black water jones and knocke 2017 sain and dietrich 2014 sain et al 2014 however conventional separation techniques such as adsorption ion exchange and biofiltration are not efficient to convert dissolved mn2 into particulate manganese counterparts the residual mn2 usually enters water distribution system through pathways of biological or chemical deposition cerrato et al 2010 li et al 2019 li et al 2020 murdoch and smith 1999 the issue of manganese exceeding the standard is still a great challenge for drinking water plant oxidative removal of mn2 by sand filtration is a popularly adopted technique in drinking water plants bruins et al 2015 burger et al 2008 jones and knocke 2017 pacini et al 2005 vries et al 2017 conventionally dissolved oxygen in water is used to gradually oxidize mn2 in sand filter due to the formation of an active coating of manganese oxides on media surface in a long term filtration farnsworth et al 2012 unfortunately this ripening period usually lasts several months for the generation of mnox s coated sand filter water treatment plants preferably apply the free chlorine residual across filtration tank for mn2 removal knocke et al 1988 knocke et al 1991 in this process mn2 could only be slowly oxidized by free chlorine under the near neutral condition eq 1 chlorine catalytic oxidation was found to shorten the ripening period eq 2 due to the autocatalytic behavior on the surface of as formed mno2 coating allard et al 2013 conventional sand filter media such as quartz and manganese sands are all easily coated with an active layer of manganese oxides by chlorine oxidation lyu et al 2019 pourahmad et al 2019 however they are commonly lower hydraulic conductivity and long term ripening in the microscopic view the additional water channel of porous materials is beneficial for hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2021 backwashing is necessary for removing the clogged particles of manganese oxides up to now the autocatalytic mechanism has not been clearly explored 1 m n 2 aq hclo h 2 o slow mn o 2 s c l 3 h 2 mn o 2 m n 2 surf hclo h 2 o autocatalyzed 2 mn o 2 s c l 3 h co existed metal ions affect the removal efficiency of mn2 by chlorine oxidation process elzinga 2011 2016 in drinking water plants the aluminum species from coagulant residuals were co deposited into the mnox s coating of filter media surface during chlorine oxidation capture of mn2 jones and knocke 2017 as a result the composition of mnox s coating was changed similar phenomenon caused by coagulant residuals was also observed in membrane filtration process wang et al 2020b in addition cu2 ion was reported to accelerate the oxidation rate of mn2 by free chlorine li et al 2020 it was attributed to the adsorption of cu2 ion onto the surface of as formed mnox particles and changed their oxidative reactivity in naturally aqueous environments mn2 also changed the symmetrical morphologies of layer structured birnessite through adsorption and redox reactions zhao et al 2016 as a result mn iii species were formed through the comproportionation reaction between adsorbed mn ii and surrounding mn iv species the as formed mn iii species were subsequently migrated into the vacant sites of layer structured surface and changed the ordered distribution of birnessite nanosheets mn2 and interlayer cations played significant roles in the morphology transformation of birnessite under solar irradiation process zhang et al 2018 the changes of surface energy by metal ion adsorption controlled the thermodynamic stability of layer structured manganese oxides yang et al 2019 it is believed that the adsorption behavior of co existed metal ions including mn2 would significantly modulate the microstructure and oxidative reactivity of manganese oxides recently the reactivity of manganese species on the edges and vacancies of manganese oxide nanostructures has been demonstrated for the layer structured manganese oxides co2 ions were preferably adsorbed and oxidized on the edge sites during the fast kinetic adsorption period wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 after that the co species were continuously accumulated on the vacant sites of layer structured manganese oxides during the longer reaction time in addition the out of plane mn centers on the asymmetric edge sites of manganese phosphate nanosheet were considered as the catalytic oxidation sites for water splitting through the formation of active intermediates liu et al 2019 on the other hand the adsorption and deposition behaviors of dissolved manganese also modulated the morphology structures of mineral surfaces it was attributed to the formation of coordination chemical bonds with different length and orientation in naturally aqueous environments jun et al 2005 consequently the heteroepitaxial nanostructures of manganese oxides were gradually grown onto the mineral surfaces inspired by the characteristics of defect sites we attempt to construct a layer structured catalyst of manganese oxide nanosheets onto media surface of sand filter due to the preferential and accessible edge sites it is prospectively used as a reactive coating of sand filter for the sustainable removal of dissolved manganese ii by continuously catalytic chlorine oxidation natural zeolite mineral possesses the characteristics of mass production low cost high porosity and ion exchange effect which is popularly adopted as filter medial in water treatment in this work in situ coating of manganese oxides onto the porous media surface of zeolite sand was conducted aiming to fabricate zeolite mnox s filter for dissolved manganese ii removal due to cation exchange effect manganese ions were first adsorbed into the porous structure of zeolite media and then mnox s nanoparticles were in situ coated by the reaction between permanganate and manganese sulfate during the chlorine catalytic oxidation process the role of in situ growing manganese oxides in zeolite mnox s filter on manganese removal was investigated key factors were optimized for the regeneration and stability of zeolite mnox s filter the engineering feasibility was also confirmed by the long term filtration of songhua river water and ground water the present study attempts to develop a novel scalable sand filter for the oxidative removal of dissolved manganese ii by chlorine 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals zeolite quartz and manganese sands were provided by our lab the particle sizes were controlled in 0 8 mm 1 2 mm by sieving mnso4 h2o kmno4 and naclo were purchased from the aladdin china ki and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent corporation china all of reagents used in our experiments were analytic grade ultrapure water r 18 2 mω cm was used for the cleaning and modification of filter media 2 2 as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter by in situ coating method the in situ coating experiment was conducted at room temperature certain amount of zeolite media was added into the mnso4 aqueous solution 0 3 m for the saturation of mn2 adsorption the suspension of zeolite media was continuously oscillated at 100 rpm for 6 h orbital shaker ts 100 kylin bell after washing off the surplus mn2 the zeolite media was added into the mixed solution of kmno4 0 2 m and naoh 0 4 m and then oscillated for 12 h when the color of zeolite media surface was changed into dark brown the zeolite mnox s media was obtained by ultrapure water washing the corresponding filter with these media was designated as the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter conventional sand filters were designated as the quartz sand filter manganese sand filter and zeolite filter respectively 2 3 water samples water samples used in the experiments included the simulated surface water river water and ground water the simulated water was composed of dechlorinated tap water and 1 mg l of mnso4 h2o the songhua river water northeast in china was spiked with 1 mg l of mnso4 h2o the mn2 concentration in the real ground water northeast in china was 0 4 mg l water quality in these water samples was listed in table s1 2 4 bench scale operation of zeolite mnox s filters bench scale setup of zeolite mnox s filter was shown in fig s1 naclo was used to prepare the stock solution of free chlorine with different concentration generally the feed water and naclo solution was pumped into the static mixer for 2 min and then the influent was gravity driven into the zeolite mnox s filter with the flow rate at 4 ml min through changing the influent flowrate the empty bed contact time ebct of zeolite mnox s filter could be adjusted to 7 9 min 11 8 min and 23 6 min respectively after long term operation the filter was designated as long term operated zeolite mnox s filter i e 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter as the controls quartz sand filter and manganese sand filter were also conducted in the system for the dynamic adsorption filtration naclo solution in feed water was inhibited to evaluate the adsorption capacity of mn2 for different filters to investigate filter stability the measure of high strength backwashing was taken in the bench scale filter system backwashing time was 5 min and the backwashing strength was controlled at 14 8 l m2 s through the opposite operation of peristaltic pump system mn2 concentration in backwashing solution was measured to evaluate the filter stability 2 5 characterization of zeolite mnox s filters manganese oxide content on the surface of filter media was measured by the method of hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl dissolution for example 0 5 g of filter media was added into 10 ml of nh2oh hcl 10 wt solution in the presence of hno3 the acidic suspension of filter media was continuously oscillated until the supernatant turned from dark brown to colorless and transparent it demonstrated that the mnox s coating on the surface of filter media was completely dissolved mnox s content was quantified by mn2 concentration in the dissolved solution the microstructures of zeolite and zeolite mnox s media were characterized by scanning electron spectroscopy sem su8010 hitachi the element compositions on media surface were calculated by the results of energy dispersive spectroscopy eds su8010 hitachi chemical structure and composition of zeolite and zeolite mnox s media were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps phi 5700 and x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker zeta potential of powdered filter media was measured by the dynamic light scattering analyzer dls nano zs90 marvin 2 6 water analytic methods the concentrations of iron manganese calcium and magnesium in water samples were measured through the inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkin elmer content of dissolved organic carbon was detected by a total organic carbon toc analyzer multin c 3100 jena fluorescent composition of organic components in water samples was analyzed by excitation emission matrix microscopy eem f7000 hitachi the effective chlorine and residual chlorine in water samples were measured by way of iodinetry and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic adsorption characteristics of zeolite mnox s filter in the absence of chlorine dynamic column filtrations of dissolved manganese ii in deionized water and dechlorinated tap water were conducted by the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter fig s2 considering the mn2 standard in china the breakthrough point was defined as the filtration time when the mn2 in filter effluent exceeded 0 1 mg l 10 of influent concentration in deionized water the breakthrough points for zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters were both 144 h much longer than those for conventional quartz and manganese sand filters in dechlorinated tap water the breakthrough points for zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters were greatly reduced more seriously the quartz and manganese sand filters were even completely penetrated in a short time dynamic adsorption results showed that zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters possessed much larger adsorption capacity of mn2 than those of conventional sand filters however these adsorption behaviors were obviously different and inhibited by the complicated background components in tap water which includes coexisted natural organic matters and other ions therefore the chlorine oxidation should be considered in the complexed water environments 3 2 chlorine catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii by zeolite mnox s filter fig 1 showed the mn2 removal from tap water by zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters in the presence of chlorine for the zeolite filter the developments of mn2 in effluent experienced three stages it firstly decreased to 0 14 mg l at the initial filtration due to the adsorption effect of zeolite porous structure when the adsorption capacity was saturated the mn2 in effluent increased up to the point of initial concentration after that the mn2 in effluent gradually decreased to 0 1 mg l until the end filtration it was attributed to the gradual formation and deposition of mnox s particles on the surface of zeolite filter in the presence of chlorine knocke et al 1988 knocke et al 1991 saito et al 2020 however for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter the mn2 in effluent was always below 0 1 mg l in the whole operation period compared to the conventional sand filters fig s2 the in situ formed mnox s coating played a significant role in the chlorine oxidation of mn2 during dynamical filtrations the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter possessed the characteristics of quick set up and high efficiency of mn2 removal 3 2 1 effects of chlorine dosage the effects of chorine dosage on mn2 removal by the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter were investigated in fig 2 a at the chlorine dosage of 0 87 and 1 3 mg l the mn2 in effluents were always kept below 0 1 mg l during the whole filtration period however the breakthrough point emerged at 48 h when the chlorine dosage was 0 43 mg l this breakthrough time was almost doubled than the counterpart without chlorine in fig s2 after that the mn2 in effluent was gradually increased to 0 55 mg l and stabilized at that level until the end of filtration this breakthrough behavior was the synergistic results of oxidation and adsorption saturation of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter dashtban kenari et al 2019 jones and knocke 2017 pourahmad et al 2019 although the chlorine dosage of 0 87 mg l was also less than the stoichiometric amount the mn2 in effluent was kept below the standard in china 0 1 mg l it indicates that the oxidation product of mn2 was not completely the form of mno2 which should be further characterized the chlorine dosage played an important role of modulating the balance between adsorption and catalytic oxidation of mn2 in addition residual chlorine in effluent was also investigated in fig 2 b the amount of which would affect the formation of disinfection by products jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 at the chlorine dosage of 0 43 mg l the residual chlorine in effluent was almost completely consumed it indicates that the 0 55 mg l of mn2 in effluent was attributed to the insufficient dosage of chlorine considering the residual chorine and mn2 in effluent the chlorine dosage of 1 3 mg l was obviously excessive for further insight into the role of chlorine dosage the minimized dosage of chlorine was experimentally measured and linearly simulated in fig 2 c as the chlorine dosage increased the oxidized amount of mn2 was gradually increased and plateaued at the 0 87 mg l of chlorine dosage after that the mn2 was completely oxidized meanwhile the residual chlorine was quickly increased from 0 07 mg l to 0 4 mg l oppositely the increasement of residual chlorine was very slow when the chlorine dosage was less than 0 87 mg l the two stage increasement of residual chlorine confirms that the 0 87 mg l of chlorine dosage was the experimentally minimized consumption for the oxidation of 1 mg l of mn2 through linear simulation the calculated consumption was 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter less than the stoichiometric counterpart derived from eq 1 1 3 mgcl2 mgmn2 it is demonstrated that the in situ formed mnox s coating possessed the catalytic capability of chlorine oxidation charbonnet et al 2018 furthermore the oxidized products should be various species of manganese oxides not limited to the state of mno2 particles 3 2 2 effects of ph doc fe2 and ca2 the change of ph value is an important factor in the oxidation process of mn2 as shown in fig 3 a the mn2 in effluents both maintained below 0 1 mg l under the neutral and alkaline conditions of tap water at the ph 6 the mn2 in effluent maintained below 0 1 mg l during the first 72 h filtration and then gradually increased to 0 58 mg l at the filtration of 240 h after the peak point the mn2 in effluent was decreased and stabilized at 0 39 mg l until the end of filtration the removal efficiency of mn2 was deteriorated at the acidic condition due to the weakened capability of chlorine catalytic oxidation knocke et al 1988 the adsorption rate of mn2 onto as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter was quicker than the catalytic oxidation rate in the presence of chlorine as a result the regeneration of in situ formed mnox s was not sufficient and the adsorption capacity of zeolite mnox s filter was gradually saturated at the filtration of 240 h when the balance between adsorption and catalytic oxidation was constructed the mn2 in effluent approached stable for zeolite mnox s filter organic components in the background of tap water not only affected the adsorption of mn2 but also consumed the chorine in filter influent effects of total organic carbon toc on the removal efficiency of mn2 were shown in fig 3 b when toc was 3 65 mg l in tap water the mn2 in effluent always maintained below 0 1 mg l during the whole operation period however the breakthrough point for zeolite mnox s filter was observed at the filtration of 12 h when toc was improved to 7 74 mg l by the addition of humic acids obviously the low content of toc in tap water could not reduce the removal efficiency of mn2 although the catalytic reactivity of in situ formed mnox s might be inhibited by the adsorption of organic contaminants allard et al 2013 johnson et al 2015 wang et al 2018 furthermore the characteristics of 3d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence of filter effluents were also investigated in fig s3 in the case of excessive chlorine 1 3 mg l the components of humic and fulvic acids in tap water were greatly removed while the removal efficiency was greatly inhibited for the 0 43 mg l of chlorine dosage the rate of mn2 oxidation is orders of magnitude more higher than that of nom oxidation in the presence of chlorine allard et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 the dosed chlorine was preferably selective to react with mn2 which is significantly beneficial for the control of disinfection by products fe2 mn2 and ca2 are commonly co existed in ground water and surface water however the fe2 in influent was easily oxidized into brown flocs of iron hydroxides before entering the filter it was attributed to the oxidation effects of dissolved oxygen 8 mg l in tap water under neutral condition not consuming the dosed chlorine farnsworth et al 2012 the as formed brown flocs of iron hydroxides were rejected by zeolite mnox s filter therefore the mn2 in effluent was still below 0 1 mg l in the presence of chlorine fig 3 c the ca2 could not reduce the mn2 removal efficiency fig 3 d due to the preferable adsorption sequence of mn2 onto manganese oxides lafferty et al 2011 the selective oxidation of mn2 in complicated water environment was critically important for the engineering application of zeolite mnox s filter 3 3 regeneration and stability of zeolite mnox s filter stability and regeneration feasibility of zeolite mnox s filter should be primarily considered during the engineering application charbonnet et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the dosing of chlorine was stopped after 10 days operation of catalytic oxidation filtration and the breakthrough points via adsorption effect of mn2 were investigated zeolite filter quickly approached the breakthrough point at the filtration of 2 h much longer for zeolite mnox s filter the breakthrough point was at the filtration of 72 h after 10 days operation zeolite mnox s filter still possessed more plenty of adsorption active sites than that of zeolite filter it indicates that the in situ grown mnox s in zeolite mnox s filter would be more active for mn2 adsorption finally mn2 completely penetrated through filters at the filtration of 72 h and 216 h for zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters respectively when the adsorption of mn2 was saturated the modulation of chlorine dosage was an excellent measure for the regeneration of zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters fig 4 b after 1 3 mg l of chlorine dosage the mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was quickly reduced to 0 137 mg l at the filtration of 4 h and then maintained below 0 043 mg l during the whole operation period however for zeolite filter the mn2 in effluent was still over the standard of 0 1 mg l and reduced to 0 083 mg l until the end filtration of 72 h these results demonstrate that the in situ grown mnox s in zeolite mnox s filter possess more highly catalytic oxidation capability than that of zeolite filter as we known backwashing operation is often periodically taken for sand filter in drinking water plant the stability of zeolite mnox s filter is also an important concern for engineering application the removal efficiency of mn2 after high strength backwashing was shown in fig 4 c although the mn2 in effluents were both bellow 0 1 mg l the zeolite mnox s filter still possessed higher removal efficiency than that of zeolite filter in the whole period of filtration in addition the mn2 in backwashing solution was also investigated to evaluate the released probability of mn2 from the saturated filters fig 4 d in the absence of chlorine mn2 was adsorbed onto the surface of as synthesized zeolite filter through surface complexation or cation exchange effects after backwashing the adsorbed mn2 was easily released into the backwashing solution 2 18 mg l however these release behaviors were greatly inhibited for the zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters in the presence of chlorine at ph 7 and ph 8 5 the absorbed mn2 was oxidized into solid state of mnox s particles which obviously reduced the concentrations of mn2 in backwashing water at ph 6 mn2 in backwashing water was still up to 0 318 mg l for zeolite mnox s filter it indicates that the catalytic oxidation rate of mn2 is slower than the adsorption rate at acidic condition which was consistent with the result of fig 3 a the stronger inhibition of mn2 release further confirmed the highly catalytic oxidation activity of in situ growing mnox s on the surface of zeolite mnox s filter 3 4 engineering feasibility of zeolite mnox s filter as we known the contact time is one of the most important parameters for filter process the contact time is the period during which the dissolved substances could be transferred from aqueous phase onto the media surface the empty bed contact time ebct is defined as the ratio between the filter volume and the influent flow rate in fact the breakthrough point and volume scale of filters depend on the ebct which could be optimized by adjusting the influent velocity and depth of filters fundneider et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 a mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was much lower than the standard of 0 1 mg l when the ebct was 11 8 min and 23 6 min however decreasing of ebct could deteriorate the removal efficiency of mn2 in the field of engineering application increasing the depth of filter media would be an alternative for the enhancement of mn2 removal farnsworth et al 2012 yang et al 2020 therefore the effective media depths of filters with different ebct would be the determinative factor for the mn2 removal in fig 5 b the effective media depth was 5 cm for the longest ebct of 23 6 min but the mn2 in effluent was approaching the standard of 0 1 mg l when the ebct was decreased to 11 8 min the effective media depth was 10 cm and the corresponding mn2 in effluent was 0 074 mg l further decreasing the ebct to 7 9 min the effective media depth didn t emerged in the whole column 30 cm it is concluded that the effective edia depth of 10 cm could be costly used to update the present filtration tank in drinking water plant for the upgrading of the existing sand filtration tanks in drinking water plants a feasible double layer filter composed of zeolite mnox s active layer 10 cm and quartz sand supporting layer 20 cm was designed in fig 5 c compared to quartz sand filter mn2 in the effluent of double layer filter was below 0 006 mg l during the whole operation period the meanwhile the drop in mn2 concentration emerged from around 75 h for quartz sand filter it was attributed to the saturated adsorption capacity fig s2 and slow rate of mn2 oxidation beyond our expectations the mn2 in effluent was even less than that of zeolite mnox s filter in fig 5 a it was contributed to the synergistic effects of catalytic oxidation of zeolite mnox s layer and released particle rejection of quartz sand supporting layer more importantly these two laminated layers of zeolite mnox s and quartz sand could not be disordered during the backwashing period this excellent lamination behavior is of great importance for the engineering application of large scale double layer filter dashtban kenari and barbeau 2017 knocke et al 1988 fig 6 presented the removal efficiency of mn2 in the backgrounds of songhua river water and ground water for the river water spiked with 1 mg l mnso4 the mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was below 0 038 mg l during the 7 days operation the catalytic chlorine oxidation exhibited excellent removal efficiency of mn2 from contaminated surface water table s2 listed the concentrations of various disinfection by products dbps in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter for the halogenated volatile substances hvs four kinds of dbps were detected for the haloacetic acids haa two kinds of dbps were detected however these dbps concentrations were all far lower than the corresponding standards of china it indirectly indicates that the chlorine oxidation of mn2 is easily catalyzed by the in situ growing mnox s in filter while the reaction between chlorine and dom is inhibited to reduce the dbps formation for the ground water mn2 was decreased from 0 4 mg l to 0 06 mg l although the fe2 coexisted in the ground water the removal efficiency of mn2 for ground water was worse than that for the songhua river water it was attributed to the complexed results of mn2 concentration co existed dom and fe2 etc bruins et al 2015 hoyland et al 2014 3 5 catalytic mechanism of in situ growing manganese oxide superstructure in zeolite mnox s filter 3 5 1 role of manganese oxide superstructure assembly scanning electron microscopy sem images of zeolite as synthesized zeolite mnox s and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filters were shown in fig 7 a zeolite filter was composed of many compacted zeolite particles with porous structures which facilitated the highly hydraulic conductivity of mn2 containing water after adsorption and oxidation of mnso4 by kmno4 the continuous flower like structures of manganese oxides on zeolite surface were obtained for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter which was beneficial from the porous and ion exchange effects the in situ formed manganese oxide coating represented the interconnected networks in which the secondary pore structures were constructed in the filter during chlorine catalytic oxidation process the interconnected networks of manganese oxide coating on zeolite surface were gradually developed into a 3d manganese oxide superstructure assembly in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter it was probably attributed to the diffusion dependent reactivity of layer structured mnox s media coating the dissolved mn2 slowly accessed to the vacancy sites of mnox s nanosheets in the superstructure assembly wang et al 2018 obviously this lamellar assembly possessed many edge sites of manganese oxides indicative of out of plane mn centers these defective mn centers are highly reactive sites for electrocatalytic water splitting liu et al 2019 as a result the surface element composition of zeolite filter was also changed with the in situ growing 3d manganese oxide superstructure assembly fig 7 b compared to zeolite filter the mn content on as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter increased to 13 36 beyond the total amount of si and al elements this result supports the room temperature coating mechanism of cation exchange adsorption and in situ oxidation by kmno4 for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter the contents of mn and o element further increased to 21 67 and 73 92 respectively combining with the sem results it is believed that the newly in situ growing manganese oxides were dominantly located on the nanosheet edges of 3d superstructure assembly it was the result of adsorption oxidation cycling in the catalytic chlorine oxidation process of sand filter in the nanoscale coordination environment particularly at edge sites the mn species were highly active for heterogeneously catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii charbonnet et al 2018 simanova and peña 2015 wang et al 2020a 3 5 2 role of manganese ii adsorption on chlorine catalytic oxidation adsorption is the predominant factor for the heterogeneously catalytic oxidation of mn2 by chlorine dynamic adsorption results in the absence of chlorine fig s2 showed that the breakthrough time of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter was twice orders of magnitude longer than that of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter it was attributed to the higher adsorption capacity of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter fig s4a the adsorption isotherm was excellently simulated by the langmuir model table s3 indicative of chemical adsorption characteristics on the other hand the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter possessed the higher adsorption rate than that of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter fig s4b compared to zeolite filter the adsorption rates of these two zeolite mnox s filter were abided by the pseudo second order kinetic model table s4 further demonstrating the domination of chemosorption through the good simulation of elovich model this quickest chemosorption behavior proved to be occurred on the heterogeneous interface of in situ growing mnox s coating of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter cheung et al 2001 zhang et al 2020 all of these results were dependent on the amount and morphologies of manganese oxides on filter surfaces through the method of nh3oh hcl dissolution the calculated amounts of manganese oxides on as synthesized zeolite mnox s and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filters were 4 89 and 12 54 mgmn gmedia respectively the 3d superstructure assembly of manganese oxide nanosheets also facilitated the mn2 adsorption 3 5 3 manganese iii as the active center of chlorine catalytic oxidation x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted to identify the changes of chemical states of manganese oxides before and after long term operation of filters in the presence of chlorine there was no signals of mn in zeolite filter obviously mn2p xps was split into the spin orbit doublet of mn2p1 2 at 652 83 ev and mn2p3 2 at 641 03 ev in the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter fig 8 a the spin orbit spiitting is 11 8 ev which was the mixed valance characteristics of manganese minerals su et al 2014 the left shifted peak position and larger peak area of binding energy indicate that there were different composition and chemical states of mn species in these two zeolite mnox s filters in fig 8 b and c the asymmetric photoelectron peak of mn2p3 2 was split into four core level multiplets these photoelectronic multiplets located at 640 37 ev for mno 641 46 ev for mn2o3 mn oh o mn3o4 642 63 ev and 644 08 ev for mno2 zhang et al 2020 compared to the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter these photoelectronic multiplets were left shifted and stronger intensified for 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter obviously the chemical states of mn species in the two filters included mn ii mn iii and mn iv the percentage ratio of which were changed from 1 1 36 0 98 to 1 2 07 1 similar mn species were also observed in the formation of birnessite at room temperature banerjee and nesbitt 1999 although the total mn amount continuously increased the increasement amplitudes of three mn species were different interestingly the content of mn iii species mn3o4 mn2o3 mn oh o was greatly increased from 40 7 to 50 8 after 25 days operation of the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter in the presence of chlorine it supports the evidence that only the active mn species capable of catalyzing chlorine oxidation were dominantly growing in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter this phenomenon implies that the mn iv core species mno2 are in plane sheet and stable in the catalytic activation of chlorine du et al 2020 importantly the catalytic oxidation products of mn2 in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter were not only mno2 but the mixed valence products which was in accordance with the less consumption of chlorine 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 in fig 2 it is believed that the mn iii species were formed through the comproportionation reaction between the mn2 adsorbed on edge sites and the in situ formed mnox s with layer structures furthermore the photoelectron peak intensity and position of o1s xps were also different for the three filters fig 8 d in terms of the binding energy at 525 535 ev these o species were assigned to the oxide species o2 banerjee and nesbitt 1999 it was the result of incorporation of oxygen anion o2 into the structure of manganese oxides mn o mn the signals of subordinate hydroxide oh and attached water were not detected which indirectly supported the formation of mnox s in zeolite filters compared to the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter the photoelectron peaks of o1s for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter shifted to the higher position and stronger intensity of binding energy this shifting behavior of binding energy indicates that there were different chemical states of o species in manganese oxides in fig 8 e and f the intensity of o species sio2 sio2 al2o3 was greatly inhibited after the in situ coating of manganese oxides in zeolite filter meanwhile the contents of o species of mnox s increased for the two zeolite mnox s filters the o species in the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter included the mn2o3 mn oh o at 528 91 ev mn3o4 mno at 529 47 ev and mno2 530 64 ev however only the o species of mn3o4 mno and mno2 were obtained for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter furthermore the increasement of mn3o4 mno species at 529 30 ev was the strongest the mno component was not increased for the mn species in fig 8 b and c in addition the crystalline structure of calcium based clinoptilolite was beneficial for the mn2 exchange and in situ formation of mnox s coating on zeolite surface by kmno4 oxidation at room temperature xrd fig s5 as expected no signals of manganese crystalline were observed without the hydrothermal or calcination treatment these amorphous manganese oxides had more concentration of reactive sites for the chlorine catalytic oxidation of mn2 charbonnet et al 2018 van genuchten and peña 2017 similar with metallic glasses the amorphous mnox s possessed the random atomic packing structure and metastable nature liang et al 2018 these extensively reduced crystalline boundaries weakened electron trapping and promote inner electron transportation during dynamic filtration the oriented growth of mnox s in the nanosheets led to the refreshment of surface active sites it demonstrated that the effective catalytic component was the amorphous mn iii species mn3o4 during the process of mn2 removal by zeolite mnox s filter in the presence of chlorine 4 conclusions a novel porous zeolite mnox s filter with high water conductivity was successfully synthesized by the in situ redox coating method compared to the conventional quartz and manganese sand filter the as synthesized zeolite mnox s possessed larger adsorption capacity of mn2 in the dynamic filtration process the recycling balance of mn2 adsorption and mnox s generation in the filter is important for mn2 removal in the presence of chlorine the minimized consumption was 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter saturated zeolite mnox s filters could be quickly regenerated by the modulation of chlorine dosage meanwhile these filters maintained stable under the high strength backwashing and the released mn2 in this period was controllable the zeolite mnox s media layer with 10 cm thickness was convenient to upgrade the present sand filtration tank by the easy method of deposition the in situ growing 3d superstructure nanosheet assembly played the dominated roles in the mn2 removal during long term operation of as synthesized zeolite mnox s the active mn iii species mn3o4 on the edge sites of nanosheet assembly

16858,manganese contamination is ubiquitous in ground water water eutrophication also exaggerates manganese release and contamination in surface water however conventional manganese ii removal process through sand filter is low efficiency and long term ripening manganese exceeding standard is still a bottleneck issue for drinking water plants to provide a quick setup and low cost means we invented an accelerated catalytic oxidation filtration process through porous zeolite filter with dynamically coating of manganese oxide nanocatalysts in dynamic filtration process the addition of chlorine less than redox stoichiometric consumption can efficiently remove dissolved manganese ii from contaminated tap water ground water and songhua river water characterization results showed that a continuous manganese iii iv oxide nanosheet catalyst was dynamically in situ growing and assembled into 3d porous superstructure in the reactive zeolite mnox s filter active mn iii species on the edges of mnox s nanosheets were dynamically generated and transferred into stable mn iv species on the layer structured surface the cycling transformation of manganese iii iv species was responsible for the accelerated catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii by chlorine without process changes in drinking water plant the porous zeolite mnox s media could be feasibly integrated onto the existing sand filtration tanks for emergence handling of manganese ii contamination this novel reactive zeolite mnox s filter with higher hydraulic conductivity provides a high efficiency scalable and low cost technique for the manganese ii removal from various of water environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese ii removal chlorine catalytic oxidation zeolite mnox s filter 3d superstructure assembly 1 introduction dissolved mn2 is significantly concerned for drinking water due to its ubiquitous existence in contaminated ground water and surface water ying et al 2017 manganese release by eutrophication is frequently occurred in surface water groundwater recharge by contaminated water exaggerates the complexity of manganese contamination which deteriorates the esthetic quality of drinking water furthermore the abundant manganese intake is harmful to cognitive performance of human body mora et al 2018 rahman et al 2017 the mn2 standard in drinking water has been down regulated to 0 1 mg l in china even 0 01 0 02 mg l to avoid the issue of black water jones and knocke 2017 sain and dietrich 2014 sain et al 2014 however conventional separation techniques such as adsorption ion exchange and biofiltration are not efficient to convert dissolved mn2 into particulate manganese counterparts the residual mn2 usually enters water distribution system through pathways of biological or chemical deposition cerrato et al 2010 li et al 2019 li et al 2020 murdoch and smith 1999 the issue of manganese exceeding the standard is still a great challenge for drinking water plant oxidative removal of mn2 by sand filtration is a popularly adopted technique in drinking water plants bruins et al 2015 burger et al 2008 jones and knocke 2017 pacini et al 2005 vries et al 2017 conventionally dissolved oxygen in water is used to gradually oxidize mn2 in sand filter due to the formation of an active coating of manganese oxides on media surface in a long term filtration farnsworth et al 2012 unfortunately this ripening period usually lasts several months for the generation of mnox s coated sand filter water treatment plants preferably apply the free chlorine residual across filtration tank for mn2 removal knocke et al 1988 knocke et al 1991 in this process mn2 could only be slowly oxidized by free chlorine under the near neutral condition eq 1 chlorine catalytic oxidation was found to shorten the ripening period eq 2 due to the autocatalytic behavior on the surface of as formed mno2 coating allard et al 2013 conventional sand filter media such as quartz and manganese sands are all easily coated with an active layer of manganese oxides by chlorine oxidation lyu et al 2019 pourahmad et al 2019 however they are commonly lower hydraulic conductivity and long term ripening in the microscopic view the additional water channel of porous materials is beneficial for hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2021 backwashing is necessary for removing the clogged particles of manganese oxides up to now the autocatalytic mechanism has not been clearly explored 1 m n 2 aq hclo h 2 o slow mn o 2 s c l 3 h 2 mn o 2 m n 2 surf hclo h 2 o autocatalyzed 2 mn o 2 s c l 3 h co existed metal ions affect the removal efficiency of mn2 by chlorine oxidation process elzinga 2011 2016 in drinking water plants the aluminum species from coagulant residuals were co deposited into the mnox s coating of filter media surface during chlorine oxidation capture of mn2 jones and knocke 2017 as a result the composition of mnox s coating was changed similar phenomenon caused by coagulant residuals was also observed in membrane filtration process wang et al 2020b in addition cu2 ion was reported to accelerate the oxidation rate of mn2 by free chlorine li et al 2020 it was attributed to the adsorption of cu2 ion onto the surface of as formed mnox particles and changed their oxidative reactivity in naturally aqueous environments mn2 also changed the symmetrical morphologies of layer structured birnessite through adsorption and redox reactions zhao et al 2016 as a result mn iii species were formed through the comproportionation reaction between adsorbed mn ii and surrounding mn iv species the as formed mn iii species were subsequently migrated into the vacant sites of layer structured surface and changed the ordered distribution of birnessite nanosheets mn2 and interlayer cations played significant roles in the morphology transformation of birnessite under solar irradiation process zhang et al 2018 the changes of surface energy by metal ion adsorption controlled the thermodynamic stability of layer structured manganese oxides yang et al 2019 it is believed that the adsorption behavior of co existed metal ions including mn2 would significantly modulate the microstructure and oxidative reactivity of manganese oxides recently the reactivity of manganese species on the edges and vacancies of manganese oxide nanostructures has been demonstrated for the layer structured manganese oxides co2 ions were preferably adsorbed and oxidized on the edge sites during the fast kinetic adsorption period wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 after that the co species were continuously accumulated on the vacant sites of layer structured manganese oxides during the longer reaction time in addition the out of plane mn centers on the asymmetric edge sites of manganese phosphate nanosheet were considered as the catalytic oxidation sites for water splitting through the formation of active intermediates liu et al 2019 on the other hand the adsorption and deposition behaviors of dissolved manganese also modulated the morphology structures of mineral surfaces it was attributed to the formation of coordination chemical bonds with different length and orientation in naturally aqueous environments jun et al 2005 consequently the heteroepitaxial nanostructures of manganese oxides were gradually grown onto the mineral surfaces inspired by the characteristics of defect sites we attempt to construct a layer structured catalyst of manganese oxide nanosheets onto media surface of sand filter due to the preferential and accessible edge sites it is prospectively used as a reactive coating of sand filter for the sustainable removal of dissolved manganese ii by continuously catalytic chlorine oxidation natural zeolite mineral possesses the characteristics of mass production low cost high porosity and ion exchange effect which is popularly adopted as filter medial in water treatment in this work in situ coating of manganese oxides onto the porous media surface of zeolite sand was conducted aiming to fabricate zeolite mnox s filter for dissolved manganese ii removal due to cation exchange effect manganese ions were first adsorbed into the porous structure of zeolite media and then mnox s nanoparticles were in situ coated by the reaction between permanganate and manganese sulfate during the chlorine catalytic oxidation process the role of in situ growing manganese oxides in zeolite mnox s filter on manganese removal was investigated key factors were optimized for the regeneration and stability of zeolite mnox s filter the engineering feasibility was also confirmed by the long term filtration of songhua river water and ground water the present study attempts to develop a novel scalable sand filter for the oxidative removal of dissolved manganese ii by chlorine 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals zeolite quartz and manganese sands were provided by our lab the particle sizes were controlled in 0 8 mm 1 2 mm by sieving mnso4 h2o kmno4 and naclo were purchased from the aladdin china ki and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent corporation china all of reagents used in our experiments were analytic grade ultrapure water r 18 2 mω cm was used for the cleaning and modification of filter media 2 2 as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter by in situ coating method the in situ coating experiment was conducted at room temperature certain amount of zeolite media was added into the mnso4 aqueous solution 0 3 m for the saturation of mn2 adsorption the suspension of zeolite media was continuously oscillated at 100 rpm for 6 h orbital shaker ts 100 kylin bell after washing off the surplus mn2 the zeolite media was added into the mixed solution of kmno4 0 2 m and naoh 0 4 m and then oscillated for 12 h when the color of zeolite media surface was changed into dark brown the zeolite mnox s media was obtained by ultrapure water washing the corresponding filter with these media was designated as the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter conventional sand filters were designated as the quartz sand filter manganese sand filter and zeolite filter respectively 2 3 water samples water samples used in the experiments included the simulated surface water river water and ground water the simulated water was composed of dechlorinated tap water and 1 mg l of mnso4 h2o the songhua river water northeast in china was spiked with 1 mg l of mnso4 h2o the mn2 concentration in the real ground water northeast in china was 0 4 mg l water quality in these water samples was listed in table s1 2 4 bench scale operation of zeolite mnox s filters bench scale setup of zeolite mnox s filter was shown in fig s1 naclo was used to prepare the stock solution of free chlorine with different concentration generally the feed water and naclo solution was pumped into the static mixer for 2 min and then the influent was gravity driven into the zeolite mnox s filter with the flow rate at 4 ml min through changing the influent flowrate the empty bed contact time ebct of zeolite mnox s filter could be adjusted to 7 9 min 11 8 min and 23 6 min respectively after long term operation the filter was designated as long term operated zeolite mnox s filter i e 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter as the controls quartz sand filter and manganese sand filter were also conducted in the system for the dynamic adsorption filtration naclo solution in feed water was inhibited to evaluate the adsorption capacity of mn2 for different filters to investigate filter stability the measure of high strength backwashing was taken in the bench scale filter system backwashing time was 5 min and the backwashing strength was controlled at 14 8 l m2 s through the opposite operation of peristaltic pump system mn2 concentration in backwashing solution was measured to evaluate the filter stability 2 5 characterization of zeolite mnox s filters manganese oxide content on the surface of filter media was measured by the method of hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl dissolution for example 0 5 g of filter media was added into 10 ml of nh2oh hcl 10 wt solution in the presence of hno3 the acidic suspension of filter media was continuously oscillated until the supernatant turned from dark brown to colorless and transparent it demonstrated that the mnox s coating on the surface of filter media was completely dissolved mnox s content was quantified by mn2 concentration in the dissolved solution the microstructures of zeolite and zeolite mnox s media were characterized by scanning electron spectroscopy sem su8010 hitachi the element compositions on media surface were calculated by the results of energy dispersive spectroscopy eds su8010 hitachi chemical structure and composition of zeolite and zeolite mnox s media were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps phi 5700 and x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker zeta potential of powdered filter media was measured by the dynamic light scattering analyzer dls nano zs90 marvin 2 6 water analytic methods the concentrations of iron manganese calcium and magnesium in water samples were measured through the inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkin elmer content of dissolved organic carbon was detected by a total organic carbon toc analyzer multin c 3100 jena fluorescent composition of organic components in water samples was analyzed by excitation emission matrix microscopy eem f7000 hitachi the effective chlorine and residual chlorine in water samples were measured by way of iodinetry and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic adsorption characteristics of zeolite mnox s filter in the absence of chlorine dynamic column filtrations of dissolved manganese ii in deionized water and dechlorinated tap water were conducted by the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter fig s2 considering the mn2 standard in china the breakthrough point was defined as the filtration time when the mn2 in filter effluent exceeded 0 1 mg l 10 of influent concentration in deionized water the breakthrough points for zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters were both 144 h much longer than those for conventional quartz and manganese sand filters in dechlorinated tap water the breakthrough points for zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters were greatly reduced more seriously the quartz and manganese sand filters were even completely penetrated in a short time dynamic adsorption results showed that zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters possessed much larger adsorption capacity of mn2 than those of conventional sand filters however these adsorption behaviors were obviously different and inhibited by the complicated background components in tap water which includes coexisted natural organic matters and other ions therefore the chlorine oxidation should be considered in the complexed water environments 3 2 chlorine catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii by zeolite mnox s filter fig 1 showed the mn2 removal from tap water by zeolite and as synthesized zeolite mnox s filters in the presence of chlorine for the zeolite filter the developments of mn2 in effluent experienced three stages it firstly decreased to 0 14 mg l at the initial filtration due to the adsorption effect of zeolite porous structure when the adsorption capacity was saturated the mn2 in effluent increased up to the point of initial concentration after that the mn2 in effluent gradually decreased to 0 1 mg l until the end filtration it was attributed to the gradual formation and deposition of mnox s particles on the surface of zeolite filter in the presence of chlorine knocke et al 1988 knocke et al 1991 saito et al 2020 however for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter the mn2 in effluent was always below 0 1 mg l in the whole operation period compared to the conventional sand filters fig s2 the in situ formed mnox s coating played a significant role in the chlorine oxidation of mn2 during dynamical filtrations the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter possessed the characteristics of quick set up and high efficiency of mn2 removal 3 2 1 effects of chlorine dosage the effects of chorine dosage on mn2 removal by the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter were investigated in fig 2 a at the chlorine dosage of 0 87 and 1 3 mg l the mn2 in effluents were always kept below 0 1 mg l during the whole filtration period however the breakthrough point emerged at 48 h when the chlorine dosage was 0 43 mg l this breakthrough time was almost doubled than the counterpart without chlorine in fig s2 after that the mn2 in effluent was gradually increased to 0 55 mg l and stabilized at that level until the end of filtration this breakthrough behavior was the synergistic results of oxidation and adsorption saturation of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter dashtban kenari et al 2019 jones and knocke 2017 pourahmad et al 2019 although the chlorine dosage of 0 87 mg l was also less than the stoichiometric amount the mn2 in effluent was kept below the standard in china 0 1 mg l it indicates that the oxidation product of mn2 was not completely the form of mno2 which should be further characterized the chlorine dosage played an important role of modulating the balance between adsorption and catalytic oxidation of mn2 in addition residual chlorine in effluent was also investigated in fig 2 b the amount of which would affect the formation of disinfection by products jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 at the chlorine dosage of 0 43 mg l the residual chlorine in effluent was almost completely consumed it indicates that the 0 55 mg l of mn2 in effluent was attributed to the insufficient dosage of chlorine considering the residual chorine and mn2 in effluent the chlorine dosage of 1 3 mg l was obviously excessive for further insight into the role of chlorine dosage the minimized dosage of chlorine was experimentally measured and linearly simulated in fig 2 c as the chlorine dosage increased the oxidized amount of mn2 was gradually increased and plateaued at the 0 87 mg l of chlorine dosage after that the mn2 was completely oxidized meanwhile the residual chlorine was quickly increased from 0 07 mg l to 0 4 mg l oppositely the increasement of residual chlorine was very slow when the chlorine dosage was less than 0 87 mg l the two stage increasement of residual chlorine confirms that the 0 87 mg l of chlorine dosage was the experimentally minimized consumption for the oxidation of 1 mg l of mn2 through linear simulation the calculated consumption was 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter less than the stoichiometric counterpart derived from eq 1 1 3 mgcl2 mgmn2 it is demonstrated that the in situ formed mnox s coating possessed the catalytic capability of chlorine oxidation charbonnet et al 2018 furthermore the oxidized products should be various species of manganese oxides not limited to the state of mno2 particles 3 2 2 effects of ph doc fe2 and ca2 the change of ph value is an important factor in the oxidation process of mn2 as shown in fig 3 a the mn2 in effluents both maintained below 0 1 mg l under the neutral and alkaline conditions of tap water at the ph 6 the mn2 in effluent maintained below 0 1 mg l during the first 72 h filtration and then gradually increased to 0 58 mg l at the filtration of 240 h after the peak point the mn2 in effluent was decreased and stabilized at 0 39 mg l until the end of filtration the removal efficiency of mn2 was deteriorated at the acidic condition due to the weakened capability of chlorine catalytic oxidation knocke et al 1988 the adsorption rate of mn2 onto as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter was quicker than the catalytic oxidation rate in the presence of chlorine as a result the regeneration of in situ formed mnox s was not sufficient and the adsorption capacity of zeolite mnox s filter was gradually saturated at the filtration of 240 h when the balance between adsorption and catalytic oxidation was constructed the mn2 in effluent approached stable for zeolite mnox s filter organic components in the background of tap water not only affected the adsorption of mn2 but also consumed the chorine in filter influent effects of total organic carbon toc on the removal efficiency of mn2 were shown in fig 3 b when toc was 3 65 mg l in tap water the mn2 in effluent always maintained below 0 1 mg l during the whole operation period however the breakthrough point for zeolite mnox s filter was observed at the filtration of 12 h when toc was improved to 7 74 mg l by the addition of humic acids obviously the low content of toc in tap water could not reduce the removal efficiency of mn2 although the catalytic reactivity of in situ formed mnox s might be inhibited by the adsorption of organic contaminants allard et al 2013 johnson et al 2015 wang et al 2018 furthermore the characteristics of 3d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence of filter effluents were also investigated in fig s3 in the case of excessive chlorine 1 3 mg l the components of humic and fulvic acids in tap water were greatly removed while the removal efficiency was greatly inhibited for the 0 43 mg l of chlorine dosage the rate of mn2 oxidation is orders of magnitude more higher than that of nom oxidation in the presence of chlorine allard et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 the dosed chlorine was preferably selective to react with mn2 which is significantly beneficial for the control of disinfection by products fe2 mn2 and ca2 are commonly co existed in ground water and surface water however the fe2 in influent was easily oxidized into brown flocs of iron hydroxides before entering the filter it was attributed to the oxidation effects of dissolved oxygen 8 mg l in tap water under neutral condition not consuming the dosed chlorine farnsworth et al 2012 the as formed brown flocs of iron hydroxides were rejected by zeolite mnox s filter therefore the mn2 in effluent was still below 0 1 mg l in the presence of chlorine fig 3 c the ca2 could not reduce the mn2 removal efficiency fig 3 d due to the preferable adsorption sequence of mn2 onto manganese oxides lafferty et al 2011 the selective oxidation of mn2 in complicated water environment was critically important for the engineering application of zeolite mnox s filter 3 3 regeneration and stability of zeolite mnox s filter stability and regeneration feasibility of zeolite mnox s filter should be primarily considered during the engineering application charbonnet et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the dosing of chlorine was stopped after 10 days operation of catalytic oxidation filtration and the breakthrough points via adsorption effect of mn2 were investigated zeolite filter quickly approached the breakthrough point at the filtration of 2 h much longer for zeolite mnox s filter the breakthrough point was at the filtration of 72 h after 10 days operation zeolite mnox s filter still possessed more plenty of adsorption active sites than that of zeolite filter it indicates that the in situ grown mnox s in zeolite mnox s filter would be more active for mn2 adsorption finally mn2 completely penetrated through filters at the filtration of 72 h and 216 h for zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters respectively when the adsorption of mn2 was saturated the modulation of chlorine dosage was an excellent measure for the regeneration of zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters fig 4 b after 1 3 mg l of chlorine dosage the mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was quickly reduced to 0 137 mg l at the filtration of 4 h and then maintained below 0 043 mg l during the whole operation period however for zeolite filter the mn2 in effluent was still over the standard of 0 1 mg l and reduced to 0 083 mg l until the end filtration of 72 h these results demonstrate that the in situ grown mnox s in zeolite mnox s filter possess more highly catalytic oxidation capability than that of zeolite filter as we known backwashing operation is often periodically taken for sand filter in drinking water plant the stability of zeolite mnox s filter is also an important concern for engineering application the removal efficiency of mn2 after high strength backwashing was shown in fig 4 c although the mn2 in effluents were both bellow 0 1 mg l the zeolite mnox s filter still possessed higher removal efficiency than that of zeolite filter in the whole period of filtration in addition the mn2 in backwashing solution was also investigated to evaluate the released probability of mn2 from the saturated filters fig 4 d in the absence of chlorine mn2 was adsorbed onto the surface of as synthesized zeolite filter through surface complexation or cation exchange effects after backwashing the adsorbed mn2 was easily released into the backwashing solution 2 18 mg l however these release behaviors were greatly inhibited for the zeolite and zeolite mnox s filters in the presence of chlorine at ph 7 and ph 8 5 the absorbed mn2 was oxidized into solid state of mnox s particles which obviously reduced the concentrations of mn2 in backwashing water at ph 6 mn2 in backwashing water was still up to 0 318 mg l for zeolite mnox s filter it indicates that the catalytic oxidation rate of mn2 is slower than the adsorption rate at acidic condition which was consistent with the result of fig 3 a the stronger inhibition of mn2 release further confirmed the highly catalytic oxidation activity of in situ growing mnox s on the surface of zeolite mnox s filter 3 4 engineering feasibility of zeolite mnox s filter as we known the contact time is one of the most important parameters for filter process the contact time is the period during which the dissolved substances could be transferred from aqueous phase onto the media surface the empty bed contact time ebct is defined as the ratio between the filter volume and the influent flow rate in fact the breakthrough point and volume scale of filters depend on the ebct which could be optimized by adjusting the influent velocity and depth of filters fundneider et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 a mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was much lower than the standard of 0 1 mg l when the ebct was 11 8 min and 23 6 min however decreasing of ebct could deteriorate the removal efficiency of mn2 in the field of engineering application increasing the depth of filter media would be an alternative for the enhancement of mn2 removal farnsworth et al 2012 yang et al 2020 therefore the effective media depths of filters with different ebct would be the determinative factor for the mn2 removal in fig 5 b the effective media depth was 5 cm for the longest ebct of 23 6 min but the mn2 in effluent was approaching the standard of 0 1 mg l when the ebct was decreased to 11 8 min the effective media depth was 10 cm and the corresponding mn2 in effluent was 0 074 mg l further decreasing the ebct to 7 9 min the effective media depth didn t emerged in the whole column 30 cm it is concluded that the effective edia depth of 10 cm could be costly used to update the present filtration tank in drinking water plant for the upgrading of the existing sand filtration tanks in drinking water plants a feasible double layer filter composed of zeolite mnox s active layer 10 cm and quartz sand supporting layer 20 cm was designed in fig 5 c compared to quartz sand filter mn2 in the effluent of double layer filter was below 0 006 mg l during the whole operation period the meanwhile the drop in mn2 concentration emerged from around 75 h for quartz sand filter it was attributed to the saturated adsorption capacity fig s2 and slow rate of mn2 oxidation beyond our expectations the mn2 in effluent was even less than that of zeolite mnox s filter in fig 5 a it was contributed to the synergistic effects of catalytic oxidation of zeolite mnox s layer and released particle rejection of quartz sand supporting layer more importantly these two laminated layers of zeolite mnox s and quartz sand could not be disordered during the backwashing period this excellent lamination behavior is of great importance for the engineering application of large scale double layer filter dashtban kenari and barbeau 2017 knocke et al 1988 fig 6 presented the removal efficiency of mn2 in the backgrounds of songhua river water and ground water for the river water spiked with 1 mg l mnso4 the mn2 in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter was below 0 038 mg l during the 7 days operation the catalytic chlorine oxidation exhibited excellent removal efficiency of mn2 from contaminated surface water table s2 listed the concentrations of various disinfection by products dbps in the effluent of zeolite mnox s filter for the halogenated volatile substances hvs four kinds of dbps were detected for the haloacetic acids haa two kinds of dbps were detected however these dbps concentrations were all far lower than the corresponding standards of china it indirectly indicates that the chlorine oxidation of mn2 is easily catalyzed by the in situ growing mnox s in filter while the reaction between chlorine and dom is inhibited to reduce the dbps formation for the ground water mn2 was decreased from 0 4 mg l to 0 06 mg l although the fe2 coexisted in the ground water the removal efficiency of mn2 for ground water was worse than that for the songhua river water it was attributed to the complexed results of mn2 concentration co existed dom and fe2 etc bruins et al 2015 hoyland et al 2014 3 5 catalytic mechanism of in situ growing manganese oxide superstructure in zeolite mnox s filter 3 5 1 role of manganese oxide superstructure assembly scanning electron microscopy sem images of zeolite as synthesized zeolite mnox s and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filters were shown in fig 7 a zeolite filter was composed of many compacted zeolite particles with porous structures which facilitated the highly hydraulic conductivity of mn2 containing water after adsorption and oxidation of mnso4 by kmno4 the continuous flower like structures of manganese oxides on zeolite surface were obtained for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter which was beneficial from the porous and ion exchange effects the in situ formed manganese oxide coating represented the interconnected networks in which the secondary pore structures were constructed in the filter during chlorine catalytic oxidation process the interconnected networks of manganese oxide coating on zeolite surface were gradually developed into a 3d manganese oxide superstructure assembly in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter it was probably attributed to the diffusion dependent reactivity of layer structured mnox s media coating the dissolved mn2 slowly accessed to the vacancy sites of mnox s nanosheets in the superstructure assembly wang et al 2018 obviously this lamellar assembly possessed many edge sites of manganese oxides indicative of out of plane mn centers these defective mn centers are highly reactive sites for electrocatalytic water splitting liu et al 2019 as a result the surface element composition of zeolite filter was also changed with the in situ growing 3d manganese oxide superstructure assembly fig 7 b compared to zeolite filter the mn content on as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter increased to 13 36 beyond the total amount of si and al elements this result supports the room temperature coating mechanism of cation exchange adsorption and in situ oxidation by kmno4 for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter the contents of mn and o element further increased to 21 67 and 73 92 respectively combining with the sem results it is believed that the newly in situ growing manganese oxides were dominantly located on the nanosheet edges of 3d superstructure assembly it was the result of adsorption oxidation cycling in the catalytic chlorine oxidation process of sand filter in the nanoscale coordination environment particularly at edge sites the mn species were highly active for heterogeneously catalytic oxidation of dissolved manganese ii charbonnet et al 2018 simanova and peña 2015 wang et al 2020a 3 5 2 role of manganese ii adsorption on chlorine catalytic oxidation adsorption is the predominant factor for the heterogeneously catalytic oxidation of mn2 by chlorine dynamic adsorption results in the absence of chlorine fig s2 showed that the breakthrough time of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter was twice orders of magnitude longer than that of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter it was attributed to the higher adsorption capacity of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter fig s4a the adsorption isotherm was excellently simulated by the langmuir model table s3 indicative of chemical adsorption characteristics on the other hand the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter possessed the higher adsorption rate than that of as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter fig s4b compared to zeolite filter the adsorption rates of these two zeolite mnox s filter were abided by the pseudo second order kinetic model table s4 further demonstrating the domination of chemosorption through the good simulation of elovich model this quickest chemosorption behavior proved to be occurred on the heterogeneous interface of in situ growing mnox s coating of 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter cheung et al 2001 zhang et al 2020 all of these results were dependent on the amount and morphologies of manganese oxides on filter surfaces through the method of nh3oh hcl dissolution the calculated amounts of manganese oxides on as synthesized zeolite mnox s and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filters were 4 89 and 12 54 mgmn gmedia respectively the 3d superstructure assembly of manganese oxide nanosheets also facilitated the mn2 adsorption 3 5 3 manganese iii as the active center of chlorine catalytic oxidation x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted to identify the changes of chemical states of manganese oxides before and after long term operation of filters in the presence of chlorine there was no signals of mn in zeolite filter obviously mn2p xps was split into the spin orbit doublet of mn2p1 2 at 652 83 ev and mn2p3 2 at 641 03 ev in the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter and 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter fig 8 a the spin orbit spiitting is 11 8 ev which was the mixed valance characteristics of manganese minerals su et al 2014 the left shifted peak position and larger peak area of binding energy indicate that there were different composition and chemical states of mn species in these two zeolite mnox s filters in fig 8 b and c the asymmetric photoelectron peak of mn2p3 2 was split into four core level multiplets these photoelectronic multiplets located at 640 37 ev for mno 641 46 ev for mn2o3 mn oh o mn3o4 642 63 ev and 644 08 ev for mno2 zhang et al 2020 compared to the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter these photoelectronic multiplets were left shifted and stronger intensified for 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter obviously the chemical states of mn species in the two filters included mn ii mn iii and mn iv the percentage ratio of which were changed from 1 1 36 0 98 to 1 2 07 1 similar mn species were also observed in the formation of birnessite at room temperature banerjee and nesbitt 1999 although the total mn amount continuously increased the increasement amplitudes of three mn species were different interestingly the content of mn iii species mn3o4 mn2o3 mn oh o was greatly increased from 40 7 to 50 8 after 25 days operation of the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter in the presence of chlorine it supports the evidence that only the active mn species capable of catalyzing chlorine oxidation were dominantly growing in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter this phenomenon implies that the mn iv core species mno2 are in plane sheet and stable in the catalytic activation of chlorine du et al 2020 importantly the catalytic oxidation products of mn2 in the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter were not only mno2 but the mixed valence products which was in accordance with the less consumption of chlorine 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 in fig 2 it is believed that the mn iii species were formed through the comproportionation reaction between the mn2 adsorbed on edge sites and the in situ formed mnox s with layer structures furthermore the photoelectron peak intensity and position of o1s xps were also different for the three filters fig 8 d in terms of the binding energy at 525 535 ev these o species were assigned to the oxide species o2 banerjee and nesbitt 1999 it was the result of incorporation of oxygen anion o2 into the structure of manganese oxides mn o mn the signals of subordinate hydroxide oh and attached water were not detected which indirectly supported the formation of mnox s in zeolite filters compared to the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter the photoelectron peaks of o1s for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter shifted to the higher position and stronger intensity of binding energy this shifting behavior of binding energy indicates that there were different chemical states of o species in manganese oxides in fig 8 e and f the intensity of o species sio2 sio2 al2o3 was greatly inhibited after the in situ coating of manganese oxides in zeolite filter meanwhile the contents of o species of mnox s increased for the two zeolite mnox s filters the o species in the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter included the mn2o3 mn oh o at 528 91 ev mn3o4 mno at 529 47 ev and mno2 530 64 ev however only the o species of mn3o4 mno and mno2 were obtained for the 25 days operated zeolite mnox s filter furthermore the increasement of mn3o4 mno species at 529 30 ev was the strongest the mno component was not increased for the mn species in fig 8 b and c in addition the crystalline structure of calcium based clinoptilolite was beneficial for the mn2 exchange and in situ formation of mnox s coating on zeolite surface by kmno4 oxidation at room temperature xrd fig s5 as expected no signals of manganese crystalline were observed without the hydrothermal or calcination treatment these amorphous manganese oxides had more concentration of reactive sites for the chlorine catalytic oxidation of mn2 charbonnet et al 2018 van genuchten and peña 2017 similar with metallic glasses the amorphous mnox s possessed the random atomic packing structure and metastable nature liang et al 2018 these extensively reduced crystalline boundaries weakened electron trapping and promote inner electron transportation during dynamic filtration the oriented growth of mnox s in the nanosheets led to the refreshment of surface active sites it demonstrated that the effective catalytic component was the amorphous mn iii species mn3o4 during the process of mn2 removal by zeolite mnox s filter in the presence of chlorine 4 conclusions a novel porous zeolite mnox s filter with high water conductivity was successfully synthesized by the in situ redox coating method compared to the conventional quartz and manganese sand filter the as synthesized zeolite mnox s possessed larger adsorption capacity of mn2 in the dynamic filtration process the recycling balance of mn2 adsorption and mnox s generation in the filter is important for mn2 removal in the presence of chlorine the minimized consumption was 0 88 mgcl2 mgmn2 for the as synthesized zeolite mnox s filter saturated zeolite mnox s filters could be quickly regenerated by the modulation of chlorine dosage meanwhile these filters maintained stable under the high strength backwashing and the released mn2 in this period was controllable the zeolite mnox s media layer with 10 cm thickness was convenient to upgrade the present sand filtration tank by the easy method of deposition the in situ growing 3d superstructure nanosheet assembly played the dominated roles in the mn2 removal during long term operation of as synthesized zeolite mnox s the active mn iii species mn3o4 on the edge sites of nanosheet assembly

16859,anaerobic digestion ad is a promising technology capable of converting waste matter into bio energy recent studies have reported that microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad is an effective system for methane production from organic waste via enhanced electron transfer however little is known about the effects of applied voltage on the ad of proteins herein the mechanism of mec ad on protein digestion was investigated using varying concentrations of bovine serum albumin bsa as the protein substrate 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l bsa experimental results showed that the applied voltage can not only enhance the methane production rate from 23 8 to 45 6 at low and medium organic loading bsa concentration of 500 mg l and 4 g l but also improve the methanogenesis efficiency increased by 225 4 at high bsa concentration 20 g l with the applied voltage of 0 6 v compared to that with open circuit mechanism explorations revealed that the applied voltage significantly enhanced the acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes in the ad of proteins microbial community characterization showed that with the applied voltage the abundance of fermentative bacteria increased by 46 7 at the anode while the abundance of methanobacterium at the cathode increased from 10 4 to 84 3 indicating the methanogenesis pathway transformed from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic external circuit electron transfer calculations demonstrated that only 10 of the produced methane could be attributed to direct interspecies electron transfer diet from a thermodynamic perspective the applied external voltage led to a reduction in the cathodic potential to 0 9 v which is beneficial for enhanced methane production via mediated interspecies electron transfer miet by enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens the findings reported here reveal the previously unrecognized contribution of proteins to mec ad while also furthering our understanding of the role of applied voltage in the mec ad process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell anaerobic digestion applied voltage methanogenesis bovine serum albumin 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for the degradation of organic matter in waste such as sewage sludge livestock manure municipal and industrial wastewater and the production of methane baek et al 2021 providing environmental benefits in terms of waste treatment pollution reduction and carbon recovery in the form of renewable biogas fuel kovacs et al 2013 in general ad processes mainly include hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis which are performed by a variety of microorganisms such as hydrolytic fermentative hydrogenogenic microorganisms respectively wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017a advances in research fields such as ad feedstock pretreatment and the optimization of ad feedstock and operational conditions have significantly improved the technologies available for methane recovery from wastewater and organic waste carrere et al 2010 however the complexity of the microbial processes involved constrains the development of interdependency and metabolomic versatility between species leading to long hydraulic retention times for stable performance and low efficiency bioconversion of organic waste to methane recently a bioelectrochemical system was developed to improve the overall performance of ad systems using the current generated in a microbial electrolysis cell mec xu et al 2020a the organic waste used as a feedstock for ad is mainly composed of carbohydrates proteins and lipids previous research performed in defined medium with simple substrates showed high methane production yields using a mec ad system for example the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate increased by 300 while the methane conversion efficiency increased by 56 2 in the combined mec ad system compared to the conventional ad system with the simple organic compound acetate used as a substrate and hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriched on the mec ad anode to convert co2 into methane bo et al 2014 furthermore it has been confirmed that the methane yield from molasses can be doubled by the addition of an electrode due to the retention of a high abundance of acetoclastic methanosaeta on the electrode de vrieze et al 2014 although specific utilization of proteins was not examined lately enhanced methane yield or accelerated methane production rate has been exhibited with the mec ad system using various waste materials as the feedstock such as waste activated sludge was feng et al 2015 wang et al 2020c xu et al 2020b waste sludge lysate yu et al 2021 food waste park et al 2018 and agriculture waste prajapati singh 2020 compared to ad the enhancement of methane production and organic compound removal efficiencies can mainly be attributed to improved carbohydrate bioconversion via 1 increased degradation rates of the substrate including some recalcitrant and complex substrates 2 the favorable redox potential between the electrodes for the enrichment of functional microorganisms choi and sang 2016 3 accelerated oxidation of intermediate volatile fatty acids increasing the acid crash threshold of the process cheng et al 2009 however due to the dynamic organic component release and degradation process in the mec ad of complex substrate and again the fate of proteins was not specifically addressed the conversion of proteins into methane is important as proteins account for 20 40 of the chemical oxygen demand cod in domestic wastewater and 60 90 of the cod in sewage sludge and food industry wastewater such as from the dairy or beverage industries duong et al 2019 it has been shown mec can be used for enhanced h2 production from protein during anaerobic fermentation lu et al 2010 nam et al 2014 methane is produced via hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis during ad from hydrolyzed simple carbohydrate liu et al 2016 therefore it is presumed that mec is feasible to stimulate a fast methane production from protein whereas little is known about applied voltage induced transformation of electron transfer pathway during ad of proteins and the contribution of direct extracellular electron transfer on methane production more efforts should be made to deeply understand applied voltage contributions to the fate of proteins bioconversion and the underlying mechanism for methane promotion which is crucial to achieve viable mec ad reactor operations in the future this study therefore aims to better understand the underlying mechanism of how applied voltages impact methane production during mec ad of proteins to establish the contribution of applied voltages on mec ad of proteins for methane production pure protein in the form of different bovine serum albumin bsa levels 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l was used to simulate the protein contained actual wastewater e g supernatant of excess sludge thermal hydrolyzed excess sludge and high protein containing dairy wastewater with ad of proteins assessed in the presence and absence of an applied voltage following this to understand how mec enhances methane production the effect of applied voltages was assessed on each step of the mec ad process and the microbial community structure based on the established findings the possible mechanism of extracellular electron transfer was proposed from a thermodynamic perspective to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate enhanced methane production due to mec ad of proteins revealing the relevant mechanisms the results obtained in this study not only improve our current understandings of the mec ad process but also provide valuable guidance to facilitate the sustainable optimization of complex waste treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and inoculation two lab scale reactors were established each with a working volume of 800 ml 7 cm diameter and 25 cm height as described by xu et al 2020b briefly the vertical distance between the cathode and anode was 4 5 cm with a carbon brush anode diameter of 4 5 cm and length of 6 0 cm and a carbon cloth cathode 5 mm diameter covered with titanium wire 1 mm diameter the ends of both electrodes were connected to a dc power supply with a 10 ω resistor connected in open circuit current output data was collected from the circuit every 10 min via a connected data recorder a nacl saturated ag agcl electrode was placed opposite to the anode to measure the real time anode and cathode potentials additionally the interfaces of the reactor were all sealed to ensure anaerobic conditions were maintained the inoculum was the secondary sludge obtained from harbin wenchang sewage treatment plant harbin china the sludge was stored at 4 c and allowed to settle for 48 h after removal of the supernatant the residue sludge was screened to remove larger particles using a 40 mesh and a 100 mesh sieve in sequence the sludge was then filtered through quantitative filter paper and dried at 105 until a constant weight was achieved the volatile solid vs content of the sludge was determined and adjusted to 16 g l the culture medium was composed of 50 mm phosphate buffer solution as described by xu et al 2020a with the addition of 1 ml l trace element solution and 1 ml l vitamin solution wang et al 2019 2 2 reactor start up and operation prior to start up 700 ml of culture medium was injected into the reactors with 2 g l sodium acetate as the carbon source after both reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for 20 min to remove oxygen from the system 50 ml of concentrated sludge was inoculated into the reactor a constant voltage of 0 6 v was supplied to the mec ac reactor through an external circuit while the ad reactor without a voltage supply was operated as a control system the operational temperature of both reactors was kept constant at 35 c when microorganism attached to the electrode and began to produce gas the influent sodium acetate content was decreased to 1 g l at an hrt of 48 h the current changes were monitored every 24 h effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and biogas production were determined every 48 h when the biogas production rate and cod removal rate became stable it was determined that the functional microorganisms were successfully enriched and that both reactors had completed their start up period following this with the cultivation conditions kept constant both reactors were operated in batch mode with the influent sodium acetate replaced with low bsa concentration of 500 mg l when a stable state was obtained based on volumetric methane production within 24 h being less than 5 ml the suspended culture broth was replaced with fresh medium containing medium 4 g l or high 20 g l bsa concentration to ensure repeatability of the experimental results analysis was performed in triplicate at each bsa concentration during each batch test the initial and final phs were measured using a ph meter 2 3 analytical methods the liquid samples taken from the reactor were centrifugated at 14000 rpm for 15 min then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane prior to further analysis cod and vs were measured according to the standard method apha 2005 protein concentrations were determined according to the protocol given in bradford reagents kit sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the protein cod content was calculated as cod from the measured protein concentration using a conversion factor of 1 1 g cod g 1 protein cod mass balance was calculated following the method as described by duong et al 2019 gas chromatography agilent 7890a j w scientific us was used to analyze the composition and concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas zhao et al 2017b the produced gas was collected in a gas bag and the methane content of the off gas was measured by gas chromatography gc7890a agilent usa every 24 h chen et al 2007 assuming that all the electrons introduced from the anode are used for methane production through extracellular electron transfer the theoretical volume of methane produced from electrons via eet was calculated according to equation 1 as follows 1 v e v m i d t n f where ve l is the cumulative methane yield from electrons vm represents the molar volume of gas generated at 35 c vm 25 3 l mol i is the current of the external circuit n represents the number of electrons consumed

the electrodes of both reactors when stable methane yields were obtained to identify the microbial community in the reactors and establish their contribution to the mec ad of proteins total genomic dna was extracted using an omega kit according to the manufacturer s protocol the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify the v4 v5 regions of microbial 16s rrna genes liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020c the purified amplicons were subjected to sequencing using an illumina miseq pe250 platform illumina us after filtering out short and low quality reads the operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity cutoff were clustered using qiime 2 quantitative insights into microbial ecology raw 16s rrna sequencing data can be accessed from the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession numbers srr14121793 to srr14121796 3 results 3 1 mec ad methane production from protein the cumulative methane yields produced from proteins using the mec ad and ad reactors with different concentrations of bsa are shown in figure 1 it can be found that the methane yield from the mec ad reactor at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l increased from 0 h to 57 h while no significant increase was observed after 57 h p 0 05 the maximum measured methane yield of 181 8 2 1 ml was similar to the yield obtained after 100 h digestion in the open circuit system figure 1a the same phenomenon was also reflected in both reactors with 4 g l bsa the methane production rate was accelerated by 45 6 in the mec ad reactor compared to in the ad reactor with the maximum methane yield of 920 0 28 ml and 895 5 16 7 ml obtained after 310 h and 380 h digestion respectively figure 1b while different methane production profile patterns were observed at a higher protein concentration when bsa concentrations of 20 g l were digested the highest methane yields of 2623 6 84 2 ml was obtained after 410 h of digestion figure 1c exhibiting an increase in methanogenesis efficiency by 225 4 compared to the control these results demonstrate that the mec ad system with an applied voltage of 0 6 v was conductive to an increased methane production rate at low and medium bsa concentration and an increased final methane yield under high bsa concentration condition which is in accordance with the previously reported results of zhao et al 2016 however the mechanism of how the applied voltage affects methanogenesis efficiency in the mec ad reactor remains unclear and therefore was explored in detail 3 2 organic compound transformation during mec ad of proteins as the terminal product of ad methane production is inevitably affected by the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps in the digestion process therefore the impact of applied voltage on the processes involved in mec ad was investigated 1 cod figure 2 shows cod removal in the mec ad reactor with an applied voltage of 0 6 v at different bsa concentrations results show that at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l the cod removal rate increased by 75 3 within 60 h in the mec ad system compared to the ad control system while no significant difference p 0 05 in residual cod concentration was observed between the two reactors after 96 h of anaerobic digestion figure 2a a similar trend was observed with bsa concentrations of 4 g l figure 2b in contrast at the highest bsa level 20 g l cod concentrations decreased to approximately 14115 6 230 8 mg l within the initial 150 h in both reactors in the presence and absence of an applied voltage figure 2c due to a greater tolerance to high protein levels cod in the mec ad reactor was continually reduced to 9525 6 194 1 mg l after 300 h of digestion exhibiting a 25 4 increase in cod removal efficiency as compared to the control the cod removal profiles were consistent with methane production performance overall these results indicate that an applied voltage not only enhances the cod removal rate in the mec ad reactor at low organic loading levels but also improves the final cod removal efficiency under high protein concentration condition 2 protein the protein hydrolysis performance and the amount of ammonia released by the mec ad and ad reactors under different bsa concentration conditions were determined to assess the effect of applied voltage on protein hydrolysis in contrast to the cod removal performance results the protein concentration profiles in both reactors were highly similar with 94 3 91 7 and 88 5 protein hydrolysis at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l respectively figure 3 a c a correspondingly increased ammonia concentrations from 0 mg l to 155 6 3 5 mg l 637 5 9 2 mg l and 2208 15 6 mg l were observed in both reactors at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l respectively figure 3a c b in contrast to previous research showing that the hydrolysis of protein containing was and food waste could be improved with an applied voltage sun et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the mec system in the present study did not promote hydrolysis during the ad of bsa it is well established that protein hydrolysis mainly depends on the secretion and activity of hydrolases in the absence of organic compound oxidation duong et al 2019 while applied voltages potentially enhancing electron transfer within the system accordingly the results obtained from using pure protein in this study confirm that the applied voltage did not exert a promotive effect on hydrolysis during the anaerobic digestion of proteins 3 vfas the profiles of volatile fatty acids vfas during anaerobic digestion of proteins at different bsa concentrations are presented in figure 4 the application of an external voltage enhanced the production and consumption of vfas under all tested conditions in this study which is consistent with the previously reported results of wang et al 2020b for example in the mec ad reactor at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l a maximum yield of 246 9 17 4 mg l vfas was obtained at 48 h while vfas were completely consumed by 72 h exhibiting a vfa consumption rate of 10 3 mg l h which was 42 8 higher than that of the ad control reactor figure 4a similar results were also obtained at a bsa concentration of 4 g l figure 4b in contrast under high protein concentration conditions bsa 20 g l the maximum yield of vfas in the mec ad reactor 3354 69 1 mg l was lower than that of the ad control reactor 4646 112 4 mg l figure 4c the vfas were consumed after 290 h in the mec ad reactor while the accumulated vfas were not completely consumed in the ad control reactor even after operation for 450 h in addition to vfas and biomass there are also proteins difficult to hydrolyze and potentially some nondegradable amino acids left in both reactors especially at high bsa concentration in the absence of applied voltage figure s1 moreover it should be noted that the final phs in both the mec ad and ad systems at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l and 4 g l were measured to be 7 0 7 2 which was consistent with previously reported results using was as a feedstock wang et al 2020c xu et al 2020a in contrast the final ph values for the mec ad and ad systems at 20 g l bsa were 6 7 and 5 6 respectively it can be inferred from these results that the applied voltage results in the mec ad system having a faster utilization rate of vfas effectively avoiding the accumulation of vfas and therefore acid crash within the reactor it has been reported that mec ad reactors can facilitate the oxidization of vfas at the anode providing more electrons to methanogenic bacteria and increasing the efficiency of methanogenesis wang et al 2020a the increased methanogenesis rate in the mec ad reactor might also be attributed to the rapid consumption of vfas which is more significant under high protein concentration conditions 3 3 microbial community response to the applied voltage in the mec ad system the microbial community structure in electrode biofilm samples from both reactors under stable conditions were characterized by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the shannon index of the inoculum 6 08 decreased after acclimation in both reactors figure s2 with a greater reduction in the shannon index observed in the anode and cathode biofilm of the mec ad reactor compared to the control reactor specifically the cathode biofilm shannon index value decreased from 5 37 to 4 59 while the anode biofilm index value decreased from 5 61 to 5 59 moreover based on the results of pca analysis figure s3 no significant difference in microbial diversity was observed between the inoculum and the control reactor while obvious differences were observed in the microbial community of the anode and cathode with an applied voltage this indicates that an applied voltage can promote the enrichment of functional microorganisms in electrode biofilms especially cathode biofilm improving the stability of the anaerobic digestion system figure 5 a shows the relative abundance of different phylotypes in the electrode biofilms at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi euryarchaeota and firmicutes were dominant in the electrode biofilm samples in the presence and absence of an applied voltage the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes contain a large number of fermentative bacteria among which proteobacteria include a variety of bacteria harboring electron producing capacity while bacteroides contains a large number of fermentative bacteria that use proteins or amino acids as substrates with an applied voltage of 0 6 v significant increases of 46 7 and 34 8 were observed in the abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in the anode biofilm respectively while a phylotype closely related to euryarchaeota was enriched in the cathode biofilm with a 4 fold higher abundance than in the ad control system figure 5b shows the relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial genera in electrode biofilms the abundance of the genus mangrovibacterium which is capable of producing vfas qin et al 2018 increased by 50 3 in the anode biofilm with an applied voltage furthermore diverse genera capable of mediating electron transfer between electrodes were detected in the anode biofilm of the mec ad system including desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and rhodobacter holmes et al 2004 rabaey et al 2004 with abundances increased by 8 9 13 3 and 85 9 respectively in contrast the abundance of fermentative bacterial genera mainly including mangrovibacterium and bellilinea decreased in the cathode biofilm from 31 3 to 17 1 these results indicate that under an applied voltage the anode facilitates the enrichment of fermentative bacteria that are capable of fermenting organic compounds for the production of vfas when the mec ad system was operated with an applied voltage the dominant methanogen in the cathode biofilm changed significantly figure 5c compared to the ad control reactor methanothrix was no longer the predominant methanogen while a 3 fold enrichment of otus affiliated to the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobacterium was observed accounting for 86 3 of archaea in the biofilm with this genera proven to have electrochemical activity de vrieze et al 2018 the enrichment of methanobacterium with an applied voltage instead of methanothrix indicates that the methane production pathway in the mec ad reactor shifted from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 4 theoretical methane production from direct interspecies electron transfer in the mec ad reactor the experimental results obtained in this study indicate that mec ad can improve methane production efficiency via acidogenesis rather than hydrolysis moreover microbial community characterization suggests that enhanced methanogenesis was related to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode biofilm based on these findings the theoretical level of methane production from diet in the mec ad reactor was calculated and compared to that of the control reactor in order to identify the main contributor to enhanced methanogenesis as shown in figure 6 the theoretical methane yield from direct interspecies electron transfer diet via an external circuit at an applied voltage of 0 6 v was 90 ml accounting for only 10 of the total value from the beginning of the mec ad process when the methanogenesis rate is significantly enhanced the sum of the methane yield in the ad system and the theoretical methane yield via diet in the mec ad system was still far smaller than the total yield volume in the mec ad reactor for example at 48 h digestion time the methane yield from the ad reactor was 130 ml while the theoretical methane yield via diet in the mec ad reactor was only 7 7 ml with a total volume reaching 217 5 ml however in the later period of digestion the theoretical methane yield through miet decreased which is not in agreement with the actual observed scenario based on the current calculation figure s4 the theoretical methane yield produced during mec ad should be 2 ml d and it may be speculated that the loss of electrons for methane production should be replaced by endogenous respiration and anabolism these results collectively suggest that the enhanced level of methanogenesis can mainly be attributed to miet meditated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the mec ad cathode biofilm from a thermodynamic perspective it has been reported that enhanced methane production could be achieved in mec ad reactors when glucose acetate or was is utilized as a substrate bo et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2018 feng et al 2015 this study reveals that an applied voltage can improve the performance of protein ad these results facilitate the further development of mec assisted ad processes for enhanced methane production from protein containing waste in comparation to previous research on the improvement of methane production from ad of organic waste via enhanced hydrolysis acidogenesis and enrichment of acetoclastic methanogens the enhanced acidogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis observed in the present study indicates a potentially different methane production mechanism from the previously reported pathways based on the anaerobic digestion performance using protein microbial community structure analysis and external circuit electron transfer calculations potential mechanisms of enhanced methane production were proposed from a thermodynamic perspective based on the transformation of acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 1 mediated interspecies electron transfer in mec ad the energy required for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis metabolic processes is derived from sodium ions during the process of methyl transfer the transmembrane gradients caused by sodium ions or protons can activate atp synthase on the cell membrane driving the conversion of adp to atp carr et al 2018 however at the beginning of the acetoclastic methanogenesis process acetic acid is catalysed into acetyl coa via the synergic effect of acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase with the consumption of one atp molecule or via acetyl coa synthetase consumption of two atp molecules costa leigh 2014 the energy consuming process leads to low metabolic productivity and efficiency in contrast the metabolic productivity and efficiency of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is much higher providing more energy for the subsequent synthesis and metabolism of cells shortening the energy generation time reducing the anaerobic digestion time and ultimately improving the energy conversion efficiency of the system the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens under applied voltage conditions was closely related to the change in electrode potential in the mec ad reactor figure s5 when the half reaction equation of acetic acid oxidation on the anode is used as a benchmark where e co2 acetate e 0 290 v while the standard electrode potential of cathodic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is equal to 2h h2 resulting in e 0 414 v and for acetoclastic methanogenesis e co2 ch4 resulting in e 0 244 v guo et al 2017 based on the formula g zfe the difference between the half reaction electrode potential of the cathode and anode is positive indicating that only reactions with a negative gibbs free energy value will occur spontaneously specifically the potential difference for acetoclastic methanogenesis e 0 046 v indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously in an easier manner in contrast the potential difference for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis e 0 124 v indicates that at least 0 124 v is required to overcome the energy barrier prior to the reaction therefore the oxidation reduction potential of 0 4 v in the control reactor cannot meet the requirements of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis resulting in acetoclastic methanogenesis dominating the ad process in the mec ad reactor with an applied voltage of 0 6 v the cathodic potential was reduced to 0 9 v sufficiently meeting the requirements for hydrogenotrophic methanogen metabolism under these conditions the thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis g0 135 kj mol is more negative than that of acetoclastic methanogenesis g0 33 kj mol allowing hydrogenotrophic methanogens that use carbon dioxide as a substrate to be effectively enriched 2 possible routes for direct electron transfer in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mec ad in addition to miet diet can effectively overcome the limitation of low gas to liquid mass transfer of hydrogen and improve the efficiency of methanogenesis from a thermodynamic perspective hydrogenotrophic methanogens also harbour the capacity for methane production via diet under applied voltage conditions in the metabolic pathway of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hydrogen does not participate in the methyl reduction process directly but relies on ferredoxin fdox low potential redox cofactor f420 and coenzyme m s s coenzyme b com s s cob to complete the reduction of aldehyde groups under the effects of hydrogenases eha and ehb and heterodisulfide reductase hdr h2 mediates electrons to reduce oxidoreductases from an oxidation state to a reduced state yvon durocher et al 2014 at ph 7 the electrode potential of cathodic electrons and h is e h h2 414 mv while that of ferredoxin is e fdox fdred 398 mv and e f420 f420h2 357 mv jirapanjawat et al 2016 ney et al 2017 regueira et al 2018 respectively h2 f420h2 or fded can then serve as electron donors for the reduction of com s s cob by hdr giving the highest standard electrode potential for com s s cob in the traditional ad process hydrogen is the only electron carrier between cells after the external voltage is applied it is speculated that electrons may enter the hydrogenotrophic methanogen metabolic process directly as shown in figure 7 firstly electrons participate in the process of connecting co2 and methanefuran to form cho mf bypassing the catalytic process of fdox reduction by hydrogenase ech with h2 secondly electrons participate in the reduction of the tetrahydromethanepterin h4mpt formyl group bypassing the reduction of two molecules of f420h2 by ech using h2 as an electron donor lastly electrons participate in the reduction of com s s cob during the catalysis of coenzyme m methyltransferase mtr the methyl group transfers itself to the thiol group of hs com to form ch3 s com with ch3 s com combined with hs cob to form com ss cob and release methane however in the present study the methane produced through this process only accounted for 10 of the total methane volume based on theoretical external electron transfer calculations which may be due to the lack of carriers e g conductive flagella cytochromes and electron shuttles mediating electron transfer directly into the cell 4 2 implications of the study this is the first study to directly assess how the combination of an applied voltage and ad affects methane production from protein filling an important gap in knowledge results show that in mec ad of proteins the promotive effect of applied voltage on acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes were significantly higher than on hydrolysis especially under high bsa concentration conditions due to the rapid consumption of vfas mec ad exhibited a higher tolerance threshold to high protein concentrations effectively alleviating the effects of acid crash in the reactor in addition to over 40 of bsa being converted to methane figure s1 the mec process was effective for protein 76 2 3 5 and cod 55 9 2 1 removal at high protein concentrations the levels of cod removal achieved by mec ad in the present study were much higher than the ad control system 26 6 3 2 and comparable to those previously reported in mec tests using was and domestic wastewater sun et al 2015 wagner et al 2009 the use of mecs could therefore offer a valuable alternative treatment technology for high protein containing wastes e g diary wastewater and agriculture waste with methane generation helping to offset treatment costs and provide additional process sustainability the results of this study show that the applied voltage decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure in electrode biofilms and changed the methanogenesis pathway from an acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic mechanism additionally the theoretical production of methane from electrons via external electron transfer and thermodynamic analysis of methane production in this study broaden our current understanding of electron transfer in mec ad systems with applied voltage methane production can not only be strengthened via miet by hydrogenotrophic methanogens but may also induce a thermodynamically feasible route for direct electron transfer in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis through diet and therefore overcoming the limitation caused by the low hydrogen gas to liquid transfer further studies should include the knockout of hydrogenase genes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and in depth transcriptomics of the microbial communities in electrode biofilms in order to confirm the proposed electron pathways involved in the conversion of proteins to methane by mec ad 5 conclusions in this study the underlying mechanism of effect of mec on methane production during protein ad was investigated the key conclusions of this study include 1 with the increase of bsa from 500 mg l to 4 g l the methane production rate increased by 23 8 to 45 6 in the mec ad reactor compared to the control system with an open circuit further increase in bsa concentrations to 20 g l resulted in methanogenesis efficiency being increased by 225 the presence of an applied voltage was found to promote acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps during mec ad of protein 2 the characterization of microbial communities on the electrodes combined with external circuit electron transfer calculations revealed that enhanced methane production was attributed to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogen on cathode via miet 3 from a thermodynamics perspective the electrode potential in mec ad might play a potential role in accelerating the direct electron transfer rate for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus overcoming the limitation caused by the low hydrogen gas to liquid transfer although this requires experimental verification in future studies 4 the findings obtained in this investigation help deepen our understanding of the impact of applied voltages on ad of proteins and provide valuable information for the development of strategies to enhance methane production from different waste sources in the future declaration of competing interest

16859,anaerobic digestion ad is a promising technology capable of converting waste matter into bio energy recent studies have reported that microbial electrolysis cell assisted anaerobic digestion mec ad is an effective system for methane production from organic waste via enhanced electron transfer however little is known about the effects of applied voltage on the ad of proteins herein the mechanism of mec ad on protein digestion was investigated using varying concentrations of bovine serum albumin bsa as the protein substrate 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l bsa experimental results showed that the applied voltage can not only enhance the methane production rate from 23 8 to 45 6 at low and medium organic loading bsa concentration of 500 mg l and 4 g l but also improve the methanogenesis efficiency increased by 225 4 at high bsa concentration 20 g l with the applied voltage of 0 6 v compared to that with open circuit mechanism explorations revealed that the applied voltage significantly enhanced the acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes in the ad of proteins microbial community characterization showed that with the applied voltage the abundance of fermentative bacteria increased by 46 7 at the anode while the abundance of methanobacterium at the cathode increased from 10 4 to 84 3 indicating the methanogenesis pathway transformed from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic external circuit electron transfer calculations demonstrated that only 10 of the produced methane could be attributed to direct interspecies electron transfer diet from a thermodynamic perspective the applied external voltage led to a reduction in the cathodic potential to 0 9 v which is beneficial for enhanced methane production via mediated interspecies electron transfer miet by enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens the findings reported here reveal the previously unrecognized contribution of proteins to mec ad while also furthering our understanding of the role of applied voltage in the mec ad process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell anaerobic digestion applied voltage methanogenesis bovine serum albumin 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for the degradation of organic matter in waste such as sewage sludge livestock manure municipal and industrial wastewater and the production of methane baek et al 2021 providing environmental benefits in terms of waste treatment pollution reduction and carbon recovery in the form of renewable biogas fuel kovacs et al 2013 in general ad processes mainly include hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis which are performed by a variety of microorganisms such as hydrolytic fermentative hydrogenogenic microorganisms respectively wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017a advances in research fields such as ad feedstock pretreatment and the optimization of ad feedstock and operational conditions have significantly improved the technologies available for methane recovery from wastewater and organic waste carrere et al 2010 however the complexity of the microbial processes involved constrains the development of interdependency and metabolomic versatility between species leading to long hydraulic retention times for stable performance and low efficiency bioconversion of organic waste to methane recently a bioelectrochemical system was developed to improve the overall performance of ad systems using the current generated in a microbial electrolysis cell mec xu et al 2020a the organic waste used as a feedstock for ad is mainly composed of carbohydrates proteins and lipids previous research performed in defined medium with simple substrates showed high methane production yields using a mec ad system for example the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate increased by 300 while the methane conversion efficiency increased by 56 2 in the combined mec ad system compared to the conventional ad system with the simple organic compound acetate used as a substrate and hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriched on the mec ad anode to convert co2 into methane bo et al 2014 furthermore it has been confirmed that the methane yield from molasses can be doubled by the addition of an electrode due to the retention of a high abundance of acetoclastic methanosaeta on the electrode de vrieze et al 2014 although specific utilization of proteins was not examined lately enhanced methane yield or accelerated methane production rate has been exhibited with the mec ad system using various waste materials as the feedstock such as waste activated sludge was feng et al 2015 wang et al 2020c xu et al 2020b waste sludge lysate yu et al 2021 food waste park et al 2018 and agriculture waste prajapati singh 2020 compared to ad the enhancement of methane production and organic compound removal efficiencies can mainly be attributed to improved carbohydrate bioconversion via 1 increased degradation rates of the substrate including some recalcitrant and complex substrates 2 the favorable redox potential between the electrodes for the enrichment of functional microorganisms choi and sang 2016 3 accelerated oxidation of intermediate volatile fatty acids increasing the acid crash threshold of the process cheng et al 2009 however due to the dynamic organic component release and degradation process in the mec ad of complex substrate and again the fate of proteins was not specifically addressed the conversion of proteins into methane is important as proteins account for 20 40 of the chemical oxygen demand cod in domestic wastewater and 60 90 of the cod in sewage sludge and food industry wastewater such as from the dairy or beverage industries duong et al 2019 it has been shown mec can be used for enhanced h2 production from protein during anaerobic fermentation lu et al 2010 nam et al 2014 methane is produced via hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis during ad from hydrolyzed simple carbohydrate liu et al 2016 therefore it is presumed that mec is feasible to stimulate a fast methane production from protein whereas little is known about applied voltage induced transformation of electron transfer pathway during ad of proteins and the contribution of direct extracellular electron transfer on methane production more efforts should be made to deeply understand applied voltage contributions to the fate of proteins bioconversion and the underlying mechanism for methane promotion which is crucial to achieve viable mec ad reactor operations in the future this study therefore aims to better understand the underlying mechanism of how applied voltages impact methane production during mec ad of proteins to establish the contribution of applied voltages on mec ad of proteins for methane production pure protein in the form of different bovine serum albumin bsa levels 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l was used to simulate the protein contained actual wastewater e g supernatant of excess sludge thermal hydrolyzed excess sludge and high protein containing dairy wastewater with ad of proteins assessed in the presence and absence of an applied voltage following this to understand how mec enhances methane production the effect of applied voltages was assessed on each step of the mec ad process and the microbial community structure based on the established findings the possible mechanism of extracellular electron transfer was proposed from a thermodynamic perspective to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate enhanced methane production due to mec ad of proteins revealing the relevant mechanisms the results obtained in this study not only improve our current understandings of the mec ad process but also provide valuable guidance to facilitate the sustainable optimization of complex waste treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and inoculation two lab scale reactors were established each with a working volume of 800 ml 7 cm diameter and 25 cm height as described by xu et al 2020b briefly the vertical distance between the cathode and anode was 4 5 cm with a carbon brush anode diameter of 4 5 cm and length of 6 0 cm and a carbon cloth cathode 5 mm diameter covered with titanium wire 1 mm diameter the ends of both electrodes were connected to a dc power supply with a 10 ω resistor connected in open circuit current output data was collected from the circuit every 10 min via a connected data recorder a nacl saturated ag agcl electrode was placed opposite to the anode to measure the real time anode and cathode potentials additionally the interfaces of the reactor were all sealed to ensure anaerobic conditions were maintained the inoculum was the secondary sludge obtained from harbin wenchang sewage treatment plant harbin china the sludge was stored at 4 c and allowed to settle for 48 h after removal of the supernatant the residue sludge was screened to remove larger particles using a 40 mesh and a 100 mesh sieve in sequence the sludge was then filtered through quantitative filter paper and dried at 105 until a constant weight was achieved the volatile solid vs content of the sludge was determined and adjusted to 16 g l the culture medium was composed of 50 mm phosphate buffer solution as described by xu et al 2020a with the addition of 1 ml l trace element solution and 1 ml l vitamin solution wang et al 2019 2 2 reactor start up and operation prior to start up 700 ml of culture medium was injected into the reactors with 2 g l sodium acetate as the carbon source after both reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for 20 min to remove oxygen from the system 50 ml of concentrated sludge was inoculated into the reactor a constant voltage of 0 6 v was supplied to the mec ac reactor through an external circuit while the ad reactor without a voltage supply was operated as a control system the operational temperature of both reactors was kept constant at 35 c when microorganism attached to the electrode and began to produce gas the influent sodium acetate content was decreased to 1 g l at an hrt of 48 h the current changes were monitored every 24 h effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and biogas production were determined every 48 h when the biogas production rate and cod removal rate became stable it was determined that the functional microorganisms were successfully enriched and that both reactors had completed their start up period following this with the cultivation conditions kept constant both reactors were operated in batch mode with the influent sodium acetate replaced with low bsa concentration of 500 mg l when a stable state was obtained based on volumetric methane production within 24 h being less than 5 ml the suspended culture broth was replaced with fresh medium containing medium 4 g l or high 20 g l bsa concentration to ensure repeatability of the experimental results analysis was performed in triplicate at each bsa concentration during each batch test the initial and final phs were measured using a ph meter 2 3 analytical methods the liquid samples taken from the reactor were centrifugated at 14000 rpm for 15 min then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane prior to further analysis cod and vs were measured according to the standard method apha 2005 protein concentrations were determined according to the protocol given in bradford reagents kit sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the protein cod content was calculated as cod from the measured protein concentration using a conversion factor of 1 1 g cod g 1 protein cod mass balance was calculated following the method as described by duong et al 2019 gas chromatography agilent 7890a j w scientific us was used to analyze the composition and concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas zhao et al 2017b the produced gas was collected in a gas bag and the methane content of the off gas was measured by gas chromatography gc7890a agilent usa every 24 h chen et al 2007 assuming that all the electrons introduced from the anode are used for methane production through extracellular electron transfer the theoretical volume of methane produced from electrons via eet was calculated according to equation 1 as follows 1 v e v m i d t n f where ve l is the cumulative methane yield from electrons vm represents the molar volume of gas generated at 35 c vm 25 3 l mol i is the current of the external circuit n represents the number of electrons consumed

the electrodes of both reactors when stable methane yields were obtained to identify the microbial community in the reactors and establish their contribution to the mec ad of proteins total genomic dna was extracted using an omega kit according to the manufacturer s protocol the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify the v4 v5 regions of microbial 16s rrna genes liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020c the purified amplicons were subjected to sequencing using an illumina miseq pe250 platform illumina us after filtering out short and low quality reads the operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity cutoff were clustered using qiime 2 quantitative insights into microbial ecology raw 16s rrna sequencing data can be accessed from the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession numbers srr14121793 to srr14121796 3 results 3 1 mec ad methane production from protein the cumulative methane yields produced from proteins using the mec ad and ad reactors with different concentrations of bsa are shown in figure 1 it can be found that the methane yield from the mec ad reactor at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l increased from 0 h to 57 h while no significant increase was observed after 57 h p 0 05 the maximum measured methane yield of 181 8 2 1 ml was similar to the yield obtained after 100 h digestion in the open circuit system figure 1a the same phenomenon was also reflected in both reactors with 4 g l bsa the methane production rate was accelerated by 45 6 in the mec ad reactor compared to in the ad reactor with the maximum methane yield of 920 0 28 ml and 895 5 16 7 ml obtained after 310 h and 380 h digestion respectively figure 1b while different methane production profile patterns were observed at a higher protein concentration when bsa concentrations of 20 g l were digested the highest methane yields of 2623 6 84 2 ml was obtained after 410 h of digestion figure 1c exhibiting an increase in methanogenesis efficiency by 225 4 compared to the control these results demonstrate that the mec ad system with an applied voltage of 0 6 v was conductive to an increased methane production rate at low and medium bsa concentration and an increased final methane yield under high bsa concentration condition which is in accordance with the previously reported results of zhao et al 2016 however the mechanism of how the applied voltage affects methanogenesis efficiency in the mec ad reactor remains unclear and therefore was explored in detail 3 2 organic compound transformation during mec ad of proteins as the terminal product of ad methane production is inevitably affected by the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps in the digestion process therefore the impact of applied voltage on the processes involved in mec ad was investigated 1 cod figure 2 shows cod removal in the mec ad reactor with an applied voltage of 0 6 v at different bsa concentrations results show that at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l the cod removal rate increased by 75 3 within 60 h in the mec ad system compared to the ad control system while no significant difference p 0 05 in residual cod concentration was observed between the two reactors after 96 h of anaerobic digestion figure 2a a similar trend was observed with bsa concentrations of 4 g l figure 2b in contrast at the highest bsa level 20 g l cod concentrations decreased to approximately 14115 6 230 8 mg l within the initial 150 h in both reactors in the presence and absence of an applied voltage figure 2c due to a greater tolerance to high protein levels cod in the mec ad reactor was continually reduced to 9525 6 194 1 mg l after 300 h of digestion exhibiting a 25 4 increase in cod removal efficiency as compared to the control the cod removal profiles were consistent with methane production performance overall these results indicate that an applied voltage not only enhances the cod removal rate in the mec ad reactor at low organic loading levels but also improves the final cod removal efficiency under high protein concentration condition 2 protein the protein hydrolysis performance and the amount of ammonia released by the mec ad and ad reactors under different bsa concentration conditions were determined to assess the effect of applied voltage on protein hydrolysis in contrast to the cod removal performance results the protein concentration profiles in both reactors were highly similar with 94 3 91 7 and 88 5 protein hydrolysis at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l respectively figure 3 a c a correspondingly increased ammonia concentrations from 0 mg l to 155 6 3 5 mg l 637 5 9 2 mg l and 2208 15 6 mg l were observed in both reactors at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l 4 g l and 20 g l respectively figure 3a c b in contrast to previous research showing that the hydrolysis of protein containing was and food waste could be improved with an applied voltage sun et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the mec system in the present study did not promote hydrolysis during the ad of bsa it is well established that protein hydrolysis mainly depends on the secretion and activity of hydrolases in the absence of organic compound oxidation duong et al 2019 while applied voltages potentially enhancing electron transfer within the system accordingly the results obtained from using pure protein in this study confirm that the applied voltage did not exert a promotive effect on hydrolysis during the anaerobic digestion of proteins 3 vfas the profiles of volatile fatty acids vfas during anaerobic digestion of proteins at different bsa concentrations are presented in figure 4 the application of an external voltage enhanced the production and consumption of vfas under all tested conditions in this study which is consistent with the previously reported results of wang et al 2020b for example in the mec ad reactor at a bsa concentration of 500 mg l a maximum yield of 246 9 17 4 mg l vfas was obtained at 48 h while vfas were completely consumed by 72 h exhibiting a vfa consumption rate of 10 3 mg l h which was 42 8 higher than that of the ad control reactor figure 4a similar results were also obtained at a bsa concentration of 4 g l figure 4b in contrast under high protein concentration conditions bsa 20 g l the maximum yield of vfas in the mec ad reactor 3354 69 1 mg l was lower than that of the ad control reactor 4646 112 4 mg l figure 4c the vfas were consumed after 290 h in the mec ad reactor while the accumulated vfas were not completely consumed in the ad control reactor even after operation for 450 h in addition to vfas and biomass there are also proteins difficult to hydrolyze and potentially some nondegradable amino acids left in both reactors especially at high bsa concentration in the absence of applied voltage figure s1 moreover it should be noted that the final phs in both the mec ad and ad systems at bsa concentrations of 500 mg l and 4 g l were measured to be 7 0 7 2 which was consistent with previously reported results using was as a feedstock wang et al 2020c xu et al 2020a in contrast the final ph values for the mec ad and ad systems at 20 g l bsa were 6 7 and 5 6 respectively it can be inferred from these results that the applied voltage results in the mec ad system having a faster utilization rate of vfas effectively avoiding the accumulation of vfas and therefore acid crash within the reactor it has been reported that mec ad reactors can facilitate the oxidization of vfas at the anode providing more electrons to methanogenic bacteria and increasing the efficiency of methanogenesis wang et al 2020a the increased methanogenesis rate in the mec ad reactor might also be attributed to the rapid consumption of vfas which is more significant under high protein concentration conditions 3 3 microbial community response to the applied voltage in the mec ad system the microbial community structure in electrode biofilm samples from both reactors under stable conditions were characterized by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the shannon index of the inoculum 6 08 decreased after acclimation in both reactors figure s2 with a greater reduction in the shannon index observed in the anode and cathode biofilm of the mec ad reactor compared to the control reactor specifically the cathode biofilm shannon index value decreased from 5 37 to 4 59 while the anode biofilm index value decreased from 5 61 to 5 59 moreover based on the results of pca analysis figure s3 no significant difference in microbial diversity was observed between the inoculum and the control reactor while obvious differences were observed in the microbial community of the anode and cathode with an applied voltage this indicates that an applied voltage can promote the enrichment of functional microorganisms in electrode biofilms especially cathode biofilm improving the stability of the anaerobic digestion system figure 5 a shows the relative abundance of different phylotypes in the electrode biofilms at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi euryarchaeota and firmicutes were dominant in the electrode biofilm samples in the presence and absence of an applied voltage the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes contain a large number of fermentative bacteria among which proteobacteria include a variety of bacteria harboring electron producing capacity while bacteroides contains a large number of fermentative bacteria that use proteins or amino acids as substrates with an applied voltage of 0 6 v significant increases of 46 7 and 34 8 were observed in the abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in the anode biofilm respectively while a phylotype closely related to euryarchaeota was enriched in the cathode biofilm with a 4 fold higher abundance than in the ad control system figure 5b shows the relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial genera in electrode biofilms the abundance of the genus mangrovibacterium which is capable of producing vfas qin et al 2018 increased by 50 3 in the anode biofilm with an applied voltage furthermore diverse genera capable of mediating electron transfer between electrodes were detected in the anode biofilm of the mec ad system including desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and rhodobacter holmes et al 2004 rabaey et al 2004 with abundances increased by 8 9 13 3 and 85 9 respectively in contrast the abundance of fermentative bacterial genera mainly including mangrovibacterium and bellilinea decreased in the cathode biofilm from 31 3 to 17 1 these results indicate that under an applied voltage the anode facilitates the enrichment of fermentative bacteria that are capable of fermenting organic compounds for the production of vfas when the mec ad system was operated with an applied voltage the dominant methanogen in the cathode biofilm changed significantly figure 5c compared to the ad control reactor methanothrix was no longer the predominant methanogen while a 3 fold enrichment of otus affiliated to the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobacterium was observed accounting for 86 3 of archaea in the biofilm with this genera proven to have electrochemical activity de vrieze et al 2018 the enrichment of methanobacterium with an applied voltage instead of methanothrix indicates that the methane production pathway in the mec ad reactor shifted from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 4 theoretical methane production from direct interspecies electron transfer in the mec ad reactor the experimental results obtained in this study indicate that mec ad can improve methane production efficiency via acidogenesis rather than hydrolysis moreover microbial community characterization suggests that enhanced methanogenesis was related to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode biofilm based on these findings the theoretical level of methane production from diet in the mec ad reactor was calculated and compared to that of the control reactor in order to identify the main contributor to enhanced methanogenesis as shown in figure 6 the theoretical methane yield from direct interspecies electron transfer diet via an external circuit at an applied voltage of 0 6 v was 90 ml accounting for only 10 of the total value from the beginning of the mec ad process when the methanogenesis rate is significantly enhanced the sum of the methane yield in the ad system and the theoretical methane yield via diet in the mec ad system was still far smaller than the total yield volume in the mec ad reactor for example at 48 h digestion time the methane yield from the ad reactor was 130 ml while the theoretical methane yield via diet in the mec ad reactor was only 7 7 ml with a total volume reaching 217 5 ml however in the later period of digestion the theoretical methane yield through miet decreased which is not in agreement with the actual observed scenario based on the current calculation figure s4 the theoretical methane yield produced during mec ad should be 2 ml d and it may be speculated that the loss of electrons for methane production should be replaced by endogenous respiration and anabolism these results collectively suggest that the enhanced level of methanogenesis can mainly be attributed to miet meditated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the mec ad cathode biofilm from a thermodynamic perspective it has been reported that enhanced methane production could be achieved in mec ad reactors when glucose acetate or was is utilized as a substrate bo et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2018 feng et al 2015 this study reveals that an applied voltage can improve the performance of protein ad these results facilitate the further development of mec assisted ad processes for enhanced methane production from protein containing waste in comparation to previous research on the improvement of methane production from ad of organic waste via enhanced hydrolysis acidogenesis and enrichment of acetoclastic methanogens the enhanced acidogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis observed in the present study indicates a potentially different methane production mechanism from the previously reported pathways based on the anaerobic digestion performance using protein microbial community structure analysis and external circuit electron transfer calculations potential mechanisms of enhanced methane production were proposed from a thermodynamic perspective based on the transformation of acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 1 mediated interspecies electron transfer in mec ad the energy required for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis metabolic processes is derived from sodium ions during the process of methyl transfer the transmembrane gradients caused by sodium ions or protons can activate atp synthase on the cell membrane driving the conversion of adp to atp carr et al 2018 however at the beginning of the acetoclastic methanogenesis process acetic acid is catalysed into acetyl coa via the synergic effect of acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase with the consumption of one atp molecule or via acetyl coa synthetase consumption of two atp molecules costa leigh 2014 the energy consuming process leads to low metabolic productivity and efficiency in contrast the metabolic productivity and efficiency of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is much higher providing more energy for the subsequent synthesis and metabolism of cells shortening the energy generation time reducing the anaerobic digestion time and ultimately improving the energy conversion efficiency of the system the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens under applied voltage conditions was closely related to the change in electrode potential in the mec ad reactor figure s5 when the half reaction equation of acetic acid oxidation on the anode is used as a benchmark where e co2 acetate e 0 290 v while the standard electrode potential of cathodic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is equal to 2h h2 resulting in e 0 414 v and for acetoclastic methanogenesis e co2 ch4 resulting in e 0 244 v guo et al 2017 based on the formula g zfe the difference between the half reaction electrode potential of the cathode and anode is positive indicating that only reactions with a negative gibbs free energy value will occur spontaneously specifically the potential difference for acetoclastic methanogenesis e 0 046 v indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously in an easier manner in contrast the potential difference for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis e 0 124 v indicates that at least 0 124 v is required to overcome the energy barrier prior to the reaction therefore the oxidation reduction potential of 0 4 v in the control reactor cannot meet the requirements of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis resulting in acetoclastic methanogenesis dominating the ad process in the mec ad reactor with an applied voltage of 0 6 v the cathodic potential was reduced to 0 9 v sufficiently meeting the requirements for hydrogenotrophic methanogen metabolism under these conditions the thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis g0 135 kj mol is more negative than that of acetoclastic methanogenesis g0 33 kj mol allowing hydrogenotrophic methanogens that use carbon dioxide as a substrate to be effectively enriched 2 possible routes for direct electron transfer in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mec ad in addition to miet diet can effectively overcome the limitation of low gas to liquid mass transfer of hydrogen and improve the efficiency of methanogenesis from a thermodynamic perspective hydrogenotrophic methanogens also harbour the capacity for methane production via diet under applied voltage conditions in the metabolic pathway of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hydrogen does not participate in the methyl reduction process directly but relies on ferredoxin fdox low potential redox cofactor f420 and coenzyme m s s coenzyme b com s s cob to complete the reduction of aldehyde groups under the effects of hydrogenases eha and ehb and heterodisulfide reductase hdr h2 mediates electrons to reduce oxidoreductases from an oxidation state to a reduced state yvon durocher et al 2014 at ph 7 the electrode potential of cathodic electrons and h is e h h2 414 mv while that of ferredoxin is e fdox fdred 398 mv and e f420 f420h2 357 mv jirapanjawat et al 2016 ney et al 2017 regueira et al 2018 respectively h2 f420h2 or fded can then serve as electron donors for the reduction of com s s cob by hdr giving the highest standard electrode potential for com s s cob in the traditional ad process hydrogen is the only electron carrier between cells after the external voltage is applied it is speculated that electrons may enter the hydrogenotrophic methanogen metabolic process directly as shown in figure 7 firstly electrons participate in the process of connecting co2 and methanefuran to form cho mf bypassing the catalytic process of fdox reduction by hydrogenase ech with h2 secondly electrons participate in the reduction of the tetrahydromethanepterin h4mpt formyl group bypassing the reduction of two molecules of f420h2 by ech using h2 as an electron donor lastly electrons participate in the reduction of com s s cob during the catalysis of coenzyme m methyltransferase mtr the methyl group transfers itself to the thiol group of hs com to form ch3 s com with ch3 s com combined with hs cob to form com ss cob and release methane however in the present study the methane produced through this process only accounted for 10 of the total methane volume based on theoretical external electron transfer calculations which may be due to the lack of carriers e g conductive flagella cytochromes and electron shuttles mediating electron transfer directly into the cell 4 2 implications of the study this is the first study to directly assess how the combination of an applied voltage and ad affects methane production from protein filling an important gap in knowledge results show that in mec ad of proteins the promotive effect of applied voltage on acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes were significantly higher than on hydrolysis especially under high bsa concentration conditions due to the rapid consumption of vfas mec ad exhibited a higher tolerance threshold to high protein concentrations effectively alleviating the effects of acid crash in the reactor in addition to over 40 of bsa being converted to methane figure s1 the mec process was effective for protein 76 2 3 5 and cod 55 9 2 1 removal at high protein concentrations the levels of cod removal achieved by mec ad in the present study were much higher than the ad control system 26 6 3 2 and comparable to those previously reported in mec tests using was and domestic wastewater sun et al 2015 wagner et al 2009 the use of mecs could therefore offer a valuable alternative treatment technology for high protein containing wastes e g diary wastewater and agriculture waste with methane generation helping to offset treatment costs and provide additional process sustainability the results of this study show that the applied voltage decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure in electrode biofilms and changed the methanogenesis pathway from an acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic mechanism additionally the theoretical production of methane from electrons via external electron transfer and thermodynamic analysis of methane production in this study broaden our current understanding of electron transfer in mec ad systems with applied voltage methane production can not only be strengthened via miet by hydrogenotrophic methanogens but may also induce a thermodynamically feasible route for direct electron transfer in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis through diet and therefore overcoming the limitation caused by the low hydrogen gas to liquid transfer further studies should include the knockout of hydrogenase genes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and in depth transcriptomics of the microbial communities in electrode biofilms in order to confirm the proposed electron pathways involved in the conversion of proteins to methane by mec ad 5 conclusions in this study the underlying mechanism of effect of mec on methane production during protein ad was investigated the key conclusions of this study include 1 with the increase of bsa from 500 mg l to 4 g l the methane production rate increased by 23 8 to 45 6 in the mec ad reactor compared to the control system with an open circuit further increase in bsa concentrations to 20 g l resulted in methanogenesis efficiency being increased by 225 the presence of an applied voltage was found to promote acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps during mec ad of protein 2 the characterization of microbial communities on the electrodes combined with external circuit electron transfer calculations revealed that enhanced methane production was attributed to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogen on cathode via miet 3 from a thermodynamics perspective the electrode potential in mec ad might play a potential role in accelerating the direct electron transfer rate for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus overcoming the limitation caused by the low hydrogen gas to liquid transfer although this requires experimental verification in future studies 4 the findings obtained in this investigation help deepen our understanding of the impact of applied voltages on ad of proteins and provide valuable information for the development of strategies to enhance methane production from different waste sources in the future declaration of competing interest
