9340,most lime trees are cultivated under open field conditions however in the mediterranean area some growers use shade screen to protect their orchards against abiotic and biotic stresses inducing changes in the plant s surrounding microclimate that could affect its water status this field experiment focuses on the effect of shade screen high density polyethylene white net with 76 light transmission and irrigation on plant and soil water status of bearss lime trees two irrigation treatments were applied during the summer autumn to open field and shaded lime trees irrigated control and non irrigated stress volumetric soil water content θv air temperature ta and canopy temperature tc were real time monitored and several derived thermal indices were calculated stem water potential ψstem and leaf gas exchange net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs were measured on representative days withholding irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant water status θv decreased from the outset in the non irrigated treatments showing breaking point connecting the rapid and the slower soil drying processes significant differences in ψstem and gs values were observed between controls and stressed trees 15 days after stress initiation during early stages of water stress lime trees cultivated in open field showed lower values of soil and plant water status than those grown in shaded conditions however at the end of stress period similar values were noted for both cropping systems pointing to severe water deficit tc and tc ta values reflected the current lime tree water status the soil water content sensors anticipated the plant water stress situation respect to thermal ones the higher θv ψstem gs pn and tc values registered in shaded lime trees revealed that shading allowed better soil plant water status and a 12 day window of opportunity to respond to the imposed soil water deficits threshold thermal based values are proposed for precise irrigation

introduction lime tree are gaining in importance as an agricultural crop although native to south central china brazil is nowadays the main lime producer followed by mexico iran egypt and colombia cirad 2021 however recently its cultivation has extended to the mediterranean area since it is well adapted to semiarid conditions due to climatic change ipcc 2021 the warmer climate may make this area even more beneficial for lime production although the shortage of water means adopting more efficient water management and cultivation practices that promote water saving monitoring the parameters of the soil plant atmosphere system is decisive for evaluating the plant responses to irrigation regimes and crop cropping system allowing the provided water to be adjusted to the plant s water requirements mira garcía et al 2020 soil water status was assessed by soil water content θv measurements traditionally by gravimetric methods which are destructive time consuming and not repeatable nowadays other indirect methods based on the physical and chemical soil properties like time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance and impedance are gaining importance hardie 2020 vera et al 2021 the plant itself has long been recognized as the best indicator of its water status which can be assessed by direct measurements of leaf ψleaf or stem water potentials ψstem or indirectly by reference to leaf gas exchange parameters stomatal conductance gs net photosynthesis pn traditionally considered as good plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling purposes cifre et al 2005 garcía orellana et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2019 mirás avalos et al 2016 however the draw back of the manual measurements is that they are laborious destructive and time consuming ballester et al 2013b garcía tejero et al 2011 furthermore the progress made in telemetry have allowed real time monitoring of other indirect plant based water status indicators such as trunk diameter shrinkage sap flow or leaf turgor conejero et al 2011 fernández 2017 rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 also canopy temperature tc long recognized as an indicator of plant water status costa et al 2013 gates 1964 jones 2004 can be in situ or remotely measured by infra red thermometry or thermal imaging using infra red radiometer sensors or thermal cameras thus the measurement of tc is a reliable rapid and non destructive technique for monitoring plant water status blaya ros et al 2020 leinonen et al 2006 romero trigueros et al 2019 it is well known that tc is influenced by atmospheric conditions such as vapour pressure deficit and radiation level among others zhang et al 2017 to attenuate the effect of these environmental variables on the absolute values of tc different thermal indices have been proposed the difference between canopy and air temperature tc ta and the crop water stress index cwsi are the most performing idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 also regression models have been suggested to predict leaf water potential based on tc or cwsi values in prunus tormann 1986 wang and gartung 2010 and citrus cohen et al 2005 in addition shade screen protect crops against abiotic stresses such as adverse weather conditions or biotic stresses such as pests and diseases mditshwa et al 2019 this cropping system reduces the incoming radiation garcía sánchez et al 2015 affecting the microclimate surrounding the plants and hence their physiological behaviour manja and aoun 2019 in this sense incesu et al 2016 observed an increase in the photosynthesis rate in lane late oranges cultivated under black netting while jifon and syvertsen 2003 observed lower tc values in red ruby grapefruit trees under aluminized screens whereas shaded avocado trees showed increased tc with respect to trees in open field conditions blakey et al 2016 this study is aimed to assess plant soil water status and thermal response of young lime trees to shading and soil water deficits for this purpose the following objectives were proposed i to evaluate the ability of discrete ψstem gs and pn and continuous plant tc and soil θv water status indicators to detect water stress ii to identify the best performing thermal based indices and iii to determine threshold thermal based values for irrigation management in semi arid conditions to do this it was necessary to measure plant soil water status and thermal based indices under well watered and water deficit conditions in shaded and non shaded trees we tested the hypothesis that microclimate caused by shade screen could affect these parameters in shaded vs non shaded lime trees this information will be relevant in a future to manage the irrigation in a higher efficient way 2 materials and methods 2 1

as for control treatment each cropping system consisted of a sub plot of 60 lime trees the irrigation treatments were distributed in shaded and open field conditions in a completely randomised design with four replications each replication consisting of one row of six trees with a total of 24 trees per irrigation treatment one tree from each replication served for measurements and the rest of the plot were considered as borders 2 3 measurements environmental data in both open field and shaded conditions were monitored by two automatic weather stations located in the both sub plots values of air temperature ta relative humidity rh wind speed solar radiation and precipitation were read every 5 min and the averages were recorded every 15 min and transmitted to the cloud based web server

sensors model si 431 series apogee instruments inc logan ut usa six sensors were installed for each cropping system three per irrigation treatment n 3 each sensor was mounted on a bracket attached to an aluminium pole installed 6 m from the lime tree row aimed at the middle south facing side of the tree canopy fig 2 the half field of view fov of these sensors was 14 with a response time of 0 1 s the sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer with an accuracy of 0 2 c they were connected to the cloud based web server platform sub section 2 2 which read tc values every 5 min and recorded

potential rate and tc ta ul is the upper limit which corresponds to a canopy where transpiration has ceased the linear relationship between tc ta and vpd for well irrigated trees control treatment was used to establish the nwsb for each cropping condition tc ta ll was calculated by solving the nwsb equation for the actual vpd the tc ta ul was a fixed value taken from the maximum tc ta value

significance of the relationships between the measured indicators 3 results 3 1 soil plant atmosphere water status during the experimental period the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 varied greatly from day to day with higher values registered in open field than in shaded conditions fig 3a the maximum daily et0 values were noted in mid june 7 32 mm d 1 and the minimum at the end of october 0 54 mm d 1 in open field conditions shaded condition reduced et0 by an average of 28 varying from the maximum of 4 30 to the minimum of 0 59 mm d 1 in june and october respectively fig 3a the discrete measurements of plant water status on representative days during the experimental period showed values of stem water potential ψstem ranging from 0 59 to 1 19 mpa in control trees of both cropping systems fig 3b in turn the real time soil water content θv on the same control trees showed in the active root zone 0 2 0 6 m mean similar values in open field 33 01 and in shaded conditions 32 22 fig 3c however higher θv at 0 8 m was observed in shaded conditions as irrigation episodes were not observed to reach this depth in open field conditions or even was showed lower θv values data not shown withholding irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant water status parameters fig 3b c ψstem values were statistically lower in stressed than in control trees from the beginning of the stress in both cropping systems fig 3b in the early stages of water stress lower values of ψstem were noted in open field than in shaded conditions fig 3b nevertheless as the stress progressed ψstem continued to decrease in both cropping systems with not statistically significant differences between non irrigated treatments sopen field and sshaded fig 3b an earlier and more abrupt decrease in θv was observed in non irrigated open field lime trees compared with shaded trees the θv values were lower in stressed open field lime trees up to mid july after which the decrease was similar in both cropping systems fig 3c at the end of the stress period doy 267 minimum values were recorded for both water status indicators with statistically similar values in open field θv 17 5 and ψstem 2 98 mpa and in shaded θv 17 6 and ψstem 3 1 mpa fig 3b c conditions in addition two phases were detected in the soil drying curve of stressed lime trees as drawn in fig 3c a first sharp reduction in θv values was observed phase i followed by a slower rate of reduction phase ii phase i corresponded to doy 173 189 in the case of open field conditions while it lasted from doy 173 201 in shaded conditions during this phase θv decreased by 30 in both cropping systems in phase ii which lasted from the end of phase i to the end of stress period doy 189 259 and doy 201 259 in open field and shaded conditions respectively θv decreased at a slower rate than during phase i the breaking point of these two phases occurred earlier in open field than in shaded conditions but at a similar θv value 20 in both cropping systems fig 3c this intersection point of θv matched a similar value of ψstem 2 mpa which was reached earlier in open field than in shaded lime trees fig 3b during the recovery period when the water restrictions ended and the stressed trees were irrigated the same as control trees from doy 259 298 a gradual increase in both θv and ψstem values was observed similar values of θv were noted in stressed and control trees 15 days after re irrigation fig 3c whereas ψstem recovered control values after one month in both cropping systems fig 3b 3 2 leaf gas exchange leaf gas exchange measurement in well irrigated trees showed high values of stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn fig 4 shade screen reduced the incident photosynthetically active radiation par by 22 47 compared with the open field conditions with the maximum reduction observed in july august corresponding to the months of highest evaporative demanding data not shown a similar seasonally fluctuating trend was noted in gs and pn values in the control trees in both cropping systems nevertheless average values were significantly higher in shaded than in open field conditions fig 4 especially apparent for gs with a seasonal value of 105 5 and 122 3 mmol m 2 s 1 in open field and shaded control trees respectively however similar average values of pn 11 1 and 10 6 µmol m 2 s 1 were noted in open field and shaded trees respectively when the water stress was applied the leaf gas exchange parameters gradually fell in both cropping systems fig 4 values of gs in the control and stressed treatments statistically differed when irrigation began to be withheld in both cropping systems fig 4a in the early stages of water stress a greater decrease in gs and pn was noted in the limes trees cultivated in open field conditions however it should be noticed that pn values in stressed trees cultivated in shaded conditions remained similar to control trees values for up to 40 days after irrigation was withheld fig 4b average gs values during the stress period were significantly lower in stressed lime trees grown in open field than in shaded conditions 54 5 and 70 3 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively in addition the same trend was observed in the case of pn with values of 6 1 and 8 0 µmol m 2 s 1 for the trees cultivated in open field and under shade screen respectively at the end of the stress period leaf gas exchange values were low in the stressed lime trees with no significant differences between cropping systems gs 23 mmol m 2 s 1 and pn 3 2 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 when the water stress period finished and all the trees were fully irrigated gs and pn gradually increased reaching similar values to those of the control trees after one month fig 4 3 3 canopy temperature and thermal based indices during the experimental period real time canopy temperature tc revealed widely varying daily values with lower values recorded during night periods always 10 c in both cropping systems and irrigation treatments and higher during light hours the maximum tc values were 44 5 and 45 7 c in the control trees grown in open field and shaded conditions respectively and up to 48 c in both stress treatments data not shown fig 5 shows tc and ambient conditions ta and vpd for the days when ψstem and leaf gas exchange were measured the daily dynamics of vpd and ta values revealed higher values in the atmosphere surrounding the lime trees grown in shade screen than in open field conditions during the daytime nevertheless during the night the opposite was noted fig 5a it was clear that for both irrigation treatments and cropping systems the night time tc values remained above 14 c during the stress period and decreased to 10 c during the recovery period maximum daily tc values were observed at midday around 12 00 14 00 gmt 2 coinciding with the highest daily vpd and ta values fig 5a the greatest differences between irrigation treatments and cropping systems were detected at this time of the day with tc being higher in lime trees grown in shaded fig 5c than in open field conditions fig 5b for instance on doy 179 and 200 tc exceeded 40 c in open field lime trees while the same occurred on four days in shaded conditions daylight tc was higher in stressed than in control trees especially at midday when differences were up to 6 and 5 c in open field fig 5b and shaded conditions fig 5c respectively this was more evident from doy 173 and 189 onwards in open field and shaded conditions respectively tc in stressed trees remained above control values during the greatest part of the day and night hours in open field trees however in shaded conditions stressed trees showed similar or even lower values of tc than control trees during night hours during the recovery period tc as well as ta and vpd values were lower than during the stress period and the tc of the stress treatments recovered to reach similar values to those of the control at the end of the experimental period doy 298 to normalize the absolute value of tc respect to ta several thermal based indices tc ta cwsi cti and tc ta were calculated throughout the experimental period stress and recovery in the different irrigation treatments and cropping systems studied the canopy to air temperature difference tc ta varied on a diurnal basis fig 6 but to a lesser extent than tc fig 5b c canopy temperature remained below ta during most of the daylight hours with negative tc ta values corresponding to night periods independently of the cropping systems the highest tc ta values were observed in stressed trees fig 6c e furthermore higher values of this thermal index were recorded in open field fig 6b c than in shaded conditions fig 6d e again independently of the irrigation treatment average 15 min values of tc ta during the experimental period was negative in control trees 0 2 c in both cropping systems and positive in stressed trees 0 6 and 0 2 c in open air and shaded conditions respectively it can also be observed in fig 6 that daily maximum tc ta in the control trees varied around average value of 4 3 and 2 6 c in open field and shaded conditions respectively while they were 6 3 and 4 4 c in the stress treatments in open field and shaded conditions respectively as outlined in fig 6b c and d f respectively moreover wider fluctuations in daily tc ta values were noted in stressed trees fig 6c e than in controls trees fig 6b d the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated using eq 1 for each cropping system with the lower limit taken from the tc ta vs vpd linear relation named nwsb of well irrigated lime trees in the analysis of all 15 min data we noted a wide hysteresis with higher tc ta in the morning denoting warming and lower in the afternoon denoting cooling considering only daylight values differences remained depending on the time interval positive slopes of the linear regression values of 0 22 and 0 10 for open field and shaded conditions respectively were found around midday 12 00 14 00 gtm 2 the nwsb was then selected from the best regression which corresponded to the time interval 09 00 10 00 gmt 2 for open field trees tc ta 0 90 vpd 1 52 r2 0 77 while the corresponding time interval selected for shaded trees was 10 00 12 00 h gmt 2 tc ta 0 83 vpd 0 85 r2 0 92 the covariance analysis revealed no significant differences among the slopes and so one regression was considered for the two cropping systems tc ta 1 05 vpd 1 57 r2 0 91 mse 0 13 in an attempt to obtain the lower limit the tc ta vs vpd regressions for stressed lime trees were drawn using data from doy 200 onwards last part of the stress period they revealed quasi parallel lines to the vpd axis with very low slopes for both cropping systems data not shown the intercept on the tc ta axis varied during the day as can be observed in fig 7 increasing from the beginning of daylight hours and reaching maximum values around midday at this time of the day higher values were observed in open field than in shaded trees 6 and 4 c respectively showing a delay of about 2 h in the case of shaded trees fig 7 thus the upper limit was selected for the same time interval as that for which the lower limit was calculated 09 00 10 00 gmt 2 for open field 1 51 c and 10 00 12 00 h gmt 2 for shaded conditions 1 53 c note that these values were similar to that of the intercept for the above described nwsb 1 57 c the cwsi values were higher in open field fig 8a than in shaded conditions fig 8b in control treatment while no significant differences were observed between stressed treatments in open field conditions the differences between stress and control treatment were apparent after one month of stress with maximum cwsi values observed by mid july doy 200 in both irrigation treatments reaching values around 1 in stressed lime trees after this time the cwsi of stressed trees remained 0 1 higher than in the control trees but with no significant differences during most of the irrigation withholding period fig 8a nevertheless in shaded conditions the differences between both irrigation treatments were minimal during the early stress period and gradually increased being statistically significant higher as stress accumulated with maximum cwsi values close to 1 being reached at the end of the stress period fig 8b in the recovery period the cwsi decreased to 0 3 in both cropping systems fig 8a b values even lower than their respective control treatments the integration of tc ta values on a daylight time basis suggested a new thermal based index tc ta from the beginning of the experiment tc ta gradually increased in all cropping systems and irrigation treatments fig 9a at the end of the experimental period the fully irrigated trees showed values of 2057 and 933 c in open field and shaded conditions respectively nevertheless the stressed plants showed 2119 and 1105 c greater than their control in open field and shaded conditions respectively the differences between control and stress treatment were evident by the end of june doy 179 in open field trees and several days later in shaded trees at the end of the experimental period stressed shaded lime trees showed similar values to those of the control trees in open field condition fig 9a furthermore tc ta values were normalized by dividing by the difference between maximum and minimum daily value eq 2 at the beginning of the experiment doy 158 the trees cultivated inside the shade screen house showed lower cti values 0 6 and 1 1 to control and stress treatments respectively than the trees cultivated in open field conditions 2 0 and 1 5 to control and stress treatments respectively differences between control and stress treatments occurred earlier and reached higher values in open field than in shaded conditions fig 9b at the end of the recovery period similar values of cti were noted in control and stress trees grown in shaded conditions 0 6 and 0 7 respectively nevertheless slightly different values were observed in control and stress trees cultivated in open field conditions 1 9 and 2 7 respectively for both cropping systems a linear regression model was made between the punctual measurements of ψstem and leaf gas exchange and the continuous measurements of thermal indexes and θv only those between ψstem and tc ta are presented as they are the most relevant fig 10 values of tc ta were averaged for the time period when the stem water potential was measured around solar noon 12 00 14 00 gmt 2 which coincided with maximum daily evaporative demand conditions the relationship between tc ta and ψstem showed good correlation regardless of the cropping system with r2 fits of 0 57 and 0 55 in open field and shaded conditions respectively also of note were the similar negative slopes 1 in both cropping systems this linear correlation between both plant water status indicators although empirical can be used as a guide for irrigation management therefore if the objective is to maintain the lime trees without stress the ψstem should be 1 0 mpa and by solving this equation fig 10 tc ta would correspond to 2 4 or 0 8 c for open field and shaded lime trees respectively for a moderate water deficit condition ψstem 1 5 mpa the tc ta would correspond to 2 9 or 1 3 c while for severe water stress conditions ψstem 2 0 mpa the tc ta would be 3 4 or 1 83 c for open field and shaded lime trees respectively 4 discussion during the experimental period the environmental conditions were characteristic of mediterranean climates with high et0 and vpd values in the summer months coinciding with the stress period doy 158 267 and low values during autumn in the recovery period doy 267 298 the microclimate surrounding lime trees differed slightly in both cropping systems par radiation being lower under shade screen than in open field fig 3a this would be a consequence of the screening increasing light scattering nissim levi et al 2008 leading to a decrease in the incoming radiation ombódi et al 2015 this reduction depends amongst other factors on the screen type colour and percentage of shading mditshwa et al 2019 in orange and in avocado trees incesu et al 2016 and tinyane et al 2018 respectively observed a reduction of par radiation ranging from 9 to 46 depending of colour and shading in our study reductions in par were seasonal in character pronounced reductions coinciding with summer and the lower reductions with autumn as was found by zhou et al 2018 and mira garcía et al 2020 in shaded citrus trees this seasonal character could be justified by a change in the solar inclination over the year the reduction in incoming par radiation observed under netting smoothed the et0 values an observation lent weight by jagadale et al 2018 who observed reductions in the et0 of 12 24 depending on the colour of the shading screen in addition the smoother values of et0 might have been the consequence of reduced wind speed observed in this cropping system similarly blakey et al 2016 and wachsmann et al 2014 observed a reduction in wind speed of up to 85 90 in avocado and mandarin trees respectively grown under screening conditions the evaluation of the ability of discrete ψstem gs and pn and continuous plant tc and soil θv water status indicators to detect water stress revealed ψstem as a reliable water status indicator greatly affected by the soil water content and in a lesser extent by shading conditions the well irrigated lime trees showed an optimal soil water status in both cropping systems as revealed by the high θv values in the active root zone which varied around field capacity values fig 3c the observed fluctuations in θv would have been due to soil wetting drying cycles corresponding to irrigation events and the periods between them in the experimental period of our study automated irrigation was carried out daily or every other day as is normal for drip irrigation scheduling for citrus during the summer months in mediterranean climates in addition midday ψstem values in control lime trees pointed to the absence of a water stress situation with values 1 mpa which is indicative of an optimal water status for citrus species mentioned in several studies ballester et al 2014 conesa et al 2018 pagán et al 2012 and there was no clear influence of the cropping system on ψstem dynamics fig 3b withholding irrigation water decreased the soil water status fig 3c from the beginning of water stress the plant water status gradually fell in stressed lime trees as θv values decreased up to ψstem values fig 3b similar to that found in non irrigated grapefruit trees pérez pérez et al 2009 but lower than the levels measured in deficit irrigated sweet orange trees gasque et al 2016 when the water stress was moderate the stress was affected by the cropping system the decrease soil and plant water status being earlier and more rapid in open field than in shaded conditions nevertheless when the water stress was severe the decrease of soil and plant water status was similar for both cropping systems proof of this is that stressed lime trees reached a ψstem value of about 2 0 mpa one month after beginning to withhold irrigation in open field conditions and 15 days later in shaded conditions fig 3b when this ψstem value was reached the transition from a relatively rapid reduction in the soil water content slowed down in both stress treatments fig 3c known as the breaking point this could be used as an indicator of the beginning of severe water stress in lime trees allowing critical irrigation monitoring it must be pointed out that when the experiment started shaded and open field had different swc values as a consequence of the different microclimatic conditions in the two cropping systems fig 3a and 5a as a result the breaking point date delayed in shaded compared with open field conditions which is consistent with the root water uptake rate of both cropping conditions similarly the change in the day time reductions of θv from a sharp decrease to a slower rate girona et al 2002 has been suggested as representing the beginning of stress in prunus abrisqueta et al 2012 and vegetable crops thompson et al 2007 in the recovery period when stressed trees were re irrigated ψstem gradually recovered to reach control values indicating that plant water status is a true reflection of soil water availability although also dependent on meteorological conditions suter et al 2019 withholding irrigation for 110 days in our study induced statistically lower average ψstem values in stressed lime trees grown in open field 1 96 mpa than in shaded 1 78 mpa conditions however similar ψstem values 3 0 mpa were observed in both cropping systems at the end of the stress period fig 3b which is considered a severe water stress situation for perennial fruit trees hsiao 1990 the leaf gas exchange in control lime trees showed greater day to day variability fig 4 but with the characteristic values of well watered trees mira garcía et al 2021 these fluctuations were greater than those observed in θv and ψstem fig 3b c indicating that apart from soil water status the leaf gas exchange was influenced by other factors including ambient conditions and changes in the internal aba concentration rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 the high gs and pn values observed coincided with the period of active lime fruit growth as was observed in grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2014 and lemon garcía orellana et al 2013 trees this fact along with the decreasing trend in leaf gas exchange during the recovery period note that harvest occurred by mid august first pick and end of september second pick was attributed to the feedback effect of the actively growing fruits on leaf photosynthesis ben mimoun et al 1996 stomatal aperture in fully irrigated trees was lower in open field than in shaded conditions fig 4a perhaps because the milder et0 fig 3a and par conditions under shading favoured stomatal aperture and photosynthetic capacity as observed in shaded citrus sp alarcón et al 2006 mira garcía et al 2021 likewise de freitas et al 2013 observed a 56 increase in gs and bastías et al 2012 a 28 increase in pn in apple trees grown under black net 50 shading and a blue photo selective net respectively during the early stages of the water stress period the lime trees acted normally in terms of leaf gas exchange nevertheless when the plant water stress was moderate stomatal closure was favoured in open field conditions fig 4a as stress progressed and ψstem continued to decrease fig 3b stomatal conductance fig 4a and net photosynthesis fig 4b in both cropping systems reached values similar to those noted in citrus sp subjected to water deficits garcía orellana et al 2007 pérez pérez et al 2009 this indicates that when the soil water content was very low shade screening was not sufficient to mitigate the negative effect of water stress on its own as lopez et al 2018 suggested moreover an asynchrony effect between gs and pn was detected in the response to water stress pn decreasing fig 4b later than gs in the stressed lime trees fig 4a this suggests that stomatal closure prevents the outflow of water vapour to a greater extent than the inflow of co2 since a decrease in transpiration due to stomatal closure causes the canopy temperature tc to increase as the so called evaporative cooling decreases tc has long been recognized as an indicator of the plant water status gates 1964 the development of infra red sensors that measure infra red radiation which can determine surface temperature without touching it has increased its use as an indicator of the degree of plant water stress related to water availability costa et al 2013 jones 2004 in all the lime trees tc values varied greatly following marked circadian rhythms with high values during midday hours also higher in stressed than in control trees and low at night fig 5 such fluctuations in tc could be due to the wide variations of gs in the diurnal cycle as observed by sánchez blanco et al 1990 who found that gs values in field grown lemon trees changed every half hour the evaluation of the response of different thermal indexes tc ta cwsi cti and σtc ta to irrigation and shade screen allowed to identify the best performing thermal based index the results showed that the daily course of tc ta also varied but to a lesser extent than tc the tc ta dynamics throughout the experimental period could be likened to the heartbeat of lime tree water status with higher values monitored in stressed than in control trees fig 6 negative tc ta values indicate that an evaporative cooling process is occurring i e heat is dissipated by the water lost from the stomata via transpiration but as soon as stomata close the canopy temperature raise several degrees above the air temperature araus et al 2008 jones et al 2002 lima et al 2016 it is clear that there were no differences in tc ta values between control and stress treatments in the absence of solar heating from approx 20 00 h to 7 00 h the next morning in spite of the higher tc values in the lime trees grown under shade screening fig 5b c the tc ta values were lower in shaded conditions than in open field trees fig 6 since the ta was higher under screen fig 5a as has been observed in other studies alaphilippe et al 2016 kim et al 2022 this anti intuitive situation denoted that shaded trees were better paired with the environmental conditions they were in which also led to lower tc ta values for stressed trees compared with the stressed open field trees fig 6 the cwsi can be calculated by empirical or theoretical methods even though the theoretical method based on the energy balance jackson 1982 is more precise its complexity in terms of data collection and calculation has meant that the empirical method which is based on equations to determine the lower and upper limits of canopy temperature has tended to be favoured the lower limit is derived from the linear equation between the vpd and tc ta in well watered conditions while the upper limit is considered a constant value from non transpiring canopies idso et al 1981 many authors have used a constant as the upper limit assuming that canopy is always above air temperature when transpiration ceases for example ta 4 c in grapefruit trees romero trigueros et al 2019 or ta 5 c in olive trees agam et al 2013 also the upper limit could be assumed from the intercept of the nwsb corrected for ta gonzález dugo et al 2014 or from the maximum measured tc ta value irmak et al 2000 yang et al 2021 in our study the lower limit was derived from the linear equation between the vpd and tc ta in well watered lime trees although it resulted highly time dependent and the maximum tc ta difference measured under severe water stress conditions was fixed as the upper limit fig 7 which also coincided with that value assumed by the intercept of the nwsb confirming the versatility of both methods we found that cwsi calculations were too empirical and too time interval dependant with wide day to day variations fig 8 other proposed thermal indices based on absolute tc ta values were used as a reliable way to monitor real time plant water status σtc ta fig 9a and cti fig 9b cti compared to cwsi better discriminated differences between irrigation treatments and cropping conditions in our study the cropping system and irrigation treatment had a clear effect on both thermal based indices in such a way that higher values of σtc ta and cti were observed in open field than in shaded conditions and in stressed than control trees along the experimental period the highest values corresponding to stressed open field trees fig 9 this indicates that in this cropping system open field the meteorological conditions were less favourable inducing a poorer plant thermal water status mira garcía et al 2020 at the same time higher values of both thermal indices were observed in stressed trees than in control trees of both cropping systems confirming that restrictions in the soil water availability induce stomatal closure blanco et al 2019 de la rosa et al 2014 thus increasing the values of the thermal indices thermal point or thermal imagery data relationships with ψstem and gs have been suggested for irrigation scheduling in citrus and fruit trees egea et al 2017 gonzález dugo et al 2014 romero trigueros et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however apart from that of sepaskhah and kashefipour 1994 on sweet lime trees in iran to our knowledge no studies have been carried out in lime trees in our study the correlation between tc ta and ψstem to determine threshold thermal based values for irrigation scheduling differed in open field and shaded conditions nevertheless a similar linear correlation slope 1 was noted in the trees cultivated under screening and open field conditions but with a different intercept fig 10 similar lineal adjustment between tc ta and ψstem was found by ballester et al 2013a in clementina de nules cultivated in open field conditions the midday tc ta threshold values proposed for triggering drip irrigation in lime trees grown in semi arid conditions were 2 4 or 0 8 c for open field and shaded conditions respectively but only when irrigation water availability is sufficient to fulfil plant water requirements under deficit irrigation conditions the proposed values were 2 9 or 1 3 c for moderate water deficits ψstem 1 5 mpa and 3 4 or 1 83 c for severe water deficits ψstem 2 mpa for open field and shaded lime trees respectively similarly tormann 1986 proposed two tc ta threshold values for irrigation management of nectarine trees based on two levels of plant water status ψstem values well irrigated and moderately stressed according with our findings shading conditions should be taken into account when seeking threshold values for irrigation management tailoring guidelines to the needs of sustainable agriculture the statistically higher ψstem and leaf gas exchange values and lower canopy to air temperature differences recorded in shaded than in open field lime trees revealed that the shade screening allowed better soil plant water status conditions furthermore it can be assumed that water consumption by trees was lower since the irrigation applied was the same in both crop conditions consequently shade netting conditions allowed a window of opportunity of 12 days to postpone a water deficit situation with respect to open field conditions this could be the result of the improved water use efficiency induced by shade screening as has been noted in several citrus sp including mandarin wachsmann et al 2014 orange medina et al 2002 lemon alarcón et al 2006 nicolás et al 2008 and grapefruit jifon and syvertsen 2003 trees early signs of a water deficit situation are desired in this sense the soil water content sensor wrapped around by the plant roots thus behaving rather like a physiological sensor anticipated the lime tree water status situation respect to thermal based indices nonetheless both monitoring systems showed close agreement as regards the water deficit level throughout the experiment 5 conclusion this study has revealed that the response of lime trees to soil water deficits differed in the two cropping systems studied open field and shaded and that the ability to detect water stress also differed for the soil plant water status indicators studied the main conclusions can be summarised as i precise estimates of the soil plant atmosphere components are needed to improve irrigation management ii ψstem is a reliable tool for assessing lime tree water status and along with the breaking point of θv are useful for irrigation monitoring iii the thermal based indices serve as an alternative to other classical discrete physiological measurements for remotely monitoring lime tree water status while the daily tc ta dynamics reflects the heartbeat of lime trees iv soil water content sensors anticipate water stress detection better than thermal based sensors v the higher ψstem gs pn and lower tc ta values observed in shaded than in open field lime trees reveals that shading allows a better soil plant water status and lowers water consumption thus delaying plant water stress vi the cropping system must be considered to propose tc ta threshold values for lime tree drip irrigation management funding this study was supported by the spanish state research agency

9340,most lime trees are cultivated under open field conditions however in the mediterranean area some growers use shade screen to protect their orchards against abiotic and biotic stresses inducing changes in the plant s surrounding microclimate that could affect its water status this field experiment focuses on the effect of shade screen high density polyethylene white net with 76 light transmission and irrigation on plant and soil water status of bearss lime trees two irrigation treatments were applied during the summer autumn to open field and shaded lime trees irrigated control and non irrigated stress volumetric soil water content θv air temperature ta and canopy temperature tc were real time monitored and several derived thermal indices were calculated stem water potential ψstem and leaf gas exchange net photosynthesis pn and stomatal conductance gs were measured on representative days withholding irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant water status θv decreased from the outset in the non irrigated treatments showing breaking point connecting the rapid and the slower soil drying processes significant differences in ψstem and gs values were observed between controls and stressed trees 15 days after stress initiation during early stages of water stress lime trees cultivated in open field showed lower values of soil and plant water status than those grown in shaded conditions however at the end of stress period similar values were noted for both cropping systems pointing to severe water deficit tc and tc ta values reflected the current lime tree water status the soil water content sensors anticipated the plant water stress situation respect to thermal ones the higher θv ψstem gs pn and tc values registered in shaded lime trees revealed that shading allowed better soil plant water status and a 12 day window of opportunity to respond to the imposed soil water deficits threshold thermal based values are proposed for precise irrigation management of lime trees in open field and shaded conditions keywords canopy thermal indices citrus latifolia tan leaf water relations shade screen soil water content stem water potential 1 introduction lime tree are gaining in importance as an agricultural crop although native to south central china brazil is nowadays the main lime producer followed by mexico iran egypt and colombia cirad 2021 however recently its cultivation has extended to the mediterranean area since it is well adapted to semiarid conditions due to climatic change ipcc 2021 the warmer climate may make this area even more beneficial for lime production although the shortage of water means adopting more efficient water management and cultivation practices that promote water saving monitoring the parameters of the soil plant atmosphere system is decisive for evaluating the plant responses to irrigation regimes and crop cropping system allowing the provided water to be adjusted to the plant s water requirements mira garcía et al 2020 soil water status was assessed by soil water content θv measurements traditionally by gravimetric methods which are destructive time consuming and not repeatable nowadays other indirect methods based on the physical and chemical soil properties like time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance and impedance are gaining importance hardie 2020 vera et al 2021 the plant itself has long been recognized as the best indicator of its water status which can be assessed by direct measurements of leaf ψleaf or stem water potentials ψstem or indirectly by reference to leaf gas exchange parameters stomatal conductance gs net photosynthesis pn traditionally considered as good plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling purposes cifre et al 2005 garcía orellana et al 2013 hernandez santana et al 2019 mirás avalos et al 2016 however the draw back of the manual measurements is that they are laborious destructive and time consuming ballester et al 2013b garcía tejero et al 2011 furthermore the progress made in telemetry have allowed real time monitoring of other indirect plant based water status indicators such as trunk diameter shrinkage sap flow or leaf turgor conejero et al 2011 fernández 2017 rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 also canopy temperature tc long recognized as an indicator of plant water status costa et al 2013 gates 1964 jones 2004 can be in situ or remotely measured by infra red thermometry or thermal imaging using infra red radiometer sensors or thermal cameras thus the measurement of tc is a reliable rapid and non destructive technique for monitoring plant water status blaya ros et al 2020 leinonen et al 2006 romero trigueros et al 2019 it is well known that tc is influenced by atmospheric conditions such as vapour pressure deficit and radiation level among others zhang et al 2017 to attenuate the effect of these environmental variables on the absolute values of tc different thermal indices have been proposed the difference between canopy and air temperature tc ta and the crop water stress index cwsi are the most performing idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 also regression models have been suggested to predict leaf water potential based on tc or cwsi values in prunus tormann 1986 wang and gartung 2010 and citrus cohen et al 2005 in addition shade screen protect crops against abiotic stresses such as adverse weather conditions or biotic stresses such as pests and diseases mditshwa et al 2019 this cropping system reduces the incoming radiation garcía sánchez et al 2015 affecting the microclimate surrounding the plants and hence their physiological behaviour manja and aoun 2019 in this sense incesu et al 2016 observed an increase in the photosynthesis rate in lane late oranges cultivated under black netting while jifon and syvertsen 2003 observed lower tc values in red ruby grapefruit trees under aluminized screens whereas shaded avocado trees showed increased tc with respect to trees in open field conditions blakey et al 2016 this study is aimed to assess plant soil water status and thermal response of young lime trees to shading and soil water deficits for this purpose the following objectives were proposed i to evaluate the ability of discrete ψstem gs and pn and continuous plant tc and soil θv water status indicators to detect water stress ii to identify the best performing thermal based indices and iii to determine threshold thermal based values for irrigation management in semi arid conditions to do this it was necessary to measure plant soil water status and thermal based indices under well watered and water deficit conditions in shaded and non shaded trees we tested the hypothesis that microclimate caused by shade screen could affect these parameters in shaded vs non shaded lime trees this information will be relevant in a future to manage the irrigation in a higher efficient way 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and plant material the experiment was conducted during spring summer autumn of 2021 from doy day of year 152 304 at the cebas csic experimental field station located in santomera

as for control treatment each cropping system consisted of a sub plot of 60 lime trees the irrigation treatments were distributed in shaded and open field conditions in a completely randomised design with four replications each replication consisting of one row of six trees with a total of 24 trees per irrigation treatment one tree from each replication served for measurements and the rest of the plot were considered as borders 2 3 measurements environmental data in both open field and shaded conditions were monitored by two automatic weather stations located in the both sub plots values of

potential rate and tc ta ul is the upper limit which corresponds to a canopy where transpiration has ceased the linear relationship between tc ta and vpd for well irrigated trees control treatment was used to establish the nwsb for each cropping condition tc ta ll was calculated by solving the nwsb equation for the actual vpd the tc ta ul was a fixed value taken from the maximum tc ta value

significance of the relationships between the measured indicators 3 results 3 1 soil plant atmosphere water status during the experimental period the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 varied greatly from day to day with higher values registered in open field than in shaded conditions fig 3a the maximum daily et0 values were noted in mid june 7 32 mm d 1 and the minimum at the end of october 0 54 mm d 1 in open field conditions shaded condition reduced et0 by an average of 28 varying from the maximum of 4 30 to the minimum of 0 59 mm d 1 in june and october respectively fig 3a the discrete measurements of plant water status on representative days during the experimental period showed values of stem water potential ψstem ranging from 0 59 to 1 19 mpa in control trees of both cropping systems fig 3b in turn the real time soil water content θv on the same control trees showed in the active root zone 0 2 0 6 m mean similar values in open field 33 01 and in shaded conditions 32 22 fig 3c however higher θv at 0 8 m was observed in shaded conditions as irrigation episodes were not observed to reach this depth in open field conditions or even was showed lower θv values data not shown withholding irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant water status parameters fig 3b c ψstem values were statistically lower in stressed than in control trees from the beginning of the stress in both cropping systems fig 3b in the early stages of water stress lower values of ψstem were noted in open field than in shaded conditions fig 3b nevertheless as the stress progressed ψstem continued to decrease in both cropping systems with not statistically significant differences between non irrigated treatments sopen field and sshaded fig 3b an earlier and more abrupt decrease in θv was observed in non irrigated open field lime trees compared with shaded trees the θv values were lower in stressed open field lime trees up to mid july after which the decrease was similar in both cropping systems fig 3c at the end of the stress period doy 267 minimum values were recorded for both water status indicators with statistically similar values in open field θv 17 5 and ψstem 2 98 mpa and in shaded θv 17 6 and ψstem 3 1 mpa fig 3b c conditions in addition two phases were detected in the soil drying curve of stressed lime trees as drawn in fig 3c a first sharp reduction in θv values was observed phase i followed by a slower rate of reduction phase ii phase i corresponded to doy 173 189 in the case of open field conditions while it lasted from doy 173 201 in shaded conditions during this phase θv decreased by 30 in both cropping systems in phase ii which lasted from the end of phase i to the end of stress period doy 189 259 and doy 201 259 in open field and shaded conditions respectively θv decreased at a slower rate than during phase i the breaking point of these two phases occurred earlier in open field than in shaded conditions but at a similar θv value 20 in both cropping systems fig 3c this intersection point of θv matched a similar value of ψstem 2 mpa which was reached earlier in open field than in shaded lime trees fig 3b during the recovery period when the water restrictions ended and the stressed trees were irrigated the same as control trees from doy 259 298 a gradual increase in both θv and ψstem values was observed similar values of θv were noted in stressed and control trees 15 days after re irrigation fig 3c whereas ψstem recovered control values after one month in both cropping systems fig 3b 3 2 leaf gas exchange leaf gas exchange measurement in well irrigated trees showed high values of stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn fig 4 shade screen reduced the incident photosynthetically active radiation par by 22 47 compared with the open field conditions with the maximum reduction observed in july august corresponding to the months of highest evaporative demanding data not shown a similar seasonally fluctuating trend was noted in gs and pn values in the control trees in both cropping systems nevertheless average values were significantly higher in shaded than in open field conditions fig 4 especially apparent for gs with a seasonal value of 105 5 and 122 3 mmol m 2 s 1 in open field and shaded control trees respectively however similar average values of pn 11 1 and 10 6 µmol m 2 s 1 were noted in open field and shaded trees respectively when the water stress was applied the leaf gas exchange parameters gradually fell in both cropping systems fig 4 values of gs in the control and stressed treatments statistically differed when irrigation began to be withheld in both cropping systems fig 4a in the early stages of water stress a greater decrease in gs and pn was noted in the limes trees cultivated in open field conditions however it should be noticed that pn values in stressed trees cultivated in shaded conditions remained similar to control trees values for up to 40 days after irrigation was withheld fig 4b average gs values during the stress period were significantly lower in stressed lime trees grown in open field than in shaded conditions 54 5 and 70 3 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively in addition the same trend was observed in the case of pn with values of 6 1 and 8 0 µmol m 2 s 1 for the trees cultivated in open field and under shade screen respectively at the end of the stress period leaf gas exchange values were low in the stressed lime trees with no significant differences between cropping systems gs 23 mmol m 2 s 1 and pn 3 2 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 when the water stress period finished and all the trees were fully irrigated gs and pn gradually increased reaching similar values to those of the control trees after one month fig 4 3 3 canopy temperature and thermal based indices during the experimental period real time canopy temperature tc revealed widely varying daily values with lower values recorded during night periods always 10 c in both cropping systems and irrigation treatments and higher during light hours the maximum tc values were 44 5 and 45 7 c in the control trees grown in open field and shaded conditions respectively and up to 48 c in both stress treatments data not shown fig 5 shows tc and ambient conditions ta and vpd for the days when ψstem and leaf gas exchange were measured the daily dynamics of vpd and ta values revealed higher values in the atmosphere surrounding the lime trees grown in shade screen than in open field conditions during the daytime nevertheless during the night the opposite was noted fig 5a it was clear that for both irrigation treatments and cropping systems the night time tc values remained above 14 c during the stress period and decreased to 10 c during the recovery period maximum daily tc values were observed at midday around 12 00 14 00 gmt 2 coinciding with the highest daily vpd and ta values fig 5a the greatest differences between irrigation treatments and cropping systems were detected at this time of the day with tc being higher in lime trees grown in shaded fig 5c than in open field conditions fig 5b for instance on doy 179 and 200 tc exceeded 40 c in open field lime trees while the same occurred on four days in shaded conditions daylight tc was higher in stressed than in control trees especially at midday when differences were up to 6 and 5 c in open field fig 5b and shaded conditions fig 5c respectively this was more evident from doy 173 and 189 onwards in open field and shaded conditions respectively tc in stressed trees remained above control values during the greatest part of the day and night hours in open field trees however in shaded conditions stressed trees showed similar or even lower values of tc than control trees during night hours during the recovery period tc as well as ta and vpd values were lower than during the stress period and the tc of the stress treatments recovered to reach similar values to those of the control at the end of the experimental period doy 298 to normalize the absolute value of tc respect to ta several thermal based indices tc ta cwsi cti and tc ta were calculated throughout the experimental period stress and recovery in the different irrigation treatments and cropping systems studied the canopy to air temperature difference tc ta varied on a diurnal basis fig 6 but to a lesser extent than tc fig 5b c canopy temperature remained below ta during most of the daylight hours with negative tc ta values corresponding to night periods independently of the cropping systems the highest tc ta values were observed in stressed trees fig 6c e furthermore higher values of this thermal index were recorded in open field fig 6b c than in shaded conditions fig 6d e again independently of the irrigation treatment average 15 min values of tc ta during the experimental period was negative in control trees 0 2 c in both cropping systems and positive in stressed trees 0 6 and 0 2 c in open air and shaded conditions respectively it can also be observed in fig 6 that daily maximum tc ta in the control trees varied around average value of 4 3 and 2 6 c in open field and shaded conditions respectively while they were 6 3 and 4 4 c in the stress treatments in open field and shaded conditions respectively as outlined in fig 6b c and d f respectively moreover wider fluctuations in daily tc ta values were noted in stressed trees fig 6c e than in controls trees fig 6b d the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated using eq 1 for each cropping system with the lower limit taken from the tc ta vs vpd linear relation named nwsb of well irrigated lime trees in the analysis of all 15 min data we noted a wide hysteresis with higher tc ta in the morning denoting warming and lower in the afternoon denoting cooling considering only daylight values differences remained depending on the time interval positive slopes of the linear regression values of 0 22 and 0 10 for open field and shaded conditions respectively were found around midday 12 00 14 00 gtm 2 the nwsb was then selected from the best regression which corresponded to the time interval 09 00 10 00 gmt 2 for open field trees tc ta 0 90 vpd 1 52 r2 0 77 while the corresponding time interval selected for shaded trees was 10 00 12 00 h gmt 2 tc ta 0 83 vpd 0 85 r2 0 92 the covariance analysis revealed no significant differences among the slopes and so one regression was considered for the two cropping systems tc ta 1 05 vpd 1 57 r2 0 91 mse 0 13 in an attempt to obtain the lower limit the tc ta vs vpd regressions for stressed lime trees were drawn using data from doy 200 onwards last part of the stress period they revealed quasi parallel lines to the vpd axis with very low slopes for both cropping systems data not shown the intercept on the tc ta axis varied during the day as can be observed in fig 7 increasing from the beginning of daylight hours and reaching maximum values around midday at this time of the day higher values were observed in open field than in shaded trees 6 and 4 c respectively showing a delay of about 2 h in the case of shaded trees fig 7 thus the upper limit was selected for the same time interval as that for which the lower limit was calculated 09 00 10 00 gmt 2 for open field 1 51 c and 10 00 12 00 h gmt 2 for shaded conditions 1 53 c note that these values were similar to that of the intercept for the above described nwsb 1 57 c the cwsi values were higher in open field fig 8a than in shaded conditions fig 8b in control treatment while no significant differences were observed between stressed treatments in open field conditions the differences between stress and control treatment were apparent after one month of stress with maximum cwsi values observed by mid july doy 200 in both irrigation treatments reaching values around 1 in stressed lime trees after this time the cwsi of stressed trees remained 0 1 higher than in the control trees but with no significant differences during most of the irrigation withholding period fig 8a nevertheless in shaded conditions the differences between both irrigation treatments were minimal during the early stress period and gradually increased being statistically significant higher as stress accumulated with maximum cwsi values close to 1 being reached at the end of the stress period fig 8b in the recovery period the cwsi decreased to 0 3 in both cropping systems fig 8a b values even lower than their respective control treatments the integration of tc ta values on a daylight time basis suggested a new thermal based index tc ta from the beginning of the experiment tc ta gradually increased in all cropping systems and irrigation treatments fig 9a at the end of the experimental period the fully irrigated trees showed values of 2057 and 933 c in open field and shaded conditions respectively nevertheless the stressed plants showed 2119 and 1105 c greater than their control in open field and shaded conditions respectively the differences between control and stress treatment were evident by the end of june doy 179 in open field trees and several days later in shaded trees at the end of the experimental period stressed shaded lime trees showed similar values to those of the control trees in open field condition fig 9a furthermore tc ta values were normalized by dividing by the difference between maximum and minimum daily value eq 2 at the beginning of the experiment doy 158 the trees cultivated inside the shade screen house showed lower cti values 0 6 and 1 1 to control and stress treatments respectively than the trees cultivated in open field conditions 2 0 and 1 5 to control and stress treatments respectively differences between control and stress treatments occurred earlier and reached higher values in open field than in shaded conditions fig 9b at the end of the recovery period similar values of cti were noted in control and stress trees grown in shaded conditions 0 6 and 0 7 respectively nevertheless slightly different values were observed in control and stress trees cultivated in open field conditions 1 9 and 2 7 respectively for both cropping systems a linear regression model was made between the punctual measurements of ψstem and leaf gas exchange and the continuous measurements of thermal indexes and θv only those between ψstem and tc ta are presented as they are the most relevant fig 10 values of tc ta were averaged for the time period when the stem water potential was measured around solar noon 12 00 14 00 gmt 2 which coincided with maximum daily evaporative demand conditions the relationship between tc ta and ψstem showed good correlation regardless of the cropping system with r2 fits of 0 57 and 0 55 in open field and shaded conditions respectively also of note were the similar negative slopes 1 in both cropping systems this linear correlation between both plant water status indicators although empirical can be used as a guide for irrigation management therefore if the objective is to maintain the lime trees without stress the ψstem should be 1 0 mpa and by solving this equation fig 10 tc ta would correspond to 2 4 or 0 8 c for open field and shaded lime trees respectively for a moderate water deficit condition ψstem 1 5 mpa the tc ta would correspond to 2 9 or 1 3 c while for severe water stress conditions ψstem 2 0 mpa the tc ta would be 3 4 or 1 83 c for open field and shaded lime trees respectively 4 discussion during the experimental period the environmental conditions were characteristic of mediterranean climates with high et0 and vpd values in the summer months coinciding with the stress period doy 158 267 and low values during autumn in the recovery period doy 267 298 the microclimate surrounding lime trees differed slightly in both cropping systems par radiation being lower under shade screen than in open field fig 3a this would be a consequence of the screening increasing light scattering nissim levi et al 2008 leading to a decrease in the incoming radiation ombódi et al 2015 this reduction depends amongst other factors on the screen type colour and percentage of shading mditshwa et al 2019 in orange and in avocado trees incesu et al 2016 and tinyane et al 2018 respectively observed a reduction of par radiation ranging from 9 to 46 depending of colour and shading in our study reductions in par were seasonal in character pronounced reductions coinciding with summer and the lower reductions with autumn as was found by zhou et al 2018 and mira garcía et al 2020 in shaded citrus trees this seasonal character could be justified by a change in the solar inclination over the year the reduction in incoming par radiation observed under netting smoothed the et0 values an observation lent weight by jagadale et al 2018 who observed reductions in the et0 of 12 24 depending on the colour of the shading screen in addition the smoother values of et0 might have been the consequence of reduced wind speed observed in this cropping system similarly blakey et al 2016 and wachsmann et al 2014 observed a reduction in wind speed of up to 85 90 in avocado and mandarin trees respectively grown under screening conditions the evaluation of the ability of discrete ψstem gs and pn and continuous plant tc and soil θv water status indicators to detect water stress revealed ψstem as a reliable water status indicator greatly affected by the soil water content and in a lesser extent by shading conditions the well irrigated lime trees showed an optimal soil water status in both cropping systems as revealed by the high θv values in the active root zone which varied around field capacity values fig 3c the observed fluctuations in θv would have been due to soil wetting drying cycles corresponding to irrigation events and the periods between them in the experimental period of our study automated irrigation was carried out daily or every other day as is normal for drip irrigation scheduling for citrus during the summer months in mediterranean climates in addition midday ψstem values in control lime trees pointed to the absence of a water stress situation with values 1 mpa which is indicative of an optimal water status for citrus species mentioned in several studies ballester et al 2014 conesa et al 2018 pagán et al 2012 and there was no clear influence of the cropping system on ψstem dynamics fig 3b withholding irrigation water decreased the soil water status fig 3c from the beginning of water stress the plant water status gradually fell in stressed lime trees as θv values decreased up to ψstem values fig 3b similar to that found in non irrigated grapefruit trees pérez pérez et al 2009 but lower than the levels measured in deficit irrigated sweet orange trees gasque et al 2016 when the water stress was moderate the stress was affected by the cropping system the decrease soil and plant water status being earlier and more rapid in open field than in shaded conditions nevertheless when the water stress was severe the decrease of soil and plant water status was similar for both cropping systems proof of this is that stressed lime trees reached a ψstem value of about 2 0 mpa one month after beginning to withhold irrigation in open field conditions and 15 days later in shaded conditions fig 3b when this ψstem value was reached the transition from a relatively rapid reduction in the soil water content slowed down in both stress treatments fig 3c known as the breaking point this could be used as an indicator of the beginning of severe water stress in lime trees allowing critical irrigation monitoring it must be pointed out that when the experiment started shaded and open field had different swc values as a consequence of the different microclimatic conditions in the two cropping systems fig 3a and 5a as a result the breaking point date delayed in shaded compared with open field conditions which is consistent with the root water uptake rate of both cropping conditions similarly the change in the day time reductions of θv from a sharp decrease to a slower rate girona et al 2002 has been suggested as representing the beginning of stress in prunus abrisqueta et al 2012 and vegetable crops thompson et al 2007 in the recovery period when stressed trees were re irrigated ψstem gradually recovered to reach control values indicating that plant water status is a true reflection of soil water availability although also dependent on meteorological conditions suter et al 2019 withholding irrigation for 110 days in our study induced statistically lower average ψstem values in stressed lime trees grown in open field 1 96 mpa than in shaded 1 78 mpa conditions however similar ψstem values 3 0 mpa were observed in both cropping systems at the end of the stress period fig 3b which is considered a severe water stress situation for perennial fruit trees hsiao 1990 the leaf gas exchange in control lime trees showed greater day to day variability fig 4 but with the characteristic values of well watered trees mira garcía et al 2021 these fluctuations were greater than those observed in θv and ψstem fig 3b c indicating that apart from soil water status the leaf gas exchange was influenced by other factors including ambient conditions and changes in the internal aba concentration rodriguez dominguez et al 2019 the high gs and pn values observed coincided with the period of active lime fruit growth as was observed in grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2014 and lemon garcía orellana et al 2013 trees this fact along with the decreasing trend in leaf gas exchange during the recovery period note that harvest occurred by mid august first pick and end of september second pick was attributed to the feedback effect of the actively growing fruits on leaf photosynthesis ben mimoun et al 1996 stomatal aperture in fully irrigated trees was lower in open field than in shaded conditions fig 4a perhaps because the milder et0 fig 3a and par conditions under shading favoured stomatal aperture and photosynthetic capacity as observed in shaded citrus sp alarcón et al 2006 mira garcía et al 2021 likewise de freitas et al 2013 observed a 56 increase in gs and bastías et al 2012 a 28 increase in pn in apple trees grown under black net 50 shading and a blue photo selective net respectively during the early stages of the water stress period the lime trees acted normally in terms of leaf gas exchange nevertheless when the plant water stress was moderate stomatal closure was favoured in open field conditions fig 4a as stress progressed and ψstem continued to decrease fig 3b stomatal conductance fig 4a and net photosynthesis fig 4b in both cropping systems reached values similar to those noted in citrus sp subjected to water deficits garcía orellana et al 2007 pérez pérez et al 2009 this indicates that when the soil water content was very low shade screening was not sufficient to mitigate the negative effect of water stress on its own as lopez et al 2018 suggested moreover an asynchrony effect between gs and pn was detected in the response to water stress pn decreasing fig 4b later than gs in the stressed lime trees fig 4a this suggests that stomatal closure prevents the outflow of water vapour to a greater extent than the inflow of co2 since a decrease in transpiration due to stomatal closure causes the canopy temperature tc to increase as the so called evaporative cooling decreases tc has long been recognized as an indicator of the plant water status gates 1964 the development of infra red sensors that measure infra red radiation which can determine surface temperature without touching it has increased its use as an indicator of the degree of plant water stress related to water availability costa et al 2013 jones 2004 in all the lime trees tc values varied greatly following marked circadian rhythms with high values during midday hours also higher in stressed than in control trees and low at night fig 5 such fluctuations in tc could be due to the wide variations of gs in the diurnal cycle as observed by sánchez blanco et al 1990 who found that gs values in field grown lemon trees changed every half hour the evaluation of the response of different thermal indexes tc ta cwsi cti and σtc ta to irrigation and shade screen allowed to identify the best performing thermal based index the results showed that the daily course of tc ta also varied but to a lesser extent than tc the tc ta dynamics throughout the experimental period could be likened to the heartbeat of lime tree water status with higher values monitored in stressed than in control trees fig 6 negative tc ta values indicate that an evaporative cooling process is occurring i e heat is dissipated by the water lost from the stomata via transpiration but as soon as stomata close the canopy temperature raise several degrees above the air temperature araus et al 2008 jones et al 2002 lima et al 2016 it is clear that there were no differences in tc ta values between control and stress treatments in the absence of solar heating from approx 20 00 h to 7 00 h the next morning in spite of the higher tc values in the lime trees grown under shade screening fig 5b c the tc ta values were lower in shaded conditions than in open field trees fig 6 since the ta was higher under screen fig 5a as has been observed in other studies alaphilippe et al 2016 kim et al 2022 this anti intuitive situation denoted that shaded trees were better paired with the environmental conditions they were in which also led to lower tc ta values for stressed trees compared with the stressed open field trees fig 6 the cwsi can be calculated by empirical or theoretical methods even though the theoretical method based on the energy balance jackson 1982 is more precise its complexity in terms of data collection and calculation has meant that the empirical method which is based on equations to determine the lower and upper limits of canopy temperature has tended to be favoured the lower limit is derived from the linear equation between the vpd and tc ta in well watered conditions while the upper limit is considered a constant value from non transpiring canopies idso et al 1981 many authors have used a constant as the upper limit assuming that canopy is always above air temperature when transpiration ceases for example ta 4 c in grapefruit trees romero trigueros et al 2019 or ta 5 c in olive trees agam et al 2013 also the upper limit could be assumed from the intercept of the nwsb corrected for ta gonzález dugo et al 2014 or from the maximum measured tc ta value irmak et al 2000 yang et al 2021 in our study the lower limit was derived from the linear equation between the vpd and tc ta in well watered lime trees although it resulted highly time dependent and the maximum tc ta difference measured under severe water stress conditions was fixed as the upper limit fig 7 which also coincided with that value assumed by the intercept of the nwsb confirming the versatility of both methods we found that cwsi calculations were too empirical and too time interval dependant with wide day to day variations fig 8 other proposed thermal indices based on absolute tc ta values were used as a reliable way to monitor real time plant water status σtc ta fig 9a and cti fig 9b cti compared to cwsi better discriminated differences between irrigation treatments and cropping conditions in our study the cropping system and irrigation treatment had a clear effect on both thermal based indices in such a way that higher values of σtc ta and cti were observed in open field than in shaded conditions and in stressed than control trees along the experimental period the highest values corresponding to stressed open field trees fig 9 this indicates that in this cropping system open field the meteorological conditions were less favourable inducing a poorer plant thermal water status mira garcía et al 2020 at the same time higher values of both thermal indices were observed in stressed trees than in control trees of both cropping systems confirming that restrictions in the soil water availability induce stomatal closure blanco et al 2019 de la rosa et al 2014 thus increasing the values of the thermal indices thermal point or thermal imagery data relationships with ψstem and gs have been suggested for irrigation scheduling in citrus and fruit trees egea et al 2017 gonzález dugo et al 2014 romero trigueros et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however apart from that of sepaskhah and kashefipour 1994 on sweet lime trees in iran to our knowledge no studies have been carried out in lime trees in our study the correlation between tc ta and ψstem to determine threshold thermal based values for irrigation scheduling differed in open field and shaded conditions nevertheless a similar linear correlation slope 1 was noted in the trees cultivated under screening and open field conditions but with a different intercept fig 10 similar lineal adjustment between tc ta and ψstem was found by ballester et al 2013a in clementina de nules cultivated in open field conditions the midday tc ta threshold values proposed for triggering drip irrigation in lime trees grown in semi arid conditions were 2 4 or 0 8 c for open field and shaded conditions respectively but only when irrigation water availability is sufficient to fulfil plant water requirements under deficit irrigation conditions the proposed values were 2 9 or 1 3 c for moderate water deficits ψstem 1 5 mpa and 3 4 or 1 83 c for severe water deficits ψstem 2 mpa for open field and shaded lime trees respectively similarly tormann 1986 proposed two tc ta threshold values for irrigation management of nectarine trees based on two levels of plant water status ψstem values well irrigated and moderately stressed according with our findings shading conditions should be taken into account when seeking threshold values for irrigation management tailoring guidelines to the needs of sustainable agriculture the statistically higher ψstem and leaf gas exchange values and lower canopy to air temperature differences recorded in shaded than in open field lime trees revealed that the shade screening allowed better soil plant water status conditions furthermore it can be assumed that water consumption by trees was lower since the irrigation applied was the same in both crop conditions consequently shade netting conditions allowed a window of opportunity of 12 days to postpone a water deficit situation with respect to open field conditions this could be the result of the improved water use efficiency induced by shade screening as has been noted in several citrus sp including mandarin wachsmann et al 2014 orange medina et al 2002 lemon alarcón et al 2006 nicolás et al 2008 and grapefruit jifon and syvertsen 2003 trees early signs of a water deficit situation are desired in this sense the soil water content sensor wrapped around by the plant roots thus behaving rather like a physiological sensor anticipated the lime tree water status situation respect to thermal based indices nonetheless both monitoring systems showed close agreement as regards the water deficit level throughout the experiment 5 conclusion this study has revealed that the response of lime trees to soil water deficits differed in the two cropping systems studied open field and shaded and that the ability to detect water stress also differed for the soil plant water status indicators studied the main conclusions can be summarised as i precise estimates of the soil plant atmosphere components are needed to improve irrigation management ii ψstem is a reliable tool for assessing lime tree water status and along with the breaking point of θv are useful for irrigation monitoring iii the thermal based indices serve as an alternative to other classical discrete physiological measurements for remotely monitoring lime tree water status while the daily tc ta dynamics reflects the heartbeat of lime trees iv soil water content sensors anticipate water stress detection better than thermal based sensors v the higher ψstem gs pn and lower tc ta values observed in shaded than in open field lime trees reveals that shading allows a better soil plant water status and lowers water consumption thus delaying plant water stress vi the cropping system must be considered to propose tc ta threshold values for lime tree drip irrigation management funding this study was supported by the spanish state research agency

9341,water planners must provide end users with reliable and high quality access to fresh water while complying with financial institutional and water availability constraints in the pursuit of these goals an over investment in design can result in stranded assets of significant value and often unwanted environmental implications under investment can lead to supply restrictions affecting human health the economy and the environment the present study uses the dominance based rough set approach drsa to develop a balancing strategy concerning complexities encountered in water resource planning for irrigation systems the methodology relies on the dominance based learning from examples module domlem algorithm which extracts minimal set of rules regarding relevant combinations between flexibility allocation and design cost criteria the algorithm delineates outcomes in the form of if then rules that translate decision possibilities facing water planners into if the design is more flexible by this amount then we expect this range of cost increment then a confusion matrix is computed for each irrigation system in order to exclude the rules generating incorrect and ambiguous classification results the outcome reveals that cost is more subject to elasticity at the hydrant e h increment than the network s coefficient r furthermore the analysis reveals that the parameter p q has only a minor impact on the cost and as a result the final decision any elasticity e h less than 3 assigned to any given coefficient r becomes a low cost increment for any given value of e h the cost increases as the coefficient r decrease elasticity from 4 to 5 with a network s coefficient r equal to or greater than 18 24 becomes a medium cost increment elasticity e h from 5 to 6 associated with an r equal or less than 16 24 becomes a very high cost increment finally rather than identifying one solution that seems better than others this approach provides an interactive schematic that helps identify the appropriate range of flexibility justified by the expense criterion which allows for debate and supports decision making keywords system flexibility cost efficiency irrigation planning multiple criteria decision analysis 1 introduction numerous water supply and distribution systems e g irrigation pipelines canals storage reservoirs etc in many countries were constructed between 1950 and 1990 and thus require various expansions upgrades and rehabilitation as structures in the system reach the end of their design lifespan fletcher et al 2019 these efforts are further compounded by change impacts and uncertainties associated with various dimensions of social and hydrologic variability such as extended periods of flood or drought rayer et al 2021 and shifting social environmental economic and political dimensions gosling and arnell 2016 for example the northern colorado water conservancy district in partnership with the u s bureau of reclamation constructed the colorado big thompson project to collect and store water from the mountainous region and convey it to farmers and municipalities in the populated eastern region this project is currently being expanded by the windy gap and chimney hollow facilities to meet current and future water user demands in addition to infrastructure and design upgrades system efficiencies and resiliency could be improved through modern water management tools as the majority of these systems were developed prior to remote sensing and the various decision analysis and risk assessment methods that can take advantage of large data records of system performance frost et al 2016 lami and moroni 2020 the complexities of these systems and the objectives of shareholders can make the path of system improvement elusive in addition the upgrade alternatives are always associated with a multi criterion problem with associated uncertainties and tradeoffs to be made between capital expenditure system performance and design flexibility khadra and lamaddalena 2010 at times water experts do not agree about the probable scenarios of alternative policies dealing with uncertainties or worse reach an unjustified agreement through compromise that replaces acknowledgment of uncertainties and information gaps with policy priorities to cope with uncertainty based problems several multiple criteria decision analysis or decision making mcda or mcdm approaches have been developed pérez gladish et al 2021 that are commonly used to solve two types of problems well structured and ill structured problems zhao et al 2019 well structured problems refer to situations where the initial state goal state and constraints are clearly defined while completing the targeted objectives multiple objective decision making models modm which require procedural knowledge of both goals and objectives and follow a completely defined step by step approach are a good fit for well structured problems e g global criterion method gcm utility function method ufm jonassen 1997 laureiro martínez and brusoni 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 conversely ill structured problems refer to situations in which objectives are very complex or even conflicting initial state and executable goals are not clear and a well defined set of operations is missing the path forward requires a formalized method to assist decision making in situations involving both multiple criteria and multiple uncertainties the formalized method aims to 1 find optimal operating rules that meet various combinations of objectives 2 set the interests and objectives of multiple actors since the input of both quantitative and qualitative information from every actor is considered as criteria and 3 understand the complexity of the multi actor setting by providing output information that is easy to communicate greco et al 2016 thus the multi criteria analysis models mcdas are appropriate for ill structured problems that are often vaguely formulated with many uncertainties e g technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis elimination et choix traduisant la realité electre rough set theory rs pawlak 1998 rahim et al 2018 wei et al 2018 rough set theory is the most successful theoretical approach to ill structured problems the approach is mathematically based and concentrates on understanding the indiscernibility similarly relations that characterize objects that can be understood as elementary granules of knowledge about the objects as an extension to the classical rough set theory rs the indiscernibility relation between objects is replaced by a dominance relation within the rough approximation groups yielding a new rough set model known as the dominance based rough set approach drsa greco et al 2001 2002 greco matarazzo slowinski 2016 skowron and dutta 2018 skowron and suraj 2013 the drsa has been successfully applied to several ill structured problems such as developing an epidemiological surveillance decision making system for an enhanced assessment of the seasonal influenza risk younsi et al 2020 developing an auto loan fraud detection system błaszczyński et al 2021 providing survey based insights about consumer attitude toward and acceptance of insect based food roma et al 2020 and developing a real time recognition system that traces online assaults in 5 g networks acharjya and ahmed 2021 the drsa has also been applied within the agricultural and environmental monitoring fields in policy assessment and decision support systems dss karami et al 2014 used the approach to analyse and evaluate water quality and its dynamics in the latyan watershed north of tehran iran karami et al 2014 boggia et al 2014 developed a decision support system based on the drsa to assess the level of rural sustainable development in the region of umbria italy boggia et al 2014 ahmadisharaf et al 2015 applied the drsa approach in assessing flood management options under multiple scenarios ahmadisharaf et al 2015 however the authors know of no attempt within the field of water resources management to consider the design cost criterion in irrigation systems with the uncertainties associated with upgrade investments traditionally planners develop a long term supply and demand prediction and include a factor of safety to account for future uncertainties chadwick et al 2021 stakhiv 2011 this traditional approach can lead to additional expenditures related to less than optimal schemes such as overdesign when demand is significantly less than supply or costly retrofits addressing under design when actual demands significantly exceed forecasted demands meanwhile society will have to face some severe economic and environmental consequences if demand is higher than forecasted such as unserved demand and additional expensive measures if demand ends up higher than forecast chadwick et al 2021 sawassi and khadra 2021 the challenge in other words is to balance under future uncertainties the trade offs between the risk of failure cost and system flexibility the present study uses the multiple criteria decision aiding mcda method to develop a balancing strategy concerning these complexities encountered in the water resources management of irrigation systems we applied the dominance based rough set approach drsa in particular to define the best range of flexibility we can afford in designing an irrigation system while accounting for a cost effectiveness criterion 2 material and methods 2 1 the design hypothesis in irrigation systems the flexibility option the model presented by clément 1966 embedded the notion of system flexibility into empirical parameters that proved to be sufficiently sensitive in the design of water distribution networks clément s first model 1966 is stochastic being one of the most applicable in the mediterranean countries for the computation of peak discharges in on demand pressurized networks the empirical parameters included by clément are defined as the elasticity at the hydrant e h the coefficient of utilization of the network r and the operation quality parameter p q first the elasticity at the hydrant e h defines the freedom assigned to farmers to organize their irrigation in a way in which the nominal discharge of the hydrants d has to be selected much higher than the duty d each hydrant is assigned an elasticity e h eq 1 that allows users to satisfy the irrigation requirements in less than 24 h 1 e h rd q s a where r is the total number of hydrants d is the nominal discharge of the hydrant ls 1 a is the area of the plot ha and q s is the specific continuous discharge l s 1 ha 1 calculated for an average hectare thus representing the cropping pattern during the peak period since the likelihood of all hydrants operating simultaneously is unlikely to occur the use of the probabilistic approach is justified the values assigned to e h typically range between 3 00 when the maximum irrigable area is considered and 6 00 when the minimum irrigable area is considered labye 1988 second the coefficient of the utilization of the network r defines irrigation duration during the peak period the operating time of the network in hours is considered less than 24 h conferring elasticity of the network 2 p t t t rt q s a t rd rt finally the operation quality parameter p q defines the risk of exceedance of the upstream discharge during the peak irrigation period this parameter value is specific to each project and the corresponding risk tolerances but typically is in the range of 95 99 i e accepting a risk of exceedance for the upstream discharges of 5 1 respectively labye 1988 the ranges of values to attribute to these parameters and their impact on the overall cost of the irrigation network are not often debated or field verified consequently these values are empirically selected and frequently under estimated sawassi et al 2021 to illustrate let s first consider a set of attributes of an irrigation system in which e h is the elasticity at the hydrant r is the coefficient of utilization of the network and p q is the operation quality parameter which represents the probability of exceedance of the peak discharge knowing that i j and z are the sets of the indices related to each attribute respectively e h i 1 2 3 4 5 6 r j 16 24 18 24 20 24 and p q z 0 90 0 95 clément s predicted discharge occurring at the upstream end of the network during the peak period is calculated using the formula q i j z accounting for the flexibility parameters 3 q i j z x a q s r j u pq z x 1 r x eh i r j a q s r j 2 the combined optimization and performance analysis model copam lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 was used in this study with the first module estimating the system s upstream discharge and the second optimizing distribution pipe diameters for performance and cost over a range of flows using labye s iterative discontinuous method lidm extended for several flow regimes elidm kadi et al 1990 lamaddalena et al 2012 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 sawassi et al 2021 the final solution of the second model should satisfy all the examined discharge configurations derived from the first one at this level an iteration based process of the abovementioned design hypothesis is performed based on allocating different values of elasticity in each repetition in which a single run of iteration generates a final cost 2 2 the study background tunisian context between 2006 and 2017 several agricultural investments in the sector of the modernization of irrigated schemes took place in tunisia s lower madjerda valley lmv molle and sanchis ibor 2019 piseau ii is one of the modernization projects financed by the world bank wb the french development agency afd and the german bank of cooperation kfw which covers seven large scale irrigation systems in the manouba region tunisia the project covers a total area of 4071 ha 10 060 acres including the systems bir aouini mehrine east mehrine west sidi neji mansoura east mansoura west and habibia even though the modernization of these irrigation systems has entailed significant financial resources the systems continue to face the challenge of inadequate operation users continuously report a high frequency of unexpected drops in the flow and or pressure that affect the quality of the rendered services very low water availability at hydrants with the required frequency discharge pressure and duration and long durations of inadequate flow rate and or pressure especially during the peak period qualitative assessments were conducted via walk throughs into the irrigation districts and sectors observations and interviews with farmers that were undertaken in a collaboration between the international center for advanced agronomic studies ciheam bari italy and the tunisian ministry of agriculture through the general directorate of rural engineering and water exploitation dggree the quantitative assessment showed a restricted selection of flexibility parameters with an average elasticity of e h 1 2 the system was designed to operate 20 h per day with a 90 probability that peak discharge would not be exceeded during the driest period of the year so it seems that from the beginning the system was designed to operate at its maximum capacity this rigid selection turns out to be the primary reason behind the system s failure endangering livelihoods based primarily on agricultural production the inability to deliver water to farmers adequately insufficient pressure and discharge is related directly to future uncertainties noted previously that was not well considered resulting in the non flexible design sawassi et al 2021 designers on the other hand have justified the system s failure by noting that the simplistic approach minimized the overall cost of the new irrigation system fig 1 2 3 the dominance based rough set approach drsa the challenge facing water designers is to strike a certain balance between current user demands and the project budget user constraints and future demand as well as future uncertainties and upgrading investments as a result several factors are examined to reach a trade off between these options this research helps water planners identify the correlation between design flexibility that guarantees a good service to users ratepayers with the least amount of associated expenses having to account for all the uncertainties and the criteria to account for we opted to use the mcda method developed by greco et al 2002 2001 as an extension of the rough set theory pawlak 1982 pawlak and pawlak 1991 this study aims to implement a strategy for identifying the best range of design elasticity to be taken by decision makers accounting for a cost driven perspective using the mcda in particular the dominance based rough set approach drsa when designing an irrigation system the decision maker should first establish a set of criteria to consider including performance adaptability cost effectiveness user satisfaction and others the decision makers should next determine their most significant criteria and assign them a certain preference the drsa takes into account these decision maker preferences as well as the typical inconsistency of decision problems kadziński et al 2014 the approach substitutes the indiscernible relation with a dominance relation in a rough approximation of decision classes making it possible to discover the inconsistencies concerning the dominance principle sawicki and żak 2014 in other words drsa builds the conceptual groundwork for discovering decision rules that have a syntax that is concordant with the dominance principle between different criteria boggia et al 2014 greco et al 2001 in this context the drsa is used to assist decision makers in identifying an effective range of flexibility adjusted for cost effectiveness this classification approach permits the acquisition of information about the most relevant criteria that delineate the objects in the form of if then resulting in a set of decisional rules as outputs these if then rules are simply translating the decision possibilities that irrigation system designers are facing if the design is more flexible by this amount then we expect this range of cost increment which are easy to interpret and decide on in the present study the drsa is denoted as the classification model fig 2 and is applied according to the following procedure błaszczyński et al 2013 boggia et al 2014 greco et al 2016 2001 roma et al 2020 2 3 1 setting the decision tables the drsa application starts from a data matrix code in which the rows include the objects and indicate the values of criteria for each corresponding object while the columns include the criteria and indicate the values of each corresponding criterion for the objects this data matrix is a 4 tuple decision table s u q v f where u is a finite set of objects q is a finite set of criteria v q q v q where v q is the domain of the criterion q and f u q v is an information function such that f x q v q for every x q u q hence a set q is divided into condition criteria set c ø and the decision criterion class d note that f x q is an evaluation of object x on criterion q c while f x d is the class assignment decision value of the object the domain of a criterion q q is assumed to be completely pre ordered by an outranking relation q x q y meaning that x is at least as good as outranks y with respect to the criterion q without loss of generality it is assumed that the domain of q is a subset of reals v q r and that the outranking relation is a simple order between real numbers such that the following relation holds x q y f x q f y q this relation is straight forward for the gain type criterion i e the more the better whereas this relation can be satisfied by negating the values from v q for the cost type criterion i e the less the better our datasets have integrated decision tables representing the irrigation systems subject of this study the data matrix code contains three sets of objects attributes a u preferences p v and decisions s s therefore for any given combination in the condition attributes a which represents the design assumptions a eh r p q a unique decision attribute which is the cost increment of the project is allocated s low medium high very high besides the decision maker preference p is assigned to each condition attribute as a gain type or cost type criterion which helps to link the condition criteria to the decision criteria through this preference information in this context the elasticity at the hydrant e h is assigned a gain type preference because the higher the value of elasticity e h the higher the price of the project the coefficient of utilisation of the network r is assigned a cost type preference because the lower the coefficient of utilization of the network the higher the estimated price of the project and the operation quality parameter p q is assigned a gain preference since the higher the value of p q the higher the price of the project the input information related to each system was elaborated using the software jmaf developed by the laboratory of intelligent decision support systems poznań university of technology poland błaszczyński et al 2011 2013 the domain of the decision criterion v d consists of n elements hence without loss of generality it is assumed that v d t with t 1 n v d induces a partition of u into n classes cl cl t t t where cl t x u f x d t each object x u is assigned to one and only one class the classes are preference ordered according to an increasing order of class indices i e for all r s t such that r s the objects from cl r are strictly preferred to the objects from cl s for this reason we can consider the upward and downward unions of classes defined respectively as 4 cl t s t cl s cl t s t cl s t 1 n t 2 3 2 defining the dominance cones the approximation of upward and downward unions of decision classes is represented by granules of knowledge that are generated by the criteria these granules are also defined as dominance cones in the criteria values space in particular x dominates y with respect to p c denoted by x d p y if x is better than y on every criterion from p x q y q p for each p c the dominance relation d p is reflexive and transitive namely it is a partial pre order given p c and x u the granules of knowledge used for approximation in drsa are as follows a set of objects dominating x called p dominating set and given by d p x y u y d p x and a set of objects dominated by x called p dominated set and given by d p x y u x d p y 2 3 3 computing the approximations of ordered decision classes the p lower and the p upper approximation of cl t t t with respect to p c denoted as p cl t and p cl t are defined as 5 p cl t x u d p x cl t 6 p cl t x u d p x cl t ø in the same way the p lower and the p upper approximation of cl t t t with respect to p c denoted as p cl t and p cl t are defined as 7 p cl t x u d p x cl t 8 p cl t x u d p x cl t ø the lower approximations group contains the objects that belong certainly to a class union cl t respectively cl t indeed object x u belongs to the lower approximation p cl t respectively p cl t if no other object in u contradicts the claim that every object x u that p dominates x also belong to the class union cl t respectively cl t the upper approximations group contains the objects that could belong to cl t respectively cl t since object x u belongs to the upper approximation p cl t respectively p cl t if there is another object y u p dominated by x from a class union cl t respectively cl t the p lower and p upper approximations satisfy the following properties for all t t and any p c 9 p cl t x u d p x cl t 10 p cl t cl t p cl t consequently the p boundaries i e p doubtful regions of cl t and cl t are defined as 11 bn p cl t p cl t p cl t 12 bn p cl t p cl t p cl t 2 3 4 sorting the quality of approximations and the reduction of attributes for every p f the quality of approximation of the ordinal classification cl by a set of attributes p is defined as the ratio of the number of objects consistent with the dominance principle and the number of all the objects in u therefore the ratio 13 γ p cl u t t bn p cl t t t bn p cl t u defines the quality of approximation of the partition cl into classesusing the set of criteria p this ratio expresses the relationship between all the correctly classified objects and all the objects in the decision table furthermore every minimal sub set p c such that γ p cl γ c cl is called a reduct of c and is denoted by red cl a decision table may have more than one reduct the intersection of all reducts is known as core cl the criteria in this core cannot be removed without affecting the quality of approximation thus there are three categories of criteria i indispensable criteria included in the core ii exchangeable criteria included in some reducts but not in the core and iii redundant criteria neither indispensable nor exchangeable which are not included in any reduct 2 3 5 generating the decisional rules based on the approximations obtained by the dominance relations it is possible to describe the preferential information included in the table in terms of decision rules these rules are expressed in the form if then which indicates a dependency between condition criteria and decision criteria the windy gap firming project is a collaboration between 12 northeastern colorado water providers to address water shortages and improve the reliability of water supplies the 12 participants represent different stakeholders with different preferences to consider nine municipalities two water districts and one power provider to address this shortage designers have used multiple approaches accounting for multiple criteria alternatives and preferences including conservation plans alternative transfer methods with farms water reuse and providing additional supplies municipal subdistrict northern colorado water conservancy 2018 this is the reason why procedures for generating decision rules should always follow an inductive learning principle in the present study we used only the certain rules that represent the certain knowledge extracted from the data which have the following form p s the variables reported in the following formats r q 1 r 2 r 1 r qp are unrelated to the network s coefficient of utilization previously stated if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x cl t if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x cl t where p q 1 q p c r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p possible rules have a similar syntax but the consequent part of the rule has a different form if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x could belong to cl t if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x could belong to cl t where p q 1 q p c r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p on the other hand the approximate rules have the following syntax if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q k r k and f x q k 1 r k 1 and f x q k 2 r k 2 and f x q p r p then x cl s cl s 1 cl t where o q k 2 q p c o q 1 q k c o o p r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p and s t 1 n such that s t a set of decision rules is complete when it covers all objects from the decision table in such a way that consistent objects are re classified to their original classes and inconsistent objects are classified into clusters of classes referring to this inconsistency moreover a set of decision rules is called minimal if is complete and non redundant so that the exclusion of any rule from this set makes it non complete several algorithms can be used for the induction of decision rules among these algorithms the dominance based learning from examples module domlem błaszczyński et al 2011 enables the generation of a minimal set of rules 3 results 3 1 iteration and cost normalization the parameters adopted from the design assessment of the seven modernized irrigation systems were considered as existing sets and their associated costs were referred to as baselines any incremental cost incurred as a result of any sequential change of the condition alternatives e h r and p q in comparison to the baseline was recorded as a percentage then the increment was normalized into four bins low moderate high and very high as illustrated in table 1 the cost increment was classified using a very basic statistical method called the quartile which performs a division of observations into n defined intervals based on the values of the data and how they compare to the entire set of observations in this context the quartile splits data into three points a lower quartile median and upper quartile to form four groups of the dataset low medium high and very high the normalization allocates a 0 increment to all the irrigation sectors while in the baseline for the low category an average interval of 0 13 is assigned to the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 0 6 to the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors the medium bin ranges from 12 19 for the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 6 12 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors the bin high ranges from 19 33 for the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 12 24 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors finally any cost increments exceeding 24 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors are categorized as very high as are the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors if the cost exceeds 33 the reasons behind this difference in cost increment ranges are the total area served the difference in elevations and the number of users hydrants in each sector 3 2 calculation of the unions of approximations at this level it is important to understand a priori which types of rules are needed first three types of rules are available certain possible and approximate in particular certain rules are generated from lower approximations of unions of classes and possible rules are generated from upper approximations of unions of classes while approximate rules are generated from boundary regions however in this work we decided to only use certain rules furthermore any significant difference between the lower and upper approximation unions of classes may lead to the uncertainty of incorrect or ambiguous results the calculation results of the standard unions of approximations corresponding to all of the sectors are plotted in table 2 a strong match in the number of objects supporting the rules from the upper and lower approximations is illustrated which shows the high accuracy of the resulting rules 3 3 drsa application the classification model one of the first steps when using the mcda is to set the decision tables which is based on understanding the relationship between the decision variables and preference criteria the more the better or the less the better in this context the elasticity at the hydrant e h is assigned a gain type preference because the higher the value of elasticity e h the higher the price of the project the coefficient of utilisation of the network r is assigned a cost type preference because the lower the coefficient of utilization of the network the higher the estimated price of the project and the operation quality parameter p q is assigned a gain preference since the higher the value of p q the higher the price of the project the second step is the calculation of dominance cones p dominating sets and p dominated sets the drsa unions and their approximations then the model assigns the final dominance relation between objects an object a is non dominated in set u pareto optimal if and only if there is no other object b in set u such that b is not worse than a on all considered criteria and strictly better on at least one criterion finally the relationship between the parameters of elasticity and their associated cost is classified by applying the domlem algorithm błaszczyński et al 2011 based on the drsa approach this algorithm extracts certain decisional rules by identifying the parameters that most influence the cost the rules are sorted into two categories that characterize the classes of the decision low medium high and very high for instance the at least rules indicate the smallest that is possible or likely e g if e h 3 then the result could be at least medium while at most rules indicate the maximum that is possible or likely e g if e h 5 then the result could be at most high the approach was applied to seven different irrigation systems where each system includes 21 different combination of the design parameters and the results revealed 26 decisional rules that are illustrated in table 3 according to their decision class all the rules shown in table 3 are dependent on each other therefore any interpretation of a single rule does not reflect the decision class borders the first rule proposes a wide range of possibilities if the elasticity e h 2 5 then the cost may be at least low the range is made narrow with the next rule announcing that if the elasticity e h 3 then the cost may be at least medium rules 6 and 7 claim two different and true conditions within the same decision class of high the second declares that if only the elasticity e h 4 then the cost increment may be at least high and the third says that if e h 4 and p q 95 then the cost increment may be at least high similar outcomes generated with rules 8 and 9 always in the same class high and with rules 15 and 16 in the class very high clearly demonstrate that the operation quality parameter p q has only a minor effect on the cost increment and decision class no at most rules were generated for the very high class since it is the ultimate class decided in this framework 3 4 the reclassification inaccuracies while generating the rules may yield misleading and unbalanced results many large scale projects have realized that checking the efficiency classification model is an important task because it allows for a more detailed analysis than a mere proportion of accuracy for instance with the windy gap firming project in colorado thirteen water providers entered the formal federal permitting process for the windy gap firming project the subdistrict published an alternatives report detailing 170 methods to potentially accomplish project goals which were then narrowed down to seven municipal subdistrict northern colorado water conservancy 2018 the reclassification is performed by computing the confusion matrix basically the confusion matrix summarizes the classification performance of a classifier algorithm with respect to a dataset this is a two dimensional matrix where each row represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class ting 2011 therefore the analysis of the confusion matrix enables to obtain the overall accuracy of classification as the ratio between the correct classified instances reported along the diagonal of the matrix and all the instances and it can be expressed as a percentage li et al 2011 table 4 illustrates the classification accuracy of the drsa obtained by the confusion matrices of the irrigation systems the matrices returned a very reliable classification and thus robust results as the classification accuracy ranges between 76 2 and 100 in all the irrigation systems nevertheless the confusion matrix and the overall accuracy do not take into account the ambiguous cases because they can neither be reassigned to their original decision class nor reclassified the ambiguous cases may occur due to significant differences between lower and upper approximations of the unions of decision classes and also to weak decision rules i e rules supported by few objects from lower approximations greco matarazzo slowinski 2016 the rules generating both incorrect and ambiguous cases are dismissed from the graphical representation fig 3 table 4 explains the reclassification results in which one ambiguous rule seemed to include both low and medium decisions in its regulations the case is recorded in the mehrine east system within the class medium three ambiguous rules are responding to low medium and high decisions at the same time these rules are all recorded in the mehrine east system two rules within the high class recorded in mehrine east and mansoura east systems are also classified as ambiguous as they are responding to the both medium and high decisions synchronically finally one incorrect rule is registered in the very high decision recorded in the sidi neji mansoura east and habibia systems 3 5 graphical representation of the rules graphical representation refers to the use of graphs to visually display analyse clarify and interpret numerical data functions and other qualitative structures fig 3 displays the exported rules corresponding to each system in a worksheet plot an x y data object is a two dimensional array of data the type of graphical representation used in this context is a heatmap heatmaps display information in a two dimensional grid of cells and each cell represents a grouping of data the cell colour indicates the relative value which is the project s cost increment in this study four colours are considered in this framework green yellow orange and red representing the classes of a low medium high and very high cost increment respectively the x versus y graph stores in its two columns the generated rules confirmed to be correct where the x column represents the elasticity e h and the y column represents the coefficient of utilization r the operation quality parameter p q is not considered in the graphical representation as it was confirmed to have a minor effect on the cost the approach provides fundamentals in identifying the suitable strategy of elasticity allocation according to the budget therefore selecting a single x and y data outcome sorts a graph cell that displays the associated cost according to the related flexibilities the graphical representation shows the sensitivity of the cost to the elasticity at the hydrant e h more than the coefficient of utilization of the network for any assigned coefficient of utilization r an elasticity e h of less than 3 would result in a low cost increment when the elasticity is equal to 3 the related cost increases as the network coefficient changes the medium cost increase appears with an elasticity of 4 and 5 only when the network s coefficient of utilization is equal to or greater than 18 24 however the very high cost increment class occurs with an elasticity of 5 6 when the network s coefficient of utilization is equal to or less than 16 24 4 discussion the findings of this research are intended to help water planners identify the correlation between design flexibility parameters that will help achieve a good service to users ratepayers with the least amount of associated expenses first the elasticity at the hydrant e h defines the flexibility assigned at the hydrant level farmer this flexibility means that the nominal discharge of the hydrants d should be selected much higher than the duty d allowing farmers to irrigate for a duration less than 24 h this condition implies that the higher the elasticity assigned at hydrant the larger the selected pipe sizes and eventually the higher the cost of the system the network s coefficient of utilization defines the flexibility at the system level in an irrigation system operating on demand and should have a value equal to one because in reality the system is operating 24 h per day the study showed that a system with a lower network coefficient of utilization costs more than a system with a higher coefficient of utilization from a design standpoint this is confirmed because we build a system to satisfy the same downstream demand in fewer operational hours so the pipe size and corresponding price will be larger the present study provides a simplistic mathematical model based on the multiple criteria decision analysis which explains how the flexibility in the design of irrigation systems can influence the project s economic outcomes other technics were similarly used to address this issue such as scenario based planning multistage scenario trees multistage decision analysis and bayesian techniques for instance scenario based planning has gained a lot of acceptance in the water resources community preparing a range of possible futures provides flexibility and adds robustness to the system so it can respond to uncertain events at reasonable costs while maintaining community confidence in their utilities kang and lansey 2013 applied the scenario based multi objective optimization model to regional scale water and wastewater infrastructure design in the southeast of tucson arizona the study involved seven scenarios representing potential system growth variations along the planning time horizon and results showed that the flexible planning process reduces the regret costs by 30 kang and lansey 2013 many authors used scenario based planning to tackle the cost effectiveness of flexible design as an approach to adapt to future uncertainties such as hadjikakou et al 2019 herman et al 2015 kang and lansey 2014 on the other hand erfani et al 2018 used the multi stage decision analysis to inform about least cost capacity expansion scheduling through multistage stochastic mathematical programming applied to london s water system the results showed that ignoring adaptive planning cost 15 4 of the total net present value and considering flexible decision making had a value of 6 of the total net present value of london s water supply system erfani et al 2018 fletcher et al 2019 developed a new planning framework that assesses the potential to learn about flexible approaches applied to a real problem in the water supply system in mombasa kenya using a bayesian statistical model the approach showed that the flexible dam design cost per m3 of additional capacity added was assumed to be 50 greater than that of the original capacity fletcher et al 2019 fletcher et al 2017 used probability based risk quantification which allows the evaluation and comparison of flexible design versus rigid design in a way that takes into account the diverse and multifaceted uncertainties water planners face the study was applied to a desalination plant in melbourne australia and results showed that in 10 of simulations rigid design lead to an overexpense of 10 us billion compared with a flexible desalination plant fletcher et al 2017 the methodology presented in this study provides a considerable understanding of the different levels of flexibility in the cost and the design process in the field of irrigation systems rather than concluding that a final solution is better than the others this is why it seemed important in this work to illustrate the main limitations of the multiple criteria decision analysis as well as opportunities to improve and extend the approach of flexibility in the design of irrigation water system planning first the present research has only considered one planning objective which is to find a compromise between the flexibility and the final cost of the project in reality planners and stakeholders may have other objectives and preferences as well such as energy intensity maintaining ecosystem services equitable distribution and access water quality etc one notable objective that is not addressed in this work is the reliability of the irrigation water systems despite the fact that it is an important objective in evaluating the cost effectiveness of flexible investments second the types and goals of flexibility are addressed in this tunisian case study in other literature flexible planning has been considered as the timing of capacity additions or even the volume of capacity additions to a system or an infrastructure in this work we provide an approach to assess the value of flexibility as a strategy for achieving reliable planning that satisfies users and planners and proves that it is a worthwhile goal however the application of this method across a wider range of many different water systems supply systems desalination plans fletcher et al 2019 hydro power systems etc or maybe other planning alternatives could enable the identification of properties of water systems that enable the high value of flexibility third the model has a quite specific representation of the decision rules if then it might be non standard and does not support a hierarchical structure of the decision criteria but it rather corresponds directly to how human experts typically make decisions fourth the monotonicity problem this constraint occurs when the value sets of attributes and the predefined classes are preference ordered and there exist monotonic relationships between condition and decision attributes fifth the choice problem related to the multiple objective optimizations occurs when the set of objects is infinite and defined by the constraints of a mathematical program sixth the discrete choice problem occurs when the set of objects is finite and reasonably small enough to be listed future work and options are to extend the framework to incorporate social and institutional issues more thoroughly such as local energy cost fluctuations this work has represented decisions from the standpoint of a single planner concentrating on realistic options that the planner has the authority to implement in reality many various actors interact with water resource systems and the planner s actions might impact the behavior of other actors and vice versa moreover the methodologies and ideas used in this dissertation could be applied to various disciplines of study many other engineering systems fields such as energy or transportation deal with infrastructure planning with many decision criteria and changing uncertainties the paradigm given here could be applied to a broad variety of systems in particular it could be applied to other infrastructure systems whose performance is impacted by future uncertainties to assess the value of flexible approaches to managing risk 5 conclusions and recommendations success in solving today s water management challenges for future generations requires a data informed plan and water planners with the ability to consider the fundamental concepts algorithms techniques and info tools that could be applied to this data to assist with or inform particular problem solving as systematic thinking fosters success in data driven decision making in this context the pattern extraction process concerning the flexibility afforded to the design of a large scale irrigation system and its associated cost is investigated with well defined stages from a give and take perspective understanding this process and its stages helps water managers to structure problem solving to consider uncertainty and to create well informed suitable designs that meet users needs to this aim seven large scale pressurized irrigation systems in the manouba region of tunisia operating under on demand service and designed according to the clément formula are considered as the context of the application of the current study in this analysis we present a simplified model that allows us to easily understand how the elasticity at the hydrant interacts with the coefficient of utilization from different networks to influence economic outcomes for project realization in the field of irrigation systems first an iteration based process of the design hypothesis was performed which generated the final cost of each system associated with a single run of iteration twenty one iterations were recorded relative to each of the seven systems assigning a different combination of elasticity to every iteration made second a classification model permits the acquisition of posterior information about the most relevant combination defining the outcome in the form of if then resulting in a set of 26 decisional rules the methodology applied helps to extract certain decisional rules by identifying the parameters that most influence the cost of a project the rules are sorted into two categories at least and at most rules which characterize the classes of the decision low medium high and very high for instance at least rules indicate the smallest conceivable or probable cost that may occur when altering the elasticity whereas at most rules indicate the greatest cost that may occur when altering the elasticity these two categories set the intervals min and max of the decision classes the results showed that some rules would present two different and true conditions within the same decision class for example the second rule declares that if only the elasticity e h 4 then the cost increment may be at least high and the third rule says that if e h 4 and p q 95 then the cost increment may be at least high as well similarly the results from other examples show that the operation quality parameter p q has only a minor effect on the cost increment and the decision class afterward these rules were reclassified using the confusion matrix model and the results were plotted in a heatmap graphical representation the reclassification resulted in 19 correct elements six 06 ambiguous elements and one 01 incorrect element which indicates the efficiency and high consistency of the classification model the results revealed the sensitivity of cost to the elasticity at the hydrant e h more than the coefficient of utilization of the network any elasticity e h less than 3 associated with any given r would result in a low cost increment the cost increases as the coefficient r decreases for any given value of e h an elasticity of 4 5 associated with a network s coefficient r equal to or greater than 18 24 leads to a medium cost increment finally any e h from 5 to 6 associated with an r equal or less than 16 24 would result in a very high cost increment this methodology provides a considerable understanding of the different levels of flexibility in the cost and the design process rather than concluding that a final solution is better than the others trade offs likely exist between achieving mathematical optimality and presenting options to decision makers yet this approach provides an interactive representation that helps in identifying the appropriate range of flexibility justified with the expense

9341,water planners must provide end users with reliable and high quality access to fresh water while complying with financial institutional and water availability constraints in the pursuit of these goals an over investment in design can result in stranded assets of significant value and often unwanted environmental implications under investment can lead to supply restrictions affecting human health the economy and the environment the present study uses the dominance based rough set approach drsa to develop a balancing strategy concerning complexities encountered in water resource planning for irrigation systems the methodology relies on the dominance based learning from examples module domlem algorithm which extracts minimal set of rules regarding relevant combinations between flexibility allocation and design cost criteria the algorithm delineates outcomes in the form of if then rules that translate decision possibilities facing water planners into if the design is more flexible by this amount then we expect this range of cost increment then a confusion matrix is computed for each irrigation system in order to exclude the rules generating incorrect and ambiguous classification results the outcome reveals that cost is more subject to elasticity at the hydrant e h increment than the network s coefficient r furthermore the analysis reveals that the parameter p q has only a minor impact on the cost and as a result the final decision any elasticity e h less than 3 assigned to any given coefficient r becomes a low cost increment for any given value of e h the cost increases as the coefficient r decrease elasticity from 4 to 5 with a network s coefficient r equal to or greater than 18 24 becomes a medium cost increment elasticity e h from 5 to 6 associated with an r equal or less than 16 24 becomes a very high cost increment finally rather than identifying one solution that seems better than others this approach provides an interactive schematic that helps identify the appropriate range of flexibility justified by the expense criterion which allows for debate and supports decision making keywords system flexibility cost efficiency irrigation planning multiple criteria decision analysis 1 introduction numerous water supply and distribution systems e g irrigation pipelines canals storage reservoirs etc in many countries were constructed between 1950 and 1990 and thus require various expansions upgrades and rehabilitation as structures in the system reach the end of their design lifespan fletcher et al 2019 these efforts are further compounded by change impacts and uncertainties associated with various dimensions of social and hydrologic variability such as extended periods of flood or drought rayer et al 2021 and shifting social environmental economic and political dimensions gosling and arnell 2016 for example the northern colorado water conservancy district in partnership with the u s bureau of reclamation constructed the colorado big thompson project to collect and store water from the mountainous region and convey it to farmers and municipalities in the populated eastern region this project is currently being expanded by the windy gap and chimney hollow facilities to meet current and future water user demands in addition to infrastructure and design upgrades system efficiencies and resiliency could be improved through modern water management tools as the majority of these systems were developed prior to remote sensing and the various decision analysis and risk assessment methods that can take advantage of large data records of system performance frost et al 2016 lami and moroni 2020 the complexities of these systems and the objectives of shareholders can make the path of system improvement elusive in addition the upgrade alternatives are always associated with a multi criterion problem with associated uncertainties and tradeoffs to be made between capital expenditure system performance and design flexibility khadra and lamaddalena 2010 at times water experts do not agree about the probable scenarios of alternative policies dealing with uncertainties or worse reach an unjustified agreement through compromise that replaces acknowledgment of uncertainties and information gaps with policy priorities to cope with uncertainty based problems several multiple criteria decision analysis or decision making mcda or mcdm approaches have been developed pérez gladish et al 2021 that are commonly used to solve two types of problems well structured and ill structured problems zhao et al 2019 well structured problems refer to situations where the initial state goal state and constraints are clearly defined while completing the targeted objectives multiple objective decision making models modm which require procedural knowledge of both goals and objectives and follow a completely defined step by step approach are a good fit for well structured problems e g global criterion method gcm utility function method ufm jonassen 1997 laureiro martínez and brusoni 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 conversely ill structured problems refer to situations in which objectives are very complex or even conflicting initial state and executable goals are not clear and a well defined set of operations is missing the path forward requires a formalized method to assist decision making in situations involving both multiple criteria and multiple uncertainties the formalized method aims to 1 find optimal operating rules that meet various combinations of objectives 2 set the interests and objectives of multiple actors since the input of both quantitative and qualitative information from every actor is considered as criteria and 3 understand the complexity of the multi actor setting by providing output information that is easy to communicate greco et al 2016 thus the multi criteria analysis models mcdas are appropriate for ill structured problems that are often vaguely formulated with many uncertainties e g technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis elimination et choix traduisant la realité electre rough set theory rs pawlak 1998 rahim et al 2018 wei et al 2018 rough set theory is the most successful theoretical approach to ill structured problems the approach is mathematically based and concentrates on understanding the indiscernibility similarly relations that characterize objects that can be understood as elementary granules of knowledge about the objects as an extension to the classical rough set theory rs the indiscernibility relation between objects is replaced by a dominance relation within the rough approximation groups yielding a new rough set model known as the dominance based rough set approach drsa greco et al 2001 2002 greco matarazzo slowinski 2016 skowron and dutta 2018 skowron and suraj 2013 the drsa has been successfully applied to several ill structured problems such as developing an epidemiological surveillance decision making system for an enhanced assessment of the seasonal influenza risk younsi et al 2020 developing an auto loan fraud detection system błaszczyński et al 2021 providing survey based insights about consumer attitude toward and acceptance of insect based food roma et al 2020 and developing a real time recognition system that traces online assaults in 5 g networks acharjya and ahmed 2021 the drsa has also been applied within the agricultural and environmental monitoring fields in policy assessment and decision support systems dss karami et al 2014 used the approach to analyse and evaluate water quality and its dynamics in the latyan watershed north of tehran iran karami et al 2014 boggia et al 2014 developed a decision support system based on the drsa to assess the level of rural sustainable development in the region of umbria italy boggia et al 2014 ahmadisharaf et al 2015 applied the drsa approach in assessing flood management options under multiple scenarios ahmadisharaf et al 2015 however the authors know of no attempt within the field of water resources management to consider the design cost criterion in irrigation systems with the uncertainties associated with upgrade investments traditionally planners develop a long term supply and demand prediction and include a factor of safety to account for future uncertainties chadwick et al 2021 stakhiv 2011 this traditional approach can lead to additional expenditures related to less than optimal schemes such as overdesign when demand is significantly less than supply or costly retrofits addressing under design when actual demands significantly exceed forecasted demands meanwhile society will have to face some severe economic and environmental consequences if demand is higher than forecasted such as unserved demand and additional expensive measures if demand ends up higher than forecast chadwick et al 2021 sawassi and khadra 2021 the challenge in other words is to balance under future uncertainties the trade offs between the risk of failure cost and system flexibility the present study uses the multiple criteria decision aiding mcda method to develop a balancing strategy concerning these complexities encountered in the water resources management of irrigation systems we applied the dominance based rough set approach drsa in particular to define the best range of flexibility we can afford in designing an irrigation system while accounting for a cost effectiveness criterion 2 material and methods 2 1 the design hypothesis in irrigation systems the flexibility option the model presented by clément 1966 embedded the notion of system flexibility into empirical parameters that proved to be sufficiently sensitive in the design of water distribution networks clément s first model 1966 is stochastic being one of the most applicable in the mediterranean countries for the computation of peak discharges in on demand pressurized networks the empirical parameters included by clément are defined as the elasticity at the hydrant e h the coefficient of utilization of the network r and the operation quality parameter p q first the elasticity at the hydrant e h defines the freedom assigned to farmers to organize their irrigation in a way in which the nominal discharge of the hydrants d has to be selected much higher than the duty d each hydrant is assigned an elasticity e h eq 1 that allows users to satisfy the irrigation requirements in less than 24 h 1 e h rd q s a where r is the total number of hydrants d is the nominal discharge of the hydrant ls 1 a is the area of the plot ha and q s is the specific continuous discharge l s 1 ha 1 calculated for an average hectare thus representing the cropping pattern during the peak period since the likelihood of all hydrants operating simultaneously is unlikely to occur the use of the probabilistic approach is justified the values assigned to e h typically range between 3 00 when the maximum irrigable area is considered and 6 00 when the minimum irrigable area is considered labye 1988 second the coefficient of the utilization of the network r defines irrigation duration during the peak period the operating time of the network in hours is considered less than 24 h conferring elasticity of the network 2 p t t t rt q s a t rd rt finally the operation quality parameter p q defines the risk of exceedance of the upstream discharge during the peak irrigation period this parameter value is specific to each project and the corresponding risk tolerances but typically is in the range of 95 99 i e accepting a risk of exceedance for the upstream discharges of 5 1 respectively labye 1988 the ranges of values to attribute to these parameters and their impact on the overall cost of the irrigation network are not often debated or field verified consequently these values are empirically selected and frequently under estimated sawassi et al 2021 to illustrate let s first consider a set of attributes of an irrigation system in which e h is the elasticity at the hydrant r is the coefficient of utilization of the network and p q is the operation quality parameter which represents the probability of exceedance of the peak discharge knowing that i j and z are the sets of the indices related to each attribute respectively e h i 1 2 3 4 5 6 r j 16 24 18 24 20 24 and p q z 0 90 0 95 clément s predicted discharge occurring at the upstream end of the network during the peak period is calculated using the formula q i j z accounting for the flexibility parameters 3 q i j z x a q s r j u pq z x 1 r x eh i r j a q s r j 2 the combined optimization and performance analysis model copam lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 was used in this study with the first module estimating the system s upstream discharge and the second optimizing distribution pipe diameters for performance and cost over a range of flows using labye s iterative discontinuous method lidm extended for several flow regimes elidm kadi et al 1990 lamaddalena et al 2012 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 sawassi et al 2021 the final solution of the second model should satisfy all the examined discharge configurations derived from the first one at this level an iteration based process of the abovementioned design hypothesis is performed based on allocating different values of elasticity in each repetition in which a single run of iteration generates a final cost 2 2 the study background tunisian context between 2006 and 2017 several agricultural investments in the sector of the modernization of irrigated schemes took place in tunisia s lower madjerda valley lmv molle and sanchis ibor 2019 piseau ii is one of the modernization projects financed by the world bank wb the french development agency afd and the german bank of cooperation kfw which covers seven large scale irrigation systems in the manouba region tunisia the project covers a total area of 4071 ha 10 060 acres including the systems bir aouini mehrine east mehrine west sidi neji mansoura east mansoura west and habibia even though the modernization of these irrigation systems has entailed significant financial resources the systems continue to face the challenge of inadequate operation users continuously report a high frequency of unexpected drops in the flow and or pressure that affect the quality of the rendered services very low water availability at hydrants with the required frequency discharge pressure and duration and long durations of inadequate flow rate and or pressure especially during the peak period qualitative assessments were conducted via walk throughs into the irrigation districts and sectors observations and interviews with farmers that were undertaken in a collaboration between the international center for advanced agronomic studies ciheam bari italy and the tunisian ministry of agriculture through the general directorate of rural engineering and water exploitation dggree the quantitative assessment showed a restricted selection of flexibility parameters with an average elasticity of e h 1 2 the system was designed to operate 20 h per day with a 90 probability that peak discharge would not be exceeded during the driest period of the year so it seems that from the beginning the system was designed to operate at its maximum capacity this rigid selection turns out to be the primary reason behind the system s failure endangering livelihoods based primarily on agricultural production the inability to deliver water to farmers adequately insufficient pressure and discharge is related directly to future uncertainties noted previously that was not well considered resulting in the non flexible design sawassi et al 2021 designers on the other hand have justified the system s failure by noting that the simplistic approach minimized the overall cost of the new irrigation system fig 1 2 3 the dominance based rough set approach drsa the challenge facing water designers is to strike a certain balance between current user demands and the project budget user constraints and future demand as well as future uncertainties and upgrading investments as a result several factors are examined to reach a trade off between these options this research helps water planners identify the correlation between design flexibility that guarantees a good service to users ratepayers with the least amount of associated expenses having to account for all the uncertainties and the criteria to account for we opted to use the mcda method developed by greco et al 2002 2001 as an extension of the rough set theory pawlak 1982 pawlak and pawlak 1991 this study aims to implement a strategy for identifying the best range of design elasticity to be taken by decision makers accounting for a cost driven perspective using the mcda in particular the dominance based rough set approach drsa when designing an irrigation system the decision maker should first establish a set of criteria to consider including performance adaptability cost effectiveness user satisfaction and others the decision makers should next determine their most significant criteria and assign them a certain preference the drsa takes into account these decision maker preferences as well as the typical inconsistency of decision problems kadziński et al 2014 the approach substitutes the indiscernible relation with a dominance relation in a rough approximation of decision classes making it possible to discover the inconsistencies concerning the dominance principle sawicki and żak 2014 in other words drsa builds the conceptual groundwork for discovering decision rules that have a syntax that is concordant with the dominance principle between different criteria boggia et al 2014 greco et al 2001 in this context the drsa is used to assist decision makers in identifying an effective range of flexibility adjusted for cost effectiveness this classification approach permits the acquisition of information about the most relevant criteria that delineate the objects in the form of if then resulting in a set of decisional rules as outputs these if then rules are simply translating the decision possibilities that irrigation system designers are facing if the design is more flexible by this amount then we expect this range of cost increment which are easy to interpret and decide on in the present study the drsa is denoted as the classification model fig 2 and is applied according to the following procedure błaszczyński et al 2013 boggia et al 2014 greco et al 2016 2001 roma et al 2020 2 3 1 setting the decision tables the drsa application starts from a data matrix code in which the rows include the objects and indicate the values of criteria for each corresponding object while the columns include the criteria and indicate the values of each corresponding criterion for the objects this data matrix is a 4 tuple decision table s u q v f where u is a finite set of objects q is a finite set of criteria v q q v q where v q is the domain of the criterion q and f u q v is an information function such that f x q v q for every x q u q hence a set q is divided into condition criteria set c ø and the decision criterion class d note that f x q is an evaluation of object x on criterion q c while f x d is the class assignment decision value of the object the domain of a criterion q q is assumed to be completely pre ordered by an outranking relation q x q y meaning that x is at least as good as outranks y with respect to the criterion q without loss of generality it is assumed that the domain of q is a subset of reals v q r and that the outranking relation is a simple order between real numbers such that the following relation holds x q y f x q f y q this relation is straight forward for the gain type criterion i e the more the better whereas this relation can be satisfied by negating the values from v q for the cost type criterion i e the less the better our datasets have integrated decision tables representing the irrigation systems subject of this study the data matrix code contains three sets of objects attributes a u preferences p v and decisions s s therefore for any given combination in the condition attributes a which represents the design assumptions a eh r p q a unique decision attribute which is the cost increment of the project is allocated s low medium high very high besides the decision maker preference p is assigned to each condition attribute as a gain type or cost type criterion which helps to link the condition criteria to the decision criteria through this preference information in this context the elasticity at the hydrant e h is assigned a gain type preference because the higher the value of elasticity e h the higher the price of the project the coefficient of utilisation of the network r is assigned a cost type preference because the lower the coefficient of utilization of the network the higher the estimated price of the project and the operation quality parameter p q is assigned a gain preference since the higher the value of p q the higher the price of the project the input information related to each system was elaborated using the software jmaf developed by the laboratory of intelligent decision support systems poznań university of technology poland błaszczyński et al 2011 2013 the domain of the decision criterion v d consists of n elements hence without loss of generality it is assumed that v d t with t 1 n v d induces a partition of u into n classes cl cl t t t where cl t x u f x d t each object x u is assigned to one and only one class the classes are preference ordered according to an increasing order of class indices i e for all r s t such that r s the objects from cl r are strictly preferred to the objects from cl s for this reason we can consider the upward and downward unions of classes defined respectively as 4 cl t s t cl s cl t s t cl s t 1 n t 2 3 2 defining the dominance cones the approximation of upward and downward unions of decision classes is represented by granules of knowledge that are generated by the criteria these granules are also defined as dominance cones in the criteria values space in particular x dominates y with respect to p c denoted by x d p y if x is better than y on every criterion from p x q y q p for each p c the dominance relation d p is reflexive and transitive namely it is a partial pre order given p c and x u the granules of knowledge used for approximation in drsa are as follows a set of objects dominating x called p dominating set and given by d p x y u y d p x and a set of objects dominated by x called p dominated set and given by d p x y u x d p y 2 3 3 computing the approximations of ordered decision classes the p lower and the p upper approximation of cl t t t with respect to p c denoted as p cl t and p cl t are defined as 5 p cl t x u d p x cl t 6 p cl t x u d p x cl t ø in the same way the p lower and the p upper approximation of cl t t t with respect to p c denoted as p cl t and p cl t are defined as 7 p cl t x u d p x cl t 8 p cl t x u d p x cl t ø the lower approximations group contains the objects that belong certainly to a class union cl t respectively cl t indeed object x u belongs to the lower approximation p cl t respectively p cl t if no other object in u contradicts the claim that every object x u that p dominates x also belong to the class union cl t respectively cl t the upper approximations group contains the objects that could belong to cl t respectively cl t since object x u belongs to the upper approximation p cl t respectively p cl t if there is another object y u p dominated by x from a class union cl t respectively cl t the p lower and p upper approximations satisfy the following properties for all t t and any p c 9 p cl t x u d p x cl t 10 p cl t cl t p cl t consequently the p boundaries i e p doubtful regions of cl t and cl t are defined as 11 bn p cl t p cl t p cl t 12 bn p cl t p cl t p cl t 2 3 4 sorting the quality of approximations and the reduction of attributes for every p f the quality of approximation of the ordinal classification cl by a set of attributes p is defined as the ratio of the number of objects consistent with the dominance principle and the number of all the objects in u therefore the ratio 13 γ p cl u t t bn p cl t t t bn p cl t u defines the quality of approximation of the partition cl into classesusing the set of criteria p this ratio expresses the relationship between all the correctly classified objects and all the objects in the decision table furthermore every minimal sub set p c such that γ p cl γ c cl is called a reduct of c and is denoted by red cl a decision table may have more than one reduct the intersection of all reducts is known as core cl the criteria in this core cannot be removed without affecting the quality of approximation thus there are three categories of criteria i indispensable criteria included in the core ii exchangeable criteria included in some reducts but not in the core and iii redundant criteria neither indispensable nor exchangeable which are not included in any reduct 2 3 5 generating the decisional rules based on the approximations obtained by the dominance relations it is possible to describe the preferential information included in the table in terms of decision rules these rules are expressed in the form if then which indicates a dependency between condition criteria and decision criteria the windy gap firming project is a collaboration between 12 northeastern colorado water providers to address water shortages and improve the reliability of water supplies the 12 participants represent different stakeholders with different preferences to consider nine municipalities two water districts and one power provider to address this shortage designers have used multiple approaches accounting for multiple criteria alternatives and preferences including conservation plans alternative transfer methods with farms water reuse and providing additional supplies municipal subdistrict northern colorado water conservancy 2018 this is the reason why procedures for generating decision rules should always follow an inductive learning principle in the present study we used only the certain rules that represent the certain knowledge extracted from the data which have the following form p s the variables reported in the following formats r q 1 r 2 r 1 r qp are unrelated to the network s coefficient of utilization previously stated if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x cl t if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x cl t where p q 1 q p c r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p possible rules have a similar syntax but the consequent part of the rule has a different form if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x could belong to cl t if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q p r p then x could belong to cl t where p q 1 q p c r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p on the other hand the approximate rules have the following syntax if f x q 1 r 1 and f x q 2 r 2 and f x q k r k and f x q k 1 r k 1 and f x q k 2 r k 2 and f x q p r p then x cl s cl s 1 cl t where o q k 2 q p c o q 1 q k c o o p r q 1 r qp v q 1 v q 2 v q p and s t 1 n such that s t a set of decision rules is complete when it covers all objects from the decision table in such a way that consistent objects are re classified to their original classes and inconsistent objects are classified into clusters of classes referring to this inconsistency moreover a set of decision rules is called minimal if is complete and non redundant so that the exclusion of any rule from this set makes it non complete several algorithms can be used for the induction of decision rules among these algorithms the dominance based learning from examples module domlem błaszczyński et al 2011 enables the generation of a minimal set of rules 3 results 3 1 iteration and cost normalization the parameters adopted from the design assessment of the seven modernized irrigation systems were considered as existing sets and their associated costs were referred to as baselines any incremental cost incurred as a result of any sequential change of the condition alternatives e h r and p q in comparison to the baseline was recorded as a percentage then the increment was normalized into four bins low moderate high and very high as illustrated in table 1 the cost increment was classified using a very basic statistical method called the quartile which performs a division of observations into n defined intervals based on the values of the data and how they compare to the entire set of observations in this context the quartile splits data into three points a lower quartile median and upper quartile to form four groups of the dataset low medium high and very high the normalization allocates a 0 increment to all the irrigation sectors while in the baseline for the low category an average interval of 0 13 is assigned to the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 0 6 to the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors the medium bin ranges from 12 19 for the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 6 12 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors the bin high ranges from 19 33 for the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors and from 12 24 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors finally any cost increments exceeding 24 for the mehrine east sidi neji mansoura east and habibia sectors are categorized as very high as are the bir aouini mehrine west and mansoura west sectors if the cost exceeds 33 the reasons behind this difference in cost increment ranges are the total area served the difference in elevations and the number of users hydrants in each sector 3 2 calculation of the unions of approximations at this level it is important to understand a priori which types of rules are needed first three types of rules are available certain possible and approximate in particular certain rules are generated from lower approximations of unions of classes and possible rules are generated from upper approximations of unions of classes while approximate rules are generated from boundary regions however in this work we decided to only use certain rules furthermore any significant difference between the lower and upper approximation unions of classes may lead to the uncertainty of incorrect or ambiguous results the calculation results of the standard unions of approximations corresponding to all of the sectors are plotted in table 2 a strong match in the number of objects supporting the rules from the upper and lower approximations is illustrated which shows the high accuracy of the resulting rules 3 3 drsa application the classification model one of the first steps when using the mcda is to set the decision tables which is based on understanding the relationship between the decision variables and preference criteria the more the better or the less the better in this context the elasticity at the hydrant e h is assigned a gain type preference because the higher the value of elasticity e h the higher the price of the project the coefficient of utilisation of the network r is assigned a cost type preference because the lower the coefficient of utilization of the network the higher the estimated price of the project and the operation quality parameter p q is assigned a gain preference since the higher the value of p q the higher the price of the project the second step is the calculation of dominance cones p dominating sets and p dominated sets the drsa unions and their approximations then the model assigns the final dominance relation between objects an object a is non dominated in set u pareto optimal if and only if there is no other object b in set u such that b is not worse than a on all considered criteria and strictly better on at least one criterion finally the relationship between the parameters of elasticity and their associated cost is classified by applying the domlem algorithm błaszczyński et al 2011 based on the drsa approach this algorithm extracts certain decisional rules by identifying the parameters that most influence the cost the rules are sorted into two categories that characterize the classes of the decision low medium high and very high for instance the at least rules indicate the smallest that is possible or likely e g if e h 3 then the result could be at least medium while at most rules indicate the maximum that is possible or likely e g if e h 5 then the result could be at most high the approach was applied to seven different irrigation systems where each system includes 21 different combination of the design parameters and the results revealed 26 decisional rules that are illustrated in table 3 according to their decision class all the rules shown in table 3 are dependent on each other therefore any interpretation of a single rule does not reflect the decision class borders the first rule proposes a wide range of possibilities if the elasticity e h 2 5 then the cost may be at least low the range is made narrow with the next rule announcing that if the elasticity e h 3 then the cost may be at least medium rules 6 and 7 claim two different and true conditions within the same decision class of high the second declares that if only the elasticity e h 4 then the cost increment may be at least high and the third says that if e h 4 and p q 95 then the cost increment may be at least high similar outcomes generated with rules 8 and 9 always in the same class high and with rules 15 and 16 in the class very high clearly demonstrate that the operation quality parameter p q has only a minor effect on the cost increment and decision class no at most rules were generated for the very high class since it is the ultimate class decided in this framework 3 4 the reclassification inaccuracies while generating the rules may yield misleading and unbalanced results many large scale projects have realized that checking the efficiency classification model is an important task because it allows for a more detailed analysis than a mere proportion of accuracy for instance with the windy gap firming project in colorado thirteen water providers entered the formal federal permitting process for the windy gap firming project the subdistrict published an alternatives report detailing 170 methods to potentially accomplish project goals which were then narrowed down to seven municipal subdistrict northern colorado water conservancy 2018 the reclassification is performed by computing the confusion matrix basically the confusion matrix summarizes the classification performance of a classifier algorithm with respect to a dataset this is a two dimensional matrix where each row represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class ting 2011 therefore the analysis of the confusion matrix enables to obtain the overall accuracy of classification as the ratio between the correct classified instances reported along the diagonal of the matrix and all the instances and it can be expressed as a percentage li et al 2011 table 4 illustrates the classification accuracy of the drsa obtained by the confusion matrices of the irrigation systems the matrices returned a very reliable classification and thus robust results as the classification accuracy ranges between 76 2 and 100 in all the irrigation systems nevertheless the confusion matrix and the overall accuracy do not take into account the ambiguous cases because they can neither be reassigned to their original decision class nor reclassified the ambiguous cases may occur due to significant differences between lower and upper approximations of the unions of decision classes and also to weak decision rules i e rules supported by few objects from lower approximations greco matarazzo slowinski 2016 the rules generating both incorrect and ambiguous cases are dismissed from the graphical representation fig 3 table 4 explains the reclassification results in which one ambiguous rule seemed to include both low and medium decisions in its regulations the case is recorded in the mehrine east system within the class medium three ambiguous rules are responding to low medium and high decisions at the same time these rules are all recorded in the mehrine east system two rules within the high class recorded in mehrine east and mansoura east systems are also classified as ambiguous as they are responding to the both medium and high decisions synchronically finally one incorrect rule is registered in the very high decision recorded in the sidi neji mansoura east and habibia systems 3 5 graphical representation of the rules graphical representation refers to the use of graphs to visually display analyse clarify and interpret numerical data functions and other qualitative structures fig 3 displays the exported rules corresponding to each system in a worksheet plot an x y data object is a two dimensional array of data the type of graphical representation used in this context is a heatmap heatmaps display information in a two dimensional grid of cells and each cell represents a grouping of data the cell colour indicates the relative value which is the project s cost increment in this study four colours are considered in this framework green yellow orange and red representing the classes of a low medium high and very high cost increment respectively the x versus y graph stores in its two columns the generated rules confirmed to be correct where the x column represents the elasticity e h and the y column represents the coefficient of utilization r the operation quality parameter p q is not considered in the graphical representation as it was confirmed to have a minor effect on the cost the approach provides fundamentals in identifying the suitable strategy of elasticity allocation according to the budget therefore selecting a single x and y data outcome sorts a graph cell that displays the associated cost according to the related flexibilities the graphical representation shows the sensitivity of the cost to the elasticity at the hydrant e h more than the coefficient of utilization of the network for any assigned coefficient of utilization r an elasticity e h of less than 3 would result in a low cost increment when the elasticity is equal to 3 the related cost increases as the network coefficient changes the medium cost increase appears with an elasticity of 4 and 5 only when the network s coefficient of utilization is equal to or greater than 18 24 however the very high cost increment class occurs with an elasticity of 5 6 when the network s coefficient of utilization is equal to or less than 16 24 4 discussion the findings of this research are intended to help water planners identify the correlation between design flexibility parameters that will help achieve a good service to users ratepayers with the least amount of associated expenses first the elasticity at the hydrant e h defines the flexibility assigned at the hydrant level farmer this flexibility means that the nominal discharge of the hydrants d should be selected much higher than the duty d allowing farmers to irrigate for a duration less than 24 h this condition implies that the higher the elasticity assigned at hydrant the larger the selected pipe sizes and eventually the higher the cost of the system the network s coefficient of utilization defines the flexibility at the system level in an irrigation system operating on demand and should have a value equal to one because in reality the system is operating 24 h per day the study showed that a system with a lower network coefficient of utilization costs more than a system with a higher coefficient of utilization from a design standpoint this is confirmed because we build a system to satisfy the same downstream demand in fewer operational hours so the pipe size and corresponding price will be larger the present study provides a simplistic mathematical model based on the multiple criteria decision analysis which explains how the flexibility in the design of irrigation systems can influence the project s economic outcomes other technics were similarly used to address this issue such as scenario based planning multistage scenario trees multistage decision analysis and bayesian techniques for instance scenario based planning has gained a lot of acceptance in the water resources community preparing a range of possible futures provides flexibility and adds robustness to the system so it can respond to uncertain events at reasonable costs while maintaining community confidence in their utilities kang and lansey 2013 applied the scenario based multi objective optimization model to regional scale water and wastewater infrastructure design in the southeast of tucson arizona the study involved seven scenarios representing potential system growth variations along the planning time horizon and results showed that the flexible planning process reduces the regret costs by 30 kang and lansey 2013 many authors used scenario based planning to tackle the cost effectiveness of flexible design as an approach to adapt to future uncertainties such as hadjikakou et al 2019 herman et al 2015 kang and lansey 2014 on the other hand erfani et al 2018 used the multi stage decision analysis to inform about least cost capacity expansion scheduling through multistage stochastic mathematical programming applied to london s water system the results showed that ignoring adaptive planning cost 15 4 of the total net present value and considering flexible decision making had a value of 6 of the total net present value of london s water supply system erfani et al 2018 fletcher et al 2019 developed a new planning framework that assesses the potential to learn about flexible approaches applied to a real problem in the water supply system in mombasa kenya using a bayesian statistical model the approach showed that the flexible dam design cost per m3 of additional capacity added was assumed to be 50 greater than that of the original capacity fletcher et al 2019 fletcher et al 2017 used probability based risk quantification which allows the evaluation and comparison of flexible design versus rigid design in a way that takes into account the diverse and multifaceted uncertainties water planners face the study was applied to a desalination plant in melbourne australia and results showed that in 10 of simulations rigid design lead to an overexpense of 10 us billion compared with a flexible desalination plant fletcher et al 2017 the methodology presented in this study provides a considerable understanding of the different levels of flexibility in the cost and the design process in the field of irrigation systems rather than concluding that a final solution is better than the others this is why it seemed important in this work to illustrate the main limitations of the multiple criteria decision analysis as well as opportunities to improve and extend the approach of flexibility in the design of irrigation water system planning first the present research has only considered one planning objective which is to find a compromise between the flexibility and the final cost of the project in reality planners and stakeholders may have other objectives and preferences as well such as energy intensity maintaining ecosystem services equitable distribution and access water quality etc one notable objective that is not addressed in this work is the reliability of the irrigation water systems despite the fact that it is an important objective in evaluating the cost effectiveness of flexible investments second the types and goals of flexibility are addressed in this tunisian case study in other literature flexible planning has been considered as the timing of capacity additions or even the volume of capacity additions to a system or an infrastructure in this work we provide an approach to assess the value of flexibility as a strategy for achieving reliable planning that satisfies users and planners and proves that it is a worthwhile goal however the application of this method across a wider range of many different water systems supply systems desalination plans fletcher et al 2019 hydro power systems etc or maybe other planning alternatives could enable the identification of properties of water systems that enable the high value of flexibility third the model has a quite specific representation of the decision rules if then it might be non standard and does not support a hierarchical structure of the decision criteria but it rather corresponds directly to how human experts typically make decisions fourth the monotonicity problem this constraint occurs when the value sets of attributes and the predefined classes are preference ordered and there exist monotonic relationships between condition and decision attributes fifth the choice problem related to the multiple objective optimizations occurs when the set of objects is infinite and defined by the constraints of a mathematical program sixth the discrete choice problem occurs when the set of objects is finite and reasonably small enough to be listed future work and options are to extend the framework to incorporate social and institutional issues more thoroughly such as local energy cost fluctuations this work has represented decisions from the standpoint of a single planner concentrating on realistic options that the planner has the authority to implement in reality many various actors interact with water resource systems and the planner s actions might impact the behavior of other actors and vice versa moreover the methodologies and ideas used in this dissertation could be applied to various disciplines of study many other engineering systems fields such as energy or transportation deal with infrastructure planning with many decision criteria and changing uncertainties the paradigm given here could be applied to a broad variety of systems in particular it could be applied to other infrastructure systems whose performance is impacted by future uncertainties to assess the value of flexible approaches to managing risk 5 conclusions and recommendations success in solving today s water management challenges for future generations requires a data informed plan and water planners with the ability to consider the fundamental concepts algorithms techniques and info tools that could be applied to this data to assist with or inform particular problem solving as systematic thinking fosters success in data driven decision making in this context the pattern extraction process concerning the flexibility afforded to the design of a large scale irrigation system and its associated cost is investigated with well defined stages from a give and take perspective understanding this process and its stages helps water managers to structure problem solving to consider uncertainty and to create well informed suitable designs that meet users needs to this aim seven large scale pressurized irrigation systems in the manouba region of tunisia operating under on demand service and designed according to the clément formula are considered as the context of the application of the current study in this analysis we present a simplified model that allows us to easily understand how the elasticity at the hydrant interacts with the coefficient of utilization from different networks to influence economic outcomes for project realization in the field of irrigation systems first an iteration based process of the design hypothesis was performed which generated the final cost of each system associated with a single run of iteration twenty one iterations were recorded relative to each of the seven systems assigning a different combination of elasticity to every iteration made second a classification model permits the acquisition of posterior information about the most relevant combination defining the outcome in the form of if then resulting in a set of 26 decisional rules the methodology applied helps to extract certain decisional rules by identifying the parameters that most influence the cost of a project the rules are sorted into two categories at least and at most rules which characterize the classes of the decision low medium high and very high for instance at least rules indicate the smallest conceivable or probable cost that may occur when altering the elasticity whereas at most rules indicate the greatest cost that may occur when altering the elasticity these two categories set the intervals min and max of the decision classes the results showed that some rules would present two different and true conditions within the same decision class for example the second rule declares that if only the elasticity e h 4 then the cost increment may be at least high and the third rule says that if e h 4 and p q 95 then the cost increment may be at least high as well similarly the results from other examples show that the operation quality parameter p q has only a minor effect on the cost increment and the decision class afterward these rules were reclassified using the confusion matrix model and the results were plotted in a heatmap graphical representation the reclassification resulted in 19 correct elements six 06 ambiguous elements and one 01 incorrect element which indicates the efficiency and high consistency of the classification model the results revealed the sensitivity of cost to the elasticity at the hydrant e h more than the coefficient of utilization of the network any elasticity e h less than 3 associated with any given r would result in a low cost increment the cost increases as the coefficient r decreases for any given value of e h an elasticity of 4 5 associated with a network s coefficient r equal to or greater than 18 24 leads to a medium cost increment finally any e h from 5 to 6 associated with an r equal or less than 16 24 would result in a very high cost increment this methodology provides a considerable understanding of the different levels of flexibility in the cost and the design process rather than concluding that a final solution is better than the others trade offs likely exist between achieving mathematical optimality and presenting options to decision makers yet this approach provides an interactive representation that helps in identifying the appropriate range of flexibility justified with the expense

9342,water harvesting has a long history but still plays an important role today by increasing crop productivity combatting erosion and improving water supplies geographical information systems gis are used extensively to assess the suitability of sites for water harvesting but available tools fail to consider the synoptic topography of sites here we report the creation of a novel automated tool sitefinder that evaluates potential locations by automatically calculating site specific information including structure parameters height length and volume and descriptors of the zone affected by the structure storage capacity and area of influence and the catchment area innovatively compared to existing tools of this kind sitefinder works within a gis environment thus it allows the possibility of combining its outputs with larger multi criteria decision making processes to consider other bio physical socio economic and environmental factors it utilises a digital elevation model dem and automatically analyses thousands of potential sites computing site characteristics for different barrier heights that are dependent on the surrounding topography it outputs values of eight parameters to aid planners in assessing the characteristics of sites as to their suitability for water harvesting we conducted case studies using 30 30 m gridded dems to automatically evaluate several thousand sites and by filtering the tool outputs successfully identified sites with characteristics appropriate for scenarios at three spatial scales large dams for nationally significant water supply reservoirs 383 sites analysed 5 filtered sites with barriers up to 30 m in height large gully erosion control dams for regional scale interventions 4 586 sites analysed 6 filtered sites with barriers up to 3 6 m in height and local community based earth embankment projects 801 sites analysed 6 filtered sites with barriers up to 2 m in height a higher resolution 1 1 m terrain elevation model derived from open source airborne survey data was used to assess the veracity of these results correlations between the barrier length impounded area and storage volume capacity derived from the two different resolution data sets were all strongly significant spearman s rank correlation p 0 001 and normalised root mean square errors were 9 15 and 16 for these parameters respectively keywords water harvesting gis digital elevation model remote sensing drylands data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction there is evidence that civilisations constructed water harvesting structures over four millennia ago critchley and siegert 1991 yet water harvesting continues to be widely used and the focus of ongoing research abdullah et al 2020 adham et al 2019 farswan et al 2019 haile and suryabhagavan 2019 it is practised primarily in arid and semi arid regions bruins et al 1986 boers 1994 wang et al 2008 where it is valuable as a way of bridging dry spells rockström and falkenmark 2015 and has been estimated to have the potential to increase crop production by up to 100 piemontese et al 2020 depending on the location and design water harvesting structures can serve different purposes for example for the promotion of tree or crop cultivation mekdaschi and liniger 2013 artificial recharge of aquifers abdalla and al rawahi 2013 şen et al 2013 erosion control li et al 2018 surface water storage sayl et al 2019 or sub surface water storage forzieri et al 2008 some form of water treatment american water works association 2006 logsdon 2008 siabi 2008 panagopoulos 2021 will probably be required when harvested water is intended for domestic industrial use with the type of treatment dependent on the water quality problem cairncross and feachem 1993 binnie et al 2018 water harvesting structures vary from small pits or soil bunds made using hand tools to earth embankments over a kilometre in length built with the aid of machinery all water harvesting structures aim to reduce runoff and thus increase water storage depending on the technique implemented water storage may take place in the soil below the surface within introduced material such as sand in surface water reservoirs or in storage tanks water harvesting techniques are described as external when they collect water originating from rainfall that has fallen elsewhere while in situ water harvesting involves collecting rainfall on the surface where it falls helmreich and horn 2009 many previous studies have used geographical information systems gis to find potential locations for water harvesting structures without the need for field visits e g padmavathy et al 1993 al adamat 2008 ziadat et al 2012 kadam et al 2012 krois and schulte 2014 al khuzaie et al 2020 these methods invariably bring together different datasets from remote sensing and digitised maps often combined with hydrological modelling and explore the decision making space within the gis environment when deciding if a location is appropriate for water harvesting there are numerous biophysical and socio economic criteria to consider in a review of 48 studies adham et al 2016 identified nine biophysical criteria and nine socio economic criteria that can be used to help assess the suitability of potential sites for water harvesting examples of biophysical criteria include rainfall tumbo et al 2014 and drainage network metrics salih and al tarif 2012 while examples of socio economic criteria include population density mati et al 2006 and distance to crops de winnaar et al 2007 adham et al 2016 found that slope was the most common biophysical criterion used to identify water harvesting sites with 79 of all studies using slope as a criterion while only 55 of all studies used rainfall as a criterion in all studies the slope data used is defined on a point by point basis with flatter locations being identified as preferential for water harvesting locations however slope defined on a point by point basis does not consider the synoptic topography or surrounding relief which is crucial for identifying the potential of water harvesting locations moreover while it may offer relevant information on the suitability of potential sites it fails to provide the dimensions of necessary impounding structures bunds or embankments and the storage geometry they would create automated tools working outside a gis environment have been developed that consider the synoptic topography of potential sites and provide details of impounding structures and storage zones for example petheram et al 2017 created a novel set of algorithms to aid the siting of dams by providing dam and reservoir dimensions wimmer et al 2019 introduced an automated method using contours to detect potential reservoir locations by calculating dam length and reservoir volume and teschemacher et al 2020 describes an open source matlab tool for determining dam and basin properties wang et al 2021 reviewed dam siting methods and found that the majority were gis based so it is argued that the siting tool introduced in this paper which operates entirely within a gis environment will be of value to those involved in water harvesting site selection open source digital elevation models dems are commonly used in selecting water harvesting sites typically those used have a gridded resolution no finer than 30 m 30 m higher resolution dems are available but usually at significant and in many cases prohibitive cost schumann and bates 2018 argued for freely available dems with global coverage higher resolution and increased accuracy as open source dems are poorly suited for many local scale hydrologic applications however higher spatial resolution brings with it a problem for methods based on point by point defined variables in that the higher the resolution the smaller each pixel becomes in relation to the land affected by a water harvesting structure thus while there is an incentive to use higher resolution dems for enhanced hydrologic modelling this reduces the appropriateness of methods that rely on parameters defined on a point by point basis such as the slope variable identified by adham et al 2016 that have been widely used hitherto the aim of the present study has been to provide a bridge between the point based slope criteria calculated in a gis environment adopted by many researchers for water harvesting site selection and the automated methods that consider the surrounding topography of potential sites but work outside a gis environment petheram et al 2017 wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 this was approached by creating a gis tool sitefinder that can aid the siting of water harvesting structures by considering the synoptic topography of potential sites the intended output of this approach is information about the length and height of potential impounding structures barriers hereinafter and details of the areas of water storage they could create upstream of themselves in essence this is a similar approach to existing methods used to estimate the storage capacity of ponds usda 1997 and small dams stephens 2010 in so much as the area of water storage and the barrier height are used to compute predicted storage volume the tool was designed to calculate the catchment area of each water harvesting structure since there is a correlation between catchment area and runoff efficiency karnieli et al 1988 boers and ben asher 1982 and the catchment area to cultivation area ratio is important for water harvesting sites designed for crop production critchley and siegert 1991 finally the tool was developed such that for every location analysed as a potential site for water harvesting several barrier heights could be considered up to a user defined maximum height in summary the aim was to create an automated process capable of providing information on barrier size and water storage volumes for potential water harvesting sites that is not at present readily available within the convenient and widely used context of a gis environment the intention is that this could assist with scoping out potential sites with an accuracy sufficient for the pre feasibility stage of a project cycle it is envisaged that this would need to be used alongside other biophysical socio economic and environmental information as part of decision making processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 tool development the basic premise of sitefinder is to take a basin elevation model and for each site of interest compute the catchment area create an imaginary axis perpendicular to the flow direction and perform analysis based on how the axis intersects with the model surface for varying heights above the elevation of the site tool outputs were compared against those derived manually using a dam site ground survey and in addition the tool was used to evaluate thousands of sites and rank them based on relevant parameters the starting point for the developed tool is a raster based digital elevation model dem which provides the primary source of elevation data clearly the capability of the tool is in part dependent on the quality and resolution of the dem used this is considered further below but it is described here with reference to a generic dem of no specific quality or resolution sitefinder is enacted using an arcpy script within arcgis pro through a series of steps described below it processes the dem and creates outputs comprising information on the barrier length height location and orientation the storage area the barrier would create and the volume of the storage created firstly since the dem may contain imperfections a fill tool is used to remove any sinks spurious regions of lower elevation the next step creates a flow direction raster fig 1 flow direction using the filled dem as the input flow direction is defined as the direction from each cell to the steepest downslope neighbouring cell the flow direction raster is then used to produce a flow accumulation raster fig 1 flow accumulation where flow accumulation is defined as the number of cells that flow into each downstream cell subsequently only cells in the flow accumulation raster with values that fall within a range defined by the user prior to running the tool based on the minimum and maximum catchment areas are kept while other cells are set to no data the amended flow accumulation raster which effectively represents a stream network is then used together with the flow direction raster to create a stream order raster fig 1 stream network stream order which classifies each cell using strahler stream ordering whereby the uppermost headwater channels in a network are denoted first order second order streams are those that result from the confluence of two or more first order streams third order streams are those that result from the confluence of two or more second order streams and so on such that the largest trunk channels in a network have the highest order strahler 1957 the next step is to create siting points fig 1 siting points by creating a point located at the centre of every cell in the stream order raster by default all cells in the stream order raster become siting points but it is possible for the user to control which stream order cells become siting points barrier information is then calculated and added to the siting points database at every siting point the sitefinder script will if the topography allows create three barriers at different elevations labelled a b and c in order of increasing elevation the user defined maximum barrier height is used to calculate the barrier elevations first the maximum height is divided by three and the result converted to an integer this integer is the step change in elevation between each barrier barrier elevations are then calculated by rounding up the dem elevation at the siting point and adding the step change for example if the user enters a maximum barrier height of 10 m and the elevation at the siting point is 576 9 m then the first barrier contour a elevation will be 580 m 577 3 the second barrier contour b elevation will be 583 m 577 6 and third barrier contour c elevation will be 586 m 577 9 the barrier axes pass through the siting point with their direction set perpendicular to the siting point cell s flow direction and their length equal to half the user defined maximum barrier length on each side of the siting point fig 2 to determine the length of the top of each barrier and subsequently the area of water they could impound the points at which the barrier meets the ground needs to be determined this requires putting the barrier axis direction into the context of the ground s topographic contours to achieve this the dem is used to create a triangulated irregular network tin fig 1 tin elevation surface from which a surface contour fig 1 contour shapefile is derived the points at which the top of each barrier intersects the ground are then determined by intersecting the axis shapefile with the contour shapefile producing intersect points fig 1 intersect points that are taken as the start and end points of the barrier each intersect point is linked with its associated siting point and barrier elevation a b or c by a contour label siting point reference that is added to the intersect points database creation of barrier lines then requires locating two intersect points with identical contour label siting point references on either side of a given siting point fig 2 the first of several scenarios that may be encountered in this process is that there is no intersect point created for a siting point at an elevation corresponding to any of the barriers a b or c this will occur if the land is too flat and the top of the proposed barrier would not meet the surrounding land within half of the user defined maximum barrier length from the siting point the second scenario is that an intersect point is unique in that there is no other intersect point with the same contour label siting point reference this case corresponds to the situation where the barrier top meets the ground as the latter rises up on one side of the siting point but the land is too flat or descending for this to happen within the maximum barrier length on the other side if either of these two scenarios occur the site is rejected the third scenario is that exactly two intersect points with the same contour label siting point reference are found one on each side of the siting point and the site is identified as a potential water harvesting site the final scenario is that more than two intersect points exist each having the same contour label siting point reference in these final cases sitefinder identifies multiple intersect points with identical contour label siting point references on the same side of the siting point and deletes the more distant ones the remaining intersect points are referred to as trimmed points fig 1 trimmed points and these sites are also thus identified as potential water harvesting sites the next step is to create a line representing the top of each barrier this is done using a points to line tool which uses the contour label siting point references to create a straight line running from one intersect point through the siting point to the corresponding intersect point on the other side if for any siting point there is no intersect point or just a single intersect point at an elevation corresponding to a b or c then no barrier is formed since to create a line requires two identical contour label siting point references since any more distant intersect points have been deleted barrier lines can only be formed using the two trimmed intersect points one on either side of each siting point these lines are stored as barrier shapefiles fig 1 barrier once the barrier lines have been created sitefinder then begins a loop processing one barrier at a time a polygon fig 1 polygon shapefile representing the area of water storage that each barrier would impound is created by combining the barrier line with a contour line that has the same contour identification reference as held in the barrier attribute field this polygon is intersected with the tin surface fig 1 tin to obtain the volume fig 1 volume impounded by each barrier for this to work each polygon is assigned an elevation value set to the elevation of the top of the barrier with which it is associated the loop process ends once every barrier has been analysed the polygons are then checked for artefacts created by closed contour lines which result in more than one polygon per barrier artefacts are removed by calculating the distance of each polygon centroid to the barrier and removing all polygons except the nearest the barrier shapefile is updated with the correct storage area and volume and secondary raster information from the polygon feature class each row in the barrier feature class represents a unique barrier and is linked to a unique polygon by a barrier reference an estimation of the height of each water harvesting structure is carried out by taking the elevation of the barrier and subtracting the lowest elevation under the barrier profile on the tin surface in a similar manner the flow accumulation for each structure is found by extracting the maximum flow accumulation value along the barrier line elementary information contained within the barrier feature class is used to calculate additional parameters for example catchment area to storage volume ratio useful for water harvesting site selection eq 1 is used to calculate the barrier volume i e the volume of material that makes up the barrier based on the geometry of a small earth dam nissen petersen 2006 where v is the barrier volume m3 h is the maximum height m of the barrier before settling l is the length m of the barrier crest c is the width m of the crest and s is the sum of the upstream and downstream slope to simplify the comparison of results the crest width was fixed at 0 25 m and the sum of upstream and downstream slopes fixed at 5 5 for all case study scenarios 1 v 0 216 hl 2 c hs 2 2 geometric validation of sitefinder to check that the fundamental geometrical aspects of the process described above were functioning as intended results produced by sitefinder from a shuttle radar topographic mission srtm void filled 3 arc seconds approximately 92 m grid resolution dem of an area in sudan fig 3 a were compared against results obtained manually using elevation data from an in situ differential geospatial positioning system dgps dam site survey mohammed 2018 the srtm elevation data earth resources observation and science eros center 2018b was selected as it is open access and the scale of the existing dam is far greater than a single 3 arc second grid cell the site is characterised by low to medium relief and srtm products are considered to have small vertical errors in such circumstances falorni et al 2005 before starting the processing a comparison of elevations between the srtm data fig 3 b and the dgps survey points was undertaken to establish the presence of any systematic vertical offset a plot of srtm elevation against the corresponding elevation from the dgps survey sm1 supplementary material confirmed the presence of such an offset the linear regression formula derived from this plot was applied to all dgps points the reduced vertical offset produced by this adjustment of the dgps data can be observed by comparing the srtm and adjusted dgps contour lines sm2 supplementary material a check was carried out to verify that the sitefinder script was producing realistic measurements for the polygon area of influence and volume storage capacity this was done by first selecting a barrier along with its associated polygon created by the script with the srtm input fig 3 c located within the boundary of the dgps survey a comparator barrier and its associated polygon was then created fig 3 d manually by forming a barrier at the same elevation and orientation as the srtm derived barrier and intersecting it with the adjusted dgps contours the storage volume that would be impounded by these two barriers were calculated the srtm sitefinder method gave a polygon area of 1 274 949 m2 and a storage volume of 2 053 581 m3 and the corresponding dgps manual process values were 1 278 310 m2 and 1 785 070 m3 respectively this is a less than 1 difference for area and an approximately 15 difference for volume in terms of area at least this difference demonstrates a strong level of consistency between the srtm and dgps derived results the 15 difference encountered when comparing the volumes may be explained by several factors including the period of 18 years between the srtm and dgps data acquisition the srtm survey is a digital surface model gallant et al 2012 which may have picked up the top of any vegetation or buildings rather than the ground while the elevation points for the dgps survey are of the dam structure and the ground surrounding the embankment only finally the distance between the survey points for the dgps ranged between 10 and 20 m and thus were better suited to capture relief features of the site compared to the 3 arc seconds srtm elevation product which resulted in a grid size of 92 92 m 2 3 application and validation to water harvesting scenarios to assess its performance in a previously unexamined context sitefinder was applied to a different study area with the intention of identifying locations within it that have favourable characteristics for siting water harvesting structures three scenarios were explored each one defined by constraints on the input parameters that resulted in a different scale of water harvesting structure being identified the study area used for this application is in central ethiopia between latitudes 8 155 8 206 n and longitudes 38 937 e to 39 046 e it covers an area of 68 4 km2 12 km 5 7 km and has an elevation range of slightly over 600 m fig 4 and is representative of the arid to semi arid regions where water harvesting techniques are most commonly implemented the digital elevation data to which the process was applied was taken from the 1 arc second global digital elevation product from the nasa space shuttle radar topography mission srtm which is freely available via the us geological survey earth resources observation and science eros center 2018a this is a digital surface model dsm rather than a digital terrain model dtm but offers good coverage of arid and semi arid regions and is often used for water harvesting site selection vema et al 2019 mugo and odera 2019 in scenario 1 the rationale was to imitate a national governmental department tasked with finding sites suitable for large dams with the primary purpose of creating water supply reservoirs candidate sites were sought that would be able to accommodate structures with a barrier height of over 15 m to meet a definition of a large dam icold cigb 2011 but not greater than 25 m other defined criteria included storage capacity in excess of 1 000 000 m3 and a storage volume to barrier volume ratio of at least ten the latter acting as an indicator of value for money finally the dam length was constrained to be no greater than 2 000 m the minimum and maximum catchment areas were set to 2 000 000 m2 and 9 000 000 m2 respectively following analysis of a flow accumulation raster to identify the most significant drainage channels within the aoi the search parameters are summarised in table 2 scenario 2 aimed to replicate the implementation of a water harvesting techniques at a scale of interest to planners at a regional level sitefinder was therefore used to search for sites suitable for large gully erosion control check dams classified when the gully depth is more than 5 m geyik 1986 the search parameters are summarised in table 3 scenario 3 was intended to resemble a community based project possibly supported by a non governmental organisation whose goal is to increase crop productivity by placing more agricultural land under flood the water harvesting structure considered therefore is in the form of earth embankment no more than 2 m in height intended to hold back runoff and as the dry season advances water loss through evaporation causes more land to become available for planting similar to some earth embankment dams in sudan zumrawi 2015 and comparable in purpose to the traditional teras system van dijk and ahmed 1993 niemeijer 1998 also found in sudan in this scenario embankments should be no more 400 m in length since the aim of project is to bring land under irrigation the desired feature of any site is the area of influence the saturated zone upstream of the barrier which should be a minimum of 10 000 m2 to identify locations that offer acceptable value for money barriers would only be considered viable if the area of influence to barrier volume ratio is equal or greater than one hundred the search parameters are summarised in table 4 2 4 high resolution dem to test the accuracy of the process using the 1 arc second resolution dsm it was repeated for each of the three scenarios using a higher resolution dem and the results compared the higher resolution dem was found using an open topography website opentopography 2008 and consisted of a 1 m 1 m resolution product obtained using a lidar instrument by the uk natural environment research council airborne research and survey facility airborne research and survey facility 2009 the comparison of results from the two elevation data products was carried out using a modified version of sitefinder so that while the siting points and axis directions were derived from the srtm dsm the actual barriers and storage volumes were created on a lidar dtm elevation surface this approach allowed a comparison of barriers and impoundments to be made for barriers formed at the same location in the same direction and of a similar height but using elevation models of different resolutions thereby isolating the effects of the resolution change from the matching pairs of barrier data three parameters were analysed to assess the comparison of the srtm based results and the lidar based results barrier length area of influence and storage volume were chosen since these metrics play a significant role in the water harvesting site selection either directly or indirectly and they cover dimensions of length area and volume comparisons of these parameters from the two elevation data products were carried out using spearman s rank correlation tests and root mean square error rmse analysis 3 results 3 1 high resolution dem the modified version of sitefinder identified 903 barriers in the lidar dtm these were compared against barriers identified in the srtm dsm however since there is a difference between the two elevation models not all barriers with a shared siting point and contour reference formed on the lidar dtm model were also formed on the srtm dsm surface barriers sharing the same siting point the same contour reference and formed on both elevation models were matched the results of the statistical comparisons of parameters derived from each dem are presented in table 1 charts of each metric are provided in supplementary materials 3 2 scenario 1 case study large dam the results for scenario 1 are presented in table 2 in total sitefinder identified 383 siting points and created 376 barriers the initial desired minimum storage volume was set at 1 106 m3 while sitefinder outputted barriers with a maximum storage volume 13 9 106 m3 and since storage volume was considered to be an important metric it was decided to increase the minimum storage volume so a filter was applied resulting in only barriers with a storage volume equal or greater than 10 106 m3 were included in the final barrier list the storage to barrier volume ratio sbvr for some barriers fell well below the desired ratio of ten so these were removed by applying a filter resulting in the filtered barriers having a sbvr not less than 15 4 consequently only five barriers remained although these were all associated with different siting points those point were all clustered together thus effectively a single site was identified fig 5 the ranges of values of parameters defining the identified barriers and impoundments are shown in table 2 this information could be used to inform decisions as to whether it would be worthwhile investigating sites as potential water harvesting locations in this scenario planners would observe that the catchment area to storage volume ratio is no greater than 0 5 m2m 3 for any of the identified barrier locations and may conclude this is insufficient to generate the inflows needed to fill the dam and hence decide not to pursue the site as a location for a large dam for comparison papenfus 2003 describes three potential dams with catchment area to storage volume ratio ranging from 69 to 122 m2m 3 drought reserve dams should have a catchment area to storage volume ratio from 50 to 100 m2m 3 agriculture victoria 2020 and nissen petersen 2006 details a dam design with a catchment area to water storage volume of 333 m2m 3 3 3 scenario 2 case study gulley check dam the results from scenario 2 are presented in table 3 sitefinder identified only 23 barriers from a total of 4586 siting points analysed of these some had very low sbvrs a filter was applied that removed all those with svbr 2 5 resulting in six barriers at different siting points across the study area although two barriers are located in the same gully separated by only 30 m while the filtered barriers met the desired parameter ranges for barrier length and catchment area they all fell outside the desired range for the parameters of catchment area to storage volume ratio 15 m 1 and barrier height 5 7 m from the results of the filtered barriers the ranges of storage volume catchment area and barrier height were 900 000 2300 000 m3 60 000 200 000 m2 and 3 3 6 m respectively ettazarini 2021 describes small check dams having a storage volume up to 500 000 m3 while geyik 1986 defines medium sized gully dams having a catchment area range of 20 000 200 000 m2 and a range of gully depth of 1 5 m so while the intention was to locate large gully check dams sitefinder results appear to show that sites for medium sized check dams have been identified the six filtered barriers located in a total of five gullies together with the respective area of influence and catchment area of each barrier are shown in fig 6 3 4 scenario 3 case study earth embankment the results for scenario 3 are presented in table 4 in total 801 siting points were analysed as potential sites for earth embankments resulting in potential barriers a barrier height filter was applied so that all barriers would be at least 1 m and no greater than 2 m placing a maximum limit on the height of filtered barriers of just 2 m increases the prospect that the construction could be accomplished using local oversight and labour as the work is technically less demanding than constructing higher embankments a high proportion 508 from a total 1 771 of outputted barriers had a sbvr ranging from zero to almost three so a filter equal or greater than 3 was applied to ensure these barriers were not included in the final list selected barriers in this scenario the purpose of the water harvesting structure is to provide irrigated land immediately upstream of the barrier i e the area of influence so a condition was applied to ensure that all filtered barriers provided at least 100 m2 of irrigated land for every cubic metre of embankment constructed this demonstrates the capacity of sitefinder to output a socio economic criterion since the area of influence to barrier volume ratio is an indicator of value for money a catchment area to storage volume ratio filter was applied that set an upper limit of 15 m 1 as a way of controlling the amount of runoff a water harvesting site would receive the rationale behind such a filter is that planners may wish to avoid sites where excess runoff might require expensive technical solutions and focus on sites where excess runoff is less problematic of the seven barriers filtered from the initial 1 771 barriers the sbvr was found to range from 234 to 1 374 table 4 sitefinder calculates the storage to include the volume of any natural depressions i e pools should they occur within the area of influence together with storage created as a direct result of the barrier sitefinder is able to compute the volume of natural depressions as it computes site geometry based on a tin surface fig 1 created using a dem that has not been filled to remove sinks table 4 shows the range of parameter values for both the total unfiltered 1 771 barriers and the seven filtered barriers the final filtered barriers all of which meet the desired criteria table 4 are distributed in three distinct clusters fig 7 4 discussion the case studies demonstrate how sitefinder can analyse automatically thousands of potential external water harvesting sites within a gis environment and provide useful information e g barrier volume and storage capacity using a digital elevation raster as the primary data source the automated method runs entirely within the gis environment and provides information for site selection purposes e g barrier dimensions and storage geometry which cannot be obtained from a slope raster which is most the common type of dataset currently used by researchers for water harvesting site selection adham et al 2016 bespoke software and tools petheram et al 2017 wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 do exist that automate the process of extracting dam details for potential sites but all function outside a gis environment damsite petheram et al 2017 is a bespoke software that uses algorithms and a pixel based process to obtain dam site information but not provide polygons of the area of influence and cannot be applied to very small basins teschemacher et al 2020 wimmer et al 2019 used a point cloud processing software opals with outputs stored in a gis vector dataset but their results do not include details of barrier volume and catchment area an open source matlab tool developed by teschemacher et al 2020 requires the user to incorporate all criteria e g settlement area in order for sites with the best potential to be identified the sitefinder tool described here does not aim to provide the answer to where the best water harvesting sites are but rather provides relevant barrier characteristics calculated within the gis environment allowing the possibility of readily incorporating results into a multi criteria decision making process again using the gis environment which would allow the consideration of other biophysical socio economic and environmental factors integral to the functioning of sitefinder is the use of flow direction to determine the orientation of the barrier set perpendicular to flow direction which is an innovative feature for an automated water harvesting site selection process this has the benefit of allowing sitefinder to scan a higher number of locations as processing time required to optimise barrier orientation is avoided unlike some site selection tools wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 sitefinder considers catchment area catchment area is related to runoff efficiency karnieli et al 1988 and the volume of runoff a water harvesting site will receive sitefinder calculates catchment area and uses it to search for potential sites and outputs water harvesting site characteristics including catchment area to cultivation area critchley and siegert 1991 this implies that if data on annual catchment runoff were available sitefinder would readily be able to output the site selection criterion of inflow to storage volume ratio papenfus 2003 using the catchment area to storage volume ratio that it already calculates often the choice of which locations should be reviewed for potential water harvesting sites involves an amount of human interpretation of maps to judge the best spots or narrows forzieri et al 2008 as places to be analysed for suitability sitefinder offers an objective and repeatable alternative to identify sites with favourable characteristics for the siting of large water harvesting structures there is an argument that human interpretation alone can identify sites of interest that warrant further analysis for example in scenario 1 fig 5 there are only a few places that a large dam could be sited and these locations could possibly be ascertained using visual interpretation of maps alone however the same task becomes extraordinarily difficult for smaller water harvesting structures like those described in scenario 2 fig 6 and scenario 3 fig 7 for a small dam the volume of material required to construct the barrier itself can represent approximately sixty percent of the bill of quantities nissen petersen 2006 the barrier volume therefore can be used as a proxy for capital cost sitefinder calculates the barrier volume based on the barrier length and barrier height however planners invariably want to establish the cost benefit of any proposed scheme in the initial stages of the project cycle to address this sitefinder provides the storage volume to barrier volume ratio and area of influence to barrier volume ratio table 2 either of which could aid a decision making process on site suitability of the forty eight papers reviewed by adham et al 2016 only four refer to cost one uses a fixed cost for the water harvesting solution jothiprakash and sathe 2009 two use price of land banai kashani 1989 sekar and randhir 2007 and only one forzieri et al 2008 considers the water storage volume against the volume of the dam or barrier volume but in a process that requires visual interpretation of satellite imagery to estimate the width of narrows sitefinder provides an automated process that bridges biophysical criteria e g area of influence with socio economic criteria e g cost benefit information in the form of storage volume to barrier volume ratio sitefinder calculates the barrier height based on the elevation profile along the entire barrier crest and similarly the catchment area of the site is based on flow accumulation associated with the barrier crest line this method is therefore arguably more sophisticated than other site selection methods that establish site suitability using single raster cell values e g slope sitefinder considers potential water harvesting sites in full extracting and using values from any number of raster cells and so represents a shift away from a single cell approach to one whereby the water harvesting structure is considered as a complete entity a problem with using values obtained at single raster cells to support a site suitability assessment is that as the cell size decreases due to the use of a higher resolution dataset the size of the raster cell becomes smaller in proportion to the water harvesting structure although is it possible to calculate surface parameters including slope using windows greater than the normal default size of 3 3 cells better elevation data in terms of vertical accuracy and spatial resolution is associated with regional and local scale data schumann and bates 2018 and since it has been demonstrated that sitefinder can be successfully used with high resolution datasets such as lidar table 1 it therefore can exploit the increased detail these dems offer in a way that techniques that assess site suitability based on values at individual raster cells cannot for every barrier created by sitefinder a polygon is also created that represents the area of influence saturated zone upstream of the water harvesting structure these polygons represent the area affected by the barrier in a more realistic way compared to representing a water harvesting structure by a single point or raster cell or just the barrier alone as part of a site selection process these area of influence polygons could be overlaid with land use and land cover maps for example if the purpose of the water harvesting structure is to facilitate artificial groundwater recharge zaidi et al 2015 the polygons defining the area of influence could be overlaid with soil texture and vadose zone thickness maps to enable the hydrological response to be more realistically assessed selection criteria have been presented in the case studies presented table 2 table 3 table 4 but sitefinder outputs allow users to formulate other criteria that they may consider useful in a site selection process for example it may be useful to know the area of influence to storage volume ratio as a way of limiting evaporation reseigh 2021 and this could simply be obtained since both parameters area of influence and volume are contained within the barrier database as sitefinder works within a gis environment combining its results with other parameters is straightforward requiring no additional software for instance the catchment area calculated by sitefinder in case study scenario 2 could be used together with the slope calculated using gis but not with sitefinder to ascertain the runoff energy which is strongly associated with erosion control check dam collapse castillo et al 2007 the case studies presented above utilised a 1 arc second 30 m x 30 m srtm dsm the resulting barriers locations were compared against the equivalent barriers locations based on the high resolution 1 m 1 m dtm and show a higher degree of agreement for water harvesting structures longer in length the implication is that using a high resolution dem will give more accurate results that said sitefinder is intended for use in scoping so all potential sites will require detailed ground based survey at a later stage the risk however especially when using a 1 arc second dsm as here is that when identifying smaller water harvesting structures e g scenarios 2 and 3 selected sites may have quite different parameters that those predicted by the tool and possibly some locations that would make suitable sites for water harvesting structures are missed sitefinder calculates the barrier crest width as being fixed at just 0 25 m this is somewhat less than the 3 m proposed by nissen petersen 2006 so the tool could be used for low standing water harvesting structures without significantly overestimating the barrier volume a future refinement of the tool could set the crest width as a function of the height of the barrier stephens 2010 as well as allowing the user more control over the design of the barrier structure to match the water harvesting technique for the three scenarios presented in the case study sitefinder was only used to find potential locations for water harvesting structures in the locations identified runoff from the outer limits of the catchment area would need to flow some distance before reaching the area of influence where it would be impounded fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 no analysis was undertaken to test the functionality of the sitefinder in finding sites suitable for in situ water harvesting gis based decision support systems have been used to identify areas suitable for in situ water harvesting mahmoud and alazba 2015 and this is a potential further application of the tool a feature of sitefinder is that the barrier axis is set perpendicular to the flow direction calculated using the d8 procedure described by jenson and domingue 1988 this d8 flow direction is also the basis for siting point identification since the flow accumulation raster is created with the d8 flow direction raster as the input other flow direction methods do exist such as multi flow direction mfd qin et al 2007 and d infinity tarboton 1997 future research could investigate if these flow direction methods would be preferable to the d8 method in setting the barrier axis direction similarly it would be interesting to determine if some flow direction methods offer advantages to others for siting point identification especially if sitefinder is to be used for both external and in situ water harvesting orlandini and moretti 2009 concluded that the choice of using non dispersive methods over dispersive methods is dependent on the need to delineate flow paths or to focus on divergent terrains this tentatively suggests that dispersive flow direction methods would be more applicable for in situ water harvesting and non dispersive methods e g d8 better for external water harvesting none of the filtered barriers table 2 table 3 table 4 are presented as recommendations for water harvesting sites since some criteria typically incorporated into a site selection process were not considered sitefinder does however demonstrate its capacity to generate pertinent site characteristics within a gis environment that could form part of a multi criteria approach mca to water harvesting site identification therefore a future development would be to use sitefinder as part of a real world mca water harvesting site selection process considering a range of biophysical socio economic and environmental criteria with the aim of identifying suitable locations prior to any site visit 5 conclusions a novel methodology has been presented for automatically obtaining the characteristics of potential external water harvesting sites using a script based tool operating entirely within a gis environment using a digital elevation product as the primary source of information using an automated process a total of 5 770 sites were analysed the characteristics of barriers computed resulting in the selection of sites based on water harvesting site selection parameters to our knowledge this is the first time that details of potential sites including details of the barrier height length and volume and storage geometry have been automatically calculated within a gis environment outputs are provided in geospatial formats including barriers represented by lines and polygons representing the area of influence linked to each barrier the tool functions using low to high resolution elevation datasets and can find site characteristics for any size water harvesting structure since gis is used extensively by researchers as part of water harvesting site selection processes it is envisaged that sitefinder could be readily assimilated into decision making methods enabling combination of outputs created by this tool with other biophysical socio economic and environmental criteria to aid the identification of potential water harvesting sites it is suggested that sitefinder is best suited for scoping prior to any field visits automatically calculating the catchment area storage capacity and barrier dimensions for potential ex situ water harvesting earth embankments with a 0 25 m crest width and fixed slope but with future refinements the tool could offer greater control over the barrier specifications e g shape slope and crest width allowing a wider range of water harvesting structures to be analysed it is recommended that further research is undertaken to ascertain the quality of the digital elevation products e g in relation to spatial resolution and vertical accuracy required to compute the geometry

9342,water harvesting has a long history but still plays an important role today by increasing crop productivity combatting erosion and improving water supplies geographical information systems gis are used extensively to assess the suitability of sites for water harvesting but available tools fail to consider the synoptic topography of sites here we report the creation of a novel automated tool sitefinder that evaluates potential locations by automatically calculating site specific information including structure parameters height length and volume and descriptors of the zone affected by the structure storage capacity and area of influence and the catchment area innovatively compared to existing tools of this kind sitefinder works within a gis environment thus it allows the possibility of combining its outputs with larger multi criteria decision making processes to consider other bio physical socio economic and environmental factors it utilises a digital elevation model dem and automatically analyses thousands of potential sites computing site characteristics for different barrier heights that are dependent on the surrounding topography it outputs values of eight parameters to aid planners in assessing the characteristics of sites as to their suitability for water harvesting we conducted case studies using 30 30 m gridded dems to automatically evaluate several thousand sites and by filtering the tool outputs successfully identified sites with characteristics appropriate for scenarios at three spatial scales large dams for nationally significant water supply reservoirs 383 sites analysed 5 filtered sites with barriers up to 30 m in height large gully erosion control dams for regional scale interventions 4 586 sites analysed 6 filtered sites with barriers up to 3 6 m in height and local community based earth embankment projects 801 sites analysed 6 filtered sites with barriers up to 2 m in height a higher resolution 1 1 m terrain elevation model derived from open source airborne survey data was used to assess the veracity of these results correlations between the barrier length impounded area and storage volume capacity derived from the two different resolution data sets were all strongly significant spearman s rank correlation p 0 001 and normalised root mean square errors were 9 15 and 16 for these parameters respectively keywords water harvesting gis digital elevation model remote sensing drylands data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction there is evidence that civilisations constructed water harvesting structures over four millennia ago critchley and siegert 1991 yet water harvesting continues to be widely used and the focus of ongoing research abdullah et al 2020 adham et al 2019 farswan et al 2019 haile and suryabhagavan 2019 it is practised primarily in arid and semi arid regions bruins et al 1986 boers 1994 wang et al 2008 where it is valuable as a way of bridging dry spells rockström and falkenmark 2015 and has been estimated to have the potential to increase crop production by up to 100 piemontese et al 2020 depending on the location and design water harvesting structures can serve different purposes for example for the promotion of tree or crop cultivation mekdaschi and liniger 2013 artificial recharge of aquifers abdalla and al rawahi 2013 şen et al 2013 erosion control li et al 2018 surface water storage sayl et al 2019 or sub surface water storage forzieri et al 2008 some form of water treatment american water works association 2006 logsdon 2008 siabi 2008 panagopoulos 2021 will probably be required when harvested water is intended for domestic industrial use with the type of treatment dependent on the water quality problem cairncross and feachem 1993 binnie et al 2018 water harvesting structures vary from small pits or soil bunds made using hand tools to earth embankments over a kilometre in length built with the aid of machinery all water harvesting structures aim to reduce runoff and thus increase water storage depending on the technique implemented water storage may take place in the soil below the surface within introduced material such as sand in surface water reservoirs or in storage tanks water harvesting techniques are described as external when they collect water originating from rainfall that has fallen elsewhere while in situ water harvesting involves collecting rainfall on the surface where it falls helmreich and horn 2009 many previous studies have used geographical information systems gis to find potential locations for water harvesting structures without the need for field visits e g padmavathy et al 1993 al adamat 2008 ziadat et al 2012 kadam et al 2012 krois and schulte 2014 al khuzaie et al 2020 these methods invariably bring together different datasets from remote sensing and digitised maps often combined with hydrological modelling and explore the decision making space within the gis environment when deciding if a location is appropriate for water harvesting there are numerous biophysical and socio economic criteria to consider in a review of 48 studies adham et al 2016 identified nine biophysical criteria and nine socio economic criteria that can be used to help assess the suitability of potential sites for water harvesting examples of biophysical criteria include rainfall tumbo et al 2014 and drainage network metrics salih and al tarif 2012 while examples of socio economic criteria include population density mati et al 2006 and distance to crops de winnaar et al 2007 adham et al 2016 found that slope was the most common biophysical criterion used to identify water harvesting sites with 79 of all studies using slope as a criterion while only 55 of all studies used rainfall as a criterion in all studies the slope data used is defined on a point by point basis with flatter locations being identified as preferential for water harvesting locations however slope defined on a point by point basis does not consider the synoptic topography or surrounding relief which is crucial for identifying the potential of water harvesting locations moreover while it may offer relevant information on the suitability of potential sites it fails to provide the dimensions of necessary impounding structures bunds or embankments and the storage geometry they would create automated tools working outside a gis environment have been developed that consider the synoptic topography of potential sites and provide details of impounding structures and storage zones for example petheram et al 2017 created a novel set of algorithms to aid the siting of dams by providing dam and reservoir dimensions wimmer et al 2019 introduced an automated method using contours to detect potential reservoir locations by calculating dam length and reservoir volume and teschemacher et al 2020 describes an open source matlab tool for determining dam and basin properties wang et al 2021 reviewed dam siting methods and found that the majority were gis based so it is argued that the siting tool introduced in this paper which operates entirely within a gis environment will be of value to those involved in water harvesting site selection open source digital elevation models dems are commonly used in selecting water harvesting sites typically those used have a gridded resolution no finer than 30 m 30 m higher resolution dems are available but usually at significant and in many cases prohibitive cost schumann and bates 2018 argued for freely available dems with global coverage higher resolution and increased accuracy as open source dems are poorly suited for many local scale hydrologic applications however higher spatial resolution brings with it a problem for methods based on point by point defined variables in that the higher the resolution the smaller each pixel becomes in relation to the land affected by a water harvesting structure thus while there is an incentive to use higher resolution dems for enhanced hydrologic modelling this reduces the appropriateness of methods that rely on parameters defined on a point by point basis such as the slope variable identified by adham et al 2016 that have been widely used hitherto the aim of the present study has been to provide a bridge between the point based slope criteria calculated in a gis environment adopted by many researchers for water harvesting site selection and the automated methods that consider the surrounding topography of potential sites but work outside a gis environment petheram et al 2017 wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 this was approached by creating a gis tool sitefinder that can aid the siting of water harvesting structures by considering the synoptic topography of potential sites the intended output of this approach is information about the length and height of potential impounding structures barriers hereinafter and details of the areas of water storage they could create upstream of themselves in essence this is a similar approach to existing methods used to estimate the storage capacity of ponds usda 1997 and small dams stephens 2010 in so much as the area of water storage and the barrier height are used to compute predicted storage volume the tool was designed to calculate the catchment area of each water harvesting structure since there is a correlation between catchment area and runoff efficiency karnieli et al 1988 boers and ben asher 1982 and the catchment area to cultivation area ratio is important for water harvesting sites designed for crop production critchley and siegert 1991 finally the tool was developed such that for every location analysed as a potential site for water harvesting several barrier heights could be considered up to a user defined maximum height in summary the aim was to create an automated process capable of providing information on barrier size and water storage volumes for potential water harvesting sites that is not at present readily available within the convenient and widely used context of a gis environment the intention is that this could assist with scoping out potential sites with an accuracy sufficient for the pre feasibility stage of a project cycle it is envisaged that this would need to be used alongside other biophysical socio economic and environmental information as part of decision making processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 tool development the basic premise of sitefinder is to take a basin elevation model and for each site of interest compute the catchment area create an imaginary axis perpendicular to the flow direction and perform analysis based on how the axis intersects with the model surface for varying heights above the elevation of the site tool outputs were compared against those derived manually using a dam site ground survey and in addition the tool was used to evaluate thousands of sites and rank them based on relevant parameters the starting point for the developed tool is a raster based digital elevation model dem which provides the primary source of elevation data clearly the capability of the tool is in part dependent on the quality and resolution of the dem used this is considered further below but it is described here with reference to a generic dem of no specific quality or resolution sitefinder is enacted using an arcpy script within arcgis pro through a series of steps described below it processes the dem and creates outputs comprising information on the barrier length height location and orientation the storage area the barrier would create and the volume of the storage created firstly since the dem may contain imperfections a fill tool is used to remove any sinks spurious regions of lower elevation the next step creates a flow direction raster fig 1 flow direction using the filled dem as the input flow direction is defined as the direction from each cell to the steepest downslope neighbouring cell the flow direction raster is then used to produce a flow accumulation raster fig 1 flow accumulation where flow accumulation is defined as the number of cells that flow into each downstream cell subsequently only cells in the flow accumulation raster with values that fall within a range defined by the user prior to running the tool based on the minimum and maximum catchment areas are kept while other cells are set to no data the amended flow accumulation raster which effectively represents a stream network is then used together with the flow direction raster to create a stream order raster fig 1 stream network stream order which classifies each cell using strahler stream ordering whereby the uppermost headwater channels in a network are denoted first order second order streams are those that result from the confluence of two or more first order streams third order streams are those that result from the confluence of two or more second order streams and so on such that the largest trunk channels in a network have the highest order strahler 1957 the next step is to create siting points fig 1 siting points by creating a point located at the centre of every cell in the stream order raster by default all cells in the stream order raster become siting points but it is possible for the user to control which stream order cells become siting points barrier information is then calculated and added to the siting points database at every siting point the sitefinder script will if the topography allows create three barriers at different elevations labelled a b and c in order of increasing elevation the user defined maximum barrier height is used to calculate the barrier elevations first the maximum height is divided by three and the result converted to an integer this integer is the step change in elevation between each barrier barrier elevations are then calculated by rounding up the dem elevation at the siting point and adding the step change for example if the user enters a maximum barrier height of 10 m and the elevation at the siting point is 576 9 m then the first barrier contour a elevation will be 580 m 577 3 the second barrier contour b elevation will be 583 m 577 6 and third barrier contour c elevation will be 586 m 577 9 the barrier axes pass through the siting point with their direction set perpendicular to the siting point cell s flow direction and their length equal to half the user defined maximum barrier length on each side of the siting point fig 2 to determine the length of the top of each barrier and subsequently the area of water they could impound the points at which the barrier meets the ground needs to be determined this requires putting the barrier axis direction into the context of the ground s topographic contours to achieve this the dem is used to create a triangulated irregular network tin fig 1 tin elevation surface from which a surface contour fig 1 contour shapefile is derived the points at which the top of each barrier intersects the ground are then determined by intersecting the axis shapefile with the contour shapefile producing intersect points fig 1 intersect points that are taken as the start and end points of the barrier each intersect point is linked with its associated siting point and barrier elevation a b or c by a contour label siting point reference that is added to the intersect points database creation of barrier lines then requires locating two intersect points with identical contour label siting point references on either side of a given siting point fig 2 the first of several scenarios that may be encountered in this process is that there is no intersect point created for a siting point at an elevation corresponding to any of the barriers a b or c this will occur if the land is too flat and the top of the proposed barrier would not meet the surrounding land within half of the user defined maximum barrier length from the siting point the second scenario is that an intersect point is unique in that there is no other intersect point with the same contour label siting point reference this case corresponds to the situation where the barrier top meets the ground as the latter rises up on one side of the siting point but the land is too flat or descending for this to happen within the maximum barrier length on the other side if either of these two scenarios occur the site is rejected the third scenario is that exactly two intersect points with the same contour label siting point reference are found one on each side of the siting point and the site is identified as a potential water harvesting site the final scenario is that more than two intersect points exist each having the same contour label siting point reference in these final cases sitefinder identifies multiple intersect points with identical contour label siting point references on the same side of the siting point and deletes the more distant ones the remaining intersect points are referred to as trimmed points fig 1 trimmed points and these sites are also thus identified as potential water harvesting sites the next step is to create a line representing the top of each barrier this is done using a points to line tool which uses the contour label siting point references to create a straight line running from one intersect point through the siting point to the corresponding intersect point on the other side if for any siting point there is no intersect point or just a single intersect point at an elevation corresponding to a b or c then no barrier is formed since to create a line requires two identical contour label siting point references since any more distant intersect points have been deleted barrier lines can only be formed using the two trimmed intersect points one on either side of each siting point these lines are stored as barrier shapefiles fig 1 barrier once the barrier lines have been created sitefinder then begins a loop processing one barrier at a time a polygon fig 1 polygon shapefile representing the area of water storage that each barrier would impound is created by combining the barrier line with a contour line that has the same contour identification reference as held in the barrier attribute field this polygon is intersected with the tin surface fig 1 tin to obtain the volume fig 1 volume impounded by each barrier for this to work each polygon is assigned an elevation value set to the elevation of the top of the barrier with which it is associated the loop process ends once every barrier has been analysed the polygons are then checked for artefacts created by closed contour lines which result in more than one polygon per barrier artefacts are removed by calculating the distance of each polygon centroid to the barrier and removing all polygons except the nearest the barrier shapefile is updated with the correct storage area and volume and secondary raster information from the polygon feature class each row in the barrier feature class represents a unique barrier and is linked to a unique polygon by a barrier reference an estimation of the height of each water harvesting structure is carried out by taking the elevation of the barrier and subtracting the lowest elevation under the barrier profile on the tin surface in a similar manner the flow accumulation for each structure is found by extracting the maximum flow accumulation value along the barrier line elementary information contained within the barrier feature class is used to calculate additional parameters for example catchment area to storage volume ratio useful for water harvesting site selection eq 1 is used to calculate the barrier volume i e the volume of material that makes up the barrier based on the geometry of a small earth dam nissen petersen 2006 where v is the barrier volume m3 h is the maximum height m of the barrier before settling l is the length m of the barrier crest c is the width m of the crest and s is the sum of the upstream and downstream slope to simplify the comparison of results the crest width was fixed at 0 25 m and the sum of upstream and downstream slopes fixed at 5 5 for all case study scenarios 1 v 0 216 hl 2 c hs 2 2 geometric validation of sitefinder to check that the fundamental geometrical aspects of the process described above were functioning as intended results produced by sitefinder from a shuttle radar topographic mission srtm void filled 3 arc seconds approximately 92 m grid resolution dem of an area in sudan fig 3 a were compared against results obtained manually using elevation data from an in situ differential geospatial positioning system dgps dam site survey mohammed 2018 the srtm elevation data earth resources observation and science eros center 2018b was selected as it is open access and the scale of the existing dam is far greater than a single 3 arc second grid cell the site is characterised by low to medium relief and srtm products are considered to have small vertical errors in such circumstances falorni et al 2005 before starting the processing a comparison of elevations between the srtm data fig 3 b and the dgps survey points was undertaken to establish the presence of any systematic vertical offset a plot of srtm elevation against the corresponding elevation from the dgps survey sm1 supplementary material confirmed the presence of such an offset the linear regression formula derived from this plot was applied to all dgps points the reduced vertical offset produced by this adjustment of the dgps data can be observed by comparing the srtm and adjusted dgps contour lines sm2 supplementary material a check was carried out to verify that the sitefinder script was producing realistic measurements for the polygon area of influence and volume storage capacity this was done by first selecting a barrier along with its associated polygon created by the script with the srtm input fig 3 c located within the boundary of the dgps survey a comparator barrier and its associated polygon was then created fig 3 d manually by forming a barrier at the same elevation and orientation as the srtm derived barrier and intersecting it with the adjusted dgps contours the storage volume that would be impounded by these two barriers were calculated the srtm sitefinder method gave a polygon area of 1 274 949 m2 and a storage volume of 2 053 581 m3 and the corresponding dgps manual process values were 1 278 310 m2 and 1 785 070 m3 respectively this is a less than 1 difference for area and an approximately 15 difference for volume in terms of area at least this difference demonstrates a strong level of consistency between the srtm and dgps derived results the 15 difference encountered when comparing the volumes may be explained by several factors including the period of 18 years between the srtm and dgps data acquisition the srtm survey is a digital surface model gallant et al 2012 which may have picked up the top of any vegetation or buildings rather than the ground while the elevation points for the dgps survey are of the dam structure and the ground surrounding the embankment only finally the distance between the survey points for the dgps ranged between 10 and 20 m and thus were better suited to capture relief features of the site compared to the 3 arc seconds srtm elevation product which resulted in a grid size of 92 92 m 2 3 application and validation to water harvesting scenarios to assess its performance in a previously unexamined context sitefinder was applied to a different study area with the intention of identifying locations within it that have favourable characteristics for siting water harvesting structures three scenarios were explored each one defined by constraints on the input parameters that resulted in a different scale of water harvesting structure being identified the study area used for this application is in central ethiopia between latitudes 8 155 8 206 n and longitudes 38 937 e to 39 046 e it covers an area of 68 4 km2 12 km 5 7 km and has an elevation range of slightly over 600 m fig 4 and is representative of the arid to semi arid regions where water harvesting techniques are most commonly implemented the digital elevation data to which the process was applied was taken from the 1 arc second global digital elevation product from the nasa space shuttle radar topography mission srtm which is freely available via the us geological survey earth resources observation and science eros center 2018a this is a digital surface model dsm rather than a digital terrain model dtm but offers good coverage of arid and semi arid regions and is often used for water harvesting site selection vema et al 2019 mugo and odera 2019 in scenario 1 the rationale was to imitate a national governmental department tasked with finding sites suitable for large dams with the primary purpose of creating water supply reservoirs candidate sites were sought that would be able to accommodate structures with a barrier height of over 15 m to meet a definition of a large dam icold cigb 2011 but not greater than 25 m other defined criteria included storage capacity in excess of 1 000 000 m3 and a storage volume to barrier volume ratio of at least ten the latter acting as an indicator of value for money finally the dam length was constrained to be no greater than 2 000 m the minimum and maximum catchment areas were set to 2 000 000 m2 and 9 000 000 m2 respectively following analysis of a flow accumulation raster to identify the most significant drainage channels within the aoi the search parameters are summarised in table 2 scenario 2 aimed to replicate the implementation of a water harvesting techniques at a scale of interest to planners at a regional level sitefinder was therefore used to search for sites suitable for large gully erosion control check dams classified when the gully depth is more than 5 m geyik 1986 the search parameters are summarised in table 3 scenario 3 was intended to resemble a community based project possibly supported by a non governmental organisation whose goal is to increase crop productivity by placing more agricultural land under flood the water harvesting structure considered therefore is in the form of earth embankment no more than 2 m in height intended to hold back runoff and as the dry season advances water loss through evaporation causes more land to become available for planting similar to some earth embankment dams in sudan zumrawi 2015 and comparable in purpose to the traditional teras system van dijk and ahmed 1993 niemeijer 1998 also found in sudan in this scenario embankments should be no more 400 m in length since the aim of project is to bring land under irrigation the desired feature of any site is the area of influence the saturated zone upstream of the barrier which should be a minimum of 10 000 m2 to identify locations that offer acceptable value for money barriers would only be considered viable if the area of influence to barrier volume ratio is equal or greater than one hundred the search parameters are summarised in table 4 2 4 high resolution dem to test the accuracy of the process using the 1 arc second resolution dsm it was repeated for each of the three scenarios using a higher resolution dem and the results compared the higher resolution dem was found using an open topography website opentopography 2008 and consisted of a 1 m 1 m resolution product obtained using a lidar instrument by the uk natural environment research council airborne research and survey facility airborne research and survey facility 2009 the comparison of results from the two elevation data products was carried out using a modified version of sitefinder so that while the siting points and axis directions were derived from the srtm dsm the actual barriers and storage volumes were created on a lidar dtm elevation surface this approach allowed a comparison of barriers and impoundments to be made for barriers formed at the same location in the same direction and of a similar height but using elevation models of different resolutions thereby isolating the effects of the resolution change from the matching pairs of barrier data three parameters were analysed to assess the comparison of the srtm based results and the lidar based results barrier length area of influence and storage volume were chosen since these metrics play a significant role in the water harvesting site selection either directly or indirectly and they cover dimensions of length area and volume comparisons of these parameters from the two elevation data products were carried out using spearman s rank correlation tests and root mean square error rmse analysis 3 results 3 1 high resolution dem the modified version of sitefinder identified 903 barriers in the lidar dtm these were compared against barriers identified in the srtm dsm however since there is a difference between the two elevation models not all barriers with a shared siting point and contour reference formed on the lidar dtm model were also formed on the srtm dsm surface barriers sharing the same siting point the same contour reference and formed on both elevation models were matched the results of the statistical comparisons of parameters derived from each dem are presented in table 1 charts of each metric are provided in supplementary materials 3 2 scenario 1 case study large dam the results for scenario 1 are presented in table 2 in total sitefinder identified 383 siting points and created 376 barriers the initial desired minimum storage volume was set at 1 106 m3 while sitefinder outputted barriers with a maximum storage volume 13 9 106 m3 and since storage volume was considered to be an important metric it was decided to increase the minimum storage volume so a filter was applied resulting in only barriers with a storage volume equal or greater than 10 106 m3 were included in the final barrier list the storage to barrier volume ratio sbvr for some barriers fell well below the desired ratio of ten so these were removed by applying a filter resulting in the filtered barriers having a sbvr not less than 15 4 consequently only five barriers remained although these were all associated with different siting points those point were all clustered together thus effectively a single site was identified fig 5 the ranges of values of parameters defining the identified barriers and impoundments are shown in table 2 this information could be used to inform decisions as to whether it would be worthwhile investigating sites as potential water harvesting locations in this scenario planners would observe that the catchment area to storage volume ratio is no greater than 0 5 m2m 3 for any of the identified barrier locations and may conclude this is insufficient to generate the inflows needed to fill the dam and hence decide not to pursue the site as a location for a large dam for comparison papenfus 2003 describes three potential dams with catchment area to storage volume ratio ranging from 69 to 122 m2m 3 drought reserve dams should have a catchment area to storage volume ratio from 50 to 100 m2m 3 agriculture victoria 2020 and nissen petersen 2006 details a dam design with a catchment area to water storage volume of 333 m2m 3 3 3 scenario 2 case study gulley check dam the results from scenario 2 are presented in table 3 sitefinder identified only 23 barriers from a total of 4586 siting points analysed of these some had very low sbvrs a filter was applied that removed all those with svbr 2 5 resulting in six barriers at different siting points across the study area although two barriers are located in the same gully separated by only 30 m while the filtered barriers met the desired parameter ranges for barrier length and catchment area they all fell outside the desired range for the parameters of catchment area to storage volume ratio 15 m 1 and barrier height 5 7 m from the results of the filtered barriers the ranges of storage volume catchment area and barrier height were 900 000 2300 000 m3 60 000 200 000 m2 and 3 3 6 m respectively ettazarini 2021 describes small check dams having a storage volume up to 500 000 m3 while geyik 1986 defines medium sized gully dams having a catchment area range of 20 000 200 000 m2 and a range of gully depth of 1 5 m so while the intention was to locate large gully check dams sitefinder results appear to show that sites for medium sized check dams have been identified the six filtered barriers located in a total of five gullies together with the respective area of influence and catchment area of each barrier are shown in fig 6 3 4 scenario 3 case study earth embankment the results for scenario 3 are presented in table 4 in total 801 siting points were analysed as potential sites for earth embankments resulting in potential barriers a barrier height filter was applied so that all barriers would be at least 1 m and no greater than 2 m placing a maximum limit on the height of filtered barriers of just 2 m increases the prospect that the construction could be accomplished using local oversight and labour as the work is technically less demanding than constructing higher embankments a high proportion 508 from a total 1 771 of outputted barriers had a sbvr ranging from zero to almost three so a filter equal or greater than 3 was applied to ensure these barriers were not included in the final list selected barriers in this scenario the purpose of the water harvesting structure is to provide irrigated land immediately upstream of the barrier i e the area of influence so a condition was applied to ensure that all filtered barriers provided at least 100 m2 of irrigated land for every cubic metre of embankment constructed this demonstrates the capacity of sitefinder to output a socio economic criterion since the area of influence to barrier volume ratio is an indicator of value for money a catchment area to storage volume ratio filter was applied that set an upper limit of 15 m 1 as a way of controlling the amount of runoff a water harvesting site would receive the rationale behind such a filter is that planners may wish to avoid sites where excess runoff might require expensive technical solutions and focus on sites where excess runoff is less problematic of the seven barriers filtered from the initial 1 771 barriers the sbvr was found to range from 234 to 1 374 table 4 sitefinder calculates the storage to include the volume of any natural depressions i e pools should they occur within the area of influence together with storage created as a direct result of the barrier sitefinder is able to compute the volume of natural depressions as it computes site geometry based on a tin surface fig 1 created using a dem that has not been filled to remove sinks table 4 shows the range of parameter values for both the total unfiltered 1 771 barriers and the seven filtered barriers the final filtered barriers all of which meet the desired criteria table 4 are distributed in three distinct clusters fig 7 4 discussion the case studies demonstrate how sitefinder can analyse automatically thousands of potential external water harvesting sites within a gis environment and provide useful information e g barrier volume and storage capacity using a digital elevation raster as the primary data source the automated method runs entirely within the gis environment and provides information for site selection purposes e g barrier dimensions and storage geometry which cannot be obtained from a slope raster which is most the common type of dataset currently used by researchers for water harvesting site selection adham et al 2016 bespoke software and tools petheram et al 2017 wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 do exist that automate the process of extracting dam details for potential sites but all function outside a gis environment damsite petheram et al 2017 is a bespoke software that uses algorithms and a pixel based process to obtain dam site information but not provide polygons of the area of influence and cannot be applied to very small basins teschemacher et al 2020 wimmer et al 2019 used a point cloud processing software opals with outputs stored in a gis vector dataset but their results do not include details of barrier volume and catchment area an open source matlab tool developed by teschemacher et al 2020 requires the user to incorporate all criteria e g settlement area in order for sites with the best potential to be identified the sitefinder tool described here does not aim to provide the answer to where the best water harvesting sites are but rather provides relevant barrier characteristics calculated within the gis environment allowing the possibility of readily incorporating results into a multi criteria decision making process again using the gis environment which would allow the consideration of other biophysical socio economic and environmental factors integral to the functioning of sitefinder is the use of flow direction to determine the orientation of the barrier set perpendicular to flow direction which is an innovative feature for an automated water harvesting site selection process this has the benefit of allowing sitefinder to scan a higher number of locations as processing time required to optimise barrier orientation is avoided unlike some site selection tools wimmer et al 2019 teschemacher et al 2020 sitefinder considers catchment area catchment area is related to runoff efficiency karnieli et al 1988 and the volume of runoff a water harvesting site will receive sitefinder calculates catchment area and uses it to search for potential sites and outputs water harvesting site characteristics including catchment area to cultivation area critchley and siegert 1991 this implies that if data on annual catchment runoff were available sitefinder would readily be able to output the site selection criterion of inflow to storage volume ratio papenfus 2003 using the catchment area to storage volume ratio that it already calculates often the choice of which locations should be reviewed for potential water harvesting sites involves an amount of human interpretation of maps to judge the best spots or narrows forzieri et al 2008 as places to be analysed for suitability sitefinder offers an objective and repeatable alternative to identify sites with favourable characteristics for the siting of large water harvesting structures there is an argument that human interpretation alone can identify sites of interest that warrant further analysis for example in scenario 1 fig 5 there are only a few places that a large dam could be sited and these locations could possibly be ascertained using visual interpretation of maps alone however the same task becomes extraordinarily difficult for smaller water harvesting structures like those described in scenario 2 fig 6 and scenario 3 fig 7 for a small dam the volume of material required to construct the barrier itself can represent approximately sixty percent of the bill of quantities nissen petersen 2006 the barrier volume therefore can be used as a proxy for capital cost sitefinder calculates the barrier volume based on the barrier length and barrier height however planners invariably want to establish the cost benefit of any proposed scheme in the initial stages of the project cycle to address this sitefinder provides the storage volume to barrier volume ratio and area of influence to barrier volume ratio table 2 either of which could aid a decision making process on site suitability of the forty eight papers reviewed by adham et al 2016 only four refer to cost one uses a fixed cost for the water harvesting solution jothiprakash and sathe 2009 two use price of land banai kashani 1989 sekar and randhir 2007 and only one forzieri et al 2008 considers the water storage volume against the volume of the dam or barrier volume but in a process that requires visual interpretation of satellite imagery to estimate the width of narrows sitefinder provides an automated process that bridges biophysical criteria e g area of influence with socio economic criteria e g cost benefit information in the form of storage volume to barrier volume ratio sitefinder calculates the barrier height based on the elevation profile along the entire barrier crest and similarly the catchment area of the site is based on flow accumulation associated with the barrier crest line this method is therefore arguably more sophisticated than other site selection methods that establish site suitability using single raster cell values e g slope sitefinder considers potential water harvesting sites in full extracting and using values from any number of raster cells and so represents a shift away from a single cell approach to one whereby the water harvesting structure is considered as a complete entity a problem with using values obtained at single raster cells to support a site suitability assessment is that as the cell size decreases due to the use of a higher resolution dataset the size of the raster cell becomes smaller in proportion to the water harvesting structure although is it possible to calculate surface parameters including slope using windows greater than the normal default size of 3 3 cells better elevation data in terms of vertical accuracy and spatial resolution is associated with regional and local scale data schumann and bates 2018 and since it has been demonstrated that sitefinder can be successfully used with high resolution datasets such as lidar table 1 it therefore can exploit the increased detail these dems offer in a way that techniques that assess site suitability based on values at individual raster cells cannot for every barrier created by sitefinder a polygon is also created that represents the area of influence saturated zone upstream of the water harvesting structure these polygons represent the area affected by the barrier in a more realistic way compared to representing a water harvesting structure by a single point or raster cell or just the barrier alone as part of a site selection process these area of influence polygons could be overlaid with land use and land cover maps for example if the purpose of the water harvesting structure is to facilitate artificial groundwater recharge zaidi et al 2015 the polygons defining the area of influence could be overlaid with soil texture and vadose zone thickness maps to enable the hydrological response to be more realistically assessed selection criteria have been presented in the case studies presented table 2 table 3 table 4 but sitefinder outputs allow users to formulate other criteria that they may consider useful in a site selection process for example it may be useful to know the area of influence to storage volume ratio as a way of limiting evaporation reseigh 2021 and this could simply be obtained since both parameters area of influence and volume are contained within the barrier database as sitefinder works within a gis environment combining its results with other parameters is straightforward requiring no additional software for instance the catchment area calculated by sitefinder in case study scenario 2 could be used together with the slope calculated using gis but not with sitefinder to ascertain the runoff energy which is strongly associated with erosion control check dam collapse castillo et al 2007 the case studies presented above utilised a 1 arc second 30 m x 30 m srtm dsm the resulting barriers locations were compared against the equivalent barriers locations based on the high resolution 1 m 1 m dtm and show a higher degree of agreement for water harvesting structures longer in length the implication is that using a high resolution dem will give more accurate results that said sitefinder is intended for use in scoping so all potential sites will require detailed ground based survey at a later stage the risk however especially when using a 1 arc second dsm as here is that when identifying smaller water harvesting structures e g scenarios 2 and 3 selected sites may have quite different parameters that those predicted by the tool and possibly some locations that would make suitable sites for water harvesting structures are missed sitefinder calculates the barrier crest width as being fixed at just 0 25 m this is somewhat less than the 3 m proposed by nissen petersen 2006 so the tool could be used for low standing water harvesting structures without significantly overestimating the barrier volume a future refinement of the tool could set the crest width as a function of the height of the barrier stephens 2010 as well as allowing the user more control over the design of the barrier structure to match the water harvesting technique for the three scenarios presented in the case study sitefinder was only used to find potential locations for water harvesting structures in the locations identified runoff from the outer limits of the catchment area would need to flow some distance before reaching the area of influence where it would be impounded fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 no analysis was undertaken to test the functionality of the sitefinder in finding sites suitable for in situ water harvesting gis based decision support systems have been used to identify areas suitable for in situ water harvesting mahmoud and alazba 2015 and this is a potential further application of the tool a feature of sitefinder is that the barrier axis is set perpendicular to the flow direction calculated using the d8 procedure described by jenson and domingue 1988 this d8 flow direction is also the basis for siting point identification since the flow accumulation raster is created with the d8 flow direction raster as the input other flow direction methods do exist such as multi flow direction mfd qin et al 2007 and d infinity tarboton 1997 future research could investigate if these flow direction methods would be preferable to the d8 method in setting the barrier axis direction similarly it would be interesting to determine if some flow direction methods offer advantages to others for siting point identification especially if sitefinder is to be used for both external and in situ water harvesting orlandini and moretti 2009 concluded that the choice of using non dispersive methods over dispersive methods is dependent on the need to delineate flow paths or to focus on divergent terrains this tentatively suggests that dispersive flow direction methods would be more applicable for in situ water harvesting and non dispersive methods e g d8 better for external water harvesting none of the filtered barriers table 2 table 3 table 4 are presented as recommendations for water harvesting sites since some criteria typically incorporated into a site selection process were not considered sitefinder does however demonstrate its capacity to generate pertinent site characteristics within a gis environment that could form part of a multi criteria approach mca to water harvesting site identification therefore a future development would be to use sitefinder as part of a real world mca water harvesting site selection process considering a range of biophysical socio economic and environmental criteria with the aim of identifying suitable locations prior to any site visit 5 conclusions a novel methodology has been presented for automatically obtaining the characteristics of potential external water harvesting sites using a script based tool operating entirely within a gis environment using a digital elevation product as the primary source of information using an automated process a total of 5 770 sites were analysed the characteristics of barriers computed resulting in the selection of sites based on water harvesting site selection parameters to our knowledge this is the first time that details of potential sites including details of the barrier height length and volume and storage geometry have been automatically calculated within a gis environment outputs are provided in geospatial formats including barriers represented by lines and polygons representing the area of influence linked to each barrier the tool functions using low to high resolution elevation datasets and can find site characteristics for any size water harvesting structure since gis is used extensively by researchers as part of water harvesting site selection processes it is envisaged that sitefinder could be readily assimilated into decision making methods enabling combination of outputs created by this tool with other biophysical socio economic and environmental criteria to aid the identification of potential water harvesting sites it is suggested that sitefinder is best suited for scoping prior to any field visits automatically calculating the catchment area storage capacity and barrier dimensions for potential ex situ water harvesting earth embankments with a 0 25 m crest width and fixed slope but with future refinements the tool could offer greater control over the barrier specifications e g shape slope and crest width allowing a wider range of water harvesting structures to be analysed it is recommended that further research is undertaken to ascertain the quality of the digital elevation products e g in relation to spatial resolution and vertical accuracy required to compute the geometry

9343,understanding the status of water energy food wef nexus oriented to the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output in irrigation systems is essential for food security and resources sustainability based on wef nexus quantification combining traditional agricultural water saving and water footprint theory the sustainable development level sdl of water acquisition transfer consumption process for pumped irrigation systems was analyzed using the principal component analysis pca and taking the lianshui irrigation district lid in eastern china as a case study in this paper the driving mechanism of sdl for wef nexus was revealed by virtue of the partial least squares regression plsr results showed that annual sdl of the wef nexus in the pumped irrigation systems was 0 3 during the study period 2005 2019 mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that sustainability had been concerned pre and rri were significant positive factors while cdi functioned as significant negative driving factors on sdl of wef nexus the measures adjusting crop planting structure transforming irrigation and drainage mode updating water pump equipment and increasing agricultural investment contribute to the sustainability of wef nexus in the observed irrigation systems therefore the sustainable management can be implemented according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in pumped irrigation systems the research is conducive to the management and program for irrigated agricultural systems under the changing circumstances graphical abstract ga1 keywords water energy food nexus pumped irrigation water footprint sustainability assessment partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water energy and food are intricately related basic resources for human being liu et al 2018 globally irrigation in crop cultivation accounted for 70 of total water abstractions novoa et al 2019 also food production and supply chains consumed about 30 of energy lee et al 2020 irrigation is of great significance that not only a social behavior with large water consumption but also a paramount measure to improve crop yield to ensure food security irrigation farmland systems accounted for more than half of the country s arable land consumed more than 60 water resources withdrawal and contributed 75 of the national food in china cao et al 2020 2022 however with population growth and economic development the challenge of securing enough water energy and food to meet human needs is amplifying liu et al 2020 therefore in order to coordinate agricultural and socioeconomic development the sustainability of resources utilization in irrigation systems is crucial the bonn conference of 2011 promoted the concept of the water energy food nexus wef nexus which has gained considerable attention from public and academia van vuuren et al 2019 water energy and food are closely linked which are all essential resources for agricultural production practices bhave et al 2022 alexandra 2018 brenda and jose 2021 in an agricultural system water energy and food are interrelated where irrigation contributes to food production while food production consumes water and energy li and singh 2019 owing to the close connection between water energy and food the nexus approach on wef nexus becomes a global concern which has been a major research topic in recent years shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the nexus approach facilitates the analysis of the complex linkages which considers the synergies and trade offs required to meet the demand for the three crucial resources wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and is equally applicable to the study of sustainable development topics water energy resources and food production are critical to the sustainable development of wef nexus however the accessibility of these resources is increasingly threatened by climate change population growth urbanization and environmental concerns wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c niva et al 2019 hence interest in wef nexus has grown rapidly albrecht et al 2018 as it is recognized that in tightly connected system wang et al 2021 any small change can have unimaginable consequences for the entire system and other interconnected systems exciting research on wef nexus mainly falls into three main categories identifying framework si et al 2019 quantifying interrelationship sadeghi et al 2020 and modeling within a region de vito et al 2017 it has been recognized that if wef nexus interconnections are arbitrarily separated it is difficult to maintain effective exploitation efficient utilization and sustainability of resources sadeghi et al 2020 however due to the inherent complexity of each system water energy and food are often managed independently ji et al 2020 in contrast to large scale study areas irrigation districts are often overlooked but they are a good breakthrough point for exploring wef nexus food production a core agricultural activity that directly affects the degree of food security at different scales is closely linked to water energy consumption in particular in the highly relevant pumped irrigation systems of wef nexus energy is required for agricultural practices such as pumped irrigation while food production and processing depend on water energy resources moreover food exports can also serve as virtual water carriers and production residues to alleviate the pressure of water energy resources scarcity guan et al 2020 li and singh 2019 as the population grows and urbanization develops so does the demand for food correspondingly the production pressure of food producing areas irrigation districts is increasing furthermore the sustainable development of wef nexus is worth exploring under the premise of limited water and land resources previous studies have often relied on simple tools such as the sustainability index which is suitable for preliminary assessments and serves as a bridge to more advanced tools dargin et al 2018 correspondingly a number of sustainability index studies on wef nexus have emerged such as the nexus assessment 1 0 flammini et al 2014 pardee rand few index abbott et al 2017 willis et al 2016 wef sdgs assessment giupponi and gain 2016 and the water energy index daher et al 2019 the wef nexus approach explicitly calls attention to interlinkages hoff 2011 zhang et al 2019 nevertheless all of the above assessments have selected indicators from individual wef sectors and thus lack comprehensive indicators that strictly reflect the nexus concept yi et al 2020 consequently these integrated analytical approaches that address the complexity of three pronged relationships boost identify interrelationships across sectors albrecht et al 2018 such holistic approach improves the efficiency of resource utilization in irrigation systems ensures food security and promotes sustainable agricultural production cui et al 2021 therefore understanding the status of wef nexus requires an integrated sustainability assessment that must consider the entire system as a whole rather than a collection of isolated subsystems yi et al 2020 the existing index assessments of wef nexus are also mainly applicable to large scales however the current regional scale studies do not fully include all three components zhou et al 2019 a large and diverse country like china where there are significant differences between watersheds and irrigation districts requires flexibility in dealing with the various elements of the wef nexus according to the different local conditions yi et al 2020 in this study the sustainable development level sdl assessment and driving mechanism of the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output of the pumped irrigation systems were investigated using principal component analysis pca and partial least squares regression plsr respectively therefore this study aims to promote sustainable development of agricultural production by developing an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of resource use in typical pumped irrigation systems and accordingly suggesting options for improvement measures the objectives of the current paper include the following four aspects 1 to select indicators and establish a framework for evaluating sustainable development in typical pumped irrigation systems 2 to propose the sdl for assessing the variation in multiple subsystems and evaluating the wef nexus 3 to explore the driving mechanisms of sdl by virtue of plsr model and 4 to postulate a hypothesis that whether the sustainable management of pumped irrigation systems can be achieved according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus 2 methods and data 2 1 quantification of the wef nexus the wef nexus of irrigation system could be divided into three subsystems namely water resources energy and food production subsystem fig 1 sustainability of wef nexus is evaluated on the basis of resources performances

component analysis pca 1 data standardization and covariance matrix the pca of 18 indicators of sdl in lid was carried out using spss 26 0 software the original indicator data is standardized in order to eliminate the quantitative relationship between variables and make the data comparable the normalized indices can be divided into positive type and negative type as shown in eqs 19 and 20 19 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij 20 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where xij is the index before standardization yij is the index after standardization the covariance matrix r rij rji is established according to the standardized data matrix which can reflect the close correlation between standardized variables and the higher the r value the stronger the correlation between variables where rij i j 1 2 3 p is the correlation coefficient between the original variable xi and yj 2 the determination of the number of principal component using spss software the characteristic value and contribution rate and cumulative contribution rate of each principal component were calculated the first four components were extracted according to the principle that the cumulative contribution rate is greater than 85 among them the contribution rate of the first principal component was 45 2 the second principal component contribution rate was 28 1 the third principal component contribution rate was 14 1 and the fourth principal component contribution rate was 8 9 which can concentrate 96 3 of the original variable 3 the establishment of the factor load matrix is calculated with the principal component score coefficient factor load is the correlation coefficient r zi xi reveals the correlation between the principal component and the sdl indicators as can be seen from the factor load matrix table 1 the first principal component is mainly influenced by op and cwf the second principal component is mainly influenced by cwfgreen and eep the third principal component is mainly influenced by wfc and the fourth principal component is mainly influenced by cwfgrey the principal component score factor is the square root of the calculation of the respective factor load vector divided by the characteristic value of the respective factor the formula is as follows 21 y i r i λ i where ri is a factor load and i is the corresponding feature root λi is the eigenvalue yi is the principal component load 4 the sustainable development level sdl the sustainable development level sdl is used to assess the agricultural wef nexus sustainability development level in observed pumped irrigation systems according to the principal component scoring coefficient matrix and the main component variance the calculation method is as follows 22 sdl k y ij y i where sdl ranges from 0 to 1 which is expected to exceed 0 5 in addition the higher the sdl the better the sustainability of wef nexus 2 3 partial least squares regression plsr plsr is a multi iterative projection method for building relationships between independent variable argument matrix x and response matrix y which is appropriate when the predictor exhibit multiple collinearity compared to principal component analysis plsr uses only the most important linear combinations to handle highly relevant noisy data cao et al 2020 2021 das et al 2019 the variable importance for the projection vip is used to represent the importance of a predictor for both the explanatory variables and the response variable and the regression coefficient rc is an indicator that reflects the direction and intensity of each variable in the plsr model in order to explore the relationship between sdl and the driving factors in pumped irrigation systems the response model of sdl to the driving factors was constructed and the main driving factors of sdl of pumped irrigation systems were found in this study the indicators that were considered to affect pumped irrigation systems are used in previous studies cao et al 2020 2021 as shown in table 2 2 4 study areas and data sources the observed pumped irrigation systems namely lid fig s1 in jiangsu province of china was selected as study area lid is located in the eastern of china the lower reaches of the huaihe river basin which extends from 118 59 to 119 46 e and 33 39 to 34 07 n during the study period from 2005 to 2019 in the lid relevant production data is presented in table s1 lid is a large irrigation district with abundant light rich precipitation which is suitable for crop growth in this study the sdl of wef nexus was assessed for the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output in the pumping irrigation district for the period 2005 2019 the cropwat model is required to represent meteorological sources such as sunshine hours precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed which are from the main weather site data in the china meteorological science data sharing service http cdc cma gov cn yearly crop output planting area ie and flow of 733 pumping stations in lid were provided by the irrigation district administration 3 results 3 1 performances of water resources energy and food production subsystem 3 1 1 water resource subsystem the annual cwf and wfc of food were 1219 5 cwfgrey was nearly 24 6 and 1791 1 m m3 respectively during the period of 2005 2019 in lid in order to judge the water consumption varying with time in the crop production process the annual cwf cwfblue cwfgreen and cwfgrey wfc and blue water proportion bwp values are demonstrated in fig 2 fig 2 reveals that cwf and wfc showed a trend of increasing over time in lid and the interannual variation of bwp was significant cv coefficient of variation 0 2 crop production and water consumption related to the large fluctuation of precipitation in previous years during the study period the arable land area changed from about 8 5 104 to 10 3 104 ha and the total amount of water resources and agricultural water consumption changed by 0 81 g m3 g 109 m3 and 0 47 g m3 respectively cwf has generally shown a steady growth trend from 2005 to 2013 however there was a decline in 2014 and 2018 and the remaining years still maintained an increasing trend with time under the premise that crop water consumption and water productivity had been little change the expansion of agricultural production scale and the change of planting structure are the main driving forces of cwf steady growth the overall growth trend of wfc which declined in 2016 2019 was mainly related to the reduction of the wfp of food i e the increasing in the productivity of lid overall the wfc was slightly higher than the cwf indicating that crop production consumes more water than the processing high productivity and improved processing processes are equally important for water conservation and contribute to the sustainability of water resources the change of rainfall led to the change of bwp which ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 implying that the cwfblue consumed in crop production was increasing leading to a gradual shift from green water to blue water the average grey water proportion gwp is 24 6 which meant that the cwfgrey consumed by diluted fertilizer accounts for about a quarter of the cwf which suggests that fertilizer input should be reduced especially nitrogen fertilizer it is indicated that the utilization of water with high instability in the production process was greatly affected by the climate in pumped irrigation systems 3 1 2 energy subsystem the fluctuations of eec and eep were relatively obvious with the average values of 3088 6 kwh and 79 5 kg kj respectively making clear that there is generally inefficient energy utilization the change of ami is on a steady growth trend with the average value of 7 0 kw ha according to the eec eep and ami values among 15 years the specific year in which the larger and smaller values were located can be determined as shown in fig 3 observing the temporal variation of eec it is found that the annual eec fluctuated significantly change rate cr 11 6 which was mainly involved with the limited water and soil resources and the unstable climatic conditions the remarkable thing is that eec decreased in 2014 eep is the opposite meanwhile a sharp increasing in precipitation was found which pointed that eec was relevant to changes in precipitation it can be explained that eec and eep quantitatively describes the relationship on energy subsystem in typical pumped irrigation systems also it is related to climatic conditions generally speaking the ami is on the rise with an average annual cr of 6 0 which indicates that low agricultural investment and slow agricultural modernization as shown in fig 3 b dep showed an increasing trend with significant growth cr 42 7 in 2012 2015 in 2007 and 2017 there was a decline but overall growth trend while the change in gep was significant from 2008 to 2013 cr 284 8 there was a decrease in 2006 2008 and 2019 however mp on the whole presented an increasing trend cr 346 7 it is worth noting that both dep and gep growth was at its peak in 2008 while mp declined which is related to local agricultural inputs the raw materials and principles of mechanical power inputs are different the impact on agricultural production is also diverse diesel engines are much more efficient and economical than gasoline engines but they emit a lot more harmful substances than gasoline engines compared with the above two kinds of internal combustion engines motors have less pollution in the energy conversion process but due to the constraints of technology and energy storage equipment the utilization of motors has been restricted among the three mechanical power inputs dep input is the largest about 88 3 followed by mp input and gep input suggesting that low fuel efficiency leads to high dependence on diesel in lid and is not conducive to the sustainable development of energy 3 1 3 food production subsystem the annual fai and pai were 472 4 and 6 2 kg ha respectively during the period of 2005 2019 in lid fig 4 in order to investigate the relevant indicators of food production subsystem varying with time in the crop production process the annual op fev y and cwp values are shown in fig 4 fig 4 reveals that fai and pai presented a dynamic course of minus increase minus over time in lid and the interannual variation of pai was significant both op and fev showed a trend of increasing then decreasing and lastly increasing while the changes in y and cwp were not obvious crs 1 0 but they were growing slowly on the whole fai and pai showed a decreasing trend while op and y were increasing although there have been several years of decline indicating that reducing the fav and pcd had not resulted in a reduction in op in other words the productive potential of seeds is increasing what s more reducing the amount of fertilizer and pesticide application contributes to relieve the stress of environment regulation food demand volume was increasing with population growth and economic development except for a period in 2010 2012 fev declined while op was modest fev were in line with changes in op in other years both increasing and decreasing at the same time under the condition of rapid population growth and increasing food demand the fev was still showing an increasing trend hinting that the productive potential of seeds is well matched to social development from the point of virtual water food exporting can alleviate water pressure in unsuitable for crops but economically developed cities in order to meet the food demand of a growing population both op and y need to be increased to achieve the sustainability of food production as for the cwp of food with no significant changes cr 1 0 the multi year average of cwp including grey water footprint is 0 7 kg m3 suggesting that low water productivity high water consumption and low yield are not conducive to the sustainable development of food production subsystem 3 2 sdl in wef nexus during 2005 2019 the average sdl of wef nexus was about 0 3 in lid the main statistics such as the range standard deviation sd coefficient of variation and change rate of each system were calculated for the purpose of clarifying the sustainable development of lid and its changes over time the results are listed in table 3 which shows that the sustainability was underdeveloped in typical pumped irrigation systems as illustrated in fig 5 the sdl values of different subsystems were used to analyze and evaluate the productivity of pumped irrigation systems and the sustainability of wef nexus in agricultural production systems fig 5 reveals that the sdl fluctuated greatly among 15 years and represents weak stability which is mainly related to the instability of artificial factors and natural conditions over the years especially the low stability of the cwfgreen caused by precipitation as well as water electricity consumption and op instability resulting weak stability of sdl combined with table 3 and fig 5 sdlw in water resources subsystem was the highest followed by sdle in energy subsystem and sdlf in food production subsystem it can be seen that the sustainability of subsystems is unfavorable in observed pumped irrigation systems which is not good for the sustainable development of agricultural production in terms of changes among 15 years the range were large while sd and cv were small which showed that the absolute changes were not obvious among the three subsystems sdl the sdlf range and sd were the highest which together revealed that food production system was relatively unstable compared with other two subsystems the sds of sdlw and sdle were not far apart and lower than that of sdlf which meant that the variation was not significant besides the cvs of sdlw and sdle were lower than sdlf which implied the low dispersion degree of indicators and the inconspicuous change during the study period table 3 and fig 5 also reveal that the sdls represent a growing trend in various subsystems furthermore the productivity had improved greatly among nearly 15 years in typical pumped irrigation systems the average growth rate of all four systems were above 5 0 with food production subsystem the highest raising sdlf from 0 to 0 4 however the food production subsystem not only has the lowest sdl but also changed significantly from the food perspective in which water and energy are the inputs de vito et al 2017 therefore water energy and food form a tight triangle consequently on the basis of guaranteeing food security more efforts are made to improve sdlf and achieve sustainable development of agricultural systems meanwhile water resources and energy subsystem should not be neglected in order to improve the sustainable development of wef nexus of pumped irrigation systems the efficiency of resource utilization especially energy should be enhanced 3 3 driving mechanism of sdl the driving factors were involved in many aspects associated with wef nexus such as natural climate social economy water supply and demand and agricultural production characteristics cao et al 2020 2021 the results of the analysis of the main factor of sdl using plsr are summarized in table 4 and fig 6 as listed in table 4 the two partial least multiplication regression main components extracted by the plsr model explain 89 0 and 5 4 of sdl respectively while adding more components to sdl s plsr model it didn t increase the contribution rate to sdl rc represents the positive or negative impact of the driving factor on sdl when the variable whose rc is greater than 0 it indicates that the variable has a positive impact on sdl and vice versa fig 6 manifests that precipitation pre of natural conditions had a positive effect on sdl while temperature tem had a negative effect on sdl population growth rate pgr urbanization rate urr agricultural production value rate apr rural residents income rri total water resources twr agricultural water rate awr and electricity consumption per unit cultivated land area eca in artificial factors had a positive impact on sdl while carbon dioxide emission intensity cdi food export rate fer and gross domestic product per capita gdc had a negative impact on sdl in general the variable whose vip 1 is an important influence on the cause variable vip 1 of the three variables in sdl s plsr model fig 6 were pre cdi and rri respectively among them the increasing of pre and rri could lead to sdl rising at the same time the lower vip factors included tem fer pgr urr gdc apr twr awr and eca precipitation and temperature are natural conditions directly related to crop production processes as the cwfgreen increases with the increasing of precipitation the corresponding cwfblue and eec decrease which contributes to reduce water energy consumption and alleviate resources stress higher temperature will increase evaporation and accelerate nutrient loss which is not conducive to crop growth chen et al 2022 therefore the richer precipitation and lower temperature are conducive to the sustainable development in pumped irrigation systems cdi fer pgr urr gdc apr twr awr and eca are all artificial factors that can comprehensively reflect the agricultural production conditions socioeconomic development and water resources utilization increasing carbon dioxide emissions will affect the climatic productivity potential thereby altering the primary productivity of ecosystems and land carrying capacity for agriculture northrup et al 2021 ultimately restraining the sustainable development of agriculture as a food production base the local food demand and food export are staged in lid which means that more water energy resources are being consumed resulting in a risk of resources shortage accordingly it imposes restrictions on the sustainable development of local agricultural production for the increasing of fer pgr expresses the degree and trend of population growth thus the reasonableness of the population structure increases the stability of the system operation the increasing of pgr conduces to adjust the population structure guarantee the labor force hence leading to an increasing sdl the improvement of urbanization has accelerated industrial development promoted regional economic growth and ensured agricultural investment in pumped irrigation systems resulting in an increasing sdl the larger the apr is it implies that agricultural production contributes more to local economy and promotes the development of agriculture meanwhile rri also has been increased which is conducive to the sustainable production of agricultural systems agricultural production practices are inseparable from the input of water energy resources such as pumped irrigation food production and processing as the population increases so does the demand for water energy and food so the expansion of twr awr and eca improves the sustainability of wef nexus 4 discussion 4 1 the characteristics of water energy food nexus in pumped irrigation systems sustainability science has expanded from a descriptive model to a solution oriented approach guo et al 2021 meanwhile the sustainability assessment is a critical first step in establishing a methodology that clarifies wef nexus interactions and provides a basis for future project first the sustainability evaluation framework based on the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output fills the functional shortcomings of single stage oriented indicators sustainable agricultural development encompasses all aspects of agricultural production associated with the wef nexus further takes into account the social economic and ecological impacts of agricultural activities guo et al 2021 a single indicator was not sufficient to evaluate the sustainability of wef nexus yi et al 2020 thus eighteen indicators were considered to establish the research framework in addition these indicators were selected for the reason that they reflect the variability of the sustainability of agricultural production in a given situation and contribute to more rational decision making second a methodology to construct sustainable development level index was implemented to assess the wef nexus for pumped irrigation systems and to provide decision makers with the required information yi et al 2020 the sdl assessment is the basis for promoting the sustainability of wef nexus in agricultural production systems under the environment of ameliorating water saving irrigation quantifying resource utilization efficiency and sustainability evaluation of seeding systems is crucial to ensure a balance among three subsystems consequently the sdl evaluation was carried out in the typical pumped irrigation systems sdl manifested the productivity of wef nexus as a benchmark for the evaluating the sustainability in pumped irrigation systems unreasonable crop cultivation structure can exacerbate the waste of water energy resources lead to lower water energy utilization reduce food productivity and therefore is not conducive to the sustainable development of wef nexus in agricultural production systems third the average annual sdl was 0 3 during the study period mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that the sustainability was relative underdeveloped in typical pumped irrigation systems it s worth noting that only sdlw exceeded 0 5 during 2014 2018 suggesting that water resources subsystem had captured more attention from stakeholders in the process of crop growth and will achieve sustainable development earlier in the future energy subsystem and food production subsystem should be poured more attention into and appropriate management so as to keep up with the steps of water resources subsystem in order to realize the sustainable development of agricultural production the novelty and characteristics of this study is the overall perspective of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output rather than the previous studies on water allocation li et al 2020 this might provide more intuitive decision support for the sustainable management of agricultural production systems since the resource utilization in the agricultural production process was evaluated from the perspective of three subsystems considering different types of drivers including natural and artificial factors 4 2 the enlightenment for pumped irrigation systems management the plsr model was applied to explore the driving factors of sdl and the results manifested that pre was the significant positive meteorological factors of sdl in addition the instability of the current climate reduced the stability of sdl and was detrimental to the natural growth of crops human activities are one of the factors affecting pre mainly through changing the underlying surface conditions such as afforestation vegetation restoration construction of reservoirs and water conservancy projects will increase the humidity of the air ultimately resulting in increasing sdl at the socioeconomic level cdi and rri are the significant negative and significant positive factors affecting sdl respectively eec is the main factor causing carbon dioxide emission during crop growth in the pumped irrigation systems the stakeholders can replace old equipment or improve pump installation design to enhance the pump efficiency in addition the cwfblue of maize was much smaller than that of rice and wheat cui et al 2021 therefore adjusting crop planting structure can reduce the eec of pumped irrigation systems from the perspective of water supply and distribution the ie can be improved by replacing channel transportation with pipeline transportation furthermore different irrigation and drainage modes have an impact on irrigation water wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c hence an appropriate irrigation and drainage mode can reduce eec and then increase sdl besides increasing investment in capital can improve breeding ability and increase crop production potential with economic development population increase and mechanical input modern agriculture has gradually replaced traditional agriculture with the support of labor force and science technology production efficiency has been effectively improved thus resulting in an increasing sdl consequently the sustainable management of pumped irrigation systems can be carried out according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in spite of this there are two limitations in this study on the one hand the relationship between the subsystems of wef nexus is dynamic rather than static however the dynamic feedback of the system has not addressed in this research on the other hand only the relationships within the system were considered nevertheless the connections to the outside were ignored therefore in the future research system dynamics wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c or bayesian network models wang et al 2021 will be applied to demonstrate the dynamic causal relationships between subsystems more importantly we will integrate the input output analysis with external resources to make the results more accurate based on this more metrics will be added to analyze the impact of multiple factors on wef nexus 5 conclusion based on wef nexus combining traditional agricultural water saving and water footprint theory this paper aimed at establishing an index evaluation framework considering the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output afterwards analyzing the sustainability of agricultural production in typical pumped irrigation systems the average sdl was low during study period in observed pumped irrigation systems mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that the weak utilization efficiency of water energy resources aggravated the waste of resources which was not conducive to the sustainable development of agricultural production what s more pre was the most obvious meteorological factor affecting sdl while cdi and rri of artificial factors had a significant impact on sdl besides the sustainable management can be carried out according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in pumped irrigation systems consequently the local managers can improve the efficiency of water energy resource utilization by adjusting crop planting structure transforming irrigation and drainage mode updating water pump equipment and increasing agricultural investment so as to achieve

9343,understanding the status of water energy food wef nexus oriented to the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output in irrigation systems is essential for food security and resources sustainability based on wef nexus quantification combining traditional agricultural water saving and water footprint theory the sustainable development level sdl of water acquisition transfer consumption process for pumped irrigation systems was analyzed using the principal component analysis pca and taking the lianshui irrigation district lid in eastern china as a case study in this paper the driving mechanism of sdl for wef nexus was revealed by virtue of the partial least squares regression plsr results showed that annual sdl of the wef nexus in the pumped irrigation systems was 0 3 during the study period 2005 2019 mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that sustainability had been concerned pre and rri were significant positive factors while cdi functioned as significant negative driving factors on sdl of wef nexus the measures adjusting crop planting structure transforming irrigation and drainage mode updating water pump equipment and increasing agricultural investment contribute to the sustainability of wef nexus in the observed irrigation systems therefore the sustainable management can be implemented according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in pumped irrigation systems the research is conducive to the management and program for irrigated agricultural systems under the changing circumstances graphical abstract ga1 keywords water energy food nexus pumped irrigation water footprint sustainability assessment partial least squares regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water energy and food are intricately related basic resources for human being liu et al 2018 globally irrigation in crop cultivation accounted for 70 of total water abstractions novoa et al 2019 also food production and supply chains consumed about 30 of energy lee et al 2020 irrigation is of great significance that not only a social behavior with large water consumption but also a paramount measure to improve crop yield to ensure food security irrigation farmland systems accounted for more than half of the country s arable land consumed more than 60 water resources withdrawal and contributed 75 of the national food in china cao et al 2020 2022 however with population growth and economic development the challenge of securing enough water energy and food to meet human needs is amplifying liu et al 2020 therefore in order to coordinate agricultural and socioeconomic development the sustainability of resources utilization in irrigation systems is crucial the bonn conference of 2011 promoted the concept of the water energy food nexus wef nexus which has gained considerable attention from public and academia van vuuren et al 2019 water energy and food are closely linked which are all essential resources for agricultural production practices bhave et al 2022 alexandra 2018 brenda and jose 2021 in an agricultural system water energy and food are interrelated where irrigation contributes to food production while food production consumes water and energy li and singh 2019 owing to the close connection between water energy and food the nexus approach on wef nexus becomes a global concern which has been a major research topic in recent years shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the nexus approach facilitates the analysis of the complex linkages which considers the synergies and trade offs required to meet the demand for the three crucial resources wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and is equally applicable to the study of sustainable development topics water energy resources and food production are critical to the sustainable development of wef nexus however the accessibility of these resources is increasingly threatened by climate change population growth urbanization and environmental concerns wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c niva et al 2019 hence interest in wef nexus has grown rapidly albrecht et al 2018 as it is recognized that in tightly connected system wang et al 2021 any small change can have unimaginable consequences for the entire system and other interconnected systems exciting research on wef nexus mainly falls into three main categories identifying framework si et al 2019 quantifying interrelationship sadeghi et al 2020 and modeling within a region de vito et al 2017 it has been recognized that if wef nexus interconnections are arbitrarily separated it is difficult to maintain effective exploitation efficient utilization and sustainability of resources sadeghi et al 2020 however due to the inherent complexity of each system water energy and food are often managed independently ji et al 2020 in contrast to large scale study areas irrigation districts are often overlooked but they are a good breakthrough point for exploring wef nexus food production a core agricultural activity that directly affects the degree of food security at different scales is closely linked to water energy consumption in particular in the highly relevant pumped irrigation systems of wef nexus energy is required for agricultural practices such as pumped irrigation while food production and processing depend on water energy resources moreover food exports can also serve as virtual water carriers and production residues to alleviate the pressure of water energy resources scarcity guan et al 2020 li and singh 2019 as the population grows and urbanization develops so does the demand for food correspondingly the production pressure of food producing areas irrigation districts is increasing furthermore the sustainable development of wef nexus is worth exploring under the premise of limited water and land resources previous studies have often relied on simple tools such as the sustainability index which is suitable for preliminary assessments and serves as a bridge to more advanced tools dargin et al 2018 correspondingly a number of sustainability index studies on wef nexus have emerged such as the nexus assessment 1 0 flammini et al 2014 pardee rand few index abbott et al 2017 willis et al 2016 wef sdgs assessment giupponi and gain 2016 and the water energy index daher et al 2019 the wef nexus approach explicitly calls attention to interlinkages hoff 2011 zhang et al 2019 nevertheless all of the above assessments have selected indicators from individual wef sectors and thus lack comprehensive indicators that strictly reflect the nexus concept yi et al 2020 consequently these integrated analytical approaches that address the complexity of three pronged relationships boost identify interrelationships across sectors albrecht et al 2018 such holistic approach improves the efficiency of resource utilization in irrigation systems ensures food security and promotes sustainable agricultural production cui et al 2021 therefore understanding the status of wef nexus requires an integrated sustainability assessment that must consider the entire system as a whole rather than a collection of isolated subsystems yi et al 2020 the existing index assessments of wef nexus are also mainly applicable to large scales however the current regional scale studies do not fully include all three components zhou et al 2019 a large and diverse country like china where there are significant differences between watersheds and irrigation districts requires flexibility in dealing with the various elements of the wef nexus according to the different local conditions yi et al 2020 in this study the sustainable development level sdl assessment and driving mechanism of the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output of the pumped irrigation systems were investigated using principal component analysis pca and partial least squares regression plsr respectively therefore this study aims to promote sustainable development of agricultural production by developing an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of resource use in typical pumped irrigation systems and accordingly suggesting options for improvement measures the objectives of the current paper include the following four aspects 1 to select indicators and establish a framework for evaluating sustainable development in typical pumped irrigation systems 2 to propose the sdl for assessing the variation in multiple subsystems and evaluating the wef nexus 3 to explore the driving mechanisms of sdl by virtue of plsr model and 4 to postulate a hypothesis that whether the sustainable management of pumped irrigation systems can be achieved according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus 2 methods and data 2 1 quantification of the wef nexus the wef nexus of irrigation system could be divided into three subsystems namely water resources energy and food production subsystem fig 1 sustainability of wef nexus is evaluated on the basis of resources performances indicators within and between subsystems quantification the meaning and calculation of the indicators in fig 1 are described below 2 1 1 water resources subsystem the crop water footprint cwf in m m3 m 106 m3 and water footprint of crop product consumption wfc in m m3 can be used to represent the sustainability development level for the water resources subsystem abdullah 2021 cwf consists of blue water footprint cwfblue green water footprint cwfgreen and grey water footprint cwfgrey the formulas are as follows 1 cwf cwf blue cwf green cwf grey for any crop the cwfblue and cwfgreen are calculated as follows 2 cwf blue 10 a max 0 et c p e 3 cwf green 10 a p e where a is the cultivated area in 104 ha pe and etc are defined as respectively the effective precipitation and the crop evaporation in mm 10 is the unit conversion both pe and etc can be calculated by cropwat model the grey water footprint per unit of crop wfgrey in m3 t m3 1000 l was calculated following the formula hoekstra et al 2011 4 wf grey α ar c max c nat 1 y 5 cwf grey wf grey op 1000 where α represents the leaching runoff fraction ar kg ha kg 106 mg the nitrogenous fertilizer application rate to the field cmax mg l the maximum acceptable concentration of the nutrient in the receiving water body and cnat the natural concentration of the nutrient in the receiving water body in this study cmax and cnat of n were 1 0 and 0 2 mg l respectively y is the crop yield per area in t ha op represents crop output in m kg the cmax and cnat were from china s national surface water quality standard mep 2002 and average values for α of n as suggested to 0 1 in franke et al franke et al 2017 the water footprint of crop production wep in m³ kg is consumption of water footprint while obtain unit of food 6 wep cwf op the water footprint of crop consumption wfc in m m3 is used to quantify how much water has been consumed to grow a crop hoekstra et al 2011 7 wfc fdv wep 8 fdv rpc p 9 rpc nfo np where the

component analysis pca 1 data standardization and covariance matrix the pca of 18 indicators of sdl in lid was carried out using spss 26 0 software the original indicator data is standardized in order to eliminate the quantitative relationship between variables and make the data comparable the normalized indices can be divided into positive type and negative type as shown in eqs 19 and 20 19 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij 20 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where xij is the index before standardization yij is the index after standardization the covariance matrix r rij rji is established according to the standardized data matrix which can reflect the close correlation between standardized variables and the higher the r value the stronger the correlation between variables where rij i j 1 2 3 p is the correlation coefficient between the original variable xi and yj 2 the determination of the number of principal component using spss software the characteristic value and contribution rate and cumulative contribution rate of each principal component were calculated the first four components were extracted according to the principle that the cumulative contribution rate is greater than 85 among them the contribution rate of the first principal component was 45 2 the second principal component contribution rate was 28 1 the third principal component contribution rate was 14 1 and the fourth principal component contribution rate was 8 9 which can concentrate 96 3 of the original variable 3 the establishment of the factor load matrix is calculated with the principal component score coefficient factor load is the correlation coefficient r zi xi reveals the correlation between the principal component and the sdl indicators as can be seen from the factor load matrix table 1 the first principal component is mainly influenced by op and cwf the second principal component is mainly influenced by cwfgreen and eep the third principal component is mainly influenced by wfc and the fourth principal component is mainly influenced by cwfgrey the principal component score factor is the square root of the calculation of the respective factor load vector divided by the characteristic value of the respective factor the formula is as follows 21 y i r i λ i where ri is a factor load and i is the corresponding feature root λi is the eigenvalue yi is the principal

systems according to the principal component scoring coefficient matrix and the main component variance the calculation method is as follows 22 sdl k y ij y i where sdl ranges from 0 to 1 which is expected to exceed 0 5 in addition the higher the sdl the better the sustainability of wef nexus 2 3 partial least squares regression plsr plsr is a multi iterative projection method for building relationships between independent variable argument matrix x and response matrix y which is appropriate when the predictor exhibit multiple collinearity compared to principal component analysis plsr uses only the most important linear combinations to handle highly relevant noisy data cao et al 2020 2021 das et al 2019 the variable importance for the projection vip is used to represent the importance of a predictor for both the explanatory variables and the response variable and the regression coefficient rc is an indicator that reflects the direction and intensity of each variable in the plsr model in order to explore the relationship between sdl and the driving factors in pumped irrigation systems the response model of sdl to the driving factors was constructed and the main driving factors of sdl of pumped irrigation systems were found in this study the indicators that were considered to affect pumped irrigation systems are used in previous studies cao et al 2020 2021 as shown in table 2 2 4 study areas and data sources the observed pumped irrigation systems namely lid fig s1 in jiangsu province of china was selected as study area lid is located in the eastern of china the lower reaches of the huaihe river basin which extends from 118 59 to 119 46 e and 33 39 to 34 07 n during the study period from 2005 to 2019 in the lid relevant production data is presented in table s1 lid is a large irrigation district with abundant light rich precipitation which is suitable for crop growth in this study the sdl of wef nexus was assessed for the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output in the pumping irrigation district for the period 2005 2019 the cropwat model is required to represent meteorological sources such as sunshine hours precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed which are from the main weather site data in the china meteorological science data sharing service http cdc cma gov cn yearly crop output planting area ie and flow of 733 pumping stations in lid were provided by the irrigation district administration 3 results 3 1 performances of water resources energy and food production subsystem 3 1 1 water resource subsystem the annual cwf and wfc of food were 1219 5 cwfgrey was nearly 24 6 and 1791 1 m m3 respectively during the period of 2005 2019 in lid in order to judge the water consumption varying with time in the crop production process the annual cwf cwfblue cwfgreen and cwfgrey wfc and blue water proportion bwp values are demonstrated in fig 2 fig 2 reveals that cwf and wfc showed a trend of increasing over time in lid and the interannual variation of bwp was significant cv coefficient of variation 0 2 crop production and water consumption related to the large fluctuation of precipitation in previous years during the study period the arable land area changed from about 8 5 104 to 10 3 104 ha and the total amount of water resources and agricultural water consumption changed by 0 81 g m3 g 109 m3 and 0 47 g m3 respectively cwf has generally shown a steady growth trend from 2005 to 2013 however there was a decline in 2014 and 2018 and the remaining years still maintained an increasing trend with time under the premise that crop water consumption and water productivity had been little change the expansion of agricultural production scale and the change of planting structure are the main driving forces of cwf steady growth the overall growth trend of wfc which declined in 2016 2019 was mainly related to the reduction of the wfp of food i e the increasing in the productivity of lid overall the wfc was slightly higher than the cwf indicating that crop production consumes more water than the processing high productivity and improved processing processes are equally important for water conservation and contribute to the sustainability of water resources the change of rainfall led to the change of bwp which ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 implying that the cwfblue consumed in crop production was increasing leading to a gradual shift from green water to blue water the average grey water proportion gwp is 24 6 which meant that the cwfgrey consumed by diluted fertilizer accounts for about a quarter of the cwf which suggests that fertilizer input should be reduced especially nitrogen fertilizer it is indicated that the utilization of water with high instability in the production process was greatly affected by the climate in pumped irrigation systems 3 1 2 energy subsystem the fluctuations of eec and eep were relatively obvious with the average values of 3088 6 kwh and 79 5 kg kj respectively making clear that there is generally inefficient energy utilization the change of ami is on a steady growth trend with the average value of 7 0 kw ha according to the eec eep and ami values among 15 years the specific year in which the larger and smaller values were located can be determined as shown in fig 3 observing the temporal variation of eec it is found that the annual eec fluctuated significantly change rate cr 11 6 which was mainly involved with the limited water and soil resources and the unstable climatic conditions the remarkable thing is that eec decreased in 2014 eep is the opposite meanwhile a sharp increasing in precipitation was found which pointed that eec was relevant to changes in precipitation it can be explained that eec and eep quantitatively describes the relationship on energy subsystem in typical pumped irrigation systems also it is related to climatic conditions generally speaking the ami is on the rise with an average annual cr of 6 0 which indicates that low agricultural investment and slow agricultural modernization as shown in fig 3 b dep showed an increasing trend with significant growth cr 42 7 in 2012 2015 in 2007 and 2017 there was a decline but overall growth trend while the change in gep was significant from 2008 to 2013 cr 284 8 there was a decrease in 2006 2008 and 2019 however mp on the whole presented an increasing trend cr 346 7 it is worth noting that both dep and gep growth was at its peak in 2008 while mp declined which is related to local agricultural inputs the raw materials and principles of mechanical power inputs are different the impact on agricultural production is also diverse diesel engines are much more efficient and economical than gasoline engines but they emit a lot more harmful substances than gasoline engines compared with the above two kinds of internal combustion engines motors have less pollution in the energy conversion process but due to the constraints of technology and energy storage equipment the utilization of motors has been restricted among the three mechanical power inputs dep input is the largest about 88 3 followed by mp input and gep input suggesting that low fuel efficiency leads to high dependence on diesel in lid and is not conducive to the sustainable development of energy 3 1 3 food production subsystem the annual fai and pai were 472 4 and 6 2 kg ha respectively during the period of 2005 2019 in lid fig 4 in order to investigate the relevant indicators of food production subsystem varying with time in the crop production process the annual op fev y and cwp values are shown in fig 4 fig 4 reveals that fai and pai presented a dynamic course of minus increase minus over time in lid and the interannual variation of pai was significant both op and fev showed a trend of increasing then decreasing and lastly increasing while the changes in y and cwp were not obvious crs 1 0 but they were growing slowly on the whole fai and pai showed a decreasing trend while op and y were increasing although there have been several years of decline indicating that reducing the fav and pcd had not resulted in a reduction in op in other words the productive potential of seeds is increasing what s more reducing the amount of fertilizer and pesticide application contributes to relieve the stress of environment regulation food demand volume was increasing with population growth and economic development except for a period in 2010 2012 fev declined while op was modest fev were in line with changes in op in other years both increasing and decreasing at the same time under the condition of rapid population growth and increasing food demand the fev was still showing an increasing trend hinting that the productive potential of seeds is well matched to social development from the point of virtual water food exporting can alleviate water pressure in unsuitable for crops but economically developed cities in order to meet the food demand of a growing population both op and y need to be increased to achieve the sustainability of food production as for the cwp of food with no significant changes cr 1 0 the multi year average of cwp including grey water footprint is 0 7 kg m3 suggesting that low water productivity high water consumption and low yield are not conducive to the sustainable development of food production subsystem 3 2 sdl in wef nexus during 2005 2019 the average sdl of wef nexus was about 0 3 in lid the main statistics such as the range standard deviation sd coefficient of variation and change rate of each system were calculated for the purpose of clarifying the sustainable development of lid and its changes over time the results are listed in table 3 which shows that the sustainability was underdeveloped in typical pumped irrigation systems as illustrated in fig 5 the sdl values of different subsystems were used to analyze and evaluate the productivity of pumped irrigation systems and the sustainability of wef nexus in agricultural production systems fig 5 reveals that the sdl fluctuated greatly among 15 years and represents weak stability which is mainly related to the instability of artificial factors and natural conditions over the years especially the low stability of the cwfgreen caused by precipitation as well as water electricity consumption and op instability resulting weak stability of sdl combined with table 3 and fig 5 sdlw in water resources subsystem was the highest followed by sdle in energy subsystem and sdlf in food production subsystem it can be seen that the sustainability of subsystems is unfavorable in observed pumped irrigation systems which is not good for the sustainable development of agricultural production in terms of changes among 15 years the range were large while sd and cv were small which showed that the absolute changes were not obvious among the three subsystems sdl the sdlf range and sd were the highest which together revealed that food production system was relatively unstable compared with other two subsystems the sds of sdlw and sdle were not far apart and lower than that of sdlf which meant that the variation was not significant besides the cvs of sdlw and sdle were lower than sdlf which implied the low dispersion degree of indicators and the inconspicuous change during the study period table 3 and fig 5 also reveal that the sdls represent a growing trend in various subsystems furthermore the productivity had improved greatly among nearly 15 years in typical pumped irrigation systems the average growth rate of all four systems were above 5 0 with food production subsystem the highest raising sdlf from 0 to 0 4 however the food production subsystem not only has the lowest sdl but also changed significantly from the food perspective in which water and energy are the inputs de vito et al 2017 therefore water energy and food form a tight triangle consequently on the basis of guaranteeing food security more efforts are made to improve sdlf and achieve sustainable development of agricultural systems meanwhile water resources and energy subsystem should not be neglected in order to improve the sustainable development of wef nexus of pumped irrigation systems the efficiency of resource utilization especially energy should be enhanced 3 3 driving mechanism of sdl the driving factors were involved in many aspects associated with wef nexus such as natural climate social economy water supply and demand and agricultural production characteristics cao et al 2020 2021 the results of the analysis of the main factor of sdl using plsr are summarized in table 4 and fig 6 as listed in table 4 the two partial least multiplication regression main components extracted by the plsr model explain 89 0 and 5 4 of sdl respectively while adding more components to sdl s plsr model it didn t increase the contribution rate to sdl rc represents the positive or negative impact of the driving factor on sdl when the variable whose rc is greater than 0 it indicates that the variable has a positive impact on sdl and vice versa fig 6 manifests that precipitation pre of natural conditions had a positive effect on sdl while temperature tem had a negative effect on sdl population growth rate pgr urbanization rate urr agricultural production value rate apr rural residents income rri total water resources twr agricultural water rate awr and electricity consumption per unit cultivated land area eca in artificial factors had a positive impact on sdl while carbon dioxide emission intensity cdi food export rate fer and gross domestic product per capita gdc had a negative impact on sdl in general the variable whose vip 1 is an important influence on the cause variable vip 1 of the three variables in sdl s plsr model fig 6 were pre cdi and rri respectively among them the increasing of pre and rri could lead to sdl rising at the same time the lower vip factors included tem fer pgr urr gdc apr twr awr and eca precipitation and temperature are natural conditions directly related to crop production processes as the cwfgreen increases with the increasing of precipitation the corresponding cwfblue and eec decrease which contributes to reduce water energy consumption and alleviate resources stress higher temperature will increase evaporation and accelerate nutrient loss which is not conducive to crop growth chen et al 2022 therefore the richer precipitation and lower temperature are conducive to the sustainable development in pumped irrigation systems cdi fer pgr urr gdc apr twr awr and eca are all artificial factors that can comprehensively reflect the agricultural production conditions socioeconomic development and water resources utilization increasing carbon dioxide emissions will affect the climatic productivity potential thereby altering the primary productivity of ecosystems and land carrying capacity for agriculture northrup et al 2021 ultimately restraining the sustainable development of agriculture as a food production base the local food demand and food export are staged in lid which means that more water energy resources are being consumed resulting in a risk of resources shortage accordingly it imposes restrictions on the sustainable development of local agricultural production for the increasing of fer pgr expresses the degree and trend of population growth thus the reasonableness of the population structure increases the stability of the system operation the increasing of pgr conduces to adjust the population structure guarantee the labor force hence leading to an increasing sdl the improvement of urbanization has accelerated industrial development promoted regional economic growth and ensured agricultural investment in pumped irrigation systems resulting in an increasing sdl the larger the apr is it implies that agricultural production contributes more to local economy and promotes the development of agriculture meanwhile rri also has been increased which is conducive to the sustainable production of agricultural systems agricultural production practices are inseparable from the input of water energy resources such as pumped irrigation food production and processing as the population increases so does the demand for water energy and food so the expansion of twr awr and eca improves the sustainability of wef nexus 4 discussion 4 1 the characteristics of water energy food nexus in pumped irrigation systems sustainability science has expanded from a descriptive model to a solution oriented approach guo et al 2021 meanwhile the sustainability assessment is a critical first step in establishing a methodology that clarifies wef nexus interactions and provides a basis for future project first the sustainability evaluation framework based on the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output fills the functional shortcomings of single stage oriented indicators sustainable agricultural development encompasses all aspects of agricultural production associated with the wef nexus further takes into account the social economic and ecological impacts of agricultural activities guo et al 2021 a single indicator was not sufficient to evaluate the sustainability of wef nexus yi et al 2020 thus eighteen indicators were considered to establish the research framework in addition these indicators were selected for the reason that they reflect the variability of the sustainability of agricultural production in a given situation and contribute to more rational decision making second a methodology to construct sustainable development level index was implemented to assess the wef nexus for pumped irrigation systems and to provide decision makers with the required information yi et al 2020 the sdl assessment is the basis for promoting the sustainability of wef nexus in agricultural production systems under the environment of ameliorating water saving irrigation quantifying resource utilization efficiency and sustainability evaluation of seeding systems is crucial to ensure a balance among three subsystems consequently the sdl evaluation was carried out in the typical pumped irrigation systems sdl manifested the productivity of wef nexus as a benchmark for the evaluating the sustainability in pumped irrigation systems unreasonable crop cultivation structure can exacerbate the waste of water energy resources lead to lower water energy utilization reduce food productivity and therefore is not conducive to the sustainable development of wef nexus in agricultural production systems third the average annual sdl was 0 3 during the study period mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that the sustainability was relative underdeveloped in typical pumped irrigation systems it s worth noting that only sdlw exceeded 0 5 during 2014 2018 suggesting that water resources subsystem had captured more attention from stakeholders in the process of crop growth and will achieve sustainable development earlier in the future energy subsystem and food production subsystem should be poured more attention into and appropriate management so as to keep up with the steps of water resources subsystem in order to realize the sustainable development of agricultural production the novelty and characteristics of this study is the overall perspective of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output rather than the previous studies on water allocation li et al 2020 this might provide more intuitive decision support for the sustainable management of agricultural production systems since the resource utilization in the agricultural production process was evaluated from the perspective of three subsystems considering different types of drivers including natural and artificial factors 4 2 the enlightenment for pumped irrigation systems management the plsr model was applied to explore the driving factors of sdl and the results manifested that pre was the significant positive meteorological factors of sdl in addition the instability of the current climate reduced the stability of sdl and was detrimental to the natural growth of crops human activities are one of the factors affecting pre mainly through changing the underlying surface conditions such as afforestation vegetation restoration construction of reservoirs and water conservancy projects will increase the humidity of the air ultimately resulting in increasing sdl at the socioeconomic level cdi and rri are the significant negative and significant positive factors affecting sdl respectively eec is the main factor causing carbon dioxide emission during crop growth in the pumped irrigation systems the stakeholders can replace old equipment or improve pump installation design to enhance the pump efficiency in addition the cwfblue of maize was much smaller than that of rice and wheat cui et al 2021 therefore adjusting crop planting structure can reduce the eec of pumped irrigation systems from the perspective of water supply and distribution the ie can be improved by replacing channel transportation with pipeline transportation furthermore different irrigation and drainage modes have an impact on irrigation water wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c hence an appropriate irrigation and drainage mode can reduce eec and then increase sdl besides increasing investment in capital can improve breeding ability and increase crop production potential with economic development population increase and mechanical input modern agriculture has gradually replaced traditional agriculture with the support of labor force and science technology production efficiency has been effectively improved thus resulting in an increasing sdl consequently the sustainable management of pumped irrigation systems can be carried out according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in spite of this there are two limitations in this study on the one hand the relationship between the subsystems of wef nexus is dynamic rather than static however the dynamic feedback of the system has not addressed in this research on the other hand only the relationships within the system were considered nevertheless the connections to the outside were ignored therefore in the future research system dynamics wu et al 2021a 2021b 2021c or bayesian network models wang et al 2021 will be applied to demonstrate the dynamic causal relationships between subsystems more importantly we will integrate the input output analysis with external resources to make the results more accurate based on this more metrics will be added to analyze the impact of multiple factors on wef nexus 5 conclusion based on wef nexus combining traditional agricultural water saving and water footprint theory this paper aimed at establishing an index evaluation framework considering the whole process of water extraction and deployment water consumption for crop growth and food production output afterwards analyzing the sustainability of agricultural production in typical pumped irrigation systems the average sdl was low during study period in observed pumped irrigation systems mainly due to the low sdle and sdlf indicating that the weak utilization efficiency of water energy resources aggravated the waste of resources which was not conducive to the sustainable development of agricultural production what s more pre was the most obvious meteorological factor affecting sdl while cdi and rri of artificial factors had a significant impact on sdl besides the sustainable management can be carried out according to the unique driving factors identification of wef nexus in pumped irrigation systems consequently the local managers can improve the efficiency of water energy resource utilization by adjusting crop planting structure transforming irrigation and drainage mode updating water pump equipment and increasing agricultural investment so as to achieve

9344,tile outlet discharge soil moisture and groundwater response were monitored for one year from a 10 ha catchment in north central ohio to understand the impact of automated drainage water management adwm following 16 storm events under adwm the tile outlet valve was programmed to open and release water when the water level in the control structure reached a user defined set point below the soil surface average groundwater level soil moisture and percentage of surface flooding indicated by groundwater levels were not significantly different following precipitation events during periods of adwm compared to free drainage however the time to achieve maximum soil water moisture following precipitation onset was significantly longer and lateral hydraulic gradients were greater during periods of free drainage compared to periods of adwm which potentially alters how agricultural fields contribute water through edge of field buffers and waterways in addition maximum discharge occurred significantly later for storm events that occurred during adwm however total tile outlet discharge was surprisingly not significantly different for events that happened under adwm compared to events that occurred during free drainage tile outlet discharge for precipitation events occurring under adwm was significantly correlated with the percentage of time during the event in which the tile outlet valve was opened adwm for this study was thus more effective at retaining water in the field and reducing tile outlet to near zero discharge during low intensity precipitation events and when dry antecedent conditions were present our results highlight that fields under adwm are not isolated from the surrounding landscape as they still allow water to move beyond the boundary of the field through combinations of 1 redistributions or reconnections of subsurface flow pathways and 2 periodic opening of outlet valves to release tile drainage water during large storm events and wet conditions keywords tile drainage drainage water management groundwater soil water agriculture hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estimated 80 90 of the original wetlands in the midwest were artificially drained to increase land for agricultural production mitsch and day 2006 artificial subsurface tile drainage is used throughout the region to increase field trafficability crop yield or grazing season length by removing excess water soil water while about 83 5 of the 225 024 km2 of land under tile drainage in the u s is found in the midwest states of iowa illinois minnesota indiana ohio and michigan the land area drained by tile drainage across the entire u s increased by 14 from 2012 to 2017 and has roughly doubled since 1970 pavelis 1987 further additional tile drains are also being installed on previously drained fields to promote more uniform drying following rain events macrae et al 2021 given the large percentage of cropland using tile drainage the timing and volume of runoff in receiving streams has been substantially altered impacting interrelated changes in stream morphology nutrient cycles aquatic habitat and biota blann et al 2009 for example tile drainage can cause a flashier streamflow response miller and lyon 2021a more erosive rivers schottler et al 2013 and provide a conduit for nutrient transport e g johnston et al 1965 king et al 2015 miller and lyon 2021b most early studies concluded that compared to natural conditions tile drainage combined with a shift in land use to row crops contributes to increased peak runoff nutrient losses and sediment losses skaggs et al 1994 to address some of these concerns drainage water management dwm also referred to as controlled drainage began to be promoted as a best management practice that reduced drainage water volumes and subsequent nutrient loads during parts of the year that would not affect crop production such as the winter fallow period or drier summer months in practice dwm uses water level control structures typically installed near the outlet of tile drainage systems to reduce tile outlet discharge and increase in field residence times in winter months however most studies have reported that a majority of the reduction in nutrient export arising from dwm is attributed to reduced drainage volume and not reduced nutrient concentrations skaggs et al 2012a 2012b reported average annual drainage volume reductions ranging from 18 to over 85 from 20 studies conducted in the u s canada and sweden using dwm while not significantly affecting nitrate concentrations reduced drainage water volume from dwm is hypothesized to be accompanied by increased water movement into and through deeper soil layers gilliam et al 1979 and increased lateral seepage or surface runoff williams et al 2015 however few studies have investigated the effects of dwm on the in field redistribution of water saadat et al 2017 bou lahdou et al 2019 in addition while dwm has been shown to reduce drainage volumes from agricultural fields labor burdens requiring producers to physically manage water control structures have prevented greater adoption as such automated drainage water management adwm as a management practice has been developed to help remove this burden through installation of electronically actuated slide gate valves triggered by water level sensors that are programable to meet producers needs for optimal field operations there remain questions however around the impact of this automation within dwm on the timing and amount of discharge and on the redistribution of water and flow pathways at the edge of agricultural fields the goal of this study is to compare the in field hydrologic response to precipitation events for an agricultural field in north central ohio under periods of adwm and periods where the field experiences traditional free drainage specifically we compared the change in 1 tile outlet discharge 2 groundwater levels and 3 soil moisture dynamics for nine rain events that occurred under adwm conditions and seven rain events that occurred under free drainage conditions from october 28 2020 through september 28 2021 in this paper we use high frequency precipitation groundwater level soil moisture and tile outlet discharge data from a small agricultural catchment 10 ha to examine the hydrologic redistribution following storm events groundwater and soil moisture were monitored at six locations in the middle of the tile drainage network along the edge and outside of the tile drainage network allowing us to compare the groundwater and soil moisture response in field to the edge of field under periods of free drainage and adwm finally we discuss the implications of our results for adwm as a best management practice as they pertain to nutrient export from small agricultural fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and data this study was conducted at the grace l drake agricultural laboratory part of the ohio state university wooster campus near apple creek in north central ohio fig 1 a smart drainage system sds agri drain corporation adair iowa usa covering a 6 ha field was installed in 2019 the sds is an adwm system that allows users to remotely program the tile drainage outlet valve to open and close depending on water level recorded in the tile outlet control structure fig 2 the sds can operate in manual and automatic modes under manual mode the user defines whether the outlet valve is open or closed regardless of the water level recorded in the outlet control structure and behaves like normal dwm when operating under automatic mode the tile outlet valve remains closed until water level rises above a user defined threshold set point which triggers the valve to open for a defined amount of time multiple set points can be created that require different wait timers for the water level to exceed the set points before opening the slide gate valve for example the slide gate valve could be programmed to open if the water level in the control structure is at least 5 cm above the set point for 10 h or if the water level is at least 10 cm above the set point for 2 h we operated the sds following typical recommendations to mitigate nutrient transport and maintain healthy crop growth during the winter months december march a relatively shallow set point 25 4 cm below the ground surface was defined in the outlet control structure to trigger the outlet valve to open the valve remained closed in winter months unless water level in the control structure rose to within 25 4 cm from the ground surface which triggered the valve to open and release water fig 2a b subsequently the valve would close again when water level fell to below the set point fig 2c corn zea mays l was planted on may 25 2021 prior to planting the outlet valve was manually opened to facilitate free drainage lower the water table in the field and to allow for heavy machinery to operate the valve remained continuously open to allow free drainage during the wet spring months to prevent damage to the root zone of the establishing crop following crop emergence june 8 2021 the sds was operated in automatic mode but with a much deeper set point 76 2 cm inches below the ground surface in order to not damage the root zone with elevated groundwater levels during summer storm events water level in the control structure would periodically exceed the set point which triggered the valve to open until water level fell below the set point prior to fall harvest september 27 2021 the outlet valve was manually programmed to remain open to promote faster drainage and allow for heavy machinery to harvest the crop while the sds covered a 6 ha field the topographic contributing area captured by the sds was larger 10 ha surface runoff originating in the untiled portion of the topographic contributing area was periodically observed during large storm events this water flowed downgradient and infiltrated the soil above the tile drainage network high resolution lidar data 0 58 m resolution was downloaded from the ohio geographically referenced information program ogrip https ogrip oit ohio gov accessed august 2021 for the study area to delineate the topographic contributing area of the field site based on surface topography dwm is most effective in relatively flat areas with slopes not exceeding 1 which is why the sds at our field site was limited to 6 ha the drainpipe diameter was 10 cm 4 in except for the main and northernmost laterals which were 15 cm 6 in the final 33 m of the main was 20 cm 8 in in diameter to promote additional drainage six monitoring locations were established at the field site fig 1 three sites were installed along the northern edge of the field western edge we middle edge me eastern edge ee and three sites were located in the middle of the field western field wf middle field mf eastern field ef at each site groundwater wells were installed at 180 cm depths and groundwater level was monitored using hydros 21 sensors meter environment pullman wa usa groundwater levels are reported relative to the tile outlet elevation volumetric water content was monitored using teros 12 sensors meter environment pullman wa usa at two depths 30 60 cm average volumetric water content was calculated for each site from the two installed soil moisture sensors in addition an atmos 41 weather station meter environment pullman wa usa was installed at site ee and measured precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure relative humidity wind speed and direction and barometric air pressure all sensors continuously recorded data at 15 minute intervals 2 2 precipitation event identification and characterization precipitation patterns at the field site are strongly influenced by its location in the interior of the north american continent during the winter the polar jet stream is located near the study area resulting in cloudy skies and regular low intensity storms williams and king 2020 during the summer weather is more impacted by warm humid subtropical air masses originating from the atlantic resulting in short duration convective thunderstorms an algorithm was developed from the continuous precipitation data to select distinct events equally captured by the two contrasting climate patterns distinct precipitation events were separated from each other if at least four consecutive hours occurred without precipitation only events with at least 10 mm of cumulative precipitation were considered in addition we only selected events in which other 10 mm events did not occur in the three preceding days to evaluate the effects of adwm on groundwater and soil moisture response in the three days following precipitation events this resulted in 16 total precipitation events for each of the 16 precipitation events the duration event precipitation amount average intensity event precipitation amount duration three day total amount and the antecedent three day amounts were calculated precipitation events were nominally classified as free or managed based on the tile outlet valve status free events occurred when the tile outlet valve was in manual mode and opened to allow free drainage for the full three day duration managed events occurred when the tile outlet valve was in automatic mode and closed at the beginning of the event and remained closed for at least half of the three day duration during managed events the tile outlet valve would periodically open to release water until the water level recorded in the outlet control structure fell below a defined value and then was closed again average precipitation tile outlet discharge groundwater and soil moisture dynamics were compared between free and managed events using the wilcoxon rank sum test 2 3 tile outlet discharge water level was monitored continuously in the tile outlet control structure using a pressure transducer manual tile outlet discharge measurements were taken biweekly covering both conditions when the outlet valve was opened and closed due to minor leaks in the control structure stoplogs small amounts of tile outlet discharge occurred even when the valve was closed rating curves were developed between the manual field discharge measurements and the continuously recorded water level during both opened and closed conditions figure a 1 the volumetric flow rate of the tile outlet discharge was converted to depth averaged discharge by dividing the volume of discharge by the topographic contributing area 10 ha for each precipitation event the three day tile discharge mm tile discharge ratio tile discharge divided by three day total precipitation maximum discharge time between the beginning of the event and timing of peak discharge and percentage of time the tile outlet valve was opened were recorded during managed precipitation events when the tile outlet began closed but opened to release water the discharged tile outlet water when the valve opened was included in the summation of tile outlet discharge occasionally the tile outlet was submerged due to high river stage conditions river stage was monitored immediately upstream with a pressure transducer hobo u20 onset corporation bourne ma usa and found to exceed the elevation of water recorded in the control structure thus tile outlet discharge was set to zero when the river stage exceeded the height of the tile outlet drain this assumption did not impact the difference between managed and free drainage events as these conditions occurred equally for both managed and free drainage events 2 4 soil moisture response for each precipitation event the average antecedent and maximum volumetric water contents were determined at each monitoring site from volumetric soil moisture sensors installed at two depths 30 60 cm in addition the time between the onset of the event and maximum average volumetric water content hr was calculated 2 5 groundwater response groundwater response was monitored for each precipitation event the antecedent and maximum groundwater levels cm and time elapsed until maximum level was achieved hr were determined for each monitoring site the change in groundwater level was calculated by subtracting the antecedent level from the maximum level and dividing by the precipitation event depth to determine the change in groundwater level relative to the precipitation amount the depth of groundwater was calculated for each well to determine the percentage of time during precipitation events that each site experienced flooding i e groundwater depth 0 in addition mean groundwater recession rates mm hr were calculated during the 12 h following peak groundwater level groundwater hydraulic gradients were calculated between pairs of monitoring wells during each event to evaluate the effects of adwm on groundwater movement the mean hydraulic gradients were calculated for each precipitation event over the three day duration 3 results 3 1 precipitation characteristics during the study period 713 mm of precipitation was recorded precipitation accumulation was fairly uniform throughout the study apart from two large rain events in may 47 8 mm and july 59 7 mm fig 3 collectively these two storm events produced 15 of all total precipitation recorded during the study overall the valve was closed 62 of the time during which 391 mm of precipitation occurred the tile outlet was open the remaining 38 of the time in which 322 mm of precipitation occurred to put the study period in context annual precipitation for 2021 represented the 42nd percentile when considering 40 years of daily observation 1982 through 2021 made at the nearby wooster weather station within college of food agriculture and environmental science weather system weather cfaes osu edu maintained by ohio state university as such the study year considered here can be considered representative with regards to precipitation amounts and events relative to a long term perspective sixteen precipitation events with at least 10 mm and separated by at least three days were identified table 1 fig 3 during these 16 events 374 mm of precipitation occurred or 52 of the total precipitation recorded during the study period on average 23 4 mm of precipitation occurred over a 13 3 hour time span for each event average event characteristics were compared for free and managed events but not found to be significantly different according to the wilcoxon rank sum test table 1 despite precipitation events occurring during different times of the year caused by different mechanisms the event characteristics were similar albeit with large standard deviations for both free and managed events managed events occurred under more variable meteorological conditions and included both low intensity winter storms and summer convective thunderstorms while free drainage events generally occurred during the spring 3 2 tile outlet discharge the tile outlet was closed for most of the time during winter december february and summer months june september fig 4 during these extended periods the tile outlet valve would periodically open to minimize surface runoff or damaging the crop root zone over the entire study period 287 mm of tile outlet discharge was recorded or 40 3 of the observed precipitation this percentage is slightly greater but within the ranges of values reported in previous studies logan et al 1980 christianson and harmel 2015 williams et al 2015 overall the vast majority of tile outlet discharge 270 mm 94 occurred when the valve was open while the remaining 17 mm 6 occurred when the valve was closed due to minor leaks in the control structure stoplogs the precipitation events in late december and mid july occurred during managed events when the tile outlet valve began closed but was triggered to open for short periods to release water until the water level recorded in the control structure dropped below the set point this resulted in repetitive cycling of the tile outlet valve opening and closing for several days fig 5 water level in the control structure would exceed the set point causing the valve to open and subsequently lowering the level in the control structure a short wait timer resulted in the valve cycling between opened and closed over a four day period average tile outlet discharge characteristics for each precipitation event are summarized in table 2 during free drainage events the total tile outlet discharge and discharge to precipitation ratio was slightly greater compared to managed events but not significantly different there was no difference in maximum discharge for free or managed events but the maximum discharge occurred significantly later for managed events during free drainage events all tile outlet discharge occurred when the outlet valve was opened during managed events the outlet valve was opened for on average 18 6 of the three day event duration in which 96 of tile outlet discharge occurred for managed events there were strong significant correlations between the percent of the event that the tile outlet valve was opened with event discharge and event discharge to precipitation ratio pearson s r 0 86 and 0 76 respectively 3 3 soil moisture dynamics average volumetric water content at the six monitoring sites during the study period is shown in fig 6 soil moisture remained relatively high for the first six months of the study regardless of whether the tile outlet valve was opened or closed volumetric water content at all monitoring locations did not begin substantially declining until late may 2021 the largest increases in soil moisture generally occurred during the 16 analyzed precipitation events mean soil moisture dynamics following the 16 precipitation events are summarized in table 3 the only significant difference between free drainage and managed events was the time between the start of the event and maximum soil volumetric water content which was longer for free events this was significantly different for three of the six monitoring locations and the overall mean while mean soil moisture dynamics were similar for many variables across the monitoring locations the standard deviation during managed events was typically larger compared to free events the managed events occurred during the winter and summer thus reflecting different wetness conditions and storm mechanisms while the free events generally occurred during the same season spring march may 3 4 groundwater response groundwater levels and depths at the six monitoring locations relative to the tile outlet elevation during the study period is shown in fig 6 and figure a 2 similar to average volumetric water content groundwater levels generally were at the greatest levels during the first six months of the study regardless of tile outlet valve status and responded quickly to precipitation events groundwater level at all monitoring locations declined over the last five months of the study period the monitoring well at site we was dry for the final month of the study groundwater level recorded at site ee the closest monitoring site to the tile outlet valve showed the most similar patterns to the water level recorded in the control structure during precipitation events when the slide gate valve was closed fig 5 however when the valve was open groundwater level recorded at this site was typically much greater than the water level recorded in the control structure emphasizing that the water level in the control structure is not synonymous with the field groundwater level groundwater responses to the 16 precipitation events are summarized in table 4 like the average volumetric water content patterns there were few significant differences between free and managed events while the standard deviation tended to be greater for managed events the mean groundwater recession rate during the first 12 hrs following peak groundwater level was significantly greater for site mf during free events compared to managed events the average hydraulic gradients measured between monitoring sites located within the smart drainage system me ee mf ef was significantly greater during free events compared to managed events table 5 however there was no difference in hydraulic gradients during free and managed events recorded outside of the sds wf mf we me positive gradients in table 5 indicate flow direction from the first mentioned location to the second for example the positive groundwater hydraulic gradient recorded for me ee indicates flow direction was from me to ee in contrast the negative gradients measured for we me indicate flow direction was from me to we the mean hydraulic gradients measured between ef ee mf me and wf we north south direction were not found to be significantly different for free and managed events 4 discussion 4 1 effect of drainage water management on water redistribution given the strong correlation between tile outlet discharge and the percentage of event that the tile outlet was opened for the managed events it is not surprising that the managed events that had an opened tile outlet valve the largest amount of the time behaved more like free drainage events fig 7 figure a 3 the second and third largest tile runoff occurred during management events when the outlet valve was opened for about 40 of the duration of the event moderate amount of tile runoff occurred during other managed events in which the valve was opened 20 30 of the time which was similar to the tile runoff measured during free drainage events at the event scale closing the tile outlet valve resulted in small reductions in tile outlet discharge discharge to precipitation ratio and increased the time to peak tile discharge while having minimum impact on soil moisture dynamics groundwater response and surface flooding at individual monitoring locations we suspect the small sample size of precipitation events contributed to the lack of significant difference between tile outlet discharge and discharge to precipitation ratio for our study drainage water management using adwm was most effective at reducing tile outlet discharge during dry conditions during low to moderate rain events or when the set point of the outlet control structure is relatively shallow for example of the 16 events analyzed the second and third largest tile outlet runoff volumes occurred during managed events in july when the set point was relatively deep below the soil surface this resulted in the tile outlet valve being open for about 40 of each event in which most of the tile outlet discharge occurred fig 7 the first event had over twice the amount of precipitation 59 7 mm compared to the mean of all 16 events while the second event occurred six days following the first event emphasizing the role of extreme precipitation events and antecedent wetness conditions on creating tile outlet discharge if these two large events in july were removed the tile outlet discharge for free and managed events were significantly different the remaining managed events occurred during the winter due to smaller less intense precipitation events and when the set point to a shallower depth resulting in the tile outlet valve remaining closed for a longer time and less discharge compared to free drainage events with similar high maximum groundwater and average soil volumetric water content levels the reduction in tile outlet discharge likely increased other hydrological fluxes at the study site but it remains unclear which fluxes were affected the most for this field simulations using drainmod have suggested increased lateral seepage for fields under dwm suggesting that up to 96 of the tile outlet discharge reductions from dwm can be due to increased lateral seepage youssef et al 2021 however youssef et al 2021 attributed that finding primarily to a sandy layer with high hydraulic conductivity and shallow management depth in the tile outlet control structure 36 cm below surface shedekar et al 2021 predicted that seepage losses were only 4 mm greater for dwm using drainmod simulations hydraulic gradients measured leaving our field site showed no significant differences between dwm and traditional drainage however these gradients may have been influenced by the tile drainage network although groundwater levels measured at the monitoring sites suggested that water level was above tile drain elevation for most of the wet periods decreases in hydraulic gradients under adwm combined with elevated groundwater levels following storm events would allow for shallow subsurface flow pathways to be activated resulting in more lateral subsurface loss than what would be expected under free drainage conditions surface runoff was not measured in this study for practical purposes but inferred from groundwater monitoring levels e g bou lahdou et al 2019 during the two largest precipitation events the adjacent stream completely flooded large portions of the field site which is likely common in other agricultural fields located immediately adjacent to streams and rivers while dwm has been shown to increase surface runoff e g tan and zhang 2011 the maximum groundwater level and percentage of time during precipitation events that groundwater level exceeded the ground surface was not significantly different during managed versus free drainage events remaining hydrological fluxes that likely compensated the reduction in tile outlet discharge are evapotranspiration skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 and vertical seepage ale et al 2009 while these two fluxes were not directly measured the ability of dwm to delay the peak release of tile outlet discharge possibly increased evapotranspiration and vertical seepage obviously individual precipitation event characteristics and the antecedent wetness conditions had a strong effect on the hydrologic response to each rain event further it is possible that the small number of events analyzed in this study are insufficient to draw broad general conclusions from or to support extrapolation beyond our empirical findings 4 2 on the implications for nutrient transport previous research has suggested that reductions in nitrate load achieved from dwm are primarily due to reduction in tile outlet discharge during the non growing season skaggs et al 2012 some studies suggest dwm also results in decreased nitrate concentrations through denitrification ng et al 2002 adeuya et al 2012 while others have not observed a difference in nitrate concentrations williams et al 2015 shedekar et al 2021 clearly nitrate dynamics are complicated by interrelated factors including soil chemistry crop type fertilizer application and weather patterns thus the impact of dwm on tile outlet discharge nitrate concentrations is not expected to be uniform nitrate concentrations are generally assumed to be lower in surface runoff water compared to tile outlet discharge or groundwater gilliam and skaggs 1986 at our site adwm appeared most effective at retaining water during the winter months with low to moderate precipitation events and the summer period with dry antecedent conditions fig 4 which would support reduced nitrogen loads through the retention of water in field further by significantly increasing time to peak tile discharge admw may lead to reductions in soluble phosphorus as the nutrients have more time to be consumed in the soil before being exported via tile drainage or as they move laterally through the subsurface at the edge of field specifically peak soluble phosphorus concentrations have been observed in tile discharge during the same time as peak surface runoff demonstrating a strong surface connection to drainage networks smith et al 2015 this would be consistent with miller and lyon 2021b who saw strong connections between instream soluble phosphorous concentrations and the wetness of the landscape where tile drainage is being utilized thus slowing down flows associated with tile drainage and allowing those waters to reconnect to streams through slower flow pathways associated with subsurface seepage at the edge of field which can be achieved through adwm seems promising as an agricultural bmp targeting nutrient load reductions clearly however more work is needed to understand the collective impacts of adwm on the coupled timing of flows and composition of water leaving farm fields in order to assess its full efficacy as a bmp relatively high groundwater tables associated with dwm are often assumed to increase surface runoff and phosphorus loads during precipitation events thus adwm may present an advantage over regular dwm by being able to open the slide gate valve prior to large precipitation events in order to reduce surface runoff 5 conclusion we compared the impact of adwm on tile outlet discharge soil moisture dynamics and groundwater response following 16 precipitation events over one year soil moisture and groundwater monitored at six locations responded quickly to rain events regardless of whether the tile outlet valve was opened or closed maximum groundwater soil moisture and percentage of surface flooding indicated by groundwater levels were not significantly different following precipitation events during adwm or traditional free drainage while overall tile drainage volumes were much greater when the outlet valve was opened at the event scale tile outlet discharge was not found to be significantly different for events that happened under managed or traditional free drainage although the small sample size and variability in precipitation characteristics likely led to the observed similarities this was because under managed events a large amount of water was discharged during the relatively short periods in which the tile outlet valve was triggered to open tile outlet discharge from precipitation events that occurred under adwm was significantly correlated with the percentage of the event in which the tile outlet valve was opened collectively adwm was most effective during low intensity precipitation events that occurred during winter months with small to moderate rainfall amounts and during late summer storm events that occurred during dry antecedent conditions despite little differences in tile outlet discharge volume between managed and free drainage events the time between the onset of the precipitation event and maximum tile outlet discharge was significantly greater for the managed events which likely reduced nutrient transport from tile outlet discharge the hydraulic gradients along the direction of the laterals were significantly greater during traditional free drainage compared to automated dwm which in turn may have facilitated greater lateral seepage and subsurface nutrient transport during elevated groundwater conditions following storm events under automated dwm funding source this work was

9344,tile outlet discharge soil moisture and groundwater response were monitored for one year from a 10 ha catchment in north central ohio to understand the impact of automated drainage water management adwm following 16 storm events under adwm the tile outlet valve was programmed to open and release water when the water level in the control structure reached a user defined set point below the soil surface average groundwater level soil moisture and percentage of surface flooding indicated by groundwater levels were not significantly different following precipitation events during periods of adwm compared to free drainage however the time to achieve maximum soil water moisture following precipitation onset was significantly longer and lateral hydraulic gradients were greater during periods of free drainage compared to periods of adwm which potentially alters how agricultural fields contribute water through edge of field buffers and waterways in addition maximum discharge occurred significantly later for storm events that occurred during adwm however total tile outlet discharge was surprisingly not significantly different for events that happened under adwm compared to events that occurred during free drainage tile outlet discharge for precipitation events occurring under adwm was significantly correlated with the percentage of time during the event in which the tile outlet valve was opened adwm for this study was thus more effective at retaining water in the field and reducing tile outlet to near zero discharge during low intensity precipitation events and when dry antecedent conditions were present our results highlight that fields under adwm are not isolated from the surrounding landscape as they still allow water to move beyond the boundary of the field through combinations of 1 redistributions or reconnections of subsurface flow pathways and 2 periodic opening of outlet valves to release tile drainage water during large storm events and wet conditions keywords tile drainage drainage water management groundwater soil water agriculture hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estimated 80 90 of the original wetlands in the midwest were artificially drained to increase land for agricultural production mitsch and day 2006 artificial subsurface tile drainage is used throughout the region to increase field trafficability crop yield or grazing season length by removing excess water soil water while about 83 5 of the 225 024 km2 of land under tile drainage in the u s is found in the midwest

1987 further additional tile drains are also being installed on previously drained fields to promote more uniform drying following rain events macrae et al 2021 given the large percentage of cropland using tile drainage the timing and volume of runoff in receiving streams has been substantially altered impacting interrelated changes in stream morphology nutrient cycles aquatic habitat and biota blann et al 2009 for example tile drainage can cause a flashier streamflow response miller and lyon 2021a more erosive rivers schottler et al 2013 and provide a conduit for nutrient transport e g johnston et al 1965 king et al 2015 miller and lyon 2021b most early studies concluded that compared to natural conditions tile drainage combined with a shift in land use to row crops contributes to increased peak runoff nutrient losses and sediment losses skaggs et al 1994 to address some of these concerns drainage water management dwm also referred to as controlled drainage began to be promoted as a best management practice that reduced drainage water volumes and subsequent nutrient loads during parts of the year that would not affect crop production such as the winter fallow period or drier summer months in practice dwm uses water level control structures typically installed near the outlet of tile drainage systems to reduce tile outlet discharge and increase in field residence times in winter months however most studies have reported that a majority of the reduction in nutrient export arising from dwm is attributed to reduced drainage volume and not reduced nutrient concentrations skaggs et al 2012a 2012b reported average annual drainage volume reductions ranging from 18 to over 85 from 20 studies conducted in the u s canada and sweden using dwm while not significantly affecting nitrate concentrations reduced drainage water volume from dwm is hypothesized to be accompanied by increased water movement into and through deeper soil layers gilliam et al 1979 and increased lateral seepage or surface runoff williams et al 2015 however few studies have investigated the effects of dwm on the in field redistribution of water saadat et al 2017 bou lahdou et al 2019 in addition while dwm has been shown to reduce drainage volumes from agricultural fields labor burdens requiring producers to physically manage water control structures have prevented greater adoption as such automated drainage water management adwm as a management practice has been developed to help remove this burden through installation of electronically actuated slide gate valves triggered by water level sensors that are programable to meet producers needs for optimal field operations there remain questions however around the impact of this automation within dwm on the timing and amount of discharge and on the redistribution of water and flow pathways at the edge of agricultural fields the goal of this study is to compare the in field hydrologic response to precipitation events for an agricultural field in north central ohio under periods of adwm and periods where the field experiences traditional free drainage specifically we compared the change in 1 tile outlet discharge 2 groundwater levels and 3 soil moisture dynamics for nine rain events that occurred under adwm conditions and seven rain events that occurred under free drainage conditions from october 28 2020 through september 28 2021 in this paper we use high frequency precipitation groundwater level soil moisture and tile outlet discharge data from a small agricultural catchment 10 ha to examine the hydrologic redistribution following storm events groundwater and soil moisture were monitored at six locations in the middle of the tile drainage network along the edge and outside of the tile drainage network allowing us to compare the groundwater and soil moisture response in field to the edge of field under periods of free drainage and adwm finally we discuss the implications of our results for adwm as a best management practice as they pertain to nutrient export from small agricultural fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and data this study was conducted at the grace l drake agricultural laboratory part of the ohio state university wooster campus near apple creek in north central ohio fig 1 a smart drainage system sds agri drain corporation adair iowa usa covering a 6 ha field was installed in 2019 the sds is an adwm system that allows users to remotely program the tile drainage outlet valve to open and close depending on water level recorded in the tile outlet control structure fig 2 the sds can operate in manual and automatic modes under manual mode the user defines whether the outlet valve is open or closed regardless of the water level recorded in the outlet control structure and behaves like normal dwm when operating under automatic mode the tile outlet valve remains closed until water level rises above a user defined threshold set point which triggers the valve to open for a defined amount of time multiple set points can be created that require different wait timers for the water level to exceed the set points before opening the slide gate valve for example the slide gate valve could be programmed to open if the water level in the control structure is at least 5 cm above the set point for 10 h or if the water level is at least 10 cm above the set point for 2 h we operated the sds following typical recommendations to mitigate nutrient transport and maintain healthy crop growth during the winter months december march a relatively shallow set point 25 4 cm below the ground surface was defined in the outlet control structure to trigger the outlet valve to open the valve remained closed in winter months unless water level in the control structure rose to within 25 4 cm from the ground surface which triggered the valve to open and release water fig 2a b subsequently the valve would close again when water level fell to below the set point fig 2c corn zea mays l was planted on may 25 2021 prior to planting the outlet valve was manually opened to facilitate free drainage lower the water table in the field and to allow for heavy machinery to operate the valve remained continuously open to allow free drainage during the wet spring months to prevent damage to the root zone of the establishing crop following crop emergence june 8 2021 the sds was operated in automatic mode but with a much deeper set point 76 2 cm inches below the ground surface in order to not damage the root zone with elevated groundwater levels during summer storm events water level in the control structure would periodically exceed the set point which triggered the valve to open until water level fell below the set point prior to fall harvest september 27 2021 the outlet valve was manually programmed to remain open to promote faster drainage and allow for heavy machinery to harvest the crop while the sds covered a 6 ha field the topographic contributing area captured by the sds was larger 10 ha surface runoff originating in the untiled portion of the topographic contributing area was periodically observed during large storm events this water flowed downgradient and infiltrated the soil above the tile drainage network high resolution lidar data 0 58 m resolution was downloaded from the ohio geographically referenced information program ogrip https ogrip oit ohio gov accessed august 2021 for the study area to delineate the topographic contributing area of the field site based on surface topography dwm is most effective in relatively flat areas with slopes not exceeding 1 which is why the sds at our field site was limited to 6 ha the drainpipe diameter was 10 cm 4 in except for the main and northernmost laterals which were 15 cm 6 in the final 33 m of the main was 20 cm 8 in in diameter to promote additional drainage six monitoring locations were established at the field site fig 1 three sites were installed along the northern edge of the field western edge we middle edge me eastern edge ee and three sites were located in the middle of the field western field wf middle field mf eastern field ef at each site groundwater wells were installed at 180 cm depths and groundwater level was monitored using hydros 21 sensors meter environment pullman wa usa groundwater levels are reported relative to the tile outlet elevation volumetric water content was monitored using teros 12 sensors meter environment pullman wa usa at two depths 30 60 cm average volumetric water content was calculated for each site from the two installed soil moisture sensors in addition an atmos 41 weather station meter environment pullman wa usa was installed at site ee and measured precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure relative humidity wind speed and direction and barometric air pressure all sensors continuously recorded data at 15 minute intervals 2 2 precipitation event identification and characterization precipitation patterns at the field site are strongly influenced by its location in the interior of the north american continent during the winter the polar jet stream is located near the study area resulting in cloudy skies and regular low intensity storms williams and king 2020 during the summer weather is more impacted by warm humid subtropical air masses originating from the atlantic resulting in short duration convective thunderstorms an algorithm was developed from the continuous precipitation data to select distinct events equally captured by the two contrasting climate patterns distinct precipitation events were separated from each other if at least four consecutive hours occurred without precipitation only events with at least 10 mm of cumulative precipitation were considered in addition we only selected events in which other 10 mm events did not occur in the three preceding days to evaluate the effects of adwm on groundwater and soil moisture response in the three days following precipitation events this resulted in 16 total precipitation events for each of the 16 precipitation events the duration event precipitation amount average intensity event precipitation amount duration three day total amount and the antecedent three day amounts were calculated precipitation events were nominally classified as free or managed based on the tile outlet valve status free events occurred when the tile outlet valve was in manual mode and opened to allow free drainage for the full three day duration managed events occurred when the tile outlet valve was in automatic mode and closed at the beginning of the event and remained closed for at least half of the three day duration during managed events the tile outlet valve would periodically open to release water until the water level recorded in the outlet control structure fell below a defined value and then was closed again average precipitation tile outlet discharge groundwater and soil moisture dynamics were compared between free and managed events using the wilcoxon rank sum test 2 3 tile outlet discharge water level was monitored continuously in the tile outlet control structure using a pressure transducer manual tile outlet discharge measurements were taken biweekly covering both conditions when the outlet valve was opened and closed due to minor leaks in the control structure stoplogs small amounts of tile outlet discharge occurred even when the valve was closed rating curves were developed between the manual field discharge measurements and the continuously recorded water level during both opened and closed conditions figure a 1 the volumetric flow rate of the tile outlet discharge was converted to depth averaged discharge by dividing the volume of discharge by the topographic contributing area 10 ha for each precipitation event the three day tile discharge mm tile discharge ratio tile discharge divided by three day total precipitation maximum discharge time between the beginning of the event and timing of peak discharge and percentage of time the tile outlet valve was opened were recorded during managed precipitation events when the tile outlet began closed but opened to release water the discharged tile outlet water when the valve opened was included in the summation of tile outlet discharge occasionally the tile outlet was submerged due to high river stage conditions river stage was monitored immediately upstream with a pressure transducer hobo u20 onset corporation bourne ma usa and found to exceed the elevation of water recorded in the control structure thus tile outlet discharge was set to zero when the river stage exceeded the height of the tile outlet drain this assumption did not impact the difference between managed and free drainage events as these conditions occurred equally for both managed and free drainage events 2 4 soil moisture response for each precipitation event the average antecedent and maximum volumetric water contents were determined at each monitoring site from volumetric soil moisture sensors installed at two depths 30 60 cm in addition the time between the onset of the event and maximum average volumetric water content hr was calculated 2 5 groundwater response groundwater response was monitored for each precipitation event the antecedent and maximum groundwater levels cm and time elapsed until maximum level was achieved hr were determined for each monitoring site the change in groundwater level was calculated by subtracting the antecedent level from the maximum level and dividing by the precipitation event depth to determine the change in groundwater level relative to the precipitation amount the depth of groundwater was calculated for each well to determine the percentage of time during precipitation events that each site experienced flooding i e groundwater depth 0 in addition mean groundwater recession rates mm hr were calculated during the 12 h following peak groundwater level groundwater hydraulic gradients were calculated between pairs of monitoring wells during each event to evaluate the effects of adwm on groundwater movement the mean hydraulic gradients were calculated for each precipitation event over the three day duration 3 results 3 1 precipitation characteristics during the study period 713 mm of precipitation was recorded precipitation accumulation was fairly uniform throughout the study apart from two large rain events in may 47 8 mm and july 59 7 mm fig 3 collectively these two storm events produced 15 of all total precipitation recorded during the study overall the valve was closed 62 of the time during which 391 mm of precipitation occurred the tile outlet was open the remaining 38 of the time in which 322 mm of precipitation occurred to put the study period in context annual precipitation for 2021 represented the 42nd percentile when considering 40 years of daily observation 1982 through 2021 made at the nearby wooster weather station within college of food agriculture and environmental science weather system weather cfaes osu edu maintained by ohio state university as such the study year considered here can be considered representative with regards to precipitation amounts and events relative to a long term perspective sixteen precipitation events with at least 10 mm and separated by at least three days were identified table 1 fig 3 during these 16 events 374 mm of precipitation occurred or 52 of the total precipitation recorded during the study period on average 23 4 mm of precipitation occurred over a 13 3 hour time span for each event average event characteristics were compared for free and managed events but not found to be significantly different according to the wilcoxon rank sum test table 1 despite precipitation events occurring during different times of the year caused by different mechanisms the event characteristics were similar albeit with large standard deviations for both free and managed events managed events occurred under more variable meteorological conditions and included both low intensity winter storms and summer convective thunderstorms while free drainage events generally occurred during the spring 3 2 tile outlet discharge the tile outlet was closed for most of the time during winter december february and summer months june september fig 4 during these extended periods the tile outlet valve would periodically open to minimize surface runoff or damaging the crop root zone over the entire study period 287 mm of tile outlet discharge was recorded or 40 3 of the observed precipitation this percentage is slightly greater but within the ranges of values reported in previous studies logan et al 1980 christianson and harmel 2015 williams et al 2015 overall the vast majority of tile outlet discharge 270 mm 94 occurred when the valve was open while the remaining 17 mm 6 occurred when the valve was closed due to minor leaks in the control structure stoplogs the precipitation events in late december and mid july occurred during managed events when the tile outlet valve began closed but was triggered to open for short periods to release water until the water level recorded in the control structure dropped below the set point this resulted in repetitive cycling of the tile outlet valve opening and closing for several days fig 5 water level in the control structure would exceed the set point causing the valve to open and subsequently lowering the level in the control structure a short wait timer resulted in the valve cycling between opened and closed over a four day period average tile outlet discharge characteristics for each precipitation event are summarized in table 2 during free drainage events the total tile outlet discharge and discharge to precipitation ratio was slightly greater compared to managed events but not significantly different there was no difference in maximum discharge for free or managed events but the maximum discharge occurred significantly later for managed events during free drainage events all tile outlet discharge occurred when the outlet valve was opened during managed events the outlet valve was opened for on average 18 6 of the three day event duration in which 96 of tile outlet discharge occurred for managed events there were strong significant correlations between the percent of the event that the tile outlet valve was opened with event discharge and event discharge to precipitation ratio pearson s r 0 86 and 0 76 respectively 3 3 soil moisture dynamics average volumetric water content at the six monitoring sites during the study period is shown in fig 6 soil moisture remained relatively high for the first six months of the study regardless of whether the tile outlet valve was opened or closed volumetric water content at all monitoring locations did not begin substantially declining until late may 2021 the largest increases in soil moisture generally occurred during the 16 analyzed precipitation events mean soil moisture dynamics following the 16 precipitation events are summarized in table 3 the only significant difference between free drainage and managed events was the time between the start of the event and maximum soil volumetric water content which was longer for free events this was significantly different for three of the six monitoring locations and the overall mean while mean soil moisture dynamics were similar for many variables across the monitoring locations the standard deviation during managed events was typically larger compared to free events the managed events occurred during the winter and summer thus reflecting different wetness conditions and storm mechanisms while the free events generally occurred during the same season spring march may 3 4 groundwater response groundwater levels and depths at the six monitoring locations relative to the tile outlet elevation during the study period is shown in fig 6 and figure a 2 similar to average volumetric water content groundwater levels generally were at the greatest levels during the first six months of the study regardless of tile outlet valve status and responded quickly to precipitation events groundwater level at all monitoring locations declined over the last five months of the study period the monitoring well at site we was dry for the final month of the study groundwater level recorded at site ee the closest monitoring site to the tile outlet valve showed the most similar patterns to the water level recorded in the control structure during precipitation events when the slide gate valve was closed fig 5 however when the valve was open groundwater level recorded at this site was typically much greater than the water level recorded in the control structure emphasizing that the water level in the control structure is not synonymous with the field groundwater level groundwater responses to the 16 precipitation events are summarized in table 4 like the average volumetric water content patterns there were few significant differences between free and managed events while the standard deviation tended to be greater for managed events the mean groundwater recession rate during the first 12 hrs following peak groundwater level was significantly greater for site mf during free events compared to managed events the average hydraulic gradients measured between monitoring sites located within the smart drainage system me ee mf ef was significantly greater during free events compared to managed events table 5 however there was no difference in hydraulic gradients during free and managed events recorded outside of the sds wf mf we me positive gradients in table 5 indicate flow direction from the first mentioned location to the second for example the positive groundwater hydraulic gradient recorded for me ee indicates flow direction was from me to ee in contrast the negative gradients measured for we me indicate flow direction was from me to we the mean hydraulic gradients measured between ef ee mf me and wf we north south direction were not found to be significantly different for free and managed events 4 discussion 4 1 effect of drainage water management on water redistribution given the strong correlation between tile outlet discharge and the percentage of event that the tile outlet was opened for the managed events it is not surprising that the managed events that had an opened tile outlet valve the largest amount of the time behaved more like free drainage events fig 7 figure a 3 the second and third largest tile runoff occurred during management events when the outlet valve was opened for about 40 of the duration of the event moderate amount of tile runoff occurred during other managed events in which the valve was opened 20 30 of the time which was similar to the tile runoff measured during free drainage events at the event scale closing the tile outlet valve resulted in small reductions in tile outlet discharge discharge to precipitation ratio and increased the time to peak tile discharge while having minimum impact on soil moisture dynamics groundwater response and surface flooding at individual monitoring locations we suspect the small sample size of precipitation events contributed to the lack of significant difference between tile outlet discharge and discharge to precipitation ratio for our study drainage water management using adwm was most effective at reducing tile outlet discharge during dry conditions during low to moderate rain events or when the set point of the outlet control structure is relatively shallow for example of the 16 events analyzed the second and third largest tile outlet runoff volumes occurred during managed events in july when the set point was relatively deep below the soil surface this resulted in the tile outlet valve being open for about 40 of each event in which most of the tile outlet discharge occurred fig 7 the first event had over twice the amount of precipitation 59 7 mm compared to the mean of all 16 events while the second event occurred six days following the first event emphasizing the role of extreme precipitation events and antecedent wetness conditions on creating tile outlet discharge if these two large events in july were removed the tile outlet discharge for free and managed events were significantly different the remaining managed events occurred during the winter due to smaller less intense precipitation events and when the set point to a shallower depth resulting in the tile outlet valve remaining closed for a longer time and less discharge compared to free drainage events with similar high maximum groundwater and average soil volumetric water content levels the reduction in tile outlet discharge likely increased other hydrological fluxes at the study site but it remains unclear which fluxes were affected the most for this field simulations using drainmod have suggested increased lateral seepage for fields under dwm suggesting that up to 96 of the tile outlet discharge reductions from dwm can be due to increased lateral seepage youssef et al 2021 however youssef et al 2021 attributed that finding primarily to a sandy layer with high hydraulic conductivity and shallow management depth in the tile outlet control structure 36 cm below surface shedekar et al 2021 predicted that seepage losses were only 4 mm greater for dwm using drainmod simulations hydraulic gradients measured leaving our field site showed no significant differences between dwm and traditional drainage however these gradients may have been influenced by the tile drainage network although groundwater levels measured at the monitoring sites suggested that water level was above tile drain elevation for most of the wet periods decreases in hydraulic gradients under adwm combined with elevated groundwater levels following storm events would allow for shallow subsurface flow pathways to be activated resulting in more lateral subsurface loss than what would be expected under free drainage conditions surface runoff was not measured in this study for practical purposes but inferred from groundwater monitoring levels e g bou lahdou et al 2019 during the two largest precipitation events the adjacent stream completely flooded large portions of the field site which is likely common in other agricultural fields located immediately adjacent to streams and rivers while dwm has been shown to increase surface runoff e g tan and zhang 2011 the maximum groundwater level and percentage of time during precipitation events that groundwater level exceeded the ground surface was not significantly different during managed versus free drainage events remaining hydrological fluxes that likely compensated the reduction in tile outlet discharge are evapotranspiration skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 and vertical seepage ale et al 2009 while these two fluxes were not directly measured the ability of dwm to delay the peak release of tile outlet discharge possibly increased evapotranspiration and vertical seepage obviously individual precipitation event characteristics and the antecedent wetness conditions had a strong effect on the hydrologic response to each rain event further it is possible that the small number of events analyzed in this study are insufficient to draw broad general conclusions from or to support extrapolation beyond our empirical findings 4 2 on the implications for nutrient transport previous research has suggested that reductions in nitrate load achieved from dwm are primarily due to reduction in tile outlet discharge during the non growing season skaggs et al 2012 some studies suggest dwm also results in decreased nitrate concentrations through denitrification ng et al 2002 adeuya et al 2012 while others have not observed a difference in nitrate concentrations williams et al 2015 shedekar et al 2021 clearly nitrate dynamics are complicated by interrelated factors including soil chemistry crop type fertilizer application and weather patterns thus the impact of dwm on tile outlet discharge nitrate concentrations is not expected to be uniform nitrate concentrations are generally assumed to be lower in surface runoff water compared to tile outlet discharge or groundwater gilliam and skaggs 1986 at our site adwm appeared most effective at retaining water during the winter months with low to moderate precipitation events and the summer period with dry antecedent conditions fig 4 which would support reduced nitrogen loads through the retention of water in field further by significantly increasing time to peak tile discharge admw may lead to reductions in soluble phosphorus as the nutrients have more time to be consumed in the soil before being exported via tile drainage or as they move laterally through the subsurface at the edge of field specifically peak soluble phosphorus concentrations have been observed in tile discharge during the same time as peak surface runoff demonstrating a strong surface connection to drainage networks smith et al 2015 this would be consistent with miller and lyon 2021b who saw strong connections between instream soluble phosphorous concentrations and the wetness of the landscape where tile drainage is being utilized thus slowing down flows associated with tile drainage and allowing those waters to reconnect to streams through slower flow pathways associated with subsurface seepage at the edge of field which can be achieved through adwm seems promising as an agricultural bmp targeting nutrient load reductions clearly however more work is needed to understand the collective impacts of adwm on the coupled timing of flows and composition of water leaving farm fields in order to assess its full efficacy as a bmp relatively high groundwater tables associated with dwm are often assumed to increase surface runoff and phosphorus loads during precipitation events thus adwm may present an advantage over regular dwm by being able to open the slide gate valve prior to large precipitation events in order to reduce surface runoff 5 conclusion we compared the impact of adwm on tile outlet discharge soil moisture dynamics and groundwater response following 16 precipitation events over one year soil moisture and groundwater monitored at six locations responded quickly to rain events regardless of whether the tile outlet valve was opened or closed maximum groundwater soil moisture and percentage of surface flooding indicated by groundwater levels were not significantly different following precipitation events during adwm or traditional free drainage while overall tile drainage volumes were much greater when the outlet valve was opened at the event scale tile outlet discharge was not found to be significantly different for events that happened under managed or traditional free drainage although the small sample size and variability in precipitation characteristics likely led to the observed similarities this was because under managed events a large amount of water was discharged during the relatively short periods in which the tile outlet valve was triggered to open tile outlet discharge from precipitation events that occurred under adwm was significantly correlated with the percentage of the event in which the tile outlet valve was opened collectively adwm was most effective during low intensity precipitation events that occurred during winter months with small to moderate rainfall amounts and during late summer storm events that occurred during dry antecedent conditions despite little differences in tile outlet discharge volume between managed and free drainage events the time between the onset of the precipitation event and maximum tile outlet discharge was significantly greater for the managed events which likely reduced nutrient transport from tile outlet discharge the hydraulic gradients along the direction of the laterals were significantly greater during traditional free drainage compared to automated dwm which in turn may have facilitated greater lateral seepage and subsurface nutrient transport during elevated groundwater conditions following storm events under automated dwm funding source this work was
