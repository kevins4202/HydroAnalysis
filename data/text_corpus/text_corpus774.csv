3870,this study experimentally and numerically investigated the influence of the inertial effect of fluid flow on the non darcy coefficient β the results showed that the non darcy coefficient β apparent permeability ka and hydraulic aperture eh decreased with the increase of reynolds number re which indicated that the non darcy coefficient depended on the geometric properties of a single fracture and the fluid inertial effect the quantification model of the non darcy coefficient was improved under the guidance of fluid inertial effect the β performed a positive power law relationship with eh under the coupling effect of fluid inertial effect and fracture geometric properties the β behaved negative power law relationship with eh which was similar to the non darcy coefficient quantitative model that ignored the fluid inertial effect in the previous study therefore the geometric properties were the dominant ones for fracture flow when it was affected by the coupling effect of geometric properties and inertial effects then the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient was improved based on the improved non darcy coefficient quantitative model a new critical reynolds number prediction model crn model was constructed compared with other crn models the new crn model considering the coupling effect of fluid and media properties could more accurately predict the critical reynolds number rec in rough single fractures which further proved the existence and importance of the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient keywords non darcy coefficient

2015a 2015b quinn et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 the appearance of the non darcy effect that is the fluid movement from regular linear motion to nonlinear made it difficult to describe the fluid flow in fractures and solute transport therefore accurate identification and quantification of non darcy flow are of great scientific significance for groundwater science environmental engineering underground storage of radioactive waste and petroleum engineering ghane et al 2014 macini et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 generally the forchheimer equation is widely accepted as an important semi empirical formula to describe non darcy flow in fractured media and the determination of the non darcy coefficient β which is included in the forchheimer equation is one of the most important methods for characterizing the non darcy effect li and engler 2001 chukwudozie et al 2012 rong et al 2020 considering the invalidity of darcy s law and the cubic law cl eq 1 wen et al 2013 under some experimental conditions such as in a high reynolds number flow rate environment ghane et al 2014 and heterogeneous media liang et al 2019 forchheimer 1901 carried out the empirical nonlinear equation to remedy the

the development of the theoretical background of the forchheimer equation irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 researchers have made a lot of improvements on it ergun 1952 polacci et al 2014 zhou et al 2019a sun et al 2020 among various forms of improved forchheimer equation the most widely used form containing the non darcy coefficient β was firstly proposed by muskat 1938 and spread by green and duwez 1951 cornell and katz 1953 and macini et al 2008 they correlated the viscous and inertial coefficients a 1 and b 1 with properties of fluid and medium 3 dp dx ρ g j μ k v β ρ v 2 4 j μ ρ g k v β g v 2 combined eqs 2 and 4 eq 5 was obtained 5 a 1 μ ρ g k b 1 β g where β m 1 is the turbulence factor coefficient which was also called as non darcy flow coefficient or forchheimer coefficient later and k m2 is the permeability cornell and katz 1953 thought that the non darcy effect was caused by turbulence so the parameter β was initially defined as the turbulence factor which could characterize the magnitude of turbulence however researchers had widely accepted that the fluid nonlinearity was not induced by turbulence but the non ignorable inertial effects ruth and ma 1992 li and engler 2001 since then the parameter β was called the non darcy coefficient or inertial resistance coefficient noted that in the following content β was called as non darcy coefficient as a parameter that directly determines the magnitude of the coefficient of the inertial term in the forchheimer equation the non darcy coefficient β is one of the most important parameters for characterizing the non darcy flow based on the non darcy coefficient β the magnitude of fluid inertial effect in a single fracture can be quantified geertsma 1974 defined a new type of reynolds number that could also be used as an indicator of non darcy flow more accurately 6 f o j v j i b 1 v 2 a 1 v k β ρ v μ where fo is the forchheimer number based on the forchheimer number fo the magnitude of the non darcy effect

fluid ghane et al 2014 javadi et al 2014 wang et al 2020 zeng and grigg 2006 and the corresponding reynolds number is the critical reynolds number which is an important criterion for identifying non darcy flow yu et al 2017 javadi et al 2014 8 re ρ v e h μ where eh m is hydraulic aperture 9 e h 12 μ q w p 1 3 combining the eqs 6 8 the expression of reynolds number including the non darcy coefficient was obtained 10 re 12 β e h e 1 e when e 0 1 was taken into eq 10 the prediction model of critical reynolds number could be obtained 11 r e c 4 3 β e h as shown in table s5 in support information although researchers have improved the critical reynolds number prediction formula based on eq 11 the non darcy coefficient still plays an irreplaceable role in calculating the critical reynolds number of a single fracture javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 while the non darcy coefficient can also be used to characterize the friction factor of fluid flow in a single fracture which is an important dimensionless parameter for fracture flow that could relate the pressure drop to flow velocity and geometric properties of rough single fractures zhou et al 2016 qian et al 2011 to describe the friction factor of non darcy flow huang and ayoub 2008 combined the darcy weisbach equation eq 12 with the forchheimer equation a new semi empirical friction model considering the flow regime was obtained 12 dp dx f 1 d h ρ v 2 2 13 f 96 re 4 β e h where dh m is the hydraulic diameter and f is the friction factor moreover it was found that a small change in the non darcy coefficient could significantly affect the pressure gradient around the wellbore of a propped fracture ubani 1981 given the important role of the non darcy coefficient such as determination of the critical reynolds number and friction factor of a single fracture the development of a non darcy coefficient prediction model or quantitative model has an important significance for further exploration of fracture flow in previous studies researchers explored many quantitative models of the non darcy coefficient in different geological porous media li and engler 2001 reviewed the quantitative models of the non darcy coefficient in porous media as shown in tables s3 and s4 and the magnitude of the non darcy coefficient in porous media depended on geometric properties such as porosity particle diameter and permeability kollbotn and bratteli 2005 found a positive proportional relationship between the non darcy coefficient and formation resistivity kutasov 1993 found that for porous media water saturation also affects the non darcy coefficient and the β is proportional to water saturation ward 1964 and moutsopoulos et al 2009 considered that the non darcy coefficient only depended on the particle diameter of porous media cooke 1973 summarized the numerical relationship between the non darcy coefficient and permeability in porous media 14 β a k b where a m2b 1 is the scaling factor with dimension and b is a dimensionless power index for a single fracture with stronger heterogeneity the quantification of the non darcy coefficient is more complex narayanaswamy et al 1999 zhou et al 2015 studied the non darcy coefficient in natural rock fractures under variable confining pressure and proposed a quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient based on hydraulic aperture chen et al 2015a evaluated the forchheimer s coefficients in the deformable rough walled fractures and proposed two mathematical models for quantifying the non darcy coefficient the single parameter model showed the negative power law relationship between the coefficient of the inertial term of the forchheimer equation that is b 1 which contained β and the hydraulic aperture and the two parameters model introduced the parameters which could characterize the roughness of a single fracture based on the single parameter model ni et al 2018 established the quantitative relationship between non darcy coefficient β joint roughness coefficient jrc and average mechanical aperture em based on laboratory experiments and found that β was proportional to the roughness of a single fracture rong et al 2020 explored the influence of fracture geometric properties on the non darcy coefficient when the fluid inertial effect could be ignored and defined new parameters to quantify the geometric properties of a single fracture based on the above quantitative model it can be found that the hydraulic aperture is an important parameter to quantify the non darcy coefficient of rough single fracture and the researchers believed that the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture only depend on the geometric properties of a single fracture and is unrelated with the magnitude of fluid inertia effect flow regime zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 in the above studies although the non darcy effect of fluid flow appeared the magnitude of the fluid inertial effect is relatively small so the influences of the fluid inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture were ignored noted that forchheimer equation is originally used to describe the non darcy or nonlinear flow so the validity of the prediction model of non darcy coefficient obtained by previous researchers based on low inertial effect is limited as a parameter determining the inertial term of the forchheimer equation the non darcy coefficient should be closely related to the inertial effect of fluid theoretically although the effect of fluid inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient is rarely reported there are still some evidences to support the existence of the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient in the above content it was mentioned that the hydraulic aperture of a single fracture was the key parameter for quantifying non darcy coefficient β the hydraulic aperture was firstly defined as a geometric mean of the aperture field which could directly reflect the geometric properties of a single fracture tsang 1984 barton et al 1985 and renshaw 1995 studied the relationship between hydraulic aperture eh and average mechanical aperture em and proposed that eh was proportional to the square of em and inversely proportional to jrc lee et al 1996 proposed the linear relation between hydraulic aperture and roughness of the surface exposed rock recently zhang and chai 2020 zhang et al 2021 and sun et al 2020 reviewed the hydraulic aperture in the works of literature which further emphasized that the hydraulic aperture was only dependent on the geometric properties of single fractures however some studies have shown the influence of the inertial effect on hydraulic aperture li and jiang 2013 and zhao et al 2014 proposed prediction models for hydraulic aperture eh when re 1 eh was only dependent on the geometric properties when re 1 the reynolds number was introduced into the prediction model which indicated the influence of the fluid inertial effect on the hydraulic aperture liu et al 2016 investigated that the increasing fluid nonlinearity might induce the reduction of hydraulic aperture and permeability in single fractures quinn et al 2020 mentioned that the size of the hydraulic aperture was related to the flow regimes the magnitude of inertial effect rong et al 2020 believed that hydraulic aperture eh decreased as the flow rate increasing due to the nonlinear effect based on the close relationship between hydraulic aperture and non darcy coefficient the influence of inertial effect on the hydraulic aperture provided evidence for the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient β moreover the coupling effect of fluid inertial force and geometric properties of fractures has not been considered in the previous quantitative model of non darcy coefficient β therefore it is necessary to re evaluate the influencing factors of the non darcy coefficient and improve the quantitative model the objectives of this study are to 1 disclose the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient in rough single fractures 2 obtain a new prediction model of the non darcy coefficient which considering inertial effect and 3 verify the validity and applicability of the new non darcy coefficient prediction model 2 materials and methods in this study for fully investigating of the influence of the inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient β laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were carried out the specific experiment process construction of physical models and parameter settings would be described in the following contents 2 1 laboratory experiment 2 1 1 physical model construction the single rock fracture in nature has strong heterogeneity to simulate the real single fracture as much as possible a random 3d rough single fracture physical model was generated using synfrac software and parametric scanning was carried out according to the 3d coordinate data generated by the synfrac then the parameterized scanning results were transformed into 3d numerical models of the upper and lower surfaces of the single fracture finally based on the numerical model the physical model of 3d rough single fracture used in laboratory experiments was obtained by using 3d printing technology the printing material is photosensitive resin and the size of the model is 100 100 mm to consider the influence of geometric properties on the non darcy coefficient in the experiment three kinds of 3d random single fracture models with different apertures were constructed by using the gasket to pad up the upper fracture surface the geometric properties of 3d real single fracture were shown in table 1 please refer to appendix a fig a for the method of determination of geometric properties of 3d real single fractures and za m is the mean height of the elevation plane rrms is the root mean square roughness ra m is average roughness rp m is peak asperity height and rsd is the relative roughness the hydraulic experimental devices and the local structure of 3d rough single fracture are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively 2 1 2 laboratory flow test in the laboratory hydraulic experiment the key is to control the magnitude of the inertial effect of steady fluid flow the hydraulic gradient and fluid velocity were controlled by the relative height of the inlet tank and outlet tank the height of the water tank should be adjusted to the right position when the indication of the manometer remained stable the value of the manometer was recorded while stopwatch and cylinder were used to calculate the volume of steady flow through the fracture exit in a certain period of time then according to the volume density and flow time of the fluid the flow rate was calculated it should be noted that when the reynolds number was small the fluid flow might be linear darcy flow therefore in laboratory experiments the reynolds number of fluid was controlled in the range of 10 this is because a large number of studies have shown that the critical reynolds number range of fluid transition from linear darcy flow to nonlinear flow in rough single fracture was about 1 10 ranjith and viete 2011 quinn 2011 zimmerman and yeo 2000 it should be noted that in the subsequent numerical simulation the numerical simulation under a small reynolds number re 1 was carried out to capture the critical reynolds number the forchheimer coefficients and its non darcy coefficient under different inertial effects can be obtained by fitting the forchheimer equation with different hydraulic gradient ranges and corresponding flow velocity flow rate the detailed fitting method was shown in fig s1 the whole hydraulic gradient was divided into many secondary fitting units then the v j data in each fitting unit was fitted by the forchheimer equation and the reynolds number was calculated by taking the flow velocity corresponding to the maximum hydraulic gradient of each fitting unit in this way the non darcy coefficients β at different reynolds numbers can be obtained moreover according to the j q data in each fitting unit the hydraulic aperture under different inertial effects can be inversely derived from the cubic law eq 9 2 2 numerical simulation laboratory experiments could provide strong evidence for the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient but the improvement of the non darcy coefficient prediction model needs more basic data considering that the amount of experimental data was limited and the control of experimental conditions was difficult the numerical simulation was carried out numerical simulations could accurately quantify and characterize the influence of different factors on the non darcy coefficient β and provide mutual verification with laboratory experiments previous studies have shown that it was reasonable to improve the quantitative model of parameters based on numerical simulation data wang et al 2015 and 2020 in this study the computational fluid dynamics cfd module based on finite element method fem in comsol multiphysics was used for numerical simulation of fracture flow zhou et al 2019a 2019b the physical model governing equations and boundary conditions in the numerical simulation would be introduced in the following contents 2 2 1 physical model of numerical simulation the physical models of numerical simulations are the simplification of two dimensional cross sections of different positions of 3d random single fracture as shown in fig 2 the initial numerical model of 3d single fracture is constructed by importing the parametric scanning results in section 2 1 1 into comsol then the x y work plane is used to intercept the 3d model at certain intervals and six initial 2d single fracture models fr a1 fr b1 fr c1 fr d1 fr e1 and fr f1 are obtained and the fracture structures are shown in fig 3 for more basic hydraulic data and consideration of the influence of geometric attributes on the non darcy coefficient six initial single fractures are expanded to obtain more single fractures with different geometric attributes the specific method is shown in fig 4 the lower surface of the 2d fracture is controlled to remain unchanged and the upper surface is raised by 0 2 mm 0 4 mm 0 6 mm and 0 8 mm respectively based on this method 2d rough single fractures of six series each series contains 5 fractures a total of 30 single fractures are obtained and the geometric properties of single fractures are shown in table 2 in this study the physical model of numerical simulation adopted with a two dimensional model the reason why 2d numerical simulations were used instead of 3d numerical simulations would be explained in detail below firstly although the three dimensional physical model is closer to the natural single fracture in the dimension the modeling process is more difficult and the solutions of the 3d navier stokes n s equation require a lot of computer resources however it is very complicated to directly solve the 3d n s equations with the finite element method and the solutions of 3d n s equations in cfd software are based on various simplified conditions comsol ab 2013 secondly compared with the 3d model the 2d model is easier to model than the 3d model and many studies have shown that using 2d n s equations to study fluid flow or solute transport in a single fracture is reliable cardenas et al 2009 chaudhary et al 2011 the 2d physical model can be used as an ideal test case for the 3d model lee et al 2015 lastly previous studies have shown that the geometric properties of a single fracture would significantly affect the non darcy coefficient β zhou et al 2015 however whether in previous studies barton and choubey 1977 or recent studies zhang and chai 2020 researchers quantified the geometric attributes of a single fracture based on the 2d structure of rough single fractures for example chen et al 2015a only used one 2d jrc profile to describe the roughness of a single fracture after 3d scanning sun et al 2020 obtained several 2d jrc curves from a 3d fracture surface by two dimensional interception and used the average jrc to characterize the roughness of a 3d fracture surface although in section 2 1 1 similar geometric properties such as rrms and rp were calculated by the distribution of measured aperture field of 3d single fracture these values were in an average sense for the single fracture with high heterogeneity the average values of geometric properties are not representatives such as 2d slices of the 3d model fig 3 and the aperture distribution and geometric properties of 2d fractures corresponding to different positions are different therefore the 2d single fracture model could better reflect the influence of geometric properties on fracture flow in conclusion 2d single fracture models were selected for numerical simulation 2 2 2 governing equations using n s equation to describe fluid flow has been widely recognized and used in the numerical simulations of fracture flow zou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 therefore in this study the steady state laminar flow model was selected noted that the laminar flow model was selected in this study the non darcy flow in this study generally refers to nonlinear laminar flow which could be well described by the forchheimer equation and was different from turbulent flow and the n s equation and the conservation equation of mass were combined as the governing equation of incompressible newtonian fluid flow in a single fracture 15 ρ u u μ 2 u p 16 u 0 where u ux uy is the velocity vector p pa is the total pressure 2 3 boundary conditions in the numerical simulation the reasonable parameter setting is the key to solve the n s equation it should be noted that cardenas et al 2009 mentioned that for a single fracture with high heterogeneity the selection of flow entrance would affect fracture flow in numerical simulation therefore the left opening of the 2d single fracture is defined as the entrance of the fluid flow and the corresponding right opening is the exit by controlling the average pressure difference between the outlet and the inlet a different magnitude of inertial effects can be achieved the boundary except the entrance and exit of the 2d single fracture was set as the non sliding wall when using the finite element method to solve the n s equation the meshing of the physical field flow field is a key step to solve the n s equation which also directly determines the accuracy and solution time of numerical simulation results in comsol meshing can be done by selecting the existing mesh options and the more detailed the grid the more accurate the numerical simulation results are but the more detailed grids would greatly increase the calculation time to get an exact solution while saving the time of numerical solution the mesh independence was analyzed a 2d fracture model fr a1 was selected as the verification object and the numerical results of conventional refined relatively refined ultra refined and extremely refined mesh generation were analyzed and visualized fig b in appendix b please refer to table s2 for the number of mesh grids of different mesh options the results showed that there was a numerical difference in the conventional refined and relatively refined hydraulic data but the data between ultra refined and extremely refined grids almost had no difference and the ultra refined grids greatly saved much calculation time than the extremely refined grids therefore balancing the accuracy and computing cost we choose the ultra fine grids to divide the physical field please refer to table s8 for a detailed set of other parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 the inertial dependence of non darcy coefficient β hydraulic experimental data of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were visualized in fig 5 a and 6 a it could be seen that the linear darcy s law couldn t accurately describe the relationship between flow velocity and hydraulic gradient which indicated that the flow regime in all single fractures was non darcy flow noted that in fig 6 only the hydraulic data of series a were drawn as the representative of the hydraulic data of numerical simulations the non darcy effect was firstly recognized by the abnormal change of intrinsic permeability which was inversely calculated by darcy s law later researchers used the apparent permeability ka to characterize the change of permeability takeuchi et al 2008 it was found that when the inertial effect of fluid was small that is the fluid flow was darcy flow the apparent permeability was equal to the intrinsic permeability in this case combined with darcy s law and cubic law cl the researchers obtained the expression of the apparent permeability of a single fracture 17 k a e h 2 12 as mentioned in section 1 many previous studies defaulted that as a geometric mean of the aperture field the hydraulic aperture was only dependent on the geometric properties of single fractures zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 up to now many researchers still insisted that eq 17 was effective therefore the permeability of a single fracture also only depended on the geometric properties of the fracture and had nothing to do with the flow regimes eq 17 was widely accepted as the expression of fracture permeability to quantify the coefficient of viscosity term in the forchheimer equation zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2015a sun et al 2020 rong et al 2020 javadi et al 2014 as shown in table s3 the empirical expression of β was generally related to the permeability and porosity of the geological medium li and engler 2001 according to the study of cooke 1973 in porous media zhou et al 2015 summarized the relationship between β and permeability k in fractures as eq 14 combined with eq 17 the negative power law relationship between β and eh was found 18 β a e h 2 12 b 12 b a e h 2 b due to the geometric attribute dependence of hydraulic aperture researchers believed that the non darcy coefficient β also only depended on geometric properties of the geological medium and was independent of the fluid properties cooper et al 1999 chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 as shown in fig s2 a large number of laboratory experiments and numerical simulation results also proved the negative power law relationship between β and eh zhang et al 2013 2015 rong et al 2020 however it should be noted that the influence of flow regime or inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture was not emphasized in these studies for example zhou et al 2015 and chen et al 2015a emphasized that their researches were carried out under the condition of confining pressure and low reynolds number in the study of the non darcy coefficient rong et al 2020 controlled the water flow in the linear flow regime in which the inertial forces were negligible compared with viscous forces therefore the influence of the inertial effect on the β and the validity of eq 17 need to be further studied recently researchers found that once the non darcy effect occurred the apparent permeability of single fractures began to decrease macini et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the reduction of apparent permeability was related to the appearance and development of recirculation zones near the rough surfaces of fractures wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the phenomenon that permeability decreasing with reynolds number was also verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and the recirculation zones were also captured in different fractures see fig s3 as shown in fig 5 b and 6 b with the increase of inertial effect the permeability of rough single fractures decreased which indicated that the permeability related not only to the geometry of the fracture but also to the fluid inertia effect in terms of current research on fracture permeability the reasons for the decrease of fracture permeability are as follows 1 the permeability model eq 16 k eh 2 12 is still valid and the hydraulic aperture decreases with the increase of re which leads to the reduction of permeability 2 the hydraulic aperture remains stable with the increasing inertial effect here the hydraulic aperture was considered only depends on the geometric properties of a single fracture but the permeability model changes and 3 both the hydraulic aperture and prediction model eq 17 have changed based on the experimental data the above reasons for the decrease of permeability were further analyzed firstly the inertial effect sensitivity of the hydraulic aperture was analyzed based on the method in section 2 1 2 the hydraulic aperture at different reynolds numbers was obtained as shown in fig 7 b and 8 b both laboratory experiments and numerical simulation results showed that the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of reynolds number this phenomenon showed that the hydraulic aperture is not only determined by the geometric properties of a single fracture but also highly related to the inertial effect of fluid flow quinn et al 2020 rong et al 2020 li and jiang 2013 zhao et al 2014 secondly the validity of eq 17 was verified in fig 9 the experimental data of other researchers rong et al 2016 2020 zhang et al 2013 2015 and the data in this study were compared the results showed that the classical parametric expression of apparent permeability ka at lower reynolds number ka e h 2 12 could not characterize the permeability of single fractures and the power exponent between permeability and hydraulic aperture was 2 therefore the third reason for the reduction of fracture permeability was reasonable that is the reduction of hydraulic aperture and the variation of permeability quantitative model induced by the higher inertial effect led to the decrease of fracture permeability to further reveal the inertial dependence of fracture permeability theoretically the parametric expression of fracture permeability under the non darcy flow was deduced by the improved forchheimer equation eq 2 and cubic law eq 1 19 μ k a e h w q β ρ w 2 e h 2 q 2 12 μ q w e h 3 20 μ k a 12 μ e h 2 β ρ q w e h 21 k a e h 2 12 β ρ v e h 2 μ 22 k a e h 2 12 β e h r e based on eq 22 it was assumed that the hydraulic aperture and the non darcy coefficient only depended on the geometric properties of a single fracture that is with the increase of re eh and β in eq 22 were constant according to this assumption the apparent permeability ka of a single fracture would increase with reynolds number which was contrary to the previous studies wang et al 2020 and the experimental and numerical simulation results in this study with the increase of inertial effect re the decrease of hydraulic aperture would only lead to the decrease of ka and the reduction of ka was already detected due to the close relationship between the non darcy flow coefficient and hydraulic aperture rong et al 2020 chen et al 2015a the reduction of hydraulic aperture could also affect the non darcy coefficient the varying trend of the non darcy coefficient under different inertial effects was shown in fig 7 a and 8 a with the increase of fluid inertial effect the non darcy coefficient decreased with the increase of re theoretical experimental and numerical simulation results showed that the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient existed traditionally the magnitude of the non darcy effect of fluid flow was characterized by the non darcy coefficient and the larger β was the stronger the non darcy effect was li and engler 2001 but it was detected that for a single fracture with fixed geometric properties the experimental and numerical results showed that β decreased with the increase of inertial effect it showed that when the inertial effect of fluid increased gradually and the geometric attribute of a single fracture was fixed the non darcy effect of fluid flow cannot be judged only by the magnitude of the non darcy coefficient of single fractures according to the definition of the non darcy effect factor the new parameter to quantify the non darcy effect zeng and grigg 2006 it could be seen that the magnitude of the non darcy effect was determined by the coefficient of viscosity term and the coefficient of the inertial term β in forchheimer equation moreover the relationship between the two forchheimer phenomenological coefficients has been revealed by researchers zhou et al 2019a the change of non darcy coefficient would lead to the change of viscosity term coefficient a 1 in eq 2 so the increase of non darcy coefficient or inertial term coefficient b 1 did not necessarily lead to the increase of non darcy effect factor and vice versa and it is unreasonable to characterize the non darcy effect of a single fracture only according to the non darcy coefficient the above content is a revision to the concept of the non darcy coefficient 3 2 quantification of non darcy coefficient β accurate quantification of the non darcy coefficient is of great significance for the study of non darcy flow in geological porous media previous studies have shown that the non darcy coefficient was only determined by the geometry of a single fracture and independent of the flow regimes however based on theoretical derivation laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was revealed for the first time both laboratory experiments and numerical simulation showed that under the influence of inertial effect there is a positive correlation between the non darcy coefficient and the hydraulic aperture which is just opposite to the previous studies therefore the inertial effect is an important factor that needs to be considered for the following accurate quantification of the non darcy coefficient 3 2 1 quantification of non darcy coefficient β under the inertial effect previous studies have shown that the quantitative results of non darcy coefficient β or inertial term coefficient of forchheimer equation of single fractures showed that there was an obvious power law relationship between hydraulic aperture and β chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 therefore the following power law equation was used to fit the relationship between non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture 23 β λ 1 e h m 1 where λ 1 m m 1 1 is the scaling factor and m 1 is the dimensionless power index noted that to explore the influence of inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient other influencing factors need to be strictly controlled therefore all the source data fitting the power law relationship in this section were from the non darcy coefficients β and their corresponding hydraulic aperture eh of the same single fracture at different reynolds numbers the fitting results were shown in fig 10 both the experimental and numerical simulation data showed that β and eh was in good agreement with the positive power law relation the fitting results of other series of numerical simulations are shown in table 3 under the dominant influence of inertial effect the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture of single fractures with different geometric properties strictly followed a positive power law relationship but the β of different fractures showed obvious differences which also reflected that the geometric properties and inertial effect behaved a coupling effect on the non darcy coefficient it should be noted that the varying geometric properties of single fractures in this section were only caused by the number of single fractures which indicated that the inertial effect was the dominant factor as shown in fig 11 the non darcy flow coefficient was inversely proportional to the reynolds number under the dominant effect of inertial effect and there seemed to be a positive proportional relationship between β and relative roughness rsd in the above study we found that the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of reynolds number because of the positive proportional relationship between the hydraulic aperture and the non darcy coefficient the reason why the non darcy coefficient was inversely proportional to the fluid inertial effect was well explained however due to the difference of the characteristic length d of different single fractures using the reynolds number to characterize the variation of the hydraulic aperture with the inertial effect resulted in a great digital dispersion as shown in fig 7 b and 8 b to quantify the influence of inertial effect on hydraulic aperture uniformly the macroscopic non darcy effect factor e was introduced to characterize the inertial effect of fluid flow and the average mechanical aperture em was used to normalize the change of hydraulic aperture in different fractures the results are shown in fig 12 the numerical simulation results of all 2d rough single fractures proved that the reduction of the hydraulic aperture was in direct proportion to the non darcy effect factor e under the guidance of the inertial effect the inertial effect affected β by controlling the change of hydraulic aperture referring to the previous researches chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 it was speculated that under the guidance of inertial effect geometric attributes might affect β by controlling the scaling coefficient and power index of the power law relationship as shown in fig 13 both the scaling coefficient λ and the power exponent m were directly proportional to the root mean square roughness rsd of a single fracture and the rsd was inversely proportional to the average mechanical aperture za em of a single fracture the specific numerical relationship was as follows 24 e m e h e m 0 725 e 0 009 25 l o g λ 6 52 r s d 26 z a 1 925 r s d 1 898 27 m 1 18 23 r s d combined with the normalized change of hydraulic aperture caused by inertial effect and the influence of geometric attributes on the proportion coefficient and power index in the power law relationship between non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture the dimensionless analysis of β under the dominant influence of inertial effect was carried out to obtain the quantitative model of β 28 β 10 6 52 r s d r p 18 23 r s d 1 e m 0 991 0 725 e 18 23 r s d it can be seen that under the dominant influence of inertial effect the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh eh was replaced by em 0 991 0 725e which was calculated by eq 24 followed a positive power law relationship and the scaling coefficient λ 1 and power exponent m 1 were determined by the geometric properties of a single fracture this further showed that the fracture would be affected by the coupling effect of the inertial effect of fluid flow and geometric properties 3 2 2 quantification of non darcy coefficient β under coupling effect the influence of geometric properties of a single fracture on the non darcy flow coefficient has always been a hot topic for researchers they believed that the geometric properties directly determined the non darcy flow coefficient under the condition that the inertial effect can be ignored chen et al 2015a zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and the non darcy coefficient was inversely proportional to the hydraulic aperture however with the increase of fluid inertia effect its influence on the non darcy coefficient couldn t be ignored the existence of the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was revealed in section 3 1 and the positive power law relationship between β and eh under the dominant effect of inertia effect was found in section 3 2 1 under the natural and human factors the coupling effect of the geometric properties and fluid inertial effect on fracture flow was common quinn et al 2020 and the previous non darcy coefficient model did not consider the influence of the inertial effect therefore in the following content the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect of inertial effect and geometric attributes was studied in this section the inertial effect of fluid and the geometric properties of single fractures were independent variables by precisely controlling the pressure gradient at the inlet and outlet the inertial effect of fluid flow in five single fractures of a series was consistent it should be noted that due to the different characteristic lengths the non darcy effect factor e was used to characterize the magnitude of inertial effect so when the e was consistent the fluid velocity or reynolds number in different single fractures were different based on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture of five single fractures in different series under different inertial effects the numerical relationship between the hydraulic aperture and the corresponding non darcy coefficient under the coupling influence of geometric attributes and inertial effects were obtained the fitting results were shown in table 4 under the coupling effect β and eh followed a negative power law relationship 29 β λ 2 e h m 2 where λ 2 m m 2 1 is the scaling factor and m 2 is the dimensionless power index this negative power law relationship is similar to the numerical relationship between β and eh found by other researchers only under the influence of geometric properties this phenomenon showed that under the coupling influence of fluid inertial effect and geometric attributes the influence of geometric attribute on non darcy coefficient was the dominant one which might be the reason why previous researchers ignored the influence of fluid inertial effect on non darcy coefficient rong et al 2020 although the influence of geometric attributes on β was more significant than that of inertial effect and it directly controlled the form of power law relationship between β and eh positive and negative power exponent as shown in fig 14 the influence of inertial effect on the quantitative model of β couldn t be ignored see fig 15 according to tables s6 and s7 the dimensionless analysis of the negative power law relationship between β and eh was carried out and then the parametric expression of the non darcy flow coefficient considering both fluid inertial effect and geometric properties of single fractures was obtained 30 β 20 56 r rms 2 r a m 2 1 e 1 4 e h m 2 31 m 2 r rms 8 686 e 10 32 β 20 56 r

model needs to be verified therefore this section was conducted to demonstrate the potential application of the quantitative model and verify its validity as mentioned above the flow regime would directly determine the choice of prediction model or governing equation of fluid flow in engineering or simulation so it is important to determine the flow regimes in fractured media however different from pipe flow the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow in a single fracture is a gradual process yu et al 2017 so the determination of critical reynolds number in a rough single fracture is of great significance researchers have different definitions of the critical reynolds number some researchers believed that the critical reynolds number represented the critical point of the flow regime when it changed from laminar flow to turbulent flow qian et al 2007 chen et al 2009 while others believed that the critical reynolds number represents the transition from linear laminar flow to nonlinear laminar flow that is the onset of nonlinear flow yu et al 2017 quinn et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 javadi et al 2014 here the definition of critical reynolds number was consistent with the latter point the determination of critical reynolds number was closely related to the value of non darcy effect factor e and a large number of studies have taken e 0 03 0 1 as the criterion of critical reynolds number quinn et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 yu et al 2017 zeng and grigg 2006 from the prediction model of critical reynolds number zimmerman et al 2004 zhou et al 2015 javadi et al 2014 and the parametric expression of the non darcy effect factor it can be seen that critical reynolds number is closely related to the non darcy coefficient however in previous studies the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was ignored so the prediction model of the critical reynolds number derived from these non darcy coefficient models without considering the inertial effect would cause the deviation between the predicted value and the measured value therefore the critical reynolds number model crn model in this study was improved by using the non darcy coefficient model which considering the coupling effect of the geometric properties of single fracture and inertia effect of fluid flow in this study e 0 1 was taken as the criterion of critical reynolds number 34 e 0 1 b 1 v 2 a 1 v b 1 v 2 then the critical velocity vc can be obtained 35 v c a 1 9 b 1 36 r e c ρ v c e h μ a 1 ρ e h 9 μ b 1 combined with eq 5 37 r e c e h 9 k β the eq 22 was introduced to eq 37 then eq 38 was obtained 38 r e c 6 5 β e h combined with the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect with e 0 1 eq 36 the critical reynolds number prediction model crn model eq 41 was obtained 39 β 516 59 r rms 2 r a 9 1314 r rms 1 e h 9 1314 r rms 40 e h 0 9185 e m 41 r e c 6 516 59 r rms 2 r a 9 1314 r rms 1 0 9185 e m 9 1314 r rms 1 to verify the validity of the above critical reynolds number prediction model it was necessary to obtain the measured and predicted critical reynolds number the measured critical reynolds numbers of 30 rough single fractures were obtained by using the method of transmittance ratio in sivanesapillai et al 2014 xiong et al 2011 and yu et al 2017 as shown in fig 16 the predicted rec were obtained based on the geometric properties of single fractures in table 2 and the prediction model then the measured and predicted values were compared with the prediction model proposed by javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 and rong et al 2020 as shown in table 5 and fig 17 the predicted values of the crn model considering the coupling effects of flow inertial effect and geometric properties of single fractures were much more accurate than other models which overestimated the critical reynolds number moreover it can be seen from fig 17 b that other crn models are more accurate in predicting the critical reynolds number of a single fracture with larger relative roughness rsd 0 35 than that of a single fracture with lower roughness this phenomenon showed that in the single fracture with larger relative roughness the inertial effect played a weak effect on the non darcy coefficient compared with the geometric properties however for a single fracture with relatively low roughness rsd 0 35 although the geometric property was still dominated the fluid flow the influence of the inertial effect became more significant and unable to be ignored the discussion on the accuracy and validity of the critical reynolds number model further verified the rationality and validity of the non darcy flow coefficient prediction model considering the coupling effect 4 conclusions through laboratory experiments and numerical simulation the influencing factors of the non darcy coefficient and its quantitative model were explored the conclusions are as follows the inertial effect of fluid flow will affect the non darcy coefficient β experiments numerical simulations and theoretical analysis showed that for a rough single fracture with fixed geometric properties the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh would decrease with the increase of the magnitude of inertia effect considering the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient the quantization model of β was improved hydraulic aperture was an important parameter to quantify the non darcy coefficient in rough single fractures under the dominant influence of inertial effect the relationship between the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh followed a negative power law relationship and the proportion coefficient λ 1 and power exponent m 1 in the power law relationship was determined by the geometric properties of single fracture however under the coupling effect of fracture geometric attributes and the inertial effect of fracture flow the relationship between the β and eh followed a negative power law compared with previous studies it was proved that the influence of geometric attributes on the non darcy coefficient was the dominant factor and directly controlled the form of a quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient based on the dimensionless analysis the quantization model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect was obtained based on the improved non darcy coefficient quantitative model a new critical reynolds number prediction model was obtained and its effectiveness was proved the new critical reynolds number model considering the coupling effect of fracture geometric properties and fluid inertial effect could well predict the critical reynolds number rec of rough single fractures the critical reynolds number of low roughness fracture rsd 0 35 was overestimated by the crn model proposed by other researchers the inertial dependence of the non darcy flow coefficient was firstly revealed through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and the influence of the inertial effect on the non darcy flow coefficient was quantified by the relationship between the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture a new critical reynolds number prediction model crn model was obtained based on the improved quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient which considering the inertial effect however it should be noted that in this study the aperture range of rough single fractures was between 0 7 and 3 0 mm which might limit the application range of the non darcy coefficient quantitative model or critical reynolds number model quinn et al 2020 moreover in section 2 we mentioned that the quantification of geometric attributes 3d real single fracture is also the focus of expanding the above quantification model of non darcy coefficient how to find the parameters that can truly represent the geometric properties not the average value of 3d real single fracture is much important thus the application of these models will be further expanded in future

3870,this study experimentally and numerically investigated the influence of the inertial effect of fluid flow on the non darcy coefficient β the results showed that the non darcy coefficient β apparent permeability ka and hydraulic aperture eh decreased with the increase of reynolds number re which indicated that the non darcy coefficient depended on the geometric properties of a single fracture and the fluid inertial effect the quantification model of the non darcy coefficient was improved under the guidance of fluid inertial effect the β performed a positive power law relationship with eh under the coupling effect of fluid inertial effect and fracture geometric properties the β behaved negative power law relationship with eh which was similar to the non darcy coefficient quantitative model that ignored the fluid inertial effect in the previous study therefore the geometric properties were the dominant ones for fracture flow when it was affected by the coupling effect of geometric properties and inertial effects then the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient was improved based on the improved non darcy coefficient quantitative model a new critical reynolds number prediction model crn model was constructed compared with other crn models the new crn model considering the coupling effect of fluid and media properties could more accurately predict

2015a 2015b quinn et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 the appearance of the non darcy effect that is the fluid movement from regular linear motion to nonlinear made it difficult to describe the fluid flow in fractures and solute transport therefore accurate identification and quantification of non darcy flow are of great scientific significance for groundwater science environmental engineering underground storage of radioactive waste and petroleum engineering ghane et al 2014 macini et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 generally the forchheimer equation is widely accepted as an important semi empirical formula to describe non darcy flow in fractured media and the determination of the non darcy coefficient β which is included in the forchheimer equation is one of the most important methods for characterizing the non darcy effect li and engler 2001 chukwudozie et al 2012 rong et al 2020 considering the invalidity of darcy s law and the cubic law cl eq 1 wen et al 2013 under some experimental conditions such as in a high reynolds number flow rate environment ghane et al 2014 and heterogeneous media liang et al 2019 forchheimer 1901 carried out the empirical nonlinear equation to remedy the

the development of the theoretical background of the forchheimer equation irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 researchers have made a lot of improvements on it ergun 1952 polacci et al 2014 zhou et al 2019a sun et al 2020 among various forms of improved forchheimer equation the most widely used form containing the non darcy coefficient β was firstly proposed by muskat 1938 and spread by green and duwez 1951 cornell and katz 1953 and macini et al 2008 they correlated the viscous and inertial coefficients a 1 and b 1 with properties of fluid and medium 3 dp dx ρ g j μ k v β ρ v 2 4 j μ ρ g k v β g v 2 combined eqs 2 and 4 eq 5 was obtained 5 a 1 μ ρ g k b 1 β g where β m 1 is the turbulence factor coefficient which was also called as non darcy flow coefficient or forchheimer coefficient later and k m2 is the permeability cornell and katz 1953 thought that the non darcy effect was caused by turbulence so the parameter β was initially defined as the turbulence factor which could characterize the magnitude of turbulence however researchers had widely accepted that the fluid nonlinearity was not induced by turbulence but the non ignorable inertial effects ruth and ma 1992 li and engler 2001 since then the parameter β was called the non darcy coefficient or inertial resistance coefficient noted that in the following content β was called as non darcy coefficient as a parameter that directly determines the magnitude of the coefficient of the inertial term in the forchheimer equation the non darcy coefficient β is one of the most important parameters for characterizing the non darcy flow based on the non darcy coefficient β the magnitude of fluid inertial effect in a single fracture can be quantified geertsma 1974 defined a new type of reynolds number that could also be used as an indicator of non darcy flow more accurately 6 f o j v j i b 1 v 2 a 1 v k β ρ v μ where fo is the forchheimer number based on the forchheimer number fo the magnitude of the non darcy effect

information although researchers have improved the critical reynolds number prediction formula based on eq 11 the non darcy coefficient still plays an irreplaceable role in calculating the critical reynolds number of a single fracture javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 while the non darcy coefficient can also be used to characterize the friction factor of fluid flow in a single fracture which is an important dimensionless parameter for fracture flow that could relate the pressure drop to flow velocity and geometric properties of rough single fractures zhou et al 2016 qian et al 2011 to describe the friction factor of non darcy flow huang and ayoub 2008 combined the darcy weisbach equation eq 12 with the forchheimer equation a new semi empirical friction model considering the flow regime was obtained 12 dp dx f 1 d h ρ v 2 2 13 f 96 re 4 β e h where dh m is the hydraulic diameter and f is the friction factor moreover it was found that a small change in the non darcy coefficient could significantly affect the pressure gradient around the wellbore of a propped fracture ubani 1981 given the important role of the non darcy coefficient such as determination of the critical reynolds number and friction factor of a single fracture the development of a non darcy coefficient prediction model or quantitative model has an important significance for further exploration of fracture flow in previous studies researchers explored many quantitative models of the non darcy coefficient in different geological porous media li and engler 2001 reviewed the quantitative models of the non darcy coefficient in porous media as shown in tables s3 and s4 and the magnitude of the non darcy coefficient in porous media depended on geometric properties such as porosity particle diameter and permeability kollbotn and bratteli 2005 found a positive proportional relationship between the non darcy coefficient and formation resistivity kutasov 1993 found that for porous media water saturation also affects the non darcy coefficient and the β is proportional to water saturation ward 1964 and moutsopoulos et al 2009 considered that the non darcy coefficient only depended on the particle diameter of porous media cooke 1973 summarized the numerical relationship between the non darcy coefficient and permeability in porous media 14 β a k b where a m2b 1 is the scaling factor with dimension and b is a dimensionless power index for a single fracture with stronger heterogeneity the quantification of the non darcy coefficient is more complex narayanaswamy et al 1999 zhou et al 2015 studied the non darcy coefficient in natural rock fractures under variable confining pressure and proposed a quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient based on hydraulic aperture chen et al 2015a evaluated the forchheimer s coefficients in the deformable rough walled fractures and proposed two mathematical models for quantifying the non darcy coefficient the single parameter model showed the negative power law relationship between the coefficient of the inertial term of the forchheimer equation that is b 1 which contained β and the hydraulic aperture and the two parameters model introduced the parameters which could characterize the roughness of a single fracture based on the single parameter model ni et al 2018 established the quantitative relationship between non darcy coefficient β joint roughness coefficient jrc and average mechanical aperture em based on laboratory experiments and found that β was proportional to the roughness of a single fracture rong et al 2020 explored the influence of fracture geometric properties on the non darcy coefficient when the fluid inertial effect could be ignored and defined new parameters to quantify the geometric properties of a single fracture based on the above quantitative model it can be found that the hydraulic aperture is an important parameter to quantify the non darcy coefficient of rough single fracture and the researchers believed that the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture only depend on the geometric properties of a single fracture and is unrelated with the magnitude of fluid inertia effect flow regime zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 in the above studies although the non darcy effect of fluid flow appeared the magnitude of the fluid inertial effect is relatively small so the influences of the fluid inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture were ignored noted that forchheimer equation is originally used to describe the non darcy or nonlinear flow so the validity of the prediction model of non darcy coefficient obtained by previous researchers based on low inertial effect is limited as a parameter determining the inertial term of the forchheimer equation the non darcy coefficient should be closely related to the inertial effect of fluid theoretically although the effect of fluid inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient is rarely reported there are still some evidences to support the existence of the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient in the above content it was mentioned that the hydraulic aperture of a single fracture was the key parameter for quantifying non darcy coefficient β the hydraulic aperture was firstly defined as a geometric mean of the aperture field which could directly reflect the geometric properties of a single fracture tsang 1984 barton et al 1985 and renshaw 1995 studied the relationship between hydraulic aperture eh and average mechanical aperture em and proposed that eh was proportional to the square of em and inversely proportional to jrc lee et al 1996 proposed the linear relation between hydraulic aperture and roughness of the surface exposed rock recently zhang and chai 2020 zhang et al 2021 and sun et al 2020 reviewed the hydraulic aperture in the works of literature which further emphasized that the hydraulic aperture was only dependent on the geometric properties of single fractures however some studies have shown the influence of the inertial effect on hydraulic aperture li and jiang 2013 and zhao et al 2014 proposed prediction models for hydraulic aperture eh when re 1 eh was only dependent on the geometric properties when re 1 the reynolds number was introduced into the prediction model which indicated the influence of the fluid inertial effect on the hydraulic aperture liu et al 2016 investigated that the increasing fluid nonlinearity might induce the reduction of hydraulic aperture and permeability in single fractures quinn et al 2020 mentioned that the size of the hydraulic aperture was related to the flow regimes the magnitude of inertial effect rong et al 2020 believed that hydraulic aperture eh decreased as the flow rate increasing due to the nonlinear effect based on the close relationship between hydraulic aperture and non darcy coefficient the influence of inertial effect on the hydraulic aperture provided evidence for the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient β moreover the coupling effect of fluid inertial force and geometric properties of fractures has not been considered in the previous quantitative model of non darcy coefficient β therefore it is necessary to re evaluate the influencing factors of the non darcy coefficient and improve the quantitative model the objectives of this study are to 1 disclose the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient in rough single fractures 2 obtain a new prediction model of the non darcy coefficient which considering inertial effect and 3 verify the validity and applicability of the new non darcy coefficient prediction model 2 materials and methods in this study for fully investigating of the influence of the inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient β laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were carried out the specific experiment process construction of physical models and parameter settings would be described in the following contents 2 1 laboratory experiment 2 1 1 physical model construction the single rock fracture in nature has strong heterogeneity to simulate the real single fracture as much as possible a random 3d rough single fracture physical model was generated using synfrac software and parametric scanning was carried out according to the 3d coordinate data generated by the synfrac then the parameterized scanning results were transformed into 3d numerical models of the upper and lower surfaces of the single fracture finally based on the numerical model the physical model of 3d rough single fracture used in laboratory experiments was obtained by using 3d printing technology the printing material is photosensitive resin and the size of the model is 100 100 mm to consider the influence of geometric properties on the non darcy coefficient in the experiment three kinds of 3d random single fracture models with different apertures were constructed by using the gasket to pad up the upper fracture surface the geometric properties of 3d real single fracture were shown in table 1 please refer to appendix a fig a for the method of determination of geometric properties of 3d real single fractures and za m is the mean height of the elevation plane rrms is the root mean square roughness ra m is average roughness rp m is peak asperity height and rsd is the relative roughness the hydraulic experimental devices and the local structure of 3d rough single fracture are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively 2 1 2 laboratory flow test in the laboratory hydraulic experiment the key is to control the magnitude of the inertial effect of steady fluid flow the hydraulic gradient and fluid velocity were controlled by the relative height of the inlet tank and outlet tank the height of the water tank should be adjusted to the right position when the indication of the manometer remained stable the value of the manometer was recorded while stopwatch and cylinder were used to calculate the volume of steady flow through the fracture exit in a certain period of time then according to the volume density and flow time of the fluid the flow rate was calculated it should be noted that when the reynolds number was small the fluid flow might be linear darcy flow therefore in laboratory experiments the reynolds number of fluid was controlled in the range of 10 this is because a large number of studies have shown that the critical reynolds number range of fluid transition from linear darcy flow to nonlinear flow in rough single fracture was about 1 10 ranjith and viete 2011 quinn 2011 zimmerman and yeo 2000 it should be noted that in the subsequent numerical simulation the numerical simulation under a small reynolds number re 1 was carried out to capture the critical reynolds number the forchheimer coefficients and its non darcy coefficient under different inertial effects can be obtained by fitting the forchheimer equation with different hydraulic gradient ranges and corresponding flow velocity flow rate the detailed fitting method was shown in fig s1 the whole hydraulic gradient was divided into many secondary fitting units then the v j data in each fitting unit was fitted by the forchheimer equation and the reynolds number was calculated by taking the flow velocity corresponding to the maximum hydraulic gradient of each fitting unit in this way the non darcy coefficients β at different reynolds numbers can be obtained moreover according to the j q data in each fitting unit the hydraulic aperture under different inertial effects can be inversely derived from the cubic law eq 9 2 2 numerical simulation laboratory experiments could provide strong evidence for the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient but the improvement of the non darcy coefficient prediction model needs more basic data considering that the amount of experimental data was limited and the control of experimental conditions was difficult the numerical simulation was carried out numerical simulations could accurately quantify and characterize the influence of different factors on the non darcy coefficient β and provide mutual verification with laboratory experiments previous studies have shown that it was reasonable to improve the quantitative model of parameters based on numerical simulation data wang et al 2015 and 2020 in this study the computational fluid dynamics cfd module based on finite element method fem in comsol multiphysics was used for numerical simulation of fracture flow zhou et al 2019a 2019b the physical model governing equations and boundary conditions in the numerical simulation would be introduced in the following contents 2 2 1 physical model of numerical simulation the physical models of numerical simulations are the simplification of two dimensional cross sections of different positions of 3d random single fracture as shown in fig 2 the initial numerical model of 3d single fracture is constructed by importing the parametric scanning results in section 2 1 1 into comsol then the x y work plane is used to intercept the 3d model at certain intervals and six initial 2d single fracture models fr a1 fr b1 fr c1 fr d1 fr e1 and fr f1 are obtained and the fracture structures are shown in fig 3 for more basic hydraulic data and consideration of the influence of geometric attributes on the non darcy coefficient six initial single fractures are expanded to obtain more single fractures with different geometric attributes the specific method is shown in fig 4 the lower surface of the 2d fracture is controlled to remain unchanged and the upper surface is raised by 0 2 mm 0 4 mm 0 6 mm and 0 8 mm respectively based on this method 2d rough single fractures of six series each series contains 5 fractures a total of 30 single fractures are obtained and the geometric properties of single fractures are shown in table 2 in this study the physical model of numerical simulation adopted with a two dimensional model the reason why 2d numerical simulations were used instead of 3d numerical simulations would be explained in detail below firstly although the three dimensional physical model is closer to the natural single fracture in the dimension the modeling process is more difficult and the solutions of the 3d navier stokes n s equation require a lot of computer resources however it is very complicated to directly solve the 3d n s equations with the finite element method and the solutions of 3d n s equations in cfd software are based on various simplified conditions comsol ab 2013 secondly compared with the 3d model the 2d model is easier to model than the 3d model and many studies have shown that using 2d n s equations to study fluid flow or solute transport in a single fracture is reliable cardenas et al 2009 chaudhary et al 2011 the 2d physical model can be used as an ideal test case for the 3d model lee et al 2015 lastly previous studies have shown that the geometric properties of a single fracture would significantly affect the non darcy coefficient β zhou et al 2015 however whether in previous studies barton and choubey 1977 or recent studies zhang and chai 2020 researchers quantified the geometric attributes of a single fracture based on the 2d structure of rough single fractures for example chen et al 2015a only used one 2d jrc profile to describe the roughness of a single fracture after 3d scanning sun et al 2020 obtained several 2d jrc curves from a 3d fracture surface by two dimensional interception and used the average jrc to characterize the roughness of a 3d fracture surface although in section 2 1 1 similar geometric properties such as rrms and rp were calculated by the distribution of measured aperture field of 3d single fracture these values were in an average sense for the single fracture with high heterogeneity the average values of geometric properties are not representatives such as 2d slices of the 3d model fig 3 and the aperture distribution and geometric properties of 2d fractures corresponding to different positions are different therefore the 2d single fracture model could better reflect the influence of geometric properties on fracture flow in conclusion 2d single fracture models were selected for numerical simulation 2 2 2 governing equations using n s equation to describe fluid flow has been widely recognized and used in the numerical simulations of fracture flow zou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 therefore in this study the steady state laminar flow model was selected noted that the laminar flow model was selected in this study the non darcy flow in this study generally refers to nonlinear laminar flow which could be well described by the forchheimer equation and was different from turbulent flow and the n s equation and the conservation equation of mass were combined as the governing equation of incompressible newtonian fluid flow in a single fracture 15 ρ u u μ 2 u p 16 u 0 where u ux uy is the velocity vector p pa is the total pressure 2 3 boundary conditions in the numerical simulation the reasonable parameter setting is the key to solve the n s equation it should be noted that cardenas et al 2009 mentioned that for a single fracture with high heterogeneity the selection of flow entrance would affect fracture flow in numerical simulation therefore the left opening of the 2d single fracture is defined as the entrance of the fluid flow and the corresponding right opening is the exit by controlling the average pressure difference between the outlet and the inlet a different magnitude of inertial effects can be achieved the boundary except the entrance and exit of the 2d single fracture was set as the non sliding wall when using the finite element method to solve the n s equation the meshing of the physical field flow field is a key step to solve the n s equation which also directly determines the accuracy and solution time of numerical simulation results in comsol meshing can be done by selecting the existing mesh options and the more detailed the grid the more accurate the numerical simulation results are but the more detailed grids would greatly increase the calculation time to get an exact solution while saving the time of numerical solution the mesh independence was analyzed a 2d fracture model fr a1 was selected as the verification object and the numerical results of conventional refined relatively refined ultra refined and extremely refined mesh generation were analyzed and visualized fig b in appendix b please refer to table s2 for the number of mesh grids of different mesh options the results showed that there was a numerical difference in the conventional refined and relatively refined hydraulic data but the data between ultra refined and extremely refined grids almost had no difference and the ultra refined grids greatly saved much calculation time than the extremely refined grids therefore balancing the accuracy and computing cost we choose the ultra fine grids to divide the physical field please refer to table s8 for a detailed set of other parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 the inertial dependence of non darcy coefficient β hydraulic experimental data of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were visualized in fig 5 a and 6 a it could be seen that the linear darcy s law couldn t accurately describe the relationship between flow velocity and hydraulic gradient which indicated that the flow regime in all single fractures was non darcy flow noted that in fig 6 only the hydraulic data of series a were drawn as the representative of the hydraulic data of numerical simulations the non darcy effect was firstly recognized by the abnormal change of intrinsic permeability which was inversely calculated by darcy s law later researchers used the apparent permeability ka to characterize the change of permeability takeuchi et al 2008 it was found that when the inertial effect of fluid was small that is the fluid flow was darcy flow the apparent permeability was equal to the intrinsic permeability in this case combined with darcy s law and cubic law cl the researchers obtained the expression of the apparent permeability of a single fracture 17 k a e h 2 12 as mentioned in section 1 many previous studies defaulted that as a geometric mean of the aperture field the hydraulic aperture was only dependent on the geometric properties of single fractures zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 up to now many researchers still insisted that eq 17 was effective therefore the permeability of a single fracture also only depended on the geometric properties of the fracture and had nothing to do with the flow regimes eq 17 was widely accepted as the expression of fracture permeability to quantify the coefficient of viscosity term in the forchheimer equation zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2015a sun et al 2020 rong et al 2020 javadi et al 2014 as shown in table s3 the empirical expression of β was generally related to the permeability and porosity of the geological medium li and engler 2001 according to the study of cooke 1973 in porous media zhou et al 2015 summarized the relationship between β and permeability k in fractures as eq 14 combined with eq 17 the negative power law relationship between β and eh was found 18 β a e h 2 12 b 12 b a e h 2 b due to the geometric attribute dependence of hydraulic aperture researchers believed that the non darcy coefficient β also only depended on geometric properties of the geological medium and was independent of the fluid properties cooper et al 1999 chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 as shown in fig s2 a large number of laboratory experiments and numerical simulation results also proved the negative power law relationship between β and eh zhang et al 2013 2015 rong et al 2020 however it should be noted that the influence of flow regime or inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture was not emphasized in these studies for example zhou et al 2015 and chen et al 2015a emphasized that their researches were carried out under the condition of confining pressure and low reynolds number in the study of the non darcy coefficient rong et al 2020 controlled the water flow in the linear flow regime in which the inertial forces were negligible compared with viscous forces therefore the influence of the inertial effect on the β and the validity of eq 17 need to be further studied recently researchers found that once the non darcy effect occurred the apparent permeability of single fractures began to decrease macini et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the reduction of apparent permeability was related to the appearance and development of recirculation zones near the rough surfaces of fractures wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the phenomenon that permeability decreasing with reynolds number was also verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and the recirculation zones were also captured in different fractures see fig s3 as shown in fig 5 b and 6 b with the increase of inertial effect the permeability of rough single fractures decreased which indicated that the permeability related not only to the geometry of the fracture but also to the fluid inertia effect in terms of current research on fracture permeability the reasons for the decrease of fracture permeability are as follows 1 the permeability model eq 16 k eh 2 12 is still valid and the hydraulic aperture decreases with the increase of re which leads to the reduction of permeability 2 the hydraulic aperture remains stable with the increasing inertial effect here the hydraulic aperture was considered only depends on the geometric properties of a single fracture but the permeability model changes and 3 both the hydraulic aperture and prediction model eq 17 have changed based on the experimental data the above reasons for the decrease of permeability were further analyzed firstly the inertial effect sensitivity of the hydraulic aperture was analyzed based on the method in section 2 1 2 the hydraulic aperture at different reynolds numbers was obtained as shown in fig 7 b and 8 b both laboratory experiments and numerical simulation results showed that the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of reynolds number this phenomenon showed that the hydraulic aperture is not only determined by the geometric properties of a single fracture but also highly related to the inertial effect of fluid flow quinn et al 2020 rong et al 2020 li and jiang 2013 zhao et al 2014 secondly the validity of eq 17 was verified in fig 9 the experimental data of other researchers rong et al 2016 2020 zhang et al 2013 2015 and the data in this study were compared the results showed that the classical parametric expression of apparent permeability ka at lower reynolds number ka e h 2 12 could not characterize the permeability of single fractures and the power exponent between permeability and hydraulic aperture was 2 therefore the third reason for the reduction of fracture permeability was reasonable that is the reduction of hydraulic aperture and the variation of permeability quantitative model induced by the higher inertial effect led to the decrease of fracture permeability to further reveal the inertial dependence of fracture permeability theoretically the parametric expression of fracture permeability under the non darcy flow was deduced by the improved forchheimer equation eq 2 and cubic law eq 1 19 μ k a e h w q β ρ w 2 e h 2 q 2 12 μ q w e h 3 20 μ k a 12 μ e h 2 β ρ q w e h 21 k a e h 2 12 β ρ v e h 2 μ 22 k a e h 2 12 β e h r e based on eq 22 it was assumed that the hydraulic aperture and the non darcy coefficient only depended on the geometric properties of a single fracture that is with the increase of re eh and β in eq 22 were constant according to this assumption the apparent permeability ka of a single fracture would increase with reynolds number which was contrary to the previous studies wang et al 2020 and the experimental and numerical simulation results in this study with the increase of inertial effect re the decrease of hydraulic aperture would only lead to the decrease of ka and the reduction of ka was already detected due to the close relationship between the non darcy flow coefficient and hydraulic aperture rong et al 2020 chen et al 2015a the reduction of hydraulic aperture could also affect the non darcy coefficient the varying trend of the non darcy coefficient under different inertial effects was shown in fig 7 a and 8 a with the increase of fluid inertial effect the non darcy coefficient decreased with the increase of re theoretical experimental and numerical simulation results showed that the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient existed traditionally the magnitude of the non darcy effect of fluid flow was characterized by the non darcy coefficient and the larger β was the stronger the non darcy effect was li and engler 2001 but it was detected that for a single fracture with fixed geometric properties the experimental and numerical results showed that β decreased with the increase of inertial effect it showed that when the inertial effect of fluid increased gradually and the geometric attribute of a single fracture was fixed the non darcy effect of fluid flow cannot be judged only by the magnitude of the non darcy coefficient of single fractures according to the definition of the non darcy effect factor the new parameter to quantify the non darcy effect zeng and grigg 2006 it could be seen that the magnitude of the non darcy effect was determined by the coefficient of viscosity term and the coefficient of the inertial term β in forchheimer equation moreover the relationship between the two forchheimer phenomenological coefficients has been revealed by researchers zhou et al 2019a the change of non darcy coefficient would lead to the change of viscosity term coefficient a 1 in eq 2 so the increase of non darcy coefficient or inertial term coefficient b 1 did not necessarily lead to the increase of non darcy effect factor and vice versa and it is unreasonable to characterize the non darcy effect of a single fracture only according to the non darcy coefficient the above content is a revision to the concept of the non darcy coefficient 3 2 quantification of non darcy coefficient β accurate quantification of the non darcy coefficient is of great significance for the study of non darcy flow in geological porous media previous studies have shown that the non darcy coefficient was only determined by the geometry of a single fracture and independent of the flow regimes however based on theoretical derivation laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was revealed for the first time both laboratory experiments and numerical simulation showed that under the influence of inertial effect there is a positive correlation between the non darcy coefficient and the hydraulic aperture which is just opposite to the previous studies therefore the inertial effect is an important factor that needs to be considered for the following accurate quantification of the non darcy coefficient 3 2 1 quantification of non darcy coefficient β under the inertial effect previous studies have shown that the quantitative results of non darcy coefficient β or inertial term coefficient of forchheimer equation of single fractures showed that there was an obvious power law relationship between hydraulic aperture and β chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 therefore the following power law equation was used to fit the relationship between non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture 23 β λ 1 e h m 1 where λ 1 m m 1 1 is the scaling factor and m 1 is the dimensionless power index noted that to explore the influence of inertial effect on the non darcy coefficient other influencing factors need to be strictly controlled therefore all the source data fitting the power law relationship in this section were from the non darcy coefficients β and their corresponding hydraulic aperture eh of the same single fracture at different reynolds numbers the fitting results were shown in fig 10 both the experimental and numerical simulation data showed that β and eh was in good agreement with the positive power law relation the fitting results of other series of numerical simulations are shown in table 3 under the dominant influence of inertial effect the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture of single fractures with different geometric properties strictly followed a positive power law relationship but the β of different fractures showed obvious differences which also reflected that the geometric properties and inertial effect behaved a coupling effect on the non darcy coefficient it should be noted that the varying geometric properties of single fractures in this section were only caused by the number of single fractures which indicated that the inertial effect was the dominant factor as shown in fig 11 the non darcy flow coefficient was inversely proportional to the reynolds number under the dominant effect of inertial effect and there seemed to be a positive proportional relationship between β and relative roughness rsd in the above study we found that the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of reynolds number because of the positive proportional relationship between the hydraulic aperture and the non darcy coefficient the reason why the non darcy coefficient was inversely proportional to the fluid inertial effect was well explained however due to the difference of the characteristic length d of different single fractures using the reynolds number to characterize the variation of the hydraulic aperture with the inertial effect resulted in a great digital dispersion as shown in fig 7 b and 8 b to quantify the influence of inertial effect on hydraulic aperture uniformly the macroscopic non darcy effect factor e was introduced to characterize the inertial effect of fluid flow and the average mechanical aperture em was used to normalize the change of hydraulic aperture in different fractures the results are shown in fig 12 the numerical simulation results of all 2d rough single fractures proved that the reduction of the hydraulic aperture was in direct proportion to the non darcy effect factor e under the guidance of the inertial effect the inertial effect affected β by controlling the change of hydraulic aperture referring to the previous researches chen et al 2015a rong et al 2020 it was speculated that under the guidance of inertial effect geometric attributes might affect β by controlling the scaling coefficient and power index of the power law relationship as shown in fig 13 both the scaling coefficient λ and the power exponent m were directly proportional to the root mean square roughness rsd of a single fracture and the rsd was inversely proportional to the average mechanical aperture za em of a single fracture the specific numerical relationship was as follows 24 e m e h e m 0 725 e 0 009 25 l o g λ 6 52 r s d 26 z a 1 925 r s d 1 898 27 m 1 18 23 r s d combined with the normalized change of hydraulic aperture caused by inertial effect and the influence of geometric attributes on the proportion coefficient and power index in the power law relationship between non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture the dimensionless analysis of β under the dominant influence of inertial effect was carried out to obtain the quantitative model of β 28 β 10 6 52 r s d r p 18 23 r s d 1 e m 0 991 0 725 e 18 23 r s d it can be seen that under the dominant influence of inertial effect the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh eh was replaced by em 0 991 0 725e which was calculated by eq 24 followed a positive power law relationship and the scaling coefficient λ 1 and power exponent m 1 were determined by the geometric properties of a single fracture this further showed that the fracture would be affected by the coupling effect of the inertial effect of fluid flow and geometric properties 3 2 2 quantification of non darcy coefficient β under coupling effect the influence of geometric properties of a single fracture on the non darcy flow coefficient has always been a hot topic for researchers they believed that the geometric properties directly determined the non darcy flow coefficient under the condition that the inertial effect can be ignored chen et al 2015a zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and the non darcy coefficient was inversely proportional to the hydraulic aperture however with the increase of fluid inertia effect its influence on the non darcy coefficient couldn t be ignored the existence of the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was revealed in section 3 1 and the positive power law relationship between β and eh under the dominant effect of inertia effect was found in section 3 2 1 under the natural and human factors the coupling effect of the geometric properties and fluid inertial effect on fracture flow was common quinn et al 2020 and the previous non darcy coefficient model did not consider the influence of the inertial effect therefore in the following content the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect of inertial effect and geometric attributes was studied in this section the inertial effect of fluid and the geometric properties of single fractures were independent variables by precisely controlling the pressure gradient at the inlet and outlet the inertial effect of fluid flow in five single fractures of a series was consistent it should be noted that due to the different characteristic lengths the non darcy effect factor e was used to characterize the magnitude of inertial effect so when the e was consistent the fluid velocity or reynolds number in different single fractures were different based on the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture of five single fractures in different series under different inertial effects the numerical relationship between the hydraulic aperture and the corresponding non darcy coefficient under the coupling influence of geometric attributes and inertial effects were obtained the fitting results were shown in table 4 under the coupling effect β and eh followed a negative power law relationship 29 β λ 2 e h m 2 where λ 2 m m 2 1 is the scaling factor and m 2 is the dimensionless power index this negative power law relationship is similar to the numerical relationship between β and eh found by other researchers only under the influence of geometric properties this phenomenon showed that under the coupling influence of fluid inertial effect and geometric attributes the influence of geometric attribute on non darcy coefficient was the dominant one which might be the reason why previous researchers ignored the influence of fluid inertial effect on non darcy coefficient rong et al 2020 although the influence of geometric attributes on β was more significant than that of inertial effect and it directly controlled the form of power law relationship between β and eh positive and negative power exponent as shown in fig 14 the influence of inertial effect on the quantitative model of β couldn t be ignored see fig 15 according to tables s6 and s7 the dimensionless analysis of the negative power law relationship between β and eh was carried out and then the parametric expression of the non darcy flow coefficient considering both fluid inertial effect and geometric properties of single fractures was obtained 30 β 20 56 r rms 2 r a m 2 1 e 1 4 e h m 2 31 m 2 r rms 8 686 e 10 32 β 20 56 r

model needs to be verified therefore this section was conducted to demonstrate the potential application of the quantitative model and verify its validity as mentioned above the flow regime would directly determine the choice of prediction model or governing equation of fluid flow in engineering or simulation so it is important to determine the flow regimes in fractured media however different from pipe flow the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow in a single fracture is a gradual process yu et al 2017 so the determination of critical reynolds number in a rough single fracture is of great significance researchers have different definitions of the critical reynolds number some researchers believed that the critical reynolds number represented the critical point of the flow regime when it changed from laminar flow to turbulent flow qian et al 2007 chen et al 2009 while others believed that the critical reynolds number represents the transition from linear laminar flow to nonlinear laminar flow that is the onset of nonlinear flow yu et al 2017 quinn et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 javadi et al 2014 here the definition of critical reynolds number was consistent with the latter point the determination of critical reynolds number was closely related to the value of non darcy effect factor e and a large number of studies have taken e 0 03 0 1 as the criterion of critical reynolds number quinn et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 yu et al 2017 zeng and grigg 2006 from the prediction model of critical reynolds number zimmerman et al 2004 zhou et al 2015 javadi et al 2014 and the parametric expression of the non darcy effect factor it can be seen that critical reynolds number is closely related to the non darcy coefficient however in previous studies the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient was ignored so the prediction model of the critical reynolds number derived from these non darcy coefficient models without considering the inertial effect would cause the deviation between the predicted value and the measured value therefore the critical reynolds number model crn model in this study was improved by using the non darcy coefficient model which considering the coupling effect of the geometric properties of single fracture and inertia effect of fluid flow in this study e 0 1 was taken as the criterion of critical reynolds number 34 e 0 1 b 1 v 2 a 1 v b 1 v 2 then the critical velocity vc can be obtained 35 v c a 1 9 b 1 36 r e c ρ v c e h μ a 1 ρ e h 9 μ b 1 combined with eq 5 37 r e c e h 9 k β the eq 22 was introduced to eq 37 then eq 38 was obtained 38 r e c 6 5 β e h combined with the quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect with e 0 1 eq 36 the critical reynolds number prediction model crn model eq 41 was obtained 39 β 516 59 r rms 2 r a 9 1314 r rms 1 e h 9 1314 r rms 40 e h 0 9185 e m 41 r e c 6 516 59 r rms 2 r a 9 1314 r rms 1 0 9185 e m 9 1314 r rms 1 to verify the validity of the above critical reynolds number prediction model it was necessary to obtain the measured and predicted critical reynolds number the measured critical reynolds numbers of 30 rough single fractures were obtained by using the method of transmittance ratio in sivanesapillai et al 2014 xiong et al 2011 and yu et al 2017 as shown in fig 16 the predicted rec were obtained based on the geometric properties of single fractures in table 2 and the prediction model then the measured and predicted values were compared with the prediction model proposed by javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 and rong et al 2020 as shown in table 5 and fig 17 the predicted values of the crn model considering the coupling effects of flow inertial effect and geometric properties of single fractures were much more accurate than other models which overestimated the critical reynolds number moreover it can be seen from fig 17 b that other crn models are more accurate in predicting the critical reynolds number of a single fracture with larger relative roughness rsd 0 35 than that of a single fracture with lower roughness this phenomenon showed that in the single fracture with larger relative roughness the inertial effect played a weak effect on the non darcy coefficient compared with the geometric properties however for a single fracture with relatively low roughness rsd 0 35 although the geometric property was still dominated the fluid flow the influence of the inertial effect became more significant and unable to be ignored the discussion on the accuracy and validity of the critical reynolds number model further verified the rationality and validity of the non darcy flow coefficient prediction model considering the coupling effect 4 conclusions through laboratory experiments and numerical simulation the influencing factors of the non darcy coefficient and its quantitative model were explored the conclusions are as follows the inertial effect of fluid flow will affect the non darcy coefficient β experiments numerical simulations and theoretical analysis showed that for a rough single fracture with fixed geometric properties the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh would decrease with the increase of the magnitude of inertia effect considering the inertial dependence of the non darcy coefficient the quantization model of β was improved hydraulic aperture was an important parameter to quantify the non darcy coefficient in rough single fractures under the dominant influence of inertial effect the relationship between the non darcy coefficient β and hydraulic aperture eh followed a negative power law relationship and the proportion coefficient λ 1 and power exponent m 1 in the power law relationship was determined by the geometric properties of single fracture however under the coupling effect of fracture geometric attributes and the inertial effect of fracture flow the relationship between the β and eh followed a negative power law compared with previous studies it was proved that the influence of geometric attributes on the non darcy coefficient was the dominant factor and directly controlled the form of a quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient based on the dimensionless analysis the quantization model of the non darcy coefficient under the coupling effect was obtained based on the improved non darcy coefficient quantitative model a new critical reynolds number prediction model was obtained and its effectiveness was proved the new critical reynolds number model considering the coupling effect of fracture geometric properties and fluid inertial effect could well predict the critical reynolds number rec of rough single fractures the critical reynolds number of low roughness fracture rsd 0 35 was overestimated by the crn model proposed by other researchers the inertial dependence of the non darcy flow coefficient was firstly revealed through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and the influence of the inertial effect on the non darcy flow coefficient was quantified by the relationship between the non darcy coefficient and hydraulic aperture a new critical reynolds number prediction model crn model was obtained based on the improved quantitative model of the non darcy coefficient which considering the inertial effect however it should be noted that in this study the aperture range of rough single fractures was between 0 7 and 3 0 mm which might limit the application range of the non darcy coefficient quantitative model or critical reynolds number model quinn et al 2020 moreover in section 2 we mentioned that the quantification of geometric attributes 3d real single fracture is also the focus of expanding the above quantification model of non darcy coefficient how to find the parameters that can truly represent the geometric properties not the average value of 3d real single fracture is much important thus the application of these models will be further expanded in future

3871,subsurface dam is a technically feasible and widely used solution to prevent seawater intrusion swi in coastal areas the effectiveness of subsurface dams and the related environmental problems have been individually established although static oceanic conditions are usually considered in this study sea boundary conditions including static and tidal scenarios were compared to comprehensively assess subsurface dams for swi control and upstream groundwater pollution thus extending previous findings the index of fresh groundwater discharge was used as a proxy to assess the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed to analyze the effects of dam height location and dispersivity the results revealed that the effectiveness of subsurface dams could be described through a so called effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on dam location showing properties within the e idhr subsurface dams could not only effectively prevent the invasive saltwater but also increase the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction tidal fluctuation significantly altered the e idhr and the lower and upper thresholds of the e idhr were lower than those of the no tide cases the lower threshold was the minimum effective height which was close to the saltwater wedge sw height determined by 95 isohaline 95 sw height for the no tide cases and the 20 sw height for the tide cases this difference was attributed to intensive salt freshwater mixing driven by tides the upper threshold of the e idhr was usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height acknowledging the e idhr applied studies may benefit from numerical and parametric uncertainties

e idhr effective and increased discharge dam height range 1 introduction it has been reported that around 80 of the world s population face severe water security problems including water scarcity and water pollution vörösmarty et al 2010 a large number of people live in coastal areas neumann et al 2015 and hence fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is overexploited and the water table is gradually decreasing thus coastal aquifers are generally subjected to different extents of seawater intrusion swi the landward movement of seawater werner et al 2013 swi leads to the salinization of fresh groundwater and dramatically reduces the availability of water supply lu et al 2019 tang et al 2021a 2021b yan et al 2021 in addition it can cause soil salinization thus reducing agricultural yield chang et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of swi and the ability to effectively prevent the salinization of fresh groundwater are essential for the improvement of the planning development and management of water resources in coastal areas many coastal countries including china japan india the middle east and some african countries have built a series of subsurface physical barriers to prevent and control invasive seawater into coastal aquifers since the 1980s nawa and miyazaki 2009 senthilkumar and elango 2011 stevanović 2015 for example approximately seven subsurface barriers were specifically constructed in japan to store and control groundwater for consistent extraction without causing swi luyun et al 2009 in 1988 the u s army corps of engineers designed and built temporary underground barriers in new orleans which limited upstream swi from the gulf of mexico mcanally and pritchard 1997 since 1990 water conservancy agencies have constructed six subsurface barriers in the cities of longkou qingdao yantai laizhou and rizhao in shandong province china to prevent seawater moving landward into coastal aquifers kang and xu 2017 zeng et al 2018 fang et al 2020 kang et al 2021 it is approved that subsurface barrier is a technically feasible and effective solution to prevent swi considering the different structures subsurface physical barriers can be divided into three types including fully penetrating barrier cutoff wall and subsurface dam armanuos et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2020 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 at present subsurface dams are the most widely used technology in practical engineering which contains an impermeable barrier constructed on the base of an aquifer with an opening above the barrier crest for upstream groundwater discharge chang et al 2020 studies over the past decade have provided critical information about the effects of subsurface dams on groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers luyun et al 2009 chang et al 2019 senthilkumar and elango 2011 revealed that groundwater levels in the range of 1 5 2 km upstream rose by 0 1 0 3 m while the downstream groundwater levels were reduced by 0 1 0 2 m after the construction of a subsurface dam in the palar river basin in india luyun et al 2009 numerically and experimentally investigated the relationship between the height of subsurface dams and their resistance efficiency against swi they found that dam heights were greater than the height of saltwater wedge prior to dam construction and thus swi was successfully prevented at the dam location while takahashi et al 2012 observed that swi could also be prevented when dam heights were equal to the height of saltwater wedge determined by the 50 isohaline at the dam location chang et al 2019 proposed and used subsurface dams with the minimum effective height to control swi the minimum effective height can be slightly lower than the height of saltwater wedge at the dam location in addition a growing attention has been paid to the environmental problems caused by subsurface dams zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a the presence of subsurface dams hinders the hydraulic links between upstream and downstream of coastal aquifers residual saltwater will be trapped in the upstream aquifer for decades zheng et al 2021 affecting the availability of fresh groundwater the natural removal of residual saltwater is associated with the height and location of subsurface dam luyun et al 2009 and zheng et al 2021 revealed an increasing time for natural purification as the dam height increased besides residual saltwater subsurface dams can also result in the accumulation of pollutants in the upstream aquifer kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 a field study by kang and xu 2017 demonstrated that nitrate concentration 9 92 mg l in the upstream aquifer was much greater than that in the downstream 0 76 mg l sun et al 2019 found that nitrate contaminated areas increased with the increasing height of subsurface dam therefore the design of subsurface dam should not only meet the requirements of swi control but also consider reducing its negative environmental impact in essence the environmental problems caused by subsurface dams are closely related to the discharge of fresh groundwater after dam construction the upstream water table rises and the degree of the rise decreases gradually with the increased distance from the dam location for coastal aquifers with a fixed water level at the inland boundary this rise can reduce the horizontal hydraulic gradient in the upstream aquifer meanwhile the discharge tubes of fresh groundwater are squeezed above the dam crest and the width is smaller than that with no dam condition these eventually lead to a reduction in fresh groundwater discharge which reduces the decontamination capacity of coastal aquifers sun et al 2019 observed that the average flow velocity of upstream groundwater decreased after dam construction and the load of nitrate discharged into the ocean decreased gao et al 2021 and zheng et al 2021 found that increasing the hydraulic gradient would speed up the process of purifying the residual saltwater therefore fresh groundwater discharge is an important index for the design of subsurface dams although previous studies have revealed the effectiveness of subsurface dams and the related problems they predominantly simplified the sea boundary as a static condition neglecting oceanic watertable oscillations driven by tides in fact tides are a common natural phenomenon in coastal environments robinson et al 2018 shen et al 2020 santos et al 2021 under tidal influence the groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers are significantly different from those in the static scenario robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2012 kuan et al 2019 tidal fluctuations generate a saltwater cycle termed as upper saline plume usp in the upper part of aquifer and force the lower saltwater wedge sw to retreat seaward relatively to no tide condition yu et al 2017 shen et al 2019 yu et al 2019 fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b tidal oscillations propagate in coastal aquifers with an attenuated signal and induce the nonlinear fluctuations of inland water table leading to the overheight phenomenon of water table nielsen 1990 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 kuan et al 2012 water table overheight reduces the hydraulic gradient of aquifers thereby reducing the rate of fresh groundwater discharge robinson et al 2007b so far the influence of tides on the subsurface dam efficiency for swi control remains unclear under the tidal condition the effective heights of subsurface dam and the changes in fresh groundwater discharge have not been evaluated the comprehensive assessment of subsurface dams for swi control and upstream groundwater pollution is still lacking to clarify these issues we conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the combined effects of tides and subsurface dams on the groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal aquifers meanwhile the environmental impact associated with subsurface dams was also assessed using the index of fresh groundwater discharge groundwater dynamics in the no tide and no dam regimes were examined as references the results of these experiments and simulations provide decisive guidance for the design of subsurface dams aimed at both swi control and avoiding groundwater pollution 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments subsurface dam experiments were conducted in a well controlled sand tank fig 1 which had previously been tested and successfully used to simulate groundwater behavior in coastal aquifers affected by tide fang et al 2021 the tank dimensions were 172 9 cm length 45 cm height 8 cm width representing a quasi two dimensional profile of an unconfined aquifer the sand tank was constructed using a glass of 1 5 cm thickness and two porous partitions divided the tank into three chambers in the horizontal length direction the middle chamber was filled with white quartz sand that was carefully filled in the tank under fully saturated conditions to avoid trapping air bubble on the left of the porous medium a beach surface with a slope of 1 2 5 was constructed the sieved quartz sand had a relatively uniform particle size d 50 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 and the porosity was measured to be 0 4 table s1 in the supplementary material the average hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were determined using one dimensional column experiments as 2 8 10 3 m s and 0 001 m respectively chang et al 2019 soil saturation and pressure were also measured along a drying curve and the measured data were used to fit the van genuchten curve a typical water retention curve van genuchten 1980 the residual water saturation was 0 025 and the van genuchten constants a and n were 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 respectively the left and right of the middle chamber were the saltwater chamber and the freshwater chamber respectively the water level in the saltwater chamber was controlled by a tidal generating device which consists of a variable height overflow column and saltwater reservoir saltwater reservoir was used to pump saltwater into and out of the saltwater chamber via the variable height overflow column cartwright et al 2003 cartwright et al 2004 variable height overflow column possessed a good connectivity with the saltwater chamber for the same water level changes fig 1a periodic fluctuations in the variable height overflow column delivered water level changes in the saltwater chamber as follows 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the transient sea level l at time t t h msl is the mean sea level l 23 8 cm high from the base of sand tank a is the tidal amplitude l preset to 2 cm and t is the tidal period t preset to 1 min for the no tide condition the tidal device was switched off and the sea level was fixed at the mean sea level h msl by an overflow outlet artificial seawater was prepared by mixing sodium chloride nacl ar grade 34 g red food dye sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 1 g and deionized water 1 l food dyes are often used to trace the movement of seawater in a sand tank and previous studies have confirmed their effectiveness goswami and clement 2007 nguyen et al 2020 the salinity and density of seawater were measured as 35 and 1025 g l respectively an electrical conductivity meter hq40d portable ec meter hach inc measured the salinity in saltwater chamber every 5 min additional seawater with a high salinity 70 g l was pumped into the saltwater chamber to counteract to the dilution effect of fresh groundwater discharge and retain a uniform seawater salinity of 35 g l the pumped flux was adjusted following the results of salinity monitoring via the electrical conductivity meter the freshwater chamber represented an inland boundary with a fixed water level which was acquired by pumping freshwater into the right chamber that flowed out of the upper overflow the overflow outlet was located 24 5 cm from the bottom of sand tank and the head difference between the landward and seaward boundaries was 0 7 cm freshwater was prepared using deionized water with a salinity of 0 g l and density of 1000 g l in this study the coordinate origin was located at the intersection between the msl and the aquifer beach the subsurface dam was made of a polystyrene hard sheet a material impermeable to water we designed two slots at x 19 5 and 40 cm and the subsurface dam could be inserted into the slots allowing the design of different scenarios each slot consisted of two porous partitions and rubber strips the porous partition can separate quartz sand and the rubber strip acts as a buffer and seal for subsurface dam experiments the way of inserting a subsurface dam can avoid changes in the porous medium structure and hydrological parameters caused by traditional rebuilding and refilling two sets of four scenarios including six experiments were carried out in the sand tank table 1 for the one set subsurface dams were not considered and swi was examined under the no tide and tide regimes scenarios notide nodam and tide nodam cases notide nodam and tide nodam were the base cases for the next investigation the other set incorporated a subsurface dam under the no tide and tide regimes scenarios notide dam and tide dam for the experiments the subsurface dam was first located at x 19 5 cm and the height was preset to 13 03 cm the two cases under the scenarios notide dam and tide dam were compared in order to illustrate the effect of tide on the efficiency of subsurface dam then the height of subsurface dam was lowered to 8 76 cm while the location was set to x 19 5 and 40 cm thus examining the influence of subsurface dam location under the scenario tide dam the experiment continued to operate for 20 36 h so that salinity distribution in the sand tank reached a steady state we defined the steady state such that the difference of the salinity movement between two images over a 2 h period was lower than 0 1 cm throughout the experiment a high pixel camera canon ixus 285 hs took images every 30 min to record the swi process 2 2 numerical simulations previous experimental evidence suggests that dyes are not able to accurately capture the extent of the dispersion zone between seawater and freshwater kuan et al 2012 kuan et al 2019 lu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 a narrower range of dispersion zone is usually observed in laboratory experiments than in numerical simulations fang et al 2021 in order to quantify the dispersion zone and groundwater flux a series of numerical simulations were performed with feflow diersch 2014 feflow is widely used to simulate the swi process in coastal aquifers including the no tide and tide regimes sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 fang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 the richards equation eq 2 was coupled with the advection diffusion equation eq 3 to govern the variably saturated and variable density groundwater flow and solute transport

preconditioned and post conditioned bicgstab were used to solve the linear matrix and nonlinear matrix respectively with a tolerance of 1 10 8 table s1 the setup of the numerical model was consistent with the experiment including the dimension of the domain hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions fig 2 the homogeneous isotropic domain was discretized into 90 119 triangular elements with a maximum length of element sides of 0 4 cm the mesh peclet number was calculated to be less than 4 which meets the requirements for numerical stability voss and provost 2002 the thickness of the subsurface dam was set to 1 cm and the elements occupied by the subsurface dam were set to be inactive the top and bottom boundaries of the model were set as no flow conditions for flow and mass transport the freshwater boundary on the right was set to a fixed head of 0 7 cm 24 5 cm from aquifer base and solute concentration of 0 g l the left seawater boundary was set as follows 1 for the no tide conditions a head specified boundary was set to the seawater level of 0 cm 2 for the tide conditions a tidal boundary was applied when the boundary nodes were saturated and located above the seawater level these nodes were set to a seepage face xin et al 2010 the nodes below the seawater level were treated as a head specified boundary that varied with the tide stage and seawater depth the seawater concentration was set to 35 g l if seawater permeated the aquifer more detail about the seawater boundary setup and application in feflow can be found in text s1 and figure s1 in the supplementary material after the validation of the numerical model by experimental cases a series of testing cases including scenarios notide dam and tide dam with various subsurface dam heights and locations were conducted in the first trial to examine their effect on swi control and fresh groundwater discharge the dam locations were set at five positions x 9 25 19 5 29 75 40 and 50 25 cm for all five dam locations the dam heights were varied six times depending on the height of the sw at the dam locations in the base cases table s2 tidal fluctuations enhance the mixing of seawater and freshwater and generate a wide dispersion zone compared to the no tide conditions robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2019 our observations demonstrated that the width of dispersion zone had an important effect on the effective heights of subsurface dam so the next trial investigated the influence of seawater and freshwater mixing on the effective heights the longitudinal dispersivity a l was set to 0 005 0 001 and 0 0001 m and the transverse dispersivity a t was 1 10 a l accordingly the dam heights were varied four times according to the sw height prior to dam construction at x 19 5 cm table s3 two intel i7 9700 3 0 ghz processors were used to perform the simulation work with model run times ranging from 6 h i e for the case notide dam to approximately 9 days i e for the case tide nodam 3 results 3 1 steady state salinity distribution 3 1 1 experimental results steady state color images captured from the sand tank are shown in fig 3 for scenarios notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam a clear boundary was observed between the red colored saltwater and freshwater fig 3a shows the salinity distribution in the base case of notide nodam with a static sea level swi induced a saltwater wedge sw at the lower end of the aquifer the sw heights decreased as it approached the inland traditionally the distance from the sw toe location to the sea boundary is defined as the distance of swi zheng et al 2021 the swi distance was 109 cm in case notide nodam the extent of swi in the base case of tide nodam is presented in fig 3b tidal fluctuations induced a usp in the upper partially saturated part of the aquifer and the sw retreated more seaward in comparison to case notide nodam the swi distance was 73 cm in case tide nodam these results were consistent with those of kuan et al 2012 who found that saltwater circulation in the usp increased the discharge of groundwater into the ocean thus inhibiting the invasion of seawater figs 3c and 3d compare the extent of swi after the construction of a subsurface dam under scenarios notide dam and tide dam respectively the dam location was set to x 19 5 cm and the height was 13 03 cm that was exactly equal to the height of the sw at the dam location in case notide nodam the subsurface dam effectively prevented intrusive seawater and the swi distance was controlled at the dam location in scenario notide dam the height of the sw at the dam location was close to the dam height while the sw height 8 cm was lower than the dam height in scenario tide dam these results were in line with the aforementioned observation base cases i e tidal activity reduces the extent of swi fig 4 shows results under scenario tide dam where the effects of different dam locations are compared the height of subsurface dam was fixed at 8 76 cm in fig 4a the intrusive seawater was intercepted at the dam location with an sw height of 6 5 cm moving the subsurface dam further inland the swi distance again was controlled at the dam location fig 4b the sw height 3 8 cm was much smaller than the dam height compared to that in fig 4a this demonstrated that subsurface dam with the same height provided more security for swi control as the dam distance from the sea boundary increased 3 1 2 simulated results the salinity distribution in the numerical model is also shown in figs 3 and 4 the dashed white lines solid white lines and dash dotted white lines represented the 5 50 and 95 isohalines respectively traditionally 50 isohalines were used to determine the saltwater freshwater interface kuan et al 2012 the results obtained with the simulated 50 isohalines were basically consistent with the experimental results for scenarios notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam these results confirmed a successful calibration and the reliability of the numerical model compared to numerical simulations the experimental results showed a narrower extension of the salt freshwater dispersion zone which was also observed in previous experimental studies kuan et al 2019 yu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 fang et al 2021 the dye tracking method failed to capture the extension of the dispersion zone during the experiments because of the lack of high resolution images to clearly distinguish the saltwater salinity by the dye shade robinson et al 2016 fang et al 2021 mo et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the width of the dispersion zone in the tidal cases was greater than that in the no tide cases which indicated that tide enhanced the mixing of saltwater and freshwater in order to connect the lab results to field scale implications we used dimensionless parameters h and x to define the dam height and location in the following respectively h represents the ratio of the dam height h to the aquifer thickness of 23 8 cm x indicates the ratio of the dam location x to the aquifer length of 133 4 cm the measurements of aquifer length and thickness were based on the intersection between the msl and the aquifer beach after validation the numerical model was used to examine the effect of subsurface dam heights on swi control under scenarios notide dam and tide dam the dam location was fixed at x 0 146 and the heights were varied six times table 2 provides the detail about the dam heights and its introduction for the scenario notide dam the effect of subsurface dams with different heights on swi prevention is shown in fig 5 i e figs 5a 5f for the salinity and flow fields and figs 5g 5l for the magnitude of flow velocity the dam heights greater than 0 474 could effectively stem the invasion of saltwater and below that height saltwater flowed over the dam and continued to invade landward thus the height of 0 474 was the minimum effective height of subsurface dam which was equal to the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 95 isohalines in the base case of notide nodam hereinafter termed as 95 sw height the high flow velocity above the dam crest allowed the washing of partially invasive saltwater and thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam could be less than the 5 sw height and also effectively control the swi fig 6 compares the results of salt freshwater interfaces in fig 5 using the 50 isohalines at the dam position the height of the sw under the minimum effective dam height was the smallest when the dam heights were greater than the minimum effective height the downstream sw rose obviously as the dam height increased under the scenario tide dam the effect of subsurface dams with different heights on swi prevention is shown in fig 7 subsurface dams with a height of more than 0 368 could effectively control swi the minimum effective height was 0 368 which was equal to the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 20 isohalines in the base case of tide nodam hereinafter termed as 20 sw height the dam height of 0 269 corresponding to the 50 sw height in case tide nodam allowed low salinity saltwater less than 17 5 g l to flow over the dam crest and invade inland the minimum effective height reduced compared with that in scenario notide dam however the ratio of the minimum effective height to the corresponding 5 sw height in base case increased i e 77 7 for the tide condition and 75 5 for the no tide condition and the next paragraph analyzed the reasons fig 8 compares the results of salt freshwater interfaces in fig 7 using the 50 isohalines when the dam heights were lower than the minimum effective height the salt freshwater interfaces in the downstream were almost unchanged when the dam heights were greater than the minimum effective height the downstream sw rose obviously and the usp contracted in the intertidal zone as the dam heights increased under the scenario tide dam with the minimum effective height 0 368 the salinity distribution and groundwater flow fields at ebbing high tide mean tide and low tide are shown in fig 9 at high tide the flow direction of downstream groundwater was landward and seawater penetrated into the aquifer thus the 5 isohaline went over the subsurface dam at low tide the hydraulic gradient drove groundwater discharge seawater flowed out of the aquifer and the hotspot of groundwater velocity existed above the dam crest removing the invasive saltwater so the 5 isohaline retreated to the dam position at low tide with this cyclical fluctuation seawater was eventually intercepted at the dam location the width of dispersion zone was large under the tidal effect but the area affected by freshwater washing above the dam crest was limited thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam needed to be increased to the 20 sw height so that the invasive saltwater can be controlled while the width of dispersion zone was thin in the no tide situation and with the aid of freshwater flushing above the dam crest the minimum effective height only needed to reach the 95 sw height these findings suggested that salt freshwater mixing in coastal aquifers played a critical role influencing the minimum effective height of subsurface dams 3 2 effective dam heights and fresh groundwater discharge 3 2 1 cases under no tide and dam condition for the scenario notide dam the swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge after the construction of subsurface dams with different heights are summarized in fig 10 setups of different dam heights were divided into the effective dam height range edr and the failed dam height range fdr depending on whether they succeeded in stemming the seawater fresh groundwater discharge was calculated by quantifying the freshwater influx from the inland boundary at the steady state the value was 0 215 m3 d m in the base case of notide nodam also understood as the dam height of 0 in the fdr fresh groundwater discharge increased with dam heights contrary in the edr a decrease in fresh groundwater discharge was recorded with increasing dam heights fresh groundwater discharge peaked at the minimum effective height as mentioned in the literature review increasing fresh groundwater discharge is beneficial to reduce the contamination of upstream groundwater including nitrate accumulation and residual saltwater sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 those heights of dams where fresh groundwater discharge was greater than the value of case notide nodam demarcated the increased discharge dam height range idhr the intersection of edr and idhr formed an effective and increased discharge dam height range e idhr see also fig 10 which is the optimal range of dam height for the design of subsurface dams aimed at swi control and avoiding inland groundwater pollution the lower threshold of the e idhr was the minimum effective height as shown in fig 10 the height of 0 750 was close to the upper threshold of the e idhr which was 120 of the 5 sw height the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case notide nodam under the scenario notide dam the water table of the aquifer after the construction of subsurface dams with different heights is shown in fig 11 as the dam height increased upstream groundwater level rose and downstream groundwater level fell thus the hydraulic gradient in the upstream decreased with an increase in dam height for example following an increased dam height from 0 547 0 750 and 1 000 the upstream hydraulic gradient decreased from 0 28 to 0 25 and 0 20 respectively however when the dam height was less than the minimum effective height the water table was practically unchanged the upstream hydraulic gradient was the largest when the dam height was less than or equal to the minimum effective height as observed in figs 5 and 6 the height of the sw was the smallest under the minimum effective dam height in other words the width of the freshwater discharge tube above the dam crest was the largest these factors eventually gave rise to the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height in addition figs 5i 5k reveal a large area of high flow velocity larger than 0 8 m d in the upstream when the dam heights were within the e idhr however for dam heights in the non e idhr the area of the high flow velocity was relatively small figs 5g 5h and 5l this might explain the increased fresh groundwater discharge for the dam heights within the e idhr 3 2 2 cases under tide and dam condition fig 12 presents the swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge under the combined effect of tide and subsurface dams with different heights similar to the scenario notide dam different setups heights of dams could be divided into edr fdr idhr and e idhr before the construction of a dam fresh groundwater discharge was 0 163 m3 d m in the base case of tide nodam which is lower than 0 215 m3 d m in case notide nodam this result was due to the overheight phenomenon of the water table caused by tidal oscillations nielsen 1990 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 kuan et al 2012 thereby at the same height of a dam fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime was always lower than that in the no tide regime compared with the e idhr in scenario notide dam fig 10 tidal vibration caused the overall left low height movement of the e idhr fig 12 the lower threshold minimum effective height was reduced to 0 368 and the upper threshold was close to 0 547 that was equal to 116 of the 5 sw height the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case tide nodam 3 3 influence of subsurface dam location in this section we examined the effect of subsurface dam location on the efficiency of swi control and fresh groundwater discharge under tidal condition for the first trial the dam location was changed to x 0 3 and the results of swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge at different dam heights are summarized in fig 13 the minimum effective height was 0 193 which was equal to the 20 sw height the dam height of 0 118 was equal to the 50 sw height but it did not successfully block the invasive saltwater less than 17 5 g l saltwater flowed over the dam crest and invaded inland these results were similar to that of the dam location fixed at x 0 146 and it was confirmed that the effective height of subsurface dam needed to be greater than the 20 sw height therefore the 20 sw interface in the base case of tide nodam was a critical line that determines the minimum effective heights of subsurface dams at different locations for the scenario tide dam as shown in fig 13 the upper threshold of the e idhr was close to 0 28 which was equal to 105 of the 5 sw height the height at x 0 3 of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case tide nodam compared with the e idhr at x 0 146 fig 12 the upper and lower thresholds of the e idhr in fig 13 decreased and the interval length also reduced i e 0 179 for the dam fixed at x 0 146 and 0 087 for the dam fixed at x 0 3 these results revealed that both the dam heights within the e idhr and the interval length of the e idhr decreased as the distance from the dam location to the sea boundary increased for the second trial fresh groundwater discharge under the different locations x and heights h of subsurface dams in scenario tide dam are presented in fig 14 the horizontal semi transparent plane indicated the amount of fresh groundwater discharge in the base case of tide nodam the intersection of the plane and the colored surface determined the idhr and the front intersection was the upper threshold of the e idhr at each dam location the peaks of fresh groundwater discharge exposed the trace of the minimum effective dam height the range determined by the front intersection and the series peaks in the horizontal plane x h was the e idhr at each dam location that is to say at each location the subsurface dam has a different optimal height range e idhr for swi control and the enlargement of fresh groundwater discharge fig 14 also reveals that the interval length of the e idhr decreases as the dam location moves landward in addition a marked decline in the maximum fresh groundwater discharge was recorded in fig 14 with an increasing distance from the dam location to the sea boundary the maximum fresh groundwater discharge was close to 0 163 m3 d m the rate in the base case of tide nodam when the dam was located at x 0 377 3 4 influence of dispersivity in section 3 1 2 we compared the relationship between the minimum effective dam height and the sw height in the base cases and deduced the contribution of salt freshwater mixing to them tide enhanced the mixing of seawater and freshwater and enlarged the mixing area thus we assumed that the influence of salt freshwater mixing may be decisive for effective dam height under tidal condition fig 15 shows the efficiency of subsurface dam for swi control under different dispersion parameters the dam heights h were set to the 50 sw height 20 sw height and 5 sw height according to the results of the no dam condition h 0 note that the 50 20 and 5 sw heights of subsurface dams were different under different dispersivity values as expected increasing the dispersivity enhanced the salt freshwater mixing resulting in a wider dispersion zone in fig 15 the dam height needed to be increased to the 5 sw height so that the invasive seawater can be prevented under the condition with a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 005 m the minimum effective dam height was equal to the 20 sw height under the longitudinal dispersivity of 0 001 m with a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 0001 m the dam height only needed to reach the 50 sw height for swi control increasing the dispersivity led to an increase of the ratio of the minimum effective dam height to the sw height in other words with the increase in dispersion subsurface dams should increase the ratio of the dam height to the sw height prior to dam construction to control the invasive seawater these findings confirmed the important effect of salt freshwater mixing on the minimum effective height especially under tidal condition 3 5 field scale numerical simulations to generalize our findings some field scale simulations were conducted in a 2d cross shore profile of an unconfined aquifer with a length of 300 m and depth of 30 m the correlation between the laboratory scale and field scale models was regulated by a dimensionless scale factor λ which governs the groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers robinson et al 2007b mo et al 2021 6 λ ω ε h at 2 k where ε is the porosity ω is the tidal angular frequency t 1 hat is the aquifer thickness l k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 the parameters table s1 and dimensions figure s2 of the field scale model were based on previous field work of xin et al 2010 and zheng et al 2021 the key scale factor was calculated to be 1 33 for laboratory scale and 1 39 for field scale within the range of real world coastal aquifers similar to the definition of laboratory scale cases fig 16 shows the field scale salinity distribution in cases notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam the minimum effective dam height was used with a height of 13 25 m for case notide dam and 12 73 m for case tide dam overall the results of the field scale simulations agreed with those from our laboratory scale studies prior to dam construction fresh groundwater discharge was 0 841 m3 d m in case notide nodam and 0 739 m3 d m in case tide nodam however after the construction of subsurface dam with the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge increased to 0 978 m3 d m in case notide dam and 0 785 m3 d m in case tide dam these results indicated that subsurface dams in field scale aquifers also possessed an effective and increased discharge height range regardless of the no tide and tide regimes as shown in fig 16 the minimum effective dam height was equal to the 85 sw height under no tide condition and the 15 sw height under tide condition the relationship between the minimum effective dam height and the sw height was close to that obtained from the laboratory scale work although a slight difference arose due to the intensive salt freshwater mixing as expected in field scale aquifers 4 discussion the design of subsurface dam relies on the accurate depictions of the extent of swi previous studies related to subsurface dams usually simplified the sea boundary as a static condition neglecting sea level oscillations driven by tides luyun et al 2009 senthilkumar and elango 2011 chang et al 2019 however the swi extent is different for the no tide and tide regimes as shown in fig 3 tidal vibration led to an overall retreat of saltwater wedge and the extent of swi decreased compared with that observed in the no tide condition thus subsurface dams only required a lower minimum effective height to block the intrusive saltwater therefore ignoring tidal forces will overestimate the swi distance and extent in coastal aquifers thereby leading engineers to designing too large heights of subsurface dams and increasing construction costs after the construction of subsurface dams the related environmental problems including residual saltwater and pollutant accumulation have gradually received attention kang and xu 2017 sun et al 2019 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the design of a subsurface dam should not only meet the requirements of controlling swi but also consider reducing the contamination of upstream groundwater fresh groundwater discharge is closely related to the decontamination capacity of an aquifer sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 therefore the present study also considered fresh groundwater discharge as an important index for the design of subsurface dams the results in figs 12 14 revealed that a subsurface dam possessed an effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on the dam location with the dam heights within this range the subsurface dam not only effectively prevented the invasive saltwater but also increased the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction thereby this range is the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed to concurrently control swi and avoid inland groundwater pollution which is of great significance for the protection of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers the optimal range of dam heights is different for the no tide and tide regimes tidal vibration decreases the lower and upper thresholds of the range in comparison with the no tide conditions moreover for the dam heights within this range fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime is lower than that in the no tide regime as earlier mentioned fresh groundwater discharge is crucial for upstream groundwater contamination sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 thus the upstream aquifer is subjected to more serious challenges of groundwater pollution under the combined effect of tide and subsurface dam these findings highlight the importance of sea boundary conditions and suggest that the future design of subsurface dams should take into account tidal fluctuations the lower threshold of the optimal range is the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge peaks at this dam height chang et al 2019 the upper threshold of the optimal range is usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines prior to dam construction as the dam location moves landward both the dam heights within the optimal range and the interval length of the optimal range decreases also the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height decreases these findings provide an important reference when choosing the location of the subsurface dam if the location is close to the sea boundary the minimum effective dam height rises thus increasing construction costs however the protected area of upstream groundwater resource increases and an increased discharge of fresh groundwater reduces the contamination of upstream groundwater the related benefits are the opposite if the dam location is located further inland salt freshwater mixing has a significant impact on the minimum effective dam height as shown in fig 5 the minimum effective height was equal to the 95 sw height under the no tide condition tide enhances the mixing of seawater and freshwater resulting in a larger dispersion zone robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2012 shen et al 2020 thus the minimum effective height increases to the 20 sw height under tidal activity fig 7 with an increase in the dispersivity the ratio of the minimum effective dam height to the sw height also increases fig 15 these findings confirm the critical effect of salt freshwater mixing and suggest again that tidal fluctuations should be carefully considered in the design of subsurface dams in real world aquifers the dispersivity is typically dependent on the scale and field scale dispersivity parameters are several orders of magnitude greater than laboratory scale values for the same materials because of natural heterogeneities gelhar et al 1992 robinson et al 2007b thus intensive salt freshwater mixing occurs in real world aquifers therefore increased caution should be exercised in the design of field scale subsurface dams 5 conclusions this study conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the combined effect of tides and subsurface dams on groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal aquifers meanwhile the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams were also assessed using the index of fresh groundwater discharge the key new findings are summarized in the following paragraph tide inhibited the intrusion of seawater thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam could be reduced compared to that in the no tide condition however the ratio of the minimum effective height to the corresponding sw height increased i e 77 7 for the tide condition and 75 5 for the no tide condition owing to the stronger salt freshwater mixing as a result of tidal activity the minimum effective height was close to the 95 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 95 isohalines prior to dam construction in the no tide condition and the 20 sw height in the tide condition fresh groundwater discharge peaked in the minimum effective height subsurface dams possessed an effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on dam location within this range subsurface dams not only effectively prevented the invasive saltwater but also enlarged the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction thereby the e idhr was considered to be the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed at the prevention of swi and upstream groundwater pollution tidal vibration altered the optimal range and the lower and upper thresholds of the optimal range were decreased compared to the no tide condition the lower threshold was the minimum effective height the upper threshold was usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines prior to dam construction as the dam location moved landward both the dam heights within the optimal range and the interval length of the optimal range decreased further the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height decreased for the dam heights within the optimal range fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime was lower than that in the no tide regime there was a positive correlation between the intensity of salt freshwater mixing and the ratio of the minimum effective height to the sw height this ratio increased as dispersivity increased notwithstanding the above findings the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams are indirectly measured in this study using the index of fresh groundwater discharge which may behave differently for the direct quantification furthermore the complexity of coastal aquifers such as heterogeneity anisotropy beach morphology inland water table variations multi component tidal signals waves and other temporal and spatial variations are neglected while these factors are known to affect the swi process future studies are required to investigate the complexity of coastal aquifers and the direct influence of tides and subsurface dams on the accumulation of terrestrial pollutants and desalinization of residual saltwater nevertheless this study provides a useful assessment of the effectiveness of subsurface dams in coastal aquifers affected by tide and proposes the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed at swi control and avoiding groundwater pollution the critical findings have been well verified via the laboratory experiments and field scale numerical simulations therefore the findings can provide a general framework that can be used to guide the optimization of subsurface dam structure for practical problems it is necessary to add more realistic features

3871,subsurface dam is a technically feasible and widely used solution to prevent seawater intrusion swi in coastal areas the effectiveness of subsurface dams and the related environmental problems have been individually established although static oceanic conditions are usually considered in this study sea boundary conditions including static and tidal scenarios were compared to comprehensively assess subsurface dams for swi control and upstream groundwater pollution thus extending previous findings the index of fresh groundwater discharge was used as a proxy to assess the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed to analyze the effects of dam height location and dispersivity the results revealed that the effectiveness of subsurface dams could be described through a so called effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on dam location showing properties within the e idhr subsurface dams could not only effectively prevent the invasive saltwater but also increase the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction tidal fluctuation significantly altered the e idhr and the lower and upper thresholds of the e idhr were lower than those of the no tide cases the lower threshold was the minimum effective height which was close to the saltwater wedge sw height determined by 95 isohaline 95 sw height for the no tide cases and the 20 sw height for the tide cases this difference was attributed to intensive salt freshwater mixing driven by tides the upper threshold of the e idhr was usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height acknowledging the e idhr applied studies may benefit from numerical and parametric uncertainties

e idhr effective and increased discharge dam height range 1 introduction it has been reported that around 80 of the world s population face severe water security problems including water scarcity and water pollution vörösmarty et al 2010 a large number of people live in coastal areas neumann et al 2015 and hence fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is overexploited and the water table is gradually decreasing thus coastal aquifers are generally subjected to different extents of seawater intrusion swi the landward movement of seawater werner et al 2013 swi leads to the salinization of fresh groundwater and dramatically reduces the availability of water supply lu et al 2019 tang et al 2021a 2021b yan et al 2021 in addition it can cause soil salinization thus reducing agricultural yield chang et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of swi and the ability to effectively prevent the salinization of fresh groundwater are essential for the improvement of the planning development and management of water resources in coastal areas many coastal countries including china japan india the middle east and some african countries have built a series of subsurface physical barriers to prevent and control invasive seawater into coastal aquifers since the 1980s nawa and miyazaki 2009 senthilkumar and elango 2011 stevanović 2015 for example approximately seven subsurface barriers were specifically constructed in japan to store and control groundwater for consistent extraction without causing swi luyun et al 2009 in 1988 the u s army corps of engineers designed and built temporary underground barriers in new orleans which limited upstream swi from the gulf of mexico mcanally and pritchard 1997 since 1990 water conservancy agencies have constructed six subsurface barriers in the cities of longkou qingdao yantai laizhou and rizhao in shandong province china to prevent seawater moving landward into coastal aquifers kang and xu 2017 zeng et al 2018 fang et al 2020 kang et al 2021 it is approved that subsurface barrier is a technically feasible and effective solution to prevent swi considering the different structures subsurface physical barriers can be divided into three types including fully penetrating barrier cutoff wall and subsurface dam armanuos et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2020 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 at present subsurface dams are the most widely used technology in practical engineering which contains an impermeable barrier constructed on the base of an aquifer with an opening above the barrier crest for upstream groundwater discharge chang et al 2020 studies over the past decade have provided critical information about the effects of subsurface dams on groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers luyun et al 2009 chang et al 2019 senthilkumar and elango 2011 revealed that groundwater levels in the range of 1 5 2 km upstream rose by 0 1 0 3 m while the downstream groundwater levels were reduced by 0 1 0 2 m after the construction of a subsurface dam in the palar river basin in india luyun et al 2009 numerically and experimentally investigated the relationship between the height of subsurface dams and their resistance efficiency against swi they found that dam heights were greater than the height of saltwater wedge prior to dam construction and thus swi was successfully prevented at the dam location while takahashi et al 2012 observed that swi could also be prevented when dam heights were equal to the height of saltwater wedge determined by the 50 isohaline at the dam location chang et al 2019 proposed and used subsurface dams with the minimum effective height to control swi the minimum effective height can be slightly lower than the height of saltwater wedge at the dam location in addition a growing attention has been paid to the environmental problems caused by subsurface dams zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a the presence of subsurface dams hinders the hydraulic links between upstream and downstream of coastal aquifers residual saltwater will be trapped in the upstream aquifer for decades zheng et al 2021 affecting the availability of fresh groundwater the natural removal of residual saltwater is associated with the height and location of subsurface dam luyun et al 2009 and zheng et al 2021 revealed an increasing time for natural purification as the dam height increased besides residual saltwater subsurface dams can also result in the accumulation of pollutants in the upstream aquifer kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 a field study by kang and xu 2017 demonstrated that nitrate concentration 9 92 mg l in the upstream aquifer was much greater than that in the downstream 0 76 mg l sun et al 2019 found that nitrate contaminated areas increased with the increasing height of subsurface dam therefore the design of subsurface dam should not only meet the requirements of swi control but also consider reducing its negative environmental impact in essence the environmental problems caused by subsurface dams are closely related to the discharge of fresh groundwater after dam construction the upstream water table rises and the degree of the rise decreases gradually with the increased distance from the dam location for coastal aquifers with a fixed water level at the inland boundary this rise can reduce the horizontal hydraulic gradient in the upstream aquifer meanwhile the discharge tubes of fresh groundwater are squeezed above the dam crest and the width is smaller than that with no dam condition these eventually lead to a reduction in fresh groundwater discharge which reduces the decontamination capacity of coastal aquifers sun et al 2019 observed that the average flow velocity of upstream groundwater decreased after dam construction and the load of nitrate discharged into the ocean decreased gao et al 2021 and zheng et al 2021 found that increasing the hydraulic gradient would speed up the process of purifying the residual saltwater therefore fresh groundwater discharge is an important index for the design of subsurface dams although previous studies have revealed the effectiveness of subsurface dams and the related problems they predominantly simplified the sea boundary as a static condition neglecting oceanic watertable oscillations driven by tides in fact tides are a common natural phenomenon in coastal environments robinson et al 2018 shen et al 2020 santos et al 2021 under tidal influence the groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers are significantly different from those in the static scenario robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2012 kuan et al 2019 tidal fluctuations generate a saltwater cycle termed as upper saline plume usp in the upper part of aquifer and force the lower saltwater wedge sw to retreat seaward relatively to no tide condition yu et al 2017 shen et al 2019 yu et al 2019 fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b tidal oscillations propagate in coastal aquifers with an attenuated signal and induce the nonlinear fluctuations of inland water table leading to the overheight phenomenon of water table nielsen 1990 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 kuan et al 2012 water table overheight reduces the hydraulic gradient of aquifers thereby reducing the rate of fresh groundwater discharge robinson et al 2007b so far the influence of tides on the subsurface dam efficiency for swi control remains unclear under the tidal condition the effective heights of subsurface dam and the changes in fresh groundwater discharge have not been evaluated the comprehensive assessment of subsurface dams for swi control and upstream groundwater pollution is still lacking to clarify these issues we conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the combined effects of tides and subsurface dams on the groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal aquifers meanwhile the environmental impact associated with subsurface dams was also assessed using the index of fresh groundwater discharge groundwater dynamics in the no tide and no dam regimes were examined as references the results of these experiments and simulations provide decisive guidance for the design of subsurface dams aimed at both swi control and avoiding groundwater pollution 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments subsurface dam experiments were conducted in a well controlled sand tank fig 1 which had previously been tested and successfully used to simulate groundwater behavior in coastal aquifers affected by tide fang et al 2021 the tank dimensions were 172 9 cm length 45 cm height 8 cm width representing a quasi two dimensional profile of an unconfined aquifer the sand tank was constructed using a glass of 1 5 cm thickness and two porous partitions divided the tank into three chambers in the horizontal length direction the middle chamber was filled with white quartz sand that was carefully filled in the tank under fully saturated conditions to avoid trapping air bubble on the left of the porous medium a beach surface with a slope of 1 2 5 was constructed the sieved quartz sand had a relatively uniform particle size d 50 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 and the porosity was measured to be 0 4 table s1 in the supplementary material the average hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were determined using one dimensional column experiments as 2 8 10 3 m s and 0 001 m respectively chang et al 2019 soil saturation and pressure were also measured along a drying curve and the measured data were used to fit the van genuchten curve a typical water retention curve van genuchten 1980 the residual water saturation was 0 025 and the van genuchten constants a and n were 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 respectively the left and right of the middle chamber were the saltwater chamber and the freshwater chamber respectively the water level in the saltwater chamber was controlled by a tidal generating device which consists of a variable height overflow column and saltwater reservoir saltwater reservoir was used to pump saltwater into and out of the saltwater chamber via the variable height overflow column cartwright et al 2003 cartwright et al 2004 variable height overflow column possessed a good connectivity with the saltwater chamber for the same water level changes fig 1a periodic fluctuations in the variable height overflow column delivered water level changes in the saltwater chamber as follows 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the transient sea level l at time t t h msl is the mean sea level l 23 8 cm high from the base of sand tank a is the tidal amplitude l preset to 2 cm and t is the tidal period t preset to 1 min for the no tide condition the tidal device was switched off and the sea level was fixed at the mean sea level h msl by an overflow outlet artificial seawater was prepared by mixing sodium chloride nacl ar grade 34 g red food dye sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 1 g and deionized water 1 l food dyes are often used to trace the movement of seawater in a sand tank and previous studies have confirmed their effectiveness goswami and clement 2007 nguyen et al 2020 the salinity and density of seawater were measured as 35 and 1025 g l respectively an electrical conductivity meter hq40d portable ec meter hach inc measured the salinity in saltwater chamber every 5 min additional seawater with a high salinity 70 g l was pumped into the saltwater chamber to counteract to the dilution effect of fresh groundwater discharge and retain a uniform seawater salinity of 35 g l the pumped flux was adjusted following the results of salinity monitoring via the electrical conductivity meter the freshwater chamber represented an inland boundary with a fixed water level which was acquired by pumping freshwater into the right chamber that flowed out of the upper overflow the overflow outlet was located 24 5 cm from the bottom of sand tank and the head difference between the landward and seaward boundaries was 0 7 cm freshwater was prepared using deionized water with a salinity of 0 g l and density of 1000 g l in this study the coordinate origin was located at the intersection between the msl and the aquifer beach the subsurface dam was made of a polystyrene hard sheet a material impermeable to water we designed two slots at x 19 5 and 40 cm and the subsurface dam could be inserted into the slots allowing the design of different scenarios each slot consisted of two porous partitions and rubber strips the porous partition can separate quartz sand and the rubber strip acts as a buffer and seal for subsurface dam experiments the way of inserting a subsurface dam can avoid changes in the porous medium structure and hydrological parameters caused by traditional rebuilding and refilling two sets of four scenarios including six experiments were carried out in the sand tank table 1 for the one set subsurface dams were not considered and swi was examined under the no tide and tide regimes scenarios notide nodam and tide nodam cases notide nodam and tide nodam were the base cases for the next investigation the other set incorporated a subsurface dam under the no tide and tide regimes scenarios notide dam and tide dam for the experiments the subsurface dam was first located at x 19 5 cm and the height was preset to 13 03 cm the two cases under the scenarios notide dam and tide dam were compared in order to illustrate the effect of tide on the efficiency of subsurface dam then the height of subsurface dam was lowered to 8 76 cm while the location was set to x 19 5 and 40 cm thus examining the influence of subsurface dam location under the scenario tide dam the experiment continued to operate for 20 36 h so that salinity distribution in the sand tank reached a steady state we defined the steady state such that the difference of the salinity movement between two images over a 2 h period was lower than 0 1 cm throughout the experiment a high pixel camera canon ixus 285 hs took images every 30 min to record the swi process 2 2 numerical simulations previous experimental evidence suggests that dyes are not able to accurately capture the extent of the dispersion zone between seawater and freshwater kuan et al 2012 kuan et al 2019 lu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 a narrower range of dispersion zone is usually observed in laboratory experiments than in numerical simulations fang et al 2021 in order to quantify the dispersion zone and groundwater flux a series of numerical simulations were performed with feflow diersch 2014 feflow is widely used to simulate the swi process in coastal aquifers including the no tide and tide regimes sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 fang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 the richards equation eq 2 was coupled with the advection diffusion equation eq 3 to govern the variably saturated and variable density groundwater flow and solute transport

preconditioned and post conditioned bicgstab were used to solve the linear matrix and nonlinear matrix respectively with a tolerance of 1 10 8 table s1 the setup of the numerical model was consistent with the experiment including the dimension of the domain hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions fig 2 the homogeneous isotropic domain was discretized into 90 119 triangular elements with a maximum length of element sides of 0 4 cm the mesh peclet number was calculated to be less than 4 which meets the requirements for numerical stability voss and provost 2002 the thickness of the subsurface dam was set to 1 cm and the elements occupied by the subsurface dam were set to be inactive the top and bottom boundaries of the model were set as no flow conditions for flow and mass transport the freshwater boundary on the right was set to a fixed head of 0 7 cm 24 5 cm from aquifer base and solute concentration of 0 g l the left seawater boundary was set as follows 1 for the no tide conditions a head specified boundary was set to the seawater level of 0 cm 2 for the tide conditions a tidal boundary was applied when the boundary nodes were saturated and located above the seawater level these nodes were set to a seepage face xin et al 2010 the nodes below the seawater level were treated as a head specified boundary that varied with the tide stage and seawater depth the seawater concentration was set to 35 g l if seawater permeated the aquifer more detail about the seawater boundary setup and application in feflow can be found in text s1 and figure s1 in the supplementary material after the validation of the numerical model by experimental cases a series of testing cases including scenarios notide dam and tide dam with various subsurface dam heights and locations were conducted in the first trial to examine their effect on swi control and fresh groundwater discharge the dam locations were set at five positions x 9 25 19 5 29 75 40 and 50 25 cm for all five dam locations the dam heights were varied six times depending on the height of the sw at the dam locations in the base cases table s2 tidal fluctuations enhance the mixing of seawater and freshwater and generate a wide dispersion zone compared to the no tide conditions robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2019 our observations demonstrated that the width of dispersion zone had an important effect on the effective heights of subsurface dam so the next trial investigated the influence of seawater and freshwater mixing on the effective heights the longitudinal dispersivity a l was set to 0 005 0 001 and 0 0001 m and the transverse dispersivity a t was 1 10 a l accordingly the dam heights were varied four times according to the sw height prior to dam construction at x 19 5 cm table s3 two intel i7 9700 3 0 ghz processors were used to perform the simulation work with model run times ranging from 6 h i e for the case notide dam to approximately 9 days i e for the case tide nodam 3 results 3 1 steady state salinity distribution 3 1 1 experimental results steady state color images captured from the sand tank are shown in fig 3 for scenarios notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam a clear boundary was observed between the red colored saltwater and freshwater fig 3a shows the salinity distribution in the base case of notide nodam with a static sea level swi induced a saltwater wedge sw at the lower end of the aquifer the sw heights decreased as it approached the inland traditionally the distance from the sw toe location to the sea boundary is defined as the distance of swi zheng et al 2021 the swi distance was 109 cm in case notide nodam the extent of swi in the base case of tide nodam is presented in fig 3b tidal fluctuations induced a usp in the upper partially saturated part of the aquifer and the sw retreated more seaward in comparison to case notide nodam the swi distance was 73 cm in case tide nodam these results were consistent with those of kuan et al 2012 who found that saltwater circulation in the usp increased the discharge of groundwater into the ocean thus inhibiting the invasion of seawater figs 3c and 3d compare the extent of swi after the construction of a subsurface dam under scenarios notide dam and tide dam respectively the dam location was set to x 19 5 cm and the height was 13 03 cm that was exactly equal to the height of the sw at the dam location in case notide nodam the subsurface dam effectively prevented intrusive seawater and the swi distance was controlled at the dam location in scenario notide dam the height of the sw at the dam location was close to the dam height while the sw height 8 cm was lower than the dam height in scenario tide dam these results were in line with the aforementioned observation base cases i e tidal activity reduces the extent of swi fig 4 shows results under scenario tide dam where the effects of different dam locations are compared the height of subsurface dam was fixed at 8 76 cm in fig 4a the intrusive seawater was intercepted at the dam location with an sw height of 6 5 cm moving the subsurface dam further inland the swi distance again was controlled at the dam location fig 4b the sw height 3 8 cm was much smaller than the dam height compared to that in fig 4a this demonstrated that subsurface dam with the same height provided more security for swi control as the dam distance from the sea boundary increased 3 1 2 simulated results the salinity distribution in the numerical model is also shown in figs 3 and 4 the dashed white lines solid white lines and dash dotted white lines represented the 5 50 and 95 isohalines respectively traditionally 50 isohalines were used to determine the saltwater freshwater interface kuan et al 2012 the results obtained with the simulated 50 isohalines were basically consistent with the experimental results for scenarios notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam these results confirmed a successful calibration and the reliability of the numerical model compared to numerical simulations the experimental results showed a narrower extension of the salt freshwater dispersion zone which was also observed in previous experimental studies kuan et al 2019 yu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 fang et al 2021 the dye tracking method failed to capture the extension of the dispersion zone during the experiments because of the lack of high resolution images to clearly distinguish the saltwater salinity by the dye shade robinson et al 2016 fang et al 2021 mo et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the width of the dispersion zone in the tidal cases was greater than that in the no tide cases which indicated that tide enhanced the mixing of saltwater and freshwater in order to connect the lab results to field scale implications we used dimensionless parameters h and x to define the dam height and location in the following respectively h represents the ratio of the dam height h to the aquifer thickness of 23 8 cm x indicates the ratio of the dam location x to the aquifer length of 133 4 cm the measurements of aquifer length and thickness were based on the intersection between the msl and the aquifer beach after validation the numerical model was used to examine the effect of subsurface dam heights on swi control under scenarios notide dam and tide dam the dam location was fixed at x 0 146 and the heights were varied six times table 2 provides the detail about the dam heights and its introduction for the scenario notide dam the effect of subsurface dams with different heights on swi prevention is shown in fig 5 i e figs 5a 5f for the salinity and flow fields and figs 5g 5l for the magnitude of flow velocity the dam heights greater than 0 474 could effectively stem the invasion of saltwater and below that height saltwater flowed over the dam and continued to invade landward thus the height of 0 474 was the minimum effective height of subsurface dam which was equal to the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 95 isohalines in the base case of notide nodam hereinafter termed as 95 sw height the high flow velocity above the dam crest allowed the washing of partially invasive saltwater and thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam could be less than the 5 sw height and also effectively control the swi fig 6 compares the results of salt freshwater interfaces in fig 5 using the 50 isohalines at the dam position the height of the sw under the minimum effective dam height was the smallest when the dam heights were greater than the minimum effective height the downstream sw rose obviously as the dam height increased under the scenario tide dam the effect of subsurface dams with different heights on swi prevention is shown in fig 7 subsurface dams with a height of more than 0 368 could effectively control swi the minimum effective height was 0 368 which was equal to the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 20 isohalines in the base case of tide nodam hereinafter termed as 20 sw height the dam height of 0 269 corresponding to the 50 sw height in case tide nodam allowed low salinity saltwater less than 17 5 g l to flow over the dam crest and invade inland the minimum effective height reduced compared with that in scenario notide dam however the ratio of the minimum effective height to the corresponding 5 sw height in base case increased i e 77 7 for the tide condition and 75 5 for the no tide condition and the next paragraph analyzed the reasons fig 8 compares the results of salt freshwater interfaces in fig 7 using the 50 isohalines when the dam heights were lower than the minimum effective height the salt freshwater interfaces in the downstream were almost unchanged when the dam heights were greater than the minimum effective height the downstream sw rose obviously and the usp contracted in the intertidal zone as the dam heights increased under the scenario tide dam with the minimum effective height 0 368 the salinity distribution and groundwater flow fields at ebbing high tide mean tide and low tide are shown in fig 9 at high tide the flow direction of downstream groundwater was landward and seawater penetrated into the aquifer thus the 5 isohaline went over the subsurface dam at low tide the hydraulic gradient drove groundwater discharge seawater flowed out of the aquifer and the hotspot of groundwater velocity existed above the dam crest removing the invasive saltwater so the 5 isohaline retreated to the dam position at low tide with this cyclical fluctuation seawater was eventually intercepted at the dam location the width of dispersion zone was large under the tidal effect but the area affected by freshwater washing above the dam crest was limited thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam needed to be increased to the 20 sw height so that the invasive saltwater can be controlled while the width of dispersion zone was thin in the no tide situation and with the aid of freshwater flushing above the dam crest the minimum effective height only needed to reach the 95 sw height these findings suggested that salt freshwater mixing in coastal aquifers played a critical role influencing the minimum effective height of subsurface dams 3 2 effective dam heights and fresh groundwater discharge 3 2 1 cases under no tide and dam condition for the scenario notide dam the swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge after the construction of subsurface dams with different heights are summarized in fig 10 setups of different dam heights were divided into the effective dam height range edr and the failed dam height range fdr depending on whether they succeeded in stemming the seawater fresh groundwater discharge was calculated by quantifying the freshwater influx from the inland boundary at the steady state the value was 0 215 m3 d m in the base case of notide nodam also understood as the dam height of 0 in the fdr fresh groundwater discharge increased with dam heights contrary in the edr a decrease in fresh groundwater discharge was recorded with increasing dam heights fresh groundwater discharge peaked at the minimum effective height as mentioned in the literature review increasing fresh groundwater discharge is beneficial to reduce the contamination of upstream groundwater including nitrate accumulation and residual saltwater sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 those heights of dams where fresh groundwater discharge was greater than the value of case notide nodam demarcated the increased discharge dam height range idhr the intersection of edr and idhr formed an effective and increased discharge dam height range e idhr see also fig 10 which is the optimal range of dam height for the design of subsurface dams aimed at swi control and avoiding inland groundwater pollution the lower threshold of the e idhr was the minimum effective height as shown in fig 10 the height of 0 750 was close to the upper threshold of the e idhr which was 120 of the 5 sw height the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case notide nodam under the scenario notide dam the water table of the aquifer after the construction of subsurface dams with different heights is shown in fig 11 as the dam height increased upstream groundwater level rose and downstream groundwater level fell thus the hydraulic gradient in the upstream decreased with an increase in dam height for example following an increased dam height from 0 547 0 750 and 1 000 the upstream hydraulic gradient decreased from 0 28 to 0 25 and 0 20 respectively however when the dam height was less than the minimum effective height the water table was practically unchanged the upstream hydraulic gradient was the largest when the dam height was less than or equal to the minimum effective height as observed in figs 5 and 6 the height of the sw was the smallest under the minimum effective dam height in other words the width of the freshwater discharge tube above the dam crest was the largest these factors eventually gave rise to the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height in addition figs 5i 5k reveal a large area of high flow velocity larger than 0 8 m d in the upstream when the dam heights were within the e idhr however for dam heights in the non e idhr the area of the high flow velocity was relatively small figs 5g 5h and 5l this might explain the increased fresh groundwater discharge for the dam heights within the e idhr 3 2 2 cases under tide and dam condition fig 12 presents the swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge under the combined effect of tide and subsurface dams with different heights similar to the scenario notide dam different setups heights of dams could be divided into edr fdr idhr and e idhr before the construction of a dam fresh groundwater discharge was 0 163 m3 d m in the base case of tide nodam which is lower than 0 215 m3 d m in case notide nodam this result was due to the overheight phenomenon of the water table caused by tidal oscillations nielsen 1990 ataie ashtiani et al 1999 kuan et al 2012 thereby at the same height of a dam fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime was always lower than that in the no tide regime compared with the e idhr in scenario notide dam fig 10 tidal vibration caused the overall left low height movement of the e idhr fig 12 the lower threshold minimum effective height was reduced to 0 368 and the upper threshold was close to 0 547 that was equal to 116 of the 5 sw height the height at the dam position of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case tide nodam 3 3 influence of subsurface dam location in this section we examined the effect of subsurface dam location on the efficiency of swi control and fresh groundwater discharge under tidal condition for the first trial the dam location was changed to x 0 3 and the results of swi distance and fresh groundwater discharge at different dam heights are summarized in fig 13 the minimum effective height was 0 193 which was equal to the 20 sw height the dam height of 0 118 was equal to the 50 sw height but it did not successfully block the invasive saltwater less than 17 5 g l saltwater flowed over the dam crest and invaded inland these results were similar to that of the dam location fixed at x 0 146 and it was confirmed that the effective height of subsurface dam needed to be greater than the 20 sw height therefore the 20 sw interface in the base case of tide nodam was a critical line that determines the minimum effective heights of subsurface dams at different locations for the scenario tide dam as shown in fig 13 the upper threshold of the e idhr was close to 0 28 which was equal to 105 of the 5 sw height the height at x 0 3 of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines in case tide nodam compared with the e idhr at x 0 146 fig 12 the upper and lower thresholds of the e idhr in fig 13 decreased and the interval length also reduced i e 0 179 for the dam fixed at x 0 146 and 0 087 for the dam fixed at x 0 3 these results revealed that both the dam heights within the e idhr and the interval length of the e idhr decreased as the distance from the dam location to the sea boundary increased for the second trial fresh groundwater discharge under the different locations x and heights h of subsurface dams in scenario tide dam are presented in fig 14 the horizontal semi transparent plane indicated the amount of fresh groundwater discharge in the base case of tide nodam the intersection of the plane and the colored surface determined the idhr and the front intersection was the upper threshold of the e idhr at each dam location the peaks of fresh groundwater discharge exposed the trace of the minimum effective dam height the range determined by the front intersection and the series peaks in the horizontal plane x h was the e idhr at each dam location that is to say at each location the subsurface dam has a different optimal height range e idhr for swi control and the enlargement of fresh groundwater discharge fig 14 also reveals that the interval length of the e idhr decreases as the dam location moves landward in addition a marked decline in the maximum fresh groundwater discharge was recorded in fig 14 with an increasing distance from the dam location to the sea boundary the maximum fresh groundwater discharge was close to 0 163 m3 d m the rate in the base case of tide nodam when the dam was located at x 0 377 3 4 influence of dispersivity in section 3 1 2 we compared the relationship between the minimum effective dam height and the sw height in the base cases and deduced the contribution of salt freshwater mixing to them tide enhanced the mixing of seawater and freshwater and enlarged the mixing area thus we assumed that the influence of salt freshwater mixing may be decisive for effective dam height under tidal condition fig 15 shows the efficiency of subsurface dam for swi control under different dispersion parameters the dam heights h were set to the 50 sw height 20 sw height and 5 sw height according to the results of the no dam condition h 0 note that the 50 20 and 5 sw heights of subsurface dams were different under different dispersivity values as expected increasing the dispersivity enhanced the salt freshwater mixing resulting in a wider dispersion zone in fig 15 the dam height needed to be increased to the 5 sw height so that the invasive seawater can be prevented under the condition with a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 005 m the minimum effective dam height was equal to the 20 sw height under the longitudinal dispersivity of 0 001 m with a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 0001 m the dam height only needed to reach the 50 sw height for swi control increasing the dispersivity led to an increase of the ratio of the minimum effective dam height to the sw height in other words with the increase in dispersion subsurface dams should increase the ratio of the dam height to the sw height prior to dam construction to control the invasive seawater these findings confirmed the important effect of salt freshwater mixing on the minimum effective height especially under tidal condition 3 5 field scale numerical simulations to generalize our findings some field scale simulations were conducted in a 2d cross shore profile of an unconfined aquifer with a length of 300 m and depth of 30 m the correlation between the laboratory scale and field scale models was regulated by a dimensionless scale factor λ which governs the groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers robinson et al 2007b mo et al 2021 6 λ ω ε h at 2 k where ε is the porosity ω is the tidal angular frequency t 1 hat is the aquifer thickness l k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 the parameters table s1 and dimensions figure s2 of the field scale model were based on previous field work of xin et al 2010 and zheng et al 2021 the key scale factor was calculated to be 1 33 for laboratory scale and 1 39 for field scale within the range of real world coastal aquifers similar to the definition of laboratory scale cases fig 16 shows the field scale salinity distribution in cases notide nodam tide nodam notide dam and tide dam the minimum effective dam height was used with a height of 13 25 m for case notide dam and 12 73 m for case tide dam overall the results of the field scale simulations agreed with those from our laboratory scale studies prior to dam construction fresh groundwater discharge was 0 841 m3 d m in case notide nodam and 0 739 m3 d m in case tide nodam however after the construction of subsurface dam with the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge increased to 0 978 m3 d m in case notide dam and 0 785 m3 d m in case tide dam these results indicated that subsurface dams in field scale aquifers also possessed an effective and increased discharge height range regardless of the no tide and tide regimes as shown in fig 16 the minimum effective dam height was equal to the 85 sw height under no tide condition and the 15 sw height under tide condition the relationship between the minimum effective dam height and the sw height was close to that obtained from the laboratory scale work although a slight difference arose due to the intensive salt freshwater mixing as expected in field scale aquifers 4 discussion the design of subsurface dam relies on the accurate depictions of the extent of swi previous studies related to subsurface dams usually simplified the sea boundary as a static condition neglecting sea level oscillations driven by tides luyun et al 2009 senthilkumar and elango 2011 chang et al 2019 however the swi extent is different for the no tide and tide regimes as shown in fig 3 tidal vibration led to an overall retreat of saltwater wedge and the extent of swi decreased compared with that observed in the no tide condition thus subsurface dams only required a lower minimum effective height to block the intrusive saltwater therefore ignoring tidal forces will overestimate the swi distance and extent in coastal aquifers thereby leading engineers to designing too large heights of subsurface dams and increasing construction costs after the construction of subsurface dams the related environmental problems including residual saltwater and pollutant accumulation have gradually received attention kang and xu 2017 sun et al 2019 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the design of a subsurface dam should not only meet the requirements of controlling swi but also consider reducing the contamination of upstream groundwater fresh groundwater discharge is closely related to the decontamination capacity of an aquifer sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 therefore the present study also considered fresh groundwater discharge as an important index for the design of subsurface dams the results in figs 12 14 revealed that a subsurface dam possessed an effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on the dam location with the dam heights within this range the subsurface dam not only effectively prevented the invasive saltwater but also increased the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction thereby this range is the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed to concurrently control swi and avoid inland groundwater pollution which is of great significance for the protection of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers the optimal range of dam heights is different for the no tide and tide regimes tidal vibration decreases the lower and upper thresholds of the range in comparison with the no tide conditions moreover for the dam heights within this range fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime is lower than that in the no tide regime as earlier mentioned fresh groundwater discharge is crucial for upstream groundwater contamination sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 thus the upstream aquifer is subjected to more serious challenges of groundwater pollution under the combined effect of tide and subsurface dam these findings highlight the importance of sea boundary conditions and suggest that the future design of subsurface dams should take into account tidal fluctuations the lower threshold of the optimal range is the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge peaks at this dam height chang et al 2019 the upper threshold of the optimal range is usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines prior to dam construction as the dam location moves landward both the dam heights within the optimal range and the interval length of the optimal range decreases also the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height decreases these findings provide an important reference when choosing the location of the subsurface dam if the location is close to the sea boundary the minimum effective dam height rises thus increasing construction costs however the protected area of upstream groundwater resource increases and an increased discharge of fresh groundwater reduces the contamination of upstream groundwater the related benefits are the opposite if the dam location is located further inland salt freshwater mixing has a significant impact on the minimum effective dam height as shown in fig 5 the minimum effective height was equal to the 95 sw height under the no tide condition tide enhances the mixing of seawater and freshwater resulting in a larger dispersion zone robinson et al 2007a kuan et al 2012 shen et al 2020 thus the minimum effective height increases to the 20 sw height under tidal activity fig 7 with an increase in the dispersivity the ratio of the minimum effective dam height to the sw height also increases fig 15 these findings confirm the critical effect of salt freshwater mixing and suggest again that tidal fluctuations should be carefully considered in the design of subsurface dams in real world aquifers the dispersivity is typically dependent on the scale and field scale dispersivity parameters are several orders of magnitude greater than laboratory scale values for the same materials because of natural heterogeneities gelhar et al 1992 robinson et al 2007b thus intensive salt freshwater mixing occurs in real world aquifers therefore increased caution should be exercised in the design of field scale subsurface dams 5 conclusions this study conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the combined effect of tides and subsurface dams on groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal aquifers meanwhile the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams were also assessed using the index of fresh groundwater discharge the key new findings are summarized in the following paragraph tide inhibited the intrusion of seawater thus the minimum effective height of subsurface dam could be reduced compared to that in the no tide condition however the ratio of the minimum effective height to the corresponding sw height increased i e 77 7 for the tide condition and 75 5 for the no tide condition owing to the stronger salt freshwater mixing as a result of tidal activity the minimum effective height was close to the 95 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 95 isohalines prior to dam construction in the no tide condition and the 20 sw height in the tide condition fresh groundwater discharge peaked in the minimum effective height subsurface dams possessed an effective and increased discharge height range e idhr which was depending on dam location within this range subsurface dams not only effectively prevented the invasive saltwater but also enlarged the amount of fresh groundwater discharge relative to the scenario prior to dam construction thereby the e idhr was considered to be the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed at the prevention of swi and upstream groundwater pollution tidal vibration altered the optimal range and the lower and upper thresholds of the optimal range were decreased compared to the no tide condition the lower threshold was the minimum effective height the upper threshold was usually close to 116 of the 5 sw height the height of the sw determined by the 5 isohalines prior to dam construction as the dam location moved landward both the dam heights within the optimal range and the interval length of the optimal range decreased further the maximum fresh groundwater discharge at the minimum effective height decreased for the dam heights within the optimal range fresh groundwater discharge in the tide regime was lower than that in the no tide regime there was a positive correlation between the intensity of salt freshwater mixing and the ratio of the minimum effective height to the sw height this ratio increased as dispersivity increased notwithstanding the above findings the environmental problems associated with subsurface dams are indirectly measured in this study using the index of fresh groundwater discharge which may behave differently for the direct quantification furthermore the complexity of coastal aquifers such as heterogeneity anisotropy beach morphology inland water table variations multi component tidal signals waves and other temporal and spatial variations are neglected while these factors are known to affect the swi process future studies are required to investigate the complexity of coastal aquifers and the direct influence of tides and subsurface dams on the accumulation of terrestrial pollutants and desalinization of residual saltwater nevertheless this study provides a useful assessment of the effectiveness of subsurface dams in coastal aquifers affected by tide and proposes the optimal range of dam heights for the design of subsurface dams aimed at swi control and avoiding groundwater pollution the critical findings have been well verified via the laboratory experiments and field scale numerical simulations therefore the findings can provide a general framework that can be used to guide the optimization of subsurface dam structure for practical problems it is necessary to add more realistic features

3872,a combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling can be applied to understand the hydrology and key water balance components of lakes and lagoons in this research the soil and water assessment tool swat model and the qgis water ecosystems tool qwet were applied for the mar menor coastal lagoon and its watershed known as campo de cartagena first the swat model was calibrated and validated based on remote sensing evapotranspiration data results showed an acceptable performance of the swat model in both calibration r2 0 63 nse 0 62 pbias 2 91 and validation r2 0 68 nse 0 68 pbias 2 47 periods on a monthly basis the swat simulated streamflow was fed into the qwet model to simulate the water balance of the lagoon the hydrodynamic model performance was evaluated based on a comparison between simulated and observed water temperatures and also the model estimated evaporation simulated daily temperatures showed a good agreement with observed data by capturing the timing and inter annual variations with an nse of 0 98 and a bias of 2 7 our water balance estimation using the reference period 2003 2019 yields a mean annual rainfall over the lake of 301 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 1325 mm the average surface runoff and groundwater discharge to the lagoon are 49 hm3 year and 11 hm3 year respectively extreme storm events cause annual surface runoff to vary between 8 hm3 year and 202 hm3 year the water balance was closed with the water exchange with the mediterranean sea resulting in an overall positive flow from the mediterranean sea of 82 hm3 year our study showed that during summer months in particular there is considerable inflow of mediterranean water to the lagoon whereas for some autumn and winter months november december and january there is a net outflow from the lagoon to the mediterranean this novel approach by combining the swat hydrological model and qwet hydrodynamic model complex provides a useful tool for understanding the hydrology of the lagoon and may also play a role for decision makers when developing strategies for mitigating eutrophication keywords swat qwet water balance mar menor coastal lagoons 1 introduction coastal lagoons are shallow water bodies partially or totally isolated from the open sea by sedimentary or anthropic barriers but linked to the sea by one or more inlets kjerfve 1994 these types of lagoons are recognised as one of the most valuable ecosystems for the fishing and aquaculture industries in the world nixon 1982 with ideal conditions for the development of recreational and tourism services which are often concentrated in these areas de pascalis et al 2012 velasco et al 2018 however these natural systems are particularly at risk from increasing anthropogenic pressures such as intensive agriculture and urbanization pressures associated with tourism development viaroli et al 2005 among other threats eutrophication is one of the main causes of water quality deterioration in coastal lagoons le moal et al 2019 developed countries are generally exposed to a greater number of anthropogenic activities making the accurate modelling of these systems much more complex such modelling allows the analysis and simulation of different measures helping to make decisions focused on the cohabitation between human activity and the preservation of the environmental values of these territories garcía ayllón 2017 in the mediterranean sea more than a hundred of these coastal lagoons have been identified pérez ruzafa et al 2011 and in addition to the previously mentioned activities there will also be a negative impact on these lagoons as a consequence of climate change ferrarin et al 2014 it is necessary to understand the different components of the system how they are connected and the cause effect relationships between the drainage basin and the coastal lagoon this paper proposes an integrated approach to modelling such systems that can be used as a first step to improve the management of any of the coastal lagoons that are currently undergoing eutrophication processes around the world from this perspective this research is focused on the mar menor coastal lagoon spain as a representative case of a highly anthropized area experiencing environmental pressures that have emerged over the last few decades as in many other coastal areas of the mediterranean the surroundings of the mar menor which are catalogued as a wetland site of international importance under the ramsar convention and is integrated in the nature 2000 network has suffered from an expansion of farming activities in the watershed and a significant increase in the tourism which led to an increase in nutrient inputs to the mar menor in recent years the process of eutrophication has resulted in a considerable reduction in water transparency affecting the tourism sector and the local economy jimeno sáez et al 2020 the regional government has responded with a series of legislative actions to guarantee a sustainable development of the mar menor environment carm 2017 carm 2018 carm 2019 some of these measures are fertilizer application control and adaptation of best management practices bmps in the watershed draining into the mar menor called campo de cartagena however no evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed measures has yet been carried out due to the complexity of this highly anthropized system and the uncertainty associated with the quantification of certain components of the lagoon s water balance such as the water exchanges with the mediterranean sea and not least the surface runoff and groundwater discharges to the lagoon given this situation a comprehensive understanding of the processes that govern the water balance of the lagoon is an essential foundation to ensure suitable management of this fragile ecosystem in recent years several studies have tried to evaluate the components of the mar menor lagoon water balance but these studies have been characterized by addressing only certain components of the water balance and not taking a holistic approach where all the key water balance components and their relations are quantified in a global framework these studies provide some valuable key individual pieces of the hydrological puzzle but do not provide the full picture of the dynamics and hydrological functioning of the lagoon hence there is a need for a holistic approach which combine hydrological and hydrodynamic models to better understand the big picture and for reducing uncertainties related to the water balance for instance previous studies on the mar menor included hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal lagoon martínez álvarez et al 2011 de pascalis et al 2012 baudron et al 2015 garcía oliva et al 2018 garcía oliva et al 2019 obtaining estimates of certain components of the water balance like the evaporation or the water exchange with the mediterranean sea however these studies disregarded the connection to the campo de cartagena area watershed and aquifer with the mar menor or at best in a very simplified manner for instance de pascalis et al 2012 garcía oliva et al 2018 and garcía oliva et al 2019 adopted a homogeneous runoff coefficient of 6 5 for the entire drainage watershed to proxy surface runoff the contribution of water from campo de cartagena aquifer has also recently been studied e g chs 2015 jiménez martínez et al 2016 domingo pinillos et al 2018 alcolea et al 2019 obtaining very different results which may be attributed to the complexity of the aquifer for example discharges to the mar menor from the aquifer varies from 6 2 mm3 yr chs 2015 to 68 mm3 yr jiménez martínez et al 2016 this large variability is influenced by the extreme anthropogenic activity e g groundwater abstractions and the complex relation between the different aquifer compartments for example more than 2000 wells exist in the area i e 1 18 wells km2 many of which exploit several aquifers through internal connections thus connections between the aquifers which is subject to increasing concern jiménez martínez et al 2016 hydrological modelling studies of the campo de cartagena watershed however are scarce martínez álvarez et al 2011 this is mainly due to the ephemeral character of the rivers and the lack of reliable data of daily discharge alcolea et al 2019 combined the modular groundwater flow modflow model harbaugh 2005 with the hydrological model sphy terink et al 2015 using available hydraulic head measurements to calibrate the groundwater model lópez ballesteros et al 2019 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat model in el beal watercourse one of the ephemeral streams that drains to the mar menor using actual evapotranspiration data aet from remote sensing data to calibrate and validate the model however the total surface runoff that drains into the mar menor coastal lagoon has not yet been assessed to be able to simulate the hydrology of the mar menor watershed the swat model has been chosen for this study because it is a public domain model that run on inputs that can be easily gathered for most watersheds blanco gómez et al 2019 in addition and despite not being the goal of this work the swat model can evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural practices on a watershed scale which could be a future line of research beyond this study swat is usually calibrated using stream discharge stations senent aparicio et al 2017 jimeno sáez et al 2018 however when discharge data are not available remotely sensed data is an alternative solution for calibration purposes herman et al 2020 recent studies proved that the swat model can be calibrated using aet data tobin and bennett 2017 ha et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 lópez ballesteros et al 2019 to simulate the hydro and thermodynamics of the mar menor lagoon the qgis water ecosystems tool qwet has been chosen qwet is an open source tool that provides a graphical user interface for the coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic ecosystem model gotm wet nielsen et al 2017 nielsen et al 2020 the model simulates mixing processes the vertical distribution of temperature and evaporation qwet also provide a link to the swat watershed model whereby swat output can be utilized as input to the qwet model setup to the best of our knowledge none of the recent studies in the mar menor area have combined hydrological and hydrodynamic models and only a few similar studies like this have been carried out world wide inoue et al 2008 dargahi setegn 2011 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 munar et al 2018 lopes et al 2018 coppens et al 2020 of which none of them combined wet and swat models the modelling approach proposed in this research could guide decision makers in the development of an integrated environmental management of the mar menor coastal lagoon and is of great interest to similar coastal lagoons the objectives of this study were to conduct a holistic integrated analysis of the different components of the lagoon water balance and to identify aspects that should be a research priority in order to further advance the quantification of the water balance since water flows are one of the main controlling forces of the physical chemical and biological dynamics of the lagoon their study and characterization must be considered as a key task to advance the scientific knowledge of this case study 2 study area due to the complexity of the integrated watershed lagoon hydrosystem we have separated the description of the case study in 1 the basin that drains into the mar menor coastal lagoon called campo de cartagena 2 the multilayer aquifer under this watershed and 3 the mar menor coastal lagoon an extensive review of human pressures and impacts on the whole campo de cartagena mar menor system can be found in conesa jiménez cárceles 2007 and jiménez martínez et al 2016 2 1 campo de cartagena basin located in the segura river basin se spain which is characterized as one of the most water stressed areas in europe senent aparicio et al 2016 the campo de cartagena watershed covers an area of around 1400 km2 and is characterized by its ephemeral streams usually running dry but which can carry large quantities of water and sediment when torrential rain falls garcía pintado et al 2007 this watershed ranks as one of europe s leading vegetable producers velasco et al 2006 mainly due to the construction of the tagus segura water transfer channel tswtc the tswtc was completed in 1980 and can provide a flow rate of up to 122 million cubic meters per year hm3 year although in recent years and due to water shortages at the headwaters of the tagus river the flow rate has decreased elevating the pressure on groundwater resources and promoting the use of desalination and wastewater reuse rupérez moreno et al 2017 shortage of water has led to the implementation of drip irrigation and generally a need to make good use of the limited water available senent aparicio et al 2015 tourism on the coast of the mar menor lagoon is also a major contributor to the local economy jimeno sáez et al 2020 and mining in the southern part of the basin was one of the main activities in the past although it has now ceased navarro et al 2008 according to the weather data used in this study this basin is one of the most arid of the mediterranean area with an annual precipitation amount from 2000 to 2019 that ranges from 166 mm to 469 mm where average precipitation is less than 300 mm per year and the annual averages for maximum and minimum daily temperatures were 23 7 c and 13 0 c respectively the precipitation is unevenly distributed into a few high intensity events mainly in spring and autumn regarding topography the altitude ranges from sea level to 1063 m a s l but most of the area is flat with over 36 of the watershed with slopes of less than 2 the primary land use of the campo de cartagena watershed is intensive irrigated agriculture around 50 of the total area the dominant soil type is calcaric cambisols 71 which is mainly composed of sand and silt 2 2 campo de cartagena aquifer the watershed described above is settled over the campo de cartagena aquifer this aquifer is a multi layered system composed of deep confined aquifers and an unconfined shallow aquifer quaternary groundwater is a major contributor to the sustainability of local agriculture along with water supplied by the tswtc and the recent increase in public desalinated seawater and private brackish water treatment plants senent aparicio et al 2015 2 3 mar menor coastal lagoon the mar menor is a hypersaline coastal lagoon with an immense socio economic and ecological value and a clear case of a severely anthropized hydroecosystem in southeastern spain velasco et al 2018 it has a surface area of 135 km2 covering a coastline of 73 km and contains five volcanic islands the mar menor is considered a shallow lagoon with an average depth of 4 4 m being the maximum depth around 7 m umgiesser et al 2014 a 22 km long sandy coastal barrier known as la manga isolates the lagoon from the mediterranean sea and is intersected by three inlets las encañizadas estacio marchamalo facilitating exchanges of waters between the mediterranean sea and the lagoon fig 1 d the most important water exchange takes place through the estacio channel in 1973 this channel was dredged and broadened to make it nautical navigable baudron et al 2015 among the most significant environmental sites in the mediterranean area is the mar menor where many economic and industrial activities meet conesa jiménez cárceles 2007 its unique weather conditions and abundant natural resources have attracted tourism recreational and fishing uses without forgetting the relevance of farming to the local economy the process of economic social and urban transformation that has affected the lagoon in the past half century and even before in the case of mining has led to a multitude of impacts on the physical and natural environment and makes the mar menor an area in need of special protection carm 2019 the situation far from improving has deteriorated in recent years in 2016 profound eutrophication generated by a severe increase in the nutrients occurred consequently chlorophyll concentrations rose which was responsible for the loss of 85 of the vegetation cover and a strong public awareness not only from an ecological point of view but also in the tourism sector garcía ayllón 2018 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 during 11 14 september 2019 extreme storm events corresponding to a return period of 500 years caused extensive flash flooding in the campo de cartagena basin causing a strong increase in chlorophyll levels and a sudden drop in salinity that caused the death of thousands of fish 3 methodology 3 1 framework for evaluating the water balance in the mar menor coastal lagoon this study combines qwet with swat model to assess the mar menor water balance for the period 2003 2019 it includes the following steps 1 swat model was calibrated and validated in the campo de cartagena watershed on a monthly basis using remote sensing evapotranspiration data 2 hydrodynamic component of qwet model was simulated using swat model outputs as an input comparing the results obtained with the available observed temperature measurements 3 using the calibrated swat and qwet models mar menor water balance was simulated and all its components were analyzed and discussed 3 2 hydrological modelling approach swat is a continuous physically based and semi distributed hydrological model developed for exploring the effects of agricultural management practices and climate change on hydrology sediment and water quality arnold et al 2012 swat operates on a daily time step and derives key hydrological processes based on hydrological response units hrus defined as unique combinations of land cover soil and topographic conditions neitsch et al 2011 simulations are performed at the hru level aggregated at the subwatershed level and routed through the stream network to the watershed outlet major components of the hydrological cycle considered in swat include surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow channel routing infiltration shallow and deep aquifer contribution and percolation into a confined deeper aquifer in this study surface runoff from daily rainfall is estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number approach and potential evapotranspiration is simulated using penman monteith infiltrated water is distributed in the soil profile and water that percolates below the soil profile is assumed to recharge the shallow aquifer this water can either percolate deeper or flow laterally towards a stream more detailed descriptions of the swat model are available in the documentation provided by the authors in neitsch et al 2011 based on the availability of satellite based remote sensing aet data a 13 year period from 2003 to 2015 was set as the simulated period additionally three first years 2000 2002 were run as a warm up period to allow key model states e g groundwater aquifers to reach equilibrium based on previous studies lópez ballesteros et al 2019 four swat parameters affecting evapotranspiration were selected for manual calibration from 2003 to 2009 using monthly aet data graphical time series plots were used to assess qualitatively model performance in addition to assess quantitatively swat model performance three statistical evaluation indices coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias were used in this study 3 2 1 swat inputs and model setup hydrological modeling was performed using the qgis interface for swat qswat version 1 8 dile et al 2016 swat model requires specific meteorological topographic land use and land cover data for the study area arnold et al 1998 streams and the drainage basin were derived based on a dem of 25 m spatial resolution obtained from the national geographic institute of spain the crops and land use map of spain 2000 2010 at a resolution of 200 m downloaded from the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa 2010 was reclassified into swat land uses related to management practices crop rotations with different crop types and fertilizer application intensities were simulated based on the criteria of francés 2018 the soil maps were extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd nachtergaele et al 2012 which includes the physical characteristics of a large number of typical profiles for each of the soils defined according to the fao classification at a spatial resolution of 1 km based on dem analysis campo de cartagena watershed was discretized into 152 sub basins the swat2lake plugin was used to assist in the watershed s delineation molina navarro et al 2018 afterwards 520 hydrological response units hrus were defined by swat based on the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class 2 2 8 8 a threshold area of 100 ha was applied to optimize processing of the computational model the required daily weather data were obtained from the weather stations of the institute of agriculture and food research and development of murcia region imida within the campo de cartagena watershed for the period 2000 to 2019 3 2 2 data used for model validation in this study model calibration was conducted by comparing the swat simulated aet data with the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 remote sensing evapotranspiration dataset gleam was developed by the vrije university of amsterdam and includes several algorithms aimed to estimate terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from remote sensing data martens et al 2017 in this research gleam version 3b spanning the period from 2003 to 2015 was used the gleam evapotranspiration datasets have been widely validated and applied for many hydro meteorological applications peng et al 2019 lópez ballesteros et al 2019 bai and liu 2018 3 3 hydrodynamic modelling approach qwet is an interface for application of the coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic ecosystem model gotm wet nielsen et al 2017 nielsen et al 2020 in qwet the lake branch of the open source general ocean turbulence model gotm is applied to simulate the vertical water column thermal structure burchard et al 1999 gotm is a one dimensional physically based turbulence closure model which calculates the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate the model thereby simulates the vertical distribution of temperatures which are influenced by the light attenuation that is derived from the water ecosystems tool wet the qwet model complex can be used to quantify evaporation rates and may also be used to close the water balance by deriving the residual water input or output required to achieve a certain water level in our study watershed inflows derived from swat were read into the qwet model complex and the residual in the water balance for the lagoon was derived as a proxy for the net exchange rate between the mar menor lagoon and the mediterranean sea on a daily time step 3 3 1 qwet inputs hydrodynamic simulations by qwet require detailed physical and meteorological input data hypsographic curves were obtained from erena et al 2020 daily rainfall data were obtained from the imida weather station named tp22 fig 1 and meteorological observations wind speed and direction air temperatures air pressure dew point temperature and cloud cover fraction were obtained from the newly released era5 global reanalysis data produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf that provides hourly estimates of the global atmosphere land surface and ocean waves at a horizontal resolution of 31 km herbasch et al 2020 the use of era5 data was driven by the unavailability of some of the meteorological variables at the tp22 station and the demonstrated good agreement of the wind values provided by era5 ramon et al 2019 swat simulations were used as inflows to the mar menor through the use of the qwet built in option that permits the connection with swat outputs 3 3 2 data used for model validation in this study the hydrodynamic model performance was assessed by comparing the qwet simulated temperature data with the observed daily temperature data provided by the autonomous regional government of murcia http canalmarmenor es since the monitored temperature data was only available from 2016 the period 2016 2019 was used for model evaluation and the period 2003 2015 was defined as the initial qwet model warm up 4 results and discussion 4 1 swat model performance swat model was manually calibrated from 2003 to 2009 7 years period and validated from 2010 to 2015 6 years period table 1 shows the initial and calibrated parameter values used for the campo de cartagena watershed some of the calibrated swat parameters include cn2 and sol awc that were reduced by 5 and 10 respectively in addition esco was decreased from 0 95 to 0 75 and epco was decreased from 1 to 0 3 which leads to an increase in the evaporation simulated by the model rchrg dp was fixed to 0 40 based on previous studies jiménez martínez et al 2011 similar parameter values have been found in watersheds in a mediterranean climate molina navarro et al 2014 monthly aet was satisfactorily predicted by the model nse value was 0 68 in calibration and 0 75 in validation with pbias values of 11 43 and 7 35 respectively trend of the observed aet was also simulated with accuracy with r2 values of 0 77 for calibration and 0 78 for validation fig 2 shows that the swat model also performs graphically well in the simulation of the actual evapotranspiration on a monthly basis 4 2 qwet model performance simulated water temperatures spanned the observed water temperature range of approximately 10 30 c and showed fig 3 an appropriate agreement with observed data during the period 2016 2019 by capturing the timing and inter annual variations with an rmse of 0 8 c a bias of 2 7 and an nse of 0 98 which can be considered as acceptable based on previous modeling studies andersen et al 2020 ladwig et al 2020 usually as the hydro and thermodynamics in qwet are based on the physically based gotm model there is little need to calibrate process parameters in the model rather scale factors for wind input data may be used if the temperature simulations are not satisfactory in our case the simulated water temperatures were in good agreement with observations and therefore no further calibration was needed 4 3 water balance the annual water balance of the campo de cartagena watershed for the period 2003 2019 is reported in table 2 the average annual rainfall is about 300 mm supplemented by about 200 mm from other sources mainly from the tswtc that allow crop irrigation in the area as it was expected the semiarid climate of the study area and their intensive agriculture make aet the main component to water loss from the basin with average values above 400 mm it was also found that the average surface runoff 35 1 mm is higher than the groundwater seepage 27 0 mm and significantly higher than the amount of groundwater discharge 4 4 mm considering that a large part of the water that percolates into the quaternary aquifer connects to the aquifers below jiménez martínez et al 2011 the results obtained for the different components of the water balance are in line with those obtained recently by puertes et al 2021 in their hydrological modelling of the ephemeral streams located to the south of the albujón stream related to the mar menor coastal lagoon water balance analysis shows that 44 8 and 26 8 of annual inflows originate from water exchange with the mediterranean sea and from surface runoff respectively fig 4 the direct rainfall contributes around 22 4 on the lake surface while the groundwater discharge provides 6 0 of the total inflow water balance results highlight that the surface runoff is significantly greater than groundwater discharge especially in wetter years the monthly average of simulated water balance components from 2003 to 2019 showed that higher water exchange from the mediterranean sea occurred during the dry season i e may august with the highest inflow in july fig 5 in other months the net water exchange to the mar menor lagoon was much lower because of a higher precipitation surface runoff and groundwater discharge the net water exchange was even negative during november december and january which means that the amount of water draining towards the mediterranean is greater than that entering from the mediterranean 4 3 1 rainfall in general for the years 2003 2019 the average annual amount of precipitation on the mar menor surface was 301 mm over the entire period the maximum annual amount of precipitation in the tp22 station was observed in 2019 567 mm and the minimum in 2014 124 mm as it is characteristic of mediterranean and semi arid climates on a monthly scale 60 of the year s total precipitation is concentrated in 4 months september december another feature of the mediterranean climate is the occurrence of high intensity rainfall events castejón porcel et al 2018 as examples the torrential precipitation episode of 15 19 december of 2016 had a registration of 275 mm or 12 13 september of 2019 when more than 200 mm were registered 4 3 2 evaporation during 2003 2019 annual evaporation ranged between 1293 and 1368 mm year with an average value of 1325 mm year monthly evaporation reaches its minimum values in december january and february with average values below 50 mm month maximum monthly evaporation occurs in july and august reaching values close to 200 mm month an absolute maximum daily value of over 15 mm day occurs in summer while minimum values during winter can be even negative due to condensation martínez álvarez et al 2011 many authors consider that penman monteith evapotranspiration estimation is a suitable approach for obtaining annual evaporation in water bodies cabezas 2009 martínez álvarez et al 2011 in this study the swat model estimates an average evapotranspiration value of 1305 mm year which is consistent with the evaporation values obtained by the qwet model 4 3 3 surface runoff annual average surface runoff to the mar menor for the 2003 2019 period is 49 hm3 year as expected there is a great variability in runoff from year to year depending not only on the amount of precipitation but also on the intensity of precipitation events occurring in that year throughout the study period surface runoff varies from 8 1 hm3 in 2011 where annual rainfall barely exceeded 200 mm to 202 3 hm3 in 2019 the wettest year this large variability is consistent with the findings of other studies performed in the campo de cartagena basin cabezas 2009 in addition the application of a distributed hydrological model has made it possible to quantify the amount of water draining from each of the wadis that flow into the mar menor results show that albujón wadi represents 42 of the total drainage water while maraña and miranda wadis account for 17 and 9 of the total surface runoff respectively in recent years there have been extreme rainfall events in the study area in which significant amount of water drained into the lagoon mobilizing in a few hours volumes of water significantly higher than the annual aquifer discharge altering the salinity of the lagoon suddenly equaling that of the mediterranean and dragging a very significant volume of sediment with the adverse effects that this can generate the impact of these flash floods is another component of the problem that must be taken into account when making recommendations for action and which reaffirms the need for progress in the development of an integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling system to address the problem as an example this study has quantified a total discharge during the isolated depression at high levels occurred in december 2016 of 162 9 hm3 or during the most recent one occurred in september 2019 of 132 1 hm3 4 3 4 groundwater discharge during the last few years several studies have been conducted to determine the volume of groundwater discharge from the aquifer into the mar menor but the results obtained show a high uncertainty with differences from 8 5 hm3 year miteco 2020 to 68 hm3 year jiménez martínez et al 2016 the findings from the swat model simulations presented in our study shows an average water transfer from the aquifer to the mar menor lagoon of 11 1 hm3 year for the period 2003 2019 if we focus specifically at the time period from october 2018 to september 2019 simulated by the most recent study available miteco 2020 we can see that the groundwater discharge obtained in this work 8 5 hm3 is very similar to that obtained by our model for the same period of time 8 64 hm3 it is noteworthy that in contrast to surface runoff the variability of annual groundwater discharges is much lower varying between 7 4 hm3 year and 32 2 hm3 year as a result of the water transferred from the tswt occurring since the 1980s there has been an increase in the aquifers piezometric levels senent aparicio et al 2015 which probably has led to greater groundwater discharges into the mar menor and the generation of a certain flow in the last kilometers of the ephemeral streams especially in albujón stream this study quantifies the flow in this stream to 4 8 hm3 year as an average for the period 2003 2019 which is consistent with the observed stream flows measured by the murcia regional government during the last year carm 2020 4 3 5 water exchange with the mediterranean sea the average annual water exchange with the mediterranean sea is estimated at 82 5 hm3 year for the period 2003 2019 martínez álvarez et al 2011 estimated an average annual water exchange from 2003 to 2006 of around 100 hm3 year this estimate is lower than water exchange estimated in this study where average annual water exchange from 2003 to 2006 was assessed to be 81 8 hm3 year martínez álvarez et al 2011 however did not consider surface runoff other authors such as de pascalis et al 2012 estimated using the shyfem hydrodynamic model for the year 1997 a net exchange of water from the mediterranean sea to the mar menor of 94 hm3 year values that are very close to those obtained in this work the water balance simulation of the mar menor in our study was conducted for a period of time that was much longer than what has been typical of previous studies martínez álvarez et al 2011 garcía oliva et al 2018 garcía oliva et al 2019 this has allowed us to evaluate the different components in the water balance in both very dry years and in very wet years from the results obtained we found that in most of the simulated years the quantity of water that enters the mar menor from the mediterranean sea is greater than the one that goes out from the mar menor to the mediterranean sea however this does not occur in the years 2016 and 2019 due to the large storm and rainfall events that occurred in these years resulting in a greater flow of water towards the mediterranean than the opposite direction only in the wettest months where the runoff generated is great water exchange is greater towards the mediterranean sea table 3 see november december and january it is important to highlight that the approach for deriving the net water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean sea does not consider the water level differences compared to other lagoon systems the mar menor generally have little water level fluctuations ferrarin et al 2014 and consequently it has also been demonstrated that wind speed and direction rather than water level differences are key drivers of the water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean garcía oliva et al 2018 however low frequency sea level fluctuations on a daily monthly or seasonal scale in the western mediterranean are significant gomis et al 2008 bonaduce et al 2016 when determining the average water balance over a long period such sea level influence diminishes but on a monthly or seasonal basis such a contribution can have a significant impact on the water balance this consideration must be taken into account in the development of future models and given its importance it is essential to install specific instrumentation in the mar menor lagoon to measure these water exchanges for an accurate model calibration 4 4 limitations and relevance for policy makers and environmental managers in recent years and because of the serious environmental deterioration of the mar menor great efforts have been made to monitor the lagoon erena et al 2020 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 however the situation in the mar menor watershed is totally different here hardly any gauging stations are present to measure flows caused by storms besides recently installed gauges in the albujón streams in all the other streams that drains into the lagoon there is no point of measurement no systematic information is available on sediment and nutrients transport in the basins except some occasional measures usually in low water levels garcía pintado et al 2007 velasco et al 2006 hence no registration of flooding episodes is carried out despite this is when most of the load is mobilized of sediments and surface contaminants from the basin to the lagoon if other key elements of the water balance are examined as the water exchange with the mediterranean sea the situation is similar and systematic measurements using pressure sensors and acoustic doppler currents profiles adcp have been deployed only very recently lópez castejón 2017 in short the level of data monitoring is very limited and requires an important effort to improve the information needed by decision makers especially in extreme storm events given the current sensitivity of the regional society to the problem of pollution in the mar menor the implementation of citizen science projects could be very effective for hydrological monitoring njue et al 2019 the model obtained based on the methodology presented in this study is a good starting point but future improvements require obtaining more data to reduce the uncertainties inherent in the modelling processes nevertheless as demonstrated in this study the combined application of the swat and qwet models is an effective tool for stakeholders to estimate the components of the water balance the ability to import the swat simulated series of flows sediments or nutrients into the qwet model provides an innovative and easy to use tool for decision makers and can be utilized to simulate the impacts and land use management scenarios on the water quality of the mar menor lagoon 5 conclusions this study is the first methodological attempt to integrate the widely used swat hydrological model with the qwet hydrodynamic ecosystem model this holistic integrated approach has been applied to evaluate the water balance of the mar menor lagoon which is one of the largest lagoon in europe and is characterized by its high environmental value annual rainfall over the mar menor is about 41 hm3 year compared to evaporation from the lagoon of 183 hm3 year and total runoff from the watershed is very variable between 8 and 202 hm3 year the groundwater discharge is of little relative magnitude about 11 hm3 year and variable maximum values reached 32 hm3 year compared with surface runoff the water exchange with the mediterranean sea varies between 160 hm3 year coming into the mar menor in the driest year and 77 hm3 year leaving from the mar menor to the mediterranean sea as a result of the extraordinary storm events in 2019 on average the net water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean sea is 82 hm3 year towards the mar menor lagoon the results of this study can be relevant for stakeholders due to its contribution to a deeper understanding of the water cycle of mar menor despite the scarcity of data and the high degree of anthropization of the study area it has been possible to evaluate the different components of the water balance therefore the model complex developed in our study which focused on hydrology could provide a strong basis for further development with focus on nutrient and ecosystem dynamics such further developed model could be used for scenario simulations and help to better understand how climate and nutrient changes affect the aquatic ecosystem beyond the mar menor study the methodological approach applied in the present study can also be useful for many other highly anthropized sites where observed data are scarce credit authorship contribution statement

3872,a combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling can be applied to understand the hydrology and key water balance components of lakes and lagoons in this research the soil and water assessment tool swat model and the qgis water ecosystems tool qwet were applied for the mar menor coastal lagoon and its watershed known as campo de cartagena first the swat model was calibrated and validated based on remote sensing evapotranspiration data results showed an acceptable performance of the swat model in both calibration r2 0 63 nse 0 62 pbias 2 91 and validation r2 0 68 nse 0 68 pbias 2 47 periods on a monthly basis the swat simulated streamflow was fed into the qwet model to simulate the water balance of the lagoon the hydrodynamic model performance was evaluated based on a comparison between simulated and observed water temperatures and also the model estimated evaporation simulated daily temperatures showed a good agreement with observed data by capturing the timing and inter annual variations with an nse of 0 98 and a bias of 2 7 our water balance estimation using the reference period 2003 2019 yields a mean annual rainfall over the lake of 301 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 1325 mm the average surface runoff and groundwater discharge to the lagoon are 49 hm3 year and 11 hm3 year respectively extreme storm events cause annual surface runoff to vary between 8 hm3 year and 202 hm3 year the water balance was closed with the water exchange with the mediterranean sea resulting in an overall positive flow from the mediterranean sea of 82 hm3 year our study showed that during summer months in particular there is considerable inflow of mediterranean water to the lagoon whereas for some autumn and winter months november december and january there is a net outflow from the lagoon to the mediterranean this novel approach by combining the swat hydrological model and qwet hydrodynamic model complex provides a useful tool for understanding the hydrology of the lagoon and may also play a role for decision makers when developing strategies for mitigating eutrophication keywords swat qwet water balance mar menor coastal lagoons 1 introduction coastal lagoons are shallow water bodies partially or totally isolated from the open sea by sedimentary or anthropic barriers but linked to the sea by one or more inlets kjerfve 1994 these types of lagoons are recognised as one of the most valuable ecosystems for the fishing and aquaculture industries in the world nixon 1982 with ideal conditions for the development of recreational and tourism services which are often concentrated in these areas de pascalis et al 2012 velasco et al 2018 however these natural systems are particularly at risk from increasing anthropogenic pressures such as intensive agriculture and urbanization pressures associated with tourism development viaroli et al 2005 among other threats eutrophication is one of the main causes of water quality deterioration in coastal lagoons le moal et al 2019 developed countries are generally exposed to a greater number of anthropogenic activities making the accurate modelling of these systems much more complex such modelling allows the analysis and simulation of different measures helping to make decisions focused on the cohabitation between human activity and the preservation of the environmental values of these territories garcía ayllón 2017 in the mediterranean sea more than a hundred of these coastal lagoons have been identified pérez ruzafa et al 2011 and in addition to the previously mentioned activities there will also be a negative impact on these lagoons as a consequence of climate change ferrarin et al 2014 it is necessary to understand the different components of the system how they are connected and the cause effect relationships between the drainage basin and the coastal lagoon this paper proposes an integrated approach to modelling such systems that can be used as a first step to improve the management of any of the coastal lagoons that are currently undergoing eutrophication processes around the world from this perspective this research is focused on the mar menor coastal lagoon spain as a representative case of a highly anthropized area experiencing environmental pressures that have emerged over the last few decades as in many other coastal areas of the mediterranean the surroundings of the mar menor which are catalogued as a wetland site of international importance under the ramsar convention and is integrated in the nature 2000 network has suffered from an expansion of farming activities in the watershed and a significant increase in the tourism which led to an increase in nutrient inputs to the mar menor in recent years the process of eutrophication has resulted in a considerable reduction in water transparency affecting the tourism sector and the local economy jimeno sáez et al 2020 the regional government has responded with a series of legislative actions to guarantee a sustainable development of the mar menor environment carm 2017 carm 2018 carm 2019 some of these measures are fertilizer application control and adaptation of best management practices bmps in the watershed draining into the mar menor called campo de cartagena however no evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed measures has yet been carried out due to the complexity of this highly anthropized system and the uncertainty associated with the quantification of certain components of the lagoon s water balance such as the water exchanges with the mediterranean sea and not least the surface runoff and groundwater discharges to the lagoon given this situation a comprehensive understanding of the processes that govern the water balance of the lagoon is an essential foundation to ensure suitable management of this fragile ecosystem in recent years several studies have tried to evaluate the components of the mar menor lagoon water balance but these studies have been characterized by addressing only certain components of the water balance and not taking a holistic approach where all the key water balance components and their relations are quantified in a global framework these studies provide some valuable key individual pieces of the hydrological puzzle but do not provide the full picture of the dynamics and hydrological functioning of the lagoon hence there is a need for a holistic approach which combine hydrological and hydrodynamic models to better understand the big picture and for reducing uncertainties related to the water balance for instance previous studies on the mar menor included hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal lagoon martínez álvarez et al 2011 de pascalis et al 2012 baudron et al 2015 garcía oliva et al 2018 garcía oliva et al 2019 obtaining estimates of certain components of the water balance like the evaporation or the water exchange with the mediterranean sea however these studies disregarded the connection to the campo de cartagena area watershed and aquifer with the mar menor or at best in a very simplified manner for instance de pascalis et al 2012 garcía oliva et al 2018 and garcía oliva et al 2019 adopted a homogeneous runoff coefficient of 6 5 for the entire drainage watershed to proxy surface runoff the contribution of water from campo de cartagena aquifer has also recently been studied e g chs 2015 jiménez martínez et al 2016 domingo pinillos et al 2018 alcolea et al 2019 obtaining very different results which may be attributed to the complexity of the aquifer for example discharges to the mar menor from the aquifer varies from 6 2 mm3 yr chs 2015 to 68 mm3 yr jiménez martínez et al 2016 this large variability is influenced by the extreme anthropogenic activity e g groundwater abstractions and the complex relation between the different aquifer compartments for example more than 2000 wells exist in the area i e 1 18 wells km2 many of which exploit several aquifers through internal connections thus connections between the aquifers which is subject to increasing concern jiménez martínez et al 2016 hydrological modelling studies of the campo de cartagena watershed however are scarce martínez álvarez et al 2011 this is mainly due to the ephemeral character of the rivers and the lack of reliable data of daily discharge alcolea et al 2019 combined the modular groundwater flow modflow model harbaugh 2005 with the hydrological model sphy terink et al 2015 using available hydraulic head measurements to calibrate the groundwater model lópez ballesteros et al 2019 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat model in el beal watercourse one of the ephemeral streams that drains to the mar menor using actual evapotranspiration data aet from remote sensing data to calibrate and validate the model however the total surface runoff that drains into the mar menor coastal lagoon has not yet been assessed to be able to simulate the hydrology of the mar menor watershed the swat model has been chosen for this study because it is a public domain model that run on inputs that can be easily gathered for most watersheds blanco gómez et al 2019 in addition and despite not being the goal of this work the swat model can evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural practices on a watershed scale which could be a future line of research beyond this study swat is usually calibrated using stream discharge stations senent aparicio et al 2017 jimeno sáez et al 2018 however when discharge data are not available remotely sensed data is an alternative solution for calibration purposes herman et al 2020 recent studies proved that the swat model can be calibrated using aet data tobin and bennett 2017 ha et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 lópez ballesteros et al 2019 to simulate the hydro and thermodynamics of the mar menor lagoon the qgis water ecosystems tool qwet has been chosen qwet is an open source tool that provides a graphical user interface for the coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic ecosystem model gotm wet nielsen et al 2017 nielsen et al 2020 the model simulates mixing processes the vertical distribution of temperature and evaporation qwet also provide a link to the swat watershed model whereby swat output can be utilized as input to the qwet model setup to the best of our knowledge none of the recent studies in the mar menor area have combined hydrological and hydrodynamic models and only a few similar studies like this have been carried out world wide inoue et al 2008 dargahi setegn 2011 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 munar et al 2018 lopes et al 2018 coppens et al 2020 of which none of them combined wet and swat models the modelling approach proposed in this research could guide decision makers in the development of an integrated environmental management of the mar menor coastal lagoon and is of great interest to similar coastal lagoons the objectives of this study were to conduct a holistic integrated analysis of the different components of the lagoon water balance and to identify aspects that should be a research priority in order to further advance the quantification of the water balance since water flows are one of the main controlling forces of the physical chemical and biological dynamics of the lagoon their study and characterization must be considered as a key task to advance the scientific knowledge of this case study 2 study area due to the complexity of the integrated watershed lagoon hydrosystem we have separated the description of the case study in 1 the basin that drains into the mar menor coastal lagoon called campo de cartagena 2 the multilayer aquifer under this watershed and 3 the mar menor coastal lagoon an extensive review of human pressures and impacts on the whole campo de cartagena mar menor system can be found in conesa jiménez cárceles 2007 and jiménez martínez et al 2016 2 1 campo de cartagena basin located in the segura river basin se spain which is characterized as one of the most water stressed areas in europe senent aparicio et al 2016 the campo de cartagena watershed covers an area of around 1400 km2 and is characterized by its ephemeral streams usually running dry but which can carry large quantities of water and sediment when torrential rain falls garcía pintado et al 2007 this watershed ranks as one of europe s leading vegetable producers velasco et al 2006 mainly due to the construction of the tagus segura water transfer channel tswtc the tswtc was completed in 1980 and can provide a flow rate of up to 122 million cubic meters per year hm3 year although in recent years and due to water shortages at the headwaters of the tagus river the flow rate has decreased elevating the pressure on groundwater resources and promoting the use of desalination and wastewater reuse rupérez moreno et al 2017 shortage of water has led to the implementation of drip irrigation and generally a need to make good use of the limited water available senent aparicio et al 2015 tourism on the coast of the mar menor lagoon is also a major contributor to the local economy jimeno sáez et al 2020 and mining in the southern part of the basin was one of the main activities in the past although it has now ceased navarro et al 2008 according to the weather data used in this study this basin is one of the most arid of the mediterranean area with an annual precipitation amount from 2000 to 2019 that ranges from 166 mm to 469 mm where average precipitation is less than 300 mm per year and the annual averages for maximum and minimum daily temperatures were 23 7 c and 13 0 c respectively the precipitation is unevenly distributed into a few high intensity events mainly in spring and autumn regarding topography the altitude ranges from sea level to 1063 m a s l but most of the area is flat with over 36 of the watershed with slopes of less than 2 the primary land use of the campo de cartagena watershed is intensive irrigated agriculture around 50 of the total area the dominant soil type is calcaric cambisols 71 which is mainly composed of sand and silt 2 2 campo de cartagena aquifer the watershed described above is settled over the campo de cartagena aquifer this aquifer is a multi layered system composed of deep confined aquifers and an unconfined shallow aquifer quaternary groundwater is a major contributor to the sustainability of local agriculture along with water supplied by the tswtc and the recent increase in public desalinated seawater and private brackish water treatment plants senent aparicio et al 2015 2 3 mar menor coastal lagoon the mar menor is a hypersaline coastal lagoon with an immense socio economic and ecological value and a clear case of a severely anthropized hydroecosystem in southeastern spain velasco et al 2018 it has a surface area of 135 km2 covering a coastline of 73 km and contains five volcanic islands the mar menor is considered a shallow lagoon with an average depth of 4 4 m being the maximum depth around 7 m umgiesser et al 2014 a 22 km long sandy coastal barrier known as la manga isolates the lagoon from the mediterranean sea and is intersected by three inlets las encañizadas estacio marchamalo facilitating exchanges of waters between the mediterranean sea and the lagoon fig 1 d the most important water exchange takes place through the estacio channel in 1973 this channel was dredged and broadened to make it nautical navigable baudron et al 2015 among the most significant environmental sites in the mediterranean area is the mar menor where many economic and industrial activities meet conesa jiménez cárceles 2007 its unique weather conditions and abundant natural resources have attracted tourism recreational and fishing uses without forgetting the relevance of farming to the local economy the process of economic social and urban transformation that has affected the lagoon in the past half century and even before in the case of mining has led to a multitude of impacts on the physical and natural environment and makes the mar menor an area in need of special protection carm 2019 the situation far from improving has deteriorated in recent years in 2016 profound eutrophication generated by a severe increase in the nutrients occurred consequently chlorophyll concentrations rose which was responsible for the loss of 85 of the vegetation cover and a strong public awareness not only from an ecological point of view but also in the tourism sector garcía ayllón 2018 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 during 11 14 september 2019 extreme storm events corresponding to a return period of 500 years caused extensive flash flooding in the campo de cartagena basin causing a strong increase in chlorophyll levels and a sudden drop in salinity that caused the death of thousands of fish 3 methodology 3 1 framework for evaluating the water balance in the mar menor coastal lagoon this study combines qwet with swat model to assess the mar menor water balance for the period 2003 2019 it includes the following steps 1 swat model was calibrated and validated in the campo de cartagena watershed on a monthly basis using remote sensing evapotranspiration data 2 hydrodynamic component of qwet model was simulated using swat model outputs as an input comparing the results obtained with the available observed temperature measurements 3 using the calibrated swat and qwet models mar menor water balance was simulated and all its components were analyzed and discussed 3 2 hydrological modelling approach swat is a continuous physically based and semi distributed hydrological model developed for exploring the effects of agricultural management practices and climate change on hydrology sediment and water quality arnold et al 2012 swat operates on a daily time step and derives key hydrological processes based on hydrological response units hrus defined as unique combinations of land cover soil and topographic conditions neitsch et al 2011 simulations are performed at the hru level aggregated at the subwatershed level and routed through the stream network to the watershed outlet major components of the hydrological cycle considered in swat include surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow channel routing infiltration shallow and deep aquifer contribution and percolation into a confined deeper aquifer in this study surface runoff from daily rainfall is estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number approach and potential evapotranspiration is simulated using penman monteith infiltrated water is distributed in the soil profile and water that percolates below the soil profile is assumed to recharge the shallow aquifer this water can either percolate deeper or flow laterally towards a stream more detailed descriptions of the swat model are available in the documentation provided by the authors in neitsch et al 2011 based on the availability of satellite based remote sensing aet data a 13 year period from 2003 to 2015 was set as the simulated period additionally three first years 2000 2002 were run as a warm up period to allow key model states e g groundwater aquifers to reach equilibrium based on previous studies lópez ballesteros et al 2019 four swat parameters affecting evapotranspiration were selected for manual calibration from 2003 to 2009 using monthly aet data graphical time series plots were used to assess qualitatively model performance in addition to assess quantitatively swat model performance three statistical evaluation indices coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias were used in this study 3 2 1 swat inputs and model setup hydrological modeling was performed using the qgis interface for swat qswat version 1 8 dile et al 2016 swat model requires specific meteorological topographic land use and land cover data for the study area arnold et al 1998 streams and the drainage basin were derived based on a dem of 25 m spatial resolution obtained from the national geographic institute of spain the crops and land use map of spain 2000 2010 at a resolution of 200 m downloaded from the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa 2010 was reclassified into swat land uses related to management practices crop rotations with different crop types and fertilizer application intensities were simulated based on the criteria of francés 2018 the soil maps were extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd nachtergaele et al 2012 which includes the physical characteristics of a large number of typical profiles for each of the soils defined according to the fao classification at a spatial resolution of 1 km based on dem analysis campo de cartagena watershed was discretized into 152 sub basins the swat2lake plugin was used to assist in the watershed s delineation molina navarro et al 2018 afterwards 520 hydrological response units hrus were defined by swat based on the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class 2 2 8 8 a threshold area of 100 ha was applied to optimize processing of the computational model the required daily weather data were obtained from the weather stations of the institute of agriculture and food research and development of murcia region imida within the campo de cartagena watershed for the period 2000 to 2019 3 2 2 data used for model validation in this study model calibration was conducted by comparing the swat simulated aet data with the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 remote sensing evapotranspiration dataset gleam was developed by the vrije university of amsterdam and includes several algorithms aimed to estimate terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from remote sensing data martens et al 2017 in this research gleam version 3b spanning the period from 2003 to 2015 was used the gleam evapotranspiration datasets have been widely validated and applied for many hydro meteorological applications peng et al 2019 lópez ballesteros et al 2019 bai and liu 2018 3 3 hydrodynamic modelling approach qwet is an interface for application of the coupled one dimensional hydrodynamic ecosystem model gotm wet nielsen et al 2017 nielsen et al 2020 in qwet the lake branch of the open source general ocean turbulence model gotm is applied to simulate the vertical water column thermal structure burchard et al 1999 gotm is a one dimensional physically based turbulence closure model which calculates the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate the model thereby simulates the vertical distribution of temperatures which are influenced by the light attenuation that is derived from the water ecosystems tool wet the qwet model complex can be used to quantify evaporation rates and may also be used to close the water balance by deriving the residual water input or output required to achieve a certain water level in our study watershed inflows derived from swat were read into the qwet model complex and the residual in the water balance for the lagoon was derived as a proxy for the net exchange rate between the mar menor lagoon and the mediterranean sea on a daily time step 3 3 1 qwet inputs hydrodynamic simulations by qwet require detailed physical and meteorological input data hypsographic curves were obtained from erena et al 2020 daily rainfall data were obtained from the imida weather station named tp22 fig 1 and meteorological observations wind speed and direction air temperatures air pressure dew point temperature and cloud cover fraction were obtained from the newly released era5 global reanalysis data produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf that provides hourly estimates of the global atmosphere land surface and ocean waves at a horizontal resolution of 31 km herbasch et al 2020 the use of era5 data was driven by the unavailability of some of the meteorological variables at the tp22 station and the demonstrated good agreement of the wind values provided by era5 ramon et al 2019 swat simulations were used as inflows to the mar menor through the use of the qwet built in option that permits the connection with swat outputs 3 3 2 data used for model validation in this study the hydrodynamic model performance was assessed by comparing the qwet simulated temperature data with the observed daily temperature data provided by the autonomous regional government of murcia http canalmarmenor es since the monitored temperature data was only available from 2016 the period 2016 2019 was used for model evaluation and the period 2003 2015 was defined as the initial qwet model warm up 4 results and discussion 4 1 swat model performance swat model was manually calibrated from 2003 to 2009 7 years period and validated from 2010 to 2015 6 years period table 1 shows the initial and calibrated parameter values used for the campo de cartagena watershed some of the calibrated swat parameters include cn2 and sol awc that were reduced by 5 and 10 respectively in addition esco was decreased from 0 95 to 0 75 and epco was decreased from 1 to 0 3 which leads to an increase in the evaporation simulated by the model rchrg dp was fixed to 0 40 based on previous studies jiménez martínez et al 2011 similar parameter values have been found in watersheds in a mediterranean climate molina navarro et al 2014 monthly aet was satisfactorily predicted by the model nse value was 0 68 in calibration and 0 75 in validation with pbias values of 11 43 and 7 35 respectively trend of the observed aet was also simulated with accuracy with r2 values of 0 77 for calibration and 0 78 for validation fig 2 shows that the swat model also performs graphically well in the simulation of the actual evapotranspiration on a monthly basis 4 2 qwet model performance simulated water temperatures spanned the observed water temperature range of approximately 10 30 c and showed fig 3 an appropriate agreement with observed data during the period 2016 2019 by capturing the timing and inter annual variations with an rmse of 0 8 c a bias of 2 7 and an nse of 0 98 which can be considered as acceptable based on previous modeling studies andersen et al 2020 ladwig et al 2020 usually as the hydro and thermodynamics in qwet are based on the physically based gotm model there is little need to calibrate process parameters in the model rather scale factors for wind input data may be used if the temperature simulations are not satisfactory in our case the simulated water temperatures were in good agreement with observations and therefore no further calibration was needed 4 3 water balance the annual water balance of the campo de cartagena watershed for the period 2003 2019 is reported in table 2 the average annual rainfall is about 300 mm supplemented by about 200 mm from other sources mainly from the tswtc that allow crop irrigation in the area as it was expected the semiarid climate of the study area and their intensive agriculture make aet the main component to water loss from the basin with average values above 400 mm it was also found that the average surface runoff 35 1 mm is higher than the groundwater seepage 27 0 mm and significantly higher than the amount of groundwater discharge 4 4 mm considering that a large part of the water that percolates into the quaternary aquifer connects to the aquifers below jiménez martínez et al 2011 the results obtained for the different components of the water balance are in line with those obtained recently by puertes et al 2021 in their hydrological modelling of the ephemeral streams located to the south of the albujón stream related to the mar menor coastal lagoon water balance analysis shows that 44 8 and 26 8 of annual inflows originate from water exchange with the mediterranean sea and from surface runoff respectively fig 4 the direct rainfall contributes around 22 4 on the lake surface while the groundwater discharge provides 6 0 of the total inflow water balance results highlight that the surface runoff is significantly greater than groundwater discharge especially in wetter years the monthly average of simulated water balance components from 2003 to 2019 showed that higher water exchange from the mediterranean sea occurred during the dry season i e may august with the highest inflow in july fig 5 in other months the net water exchange to the mar menor lagoon was much lower because of a higher precipitation surface runoff and groundwater discharge the net water exchange was even negative during november december and january which means that the amount of water draining towards the mediterranean is greater than that entering from the mediterranean 4 3 1 rainfall in general for the years 2003 2019 the average annual amount of precipitation on the mar menor surface was 301 mm over the entire period the maximum annual amount of precipitation in the tp22 station was observed in 2019 567 mm and the minimum in 2014 124 mm as it is characteristic of mediterranean and semi arid climates on a monthly scale 60 of the year s total precipitation is concentrated in 4 months september december another feature of the mediterranean climate is the occurrence of high intensity rainfall events castejón porcel et al 2018 as examples the torrential precipitation episode of 15 19 december of 2016 had a registration of 275 mm or 12 13 september of 2019 when more than 200 mm were registered 4 3 2 evaporation during 2003 2019 annual evaporation ranged between 1293 and 1368 mm year with an average value of 1325 mm year monthly evaporation reaches its minimum values in december january and february with average values below 50 mm month maximum monthly evaporation occurs in july and august reaching values close to 200 mm month an absolute maximum daily value of over 15 mm day occurs in summer while minimum values during winter can be even negative due to condensation martínez álvarez et al 2011 many authors consider that penman monteith evapotranspiration estimation is a suitable approach for obtaining annual evaporation in water bodies cabezas 2009 martínez álvarez et al 2011 in this study the swat model estimates an average evapotranspiration value of 1305 mm year which is consistent with the evaporation values obtained by the qwet model 4 3 3 surface runoff annual average surface runoff to the mar menor for the 2003 2019 period is 49 hm3 year as expected there is a great variability in runoff from year to year depending not only on the amount of precipitation but also on the intensity of precipitation events occurring in that year throughout the study period surface runoff varies from 8 1 hm3 in 2011 where annual rainfall barely exceeded 200 mm to 202 3 hm3 in 2019 the wettest year this large variability is consistent with the findings of other studies performed in the campo de cartagena basin cabezas 2009 in addition the application of a distributed hydrological model has made it possible to quantify the amount of water draining from each of the wadis that flow into the mar menor results show that albujón wadi represents 42 of the total drainage water while maraña and miranda wadis account for 17 and 9 of the total surface runoff respectively in recent years there have been extreme rainfall events in the study area in which significant amount of water drained into the lagoon mobilizing in a few hours volumes of water significantly higher than the annual aquifer discharge altering the salinity of the lagoon suddenly equaling that of the mediterranean and dragging a very significant volume of sediment with the adverse effects that this can generate the impact of these flash floods is another component of the problem that must be taken into account when making recommendations for action and which reaffirms the need for progress in the development of an integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling system to address the problem as an example this study has quantified a total discharge during the isolated depression at high levels occurred in december 2016 of 162 9 hm3 or during the most recent one occurred in september 2019 of 132 1 hm3 4 3 4 groundwater discharge during the last few years several studies have been conducted to determine the volume of groundwater discharge from the aquifer into the mar menor but the results obtained show a high uncertainty with differences from 8 5 hm3 year miteco 2020 to 68 hm3 year jiménez martínez et al 2016 the findings from the swat model simulations presented in our study shows an average water transfer from the aquifer to the mar menor lagoon of 11 1 hm3 year for the period 2003 2019 if we focus specifically at the time period from october 2018 to september 2019 simulated by the most recent study available miteco 2020 we can see that the groundwater discharge obtained in this work 8 5 hm3 is very similar to that obtained by our model for the same period of time 8 64 hm3 it is noteworthy that in contrast to surface runoff the variability of annual groundwater discharges is much lower varying between 7 4 hm3 year and 32 2 hm3 year as a result of the water transferred from the tswt occurring since the 1980s there has been an increase in the aquifers piezometric levels senent aparicio et al 2015 which probably has led to greater groundwater discharges into the mar menor and the generation of a certain flow in the last kilometers of the ephemeral streams especially in albujón stream this study quantifies the flow in this stream to 4 8 hm3 year as an average for the period 2003 2019 which is consistent with the observed stream flows measured by the murcia regional government during the last year carm 2020 4 3 5 water exchange with the mediterranean sea the average annual water exchange with the mediterranean sea is estimated at 82 5 hm3 year for the period 2003 2019 martínez álvarez et al 2011 estimated an average annual water exchange from 2003 to 2006 of around 100 hm3 year this estimate is lower than water exchange estimated in this study where average annual water exchange from 2003 to 2006 was assessed to be 81 8 hm3 year martínez álvarez et al 2011 however did not consider surface runoff other authors such as de pascalis et al 2012 estimated using the shyfem hydrodynamic model for the year 1997 a net exchange of water from the mediterranean sea to the mar menor of 94 hm3 year values that are very close to those obtained in this work the water balance simulation of the mar menor in our study was conducted for a period of time that was much longer than what has been typical of previous studies martínez álvarez et al 2011 garcía oliva et al 2018 garcía oliva et al 2019 this has allowed us to evaluate the different components in the water balance in both very dry years and in very wet years from the results obtained we found that in most of the simulated years the quantity of water that enters the mar menor from the mediterranean sea is greater than the one that goes out from the mar menor to the mediterranean sea however this does not occur in the years 2016 and 2019 due to the large storm and rainfall events that occurred in these years resulting in a greater flow of water towards the mediterranean than the opposite direction only in the wettest months where the runoff generated is great water exchange is greater towards the mediterranean sea table 3 see november december and january it is important to highlight that the approach for deriving the net water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean sea does not consider the water level differences compared to other lagoon systems the mar menor generally have little water level fluctuations ferrarin et al 2014 and consequently it has also been demonstrated that wind speed and direction rather than water level differences are key drivers of the water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean garcía oliva et al 2018 however low frequency sea level fluctuations on a daily monthly or seasonal scale in the western mediterranean are significant gomis et al 2008 bonaduce et al 2016 when determining the average water balance over a long period such sea level influence diminishes but on a monthly or seasonal basis such a contribution can have a significant impact on the water balance this consideration must be taken into account in the development of future models and given its importance it is essential to install specific instrumentation in the mar menor lagoon to measure these water exchanges for an accurate model calibration 4 4 limitations and relevance for policy makers and environmental managers in recent years and because of the serious environmental deterioration of the mar menor great efforts have been made to monitor the lagoon erena et al 2020 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 however the situation in the mar menor watershed is totally different here hardly any gauging stations are present to measure flows caused by storms besides recently installed gauges in the albujón streams in all the other streams that drains into the lagoon there is no point of measurement no systematic information is available on sediment and nutrients transport in the basins except some occasional measures usually in low water levels garcía pintado et al 2007 velasco et al 2006 hence no registration of flooding episodes is carried out despite this is when most of the load is mobilized of sediments and surface contaminants from the basin to the lagoon if other key elements of the water balance are examined as the water exchange with the mediterranean sea the situation is similar and systematic measurements using pressure sensors and acoustic doppler currents profiles adcp have been deployed only very recently lópez castejón 2017 in short the level of data monitoring is very limited and requires an important effort to improve the information needed by decision makers especially in extreme storm events given the current sensitivity of the regional society to the problem of pollution in the mar menor the implementation of citizen science projects could be very effective for hydrological monitoring njue et al 2019 the model obtained based on the methodology presented in this study is a good starting point but future improvements require obtaining more data to reduce the uncertainties inherent in the modelling processes nevertheless as demonstrated in this study the combined application of the swat and qwet models is an effective tool for stakeholders to estimate the components of the water balance the ability to import the swat simulated series of flows sediments or nutrients into the qwet model provides an innovative and easy to use tool for decision makers and can be utilized to simulate the impacts and land use management scenarios on the water quality of the mar menor lagoon 5 conclusions this study is the first methodological attempt to integrate the widely used swat hydrological model with the qwet hydrodynamic ecosystem model this holistic integrated approach has been applied to evaluate the water balance of the mar menor lagoon which is one of the largest lagoon in europe and is characterized by its high environmental value annual rainfall over the mar menor is about 41 hm3 year compared to evaporation from the lagoon of 183 hm3 year and total runoff from the watershed is very variable between 8 and 202 hm3 year the groundwater discharge is of little relative magnitude about 11 hm3 year and variable maximum values reached 32 hm3 year compared with surface runoff the water exchange with the mediterranean sea varies between 160 hm3 year coming into the mar menor in the driest year and 77 hm3 year leaving from the mar menor to the mediterranean sea as a result of the extraordinary storm events in 2019 on average the net water exchange between the mar menor and the mediterranean sea is 82 hm3 year towards the mar menor lagoon the results of this study can be relevant for stakeholders due to its contribution to a deeper understanding of the water cycle of mar menor despite the scarcity of data and the high degree of anthropization of the study area it has been possible to evaluate the different components of the water balance therefore the model complex developed in our study which focused on hydrology could provide a strong basis for further development with focus on nutrient and ecosystem dynamics such further developed model could be used for scenario simulations and help to better understand how climate and nutrient changes affect the aquatic ecosystem beyond the mar menor study the methodological approach applied in the present study can also be useful for many other highly anthropized sites where observed data are scarce credit authorship contribution statement

which provides a good fingerprint of different oc sources in rivers he et al 2019 wen et al 2020 several source apportionment models and a series of procedures using stable isotope signatures were developed to calculate the contributions of all potential sources to bulk doc including the isosource mixsir isotoper and stable isotope analyses in r siar parnell et al 2010 phillips and gregg 2003 siar is becoming one of the most popular resources due to its precise estimation and open source and it can precisely estimate the sources contributing proportion to a mixture coping with too much variation based on the bayesian approaches parnell et al 2010 besides fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was successfully used to characterize the detailed molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom in fluvial systems as a high resolution technique he et al 2019 kamjunke et al 2017 valle et al 2020 the ultrahigh resolution of ft icr ms allowed the researchers to trace the differences in molecular levels between distinct dom pools kamjunke et al 2017 valle et al 2020 previous studies have proven that the riverine oc transport and composition were co affected by the basin characteristics season hydrology trophic state and human activities bhattacharya and osburn 2020 butman et al 2015 maavara et al 2017 typically dom in aquatic ecosystems is derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources dom composition also varies due to the various sources studies have shown that domestic sewage discharge and agricultural activity have significant influences on dom concentration in rivers wen et al 2020 wen et al 2021 the anthropogenic land use and land cover lulc activity has significant influences on dom molecular composition in rivers fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 xenopoulos et al 2021 a maximum concentration of dom with a remarkably high content of aromatic and humic like material derived from surface soil and litter layers was observed in the yukon river during the spring flush spencer et al 2008 in forested watersheds during non storm periods the low molecular weight dom molecules in the upper soil horizons and leaf debris were tended to contribute to the streams inamdar et al 2012 the degree of dom processing during downstream transport in the congo river basin is a function of landscape characteristics and water residence time lambert et al 2016 however knowledge is lacking in the influence of multi factor superposition on the flux and composition of riverine doc china is the largest asian country and many chinese rivers enter oceans the annual total flux of riverine doc entering the marginal seas in china showed a significant linear increase during 1953 2016 with the value of 2 75 0 13 10 3 pg c yr in the 1950 s but 5 02 0 3 10 3 pg c yr in the 2010 s on average the annual total doc flux increased by 4 1 10 5 pg c yr liu et al 2020 but the sources and composition of riverine doc were not well understood more importantly these river basins are characterized by various types of landforms and varying degrees of human disturbance serving as an ideal case to characterize the source and composition of riverine doc into the marginal sea under changes in both watershed characteristics and local human activities globally the present studies mainly pay attention to estimate long term riverine oc fluxes wang et al 2016 yue et al 2016 and most of these studies were conducted in a single river e g yangtze river the comparative studies on oc fluxes among different rivers were relatively sparse especially when it comes to carbon seasonal changes in different rivers drake et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 besides studies on the river oc flux were mostly conducted near the hydrological stations on the river which are usually far from estuaries whereas the amount and quality of oc from this location to the estuary is likely to change dramatically ward et al 2015 in contrast the related studies conducted by oceanographers using research vessels were usually based on the samples from the coastal ocean and the sampling sites were several kilometers away from the estuary shallow water to avoid standing therefore the accurate data about riverine oc flux into the marginal sea are difficult to access considering the projecting model on the future climate change shows that rainfall and flood will be further increased in the future such as in china nepal and indonesia du et al 2019 li et al 2016 saurav et al 2021 yamamoto et al 2021 it is necessary to better constrain the quantity and quality of riverine doc in this study surface water samples were collected from 48 chinese estuaries 7 river basins in 2019 in four different seasons we considered concentrations sources and the molecular compositions of oc in combination with the stable isotopic analysis and ft icr ms analysis this study aimed to 1 evaluate the concentrations of riverine doc and poc in different seasons and river basins 2 assess the sources of oc that contribute to the doc pools in different river basins and 3 assess the molecular compositions of dom in different river basins our results semi quantified the contributions of the natural and anthropogenic inputs to doc in chinese rivers entering marginal seas for the first time and highlighted the effect of the anthropogenic activities on molecular compositions of riverine dom this work also aims to provide critical background information for ongoing research of regional and global riverine carbon cycling and put forward the method for evaluating the potential impact of natural and human disturbances on riverine oc components 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection from north to south

pearl river fig 1 the drainage area of all studied rivers is detailed in the supporting materials the land use types in these studied river basins are shown in fig s1a the farmland is the dominant land use type in liaohe river basin huaihe river basin and haihe river basin with percentages of 36 9 49 8 and 68 9 respectively fig s1b in other studied river basins the farmland is the secondary use type followed by the forest or grassland fig s1b the percentages of the artificial land in these basins range from 2 4 in yellow river basin to 13 8 in huaihe river basin fig s1b the more watershed characteristics of these river basins were detailed in the supporting materials the sampling campaign in each river was repeated four times covered four seasons in turn in january april july and october respectively in 2019 a total of 192 river water samples were collected fig 1 we grouped all sampled rivers by seven river basins including the liaohe river basin n 20 haihe river basin n 40 yellow river basin n 8 huaihe river basin n 28 yangtze river basin n 12 southeastern rivers n 48 and pearl river basin n 36 for each river the sampling station was purposely designed at the most downstream location assuming that it would be more representative of the whole basin during the sampling we have designed more than one sampling station downstream of each river and we measured the salinity psu water temperature c and ph value of river water in situ using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi 6600 u s we finally adopted the most downstream station with a very similar salinity with the upstream location salinity 1 psu assuming there was no inwelling at this sampling station all in situ data and details of these measurements are shown in supplementary table s1 surface water was sampled at a depth of 0 1 0 3 m with a unistrong g3 gps receiver to record the location 2 2 water quality measurements to determine doc concentrations water samples were first filtered through 0 45 μm pre cleaned glass fiber filters bandao industrial co ltd china within 24 h of the water being transported to the laboratory then doc concentrations in the filtered water were measured by a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu corporation japan through high temperature catalytic oxidation 680 c blanks and replications analysis showed a detection limit of

samples to prevent isotope fractionation the pretreatment process of dom samples for δ13c analysis first water samplings were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters then 4 ml filtered water samples were transferred to 12 ml amber borosilicate vials with the addition of 1 ml of h3po4 reagent mixture 4 0 g sodium persulfate and 1 0 g anhydrous phosphoric acid were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water and stored at ambient temperature finally stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotopes of the filtrate were analyzed using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer precision of 0 2 for δ13c and 0 5 for δ15n mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the accuracy of δ13c of the instrument is better than 0 06 the isotope composition of dom was reported using delta δ notation and the values of δ13c and δ15n are expressed in parts per thousand relative to the international standard v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite and atmospheric n2 gas with the equation where r is the ratio of 13c 12c or 15n 14n δ 13 c o r δ 15 n r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample is the 13c 12c or 15n 14n of a sample and rstandard is the 13c 12c or 15n 14n of the v pdb sample and atmospheric n2 gas 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms out of a total of 192 river samples 16 samples were analyzed by ft icr ms these 16 samples were from 8 rivers both july and october across china from north to south including liaohe river haihe river jiyun river yellow river yangtze river huangpu river feiyun river and pearl river all 16 samples c a 1 l each were filtered through 0 45 μm filters to obtain dom then the filtrate contained dom was acidified further isolated by solid phase extraction agilent bond elut ppl 200 mg 3 ml and eluted with meoh dittmar et al 2008 the recovery efficiencies of ppl ranged from 55 to 66 58 on average n 16 on a doc basis ft icr ms were acquired using a 9 4 t bruker solarix mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany hyphenated to an esi source in the negative ion mode to analyze the methanol eluent of spe dom the detailed information on ft icr ms measurement of dom is provided in the supporting material and the measurement was conducted at the heavy oil processing laboratory china university of petroleum located in beijing all 16 samples were analyzed in duplicate to assess the reproducibility of the ft icr ms acquisitions and only the formulas presented in both duplicates are considered and used to calculate a series of molecular parameters weight average parameters including h c w o c w molecular weight mww modified aromaticity index aiw molecular lability index mlbw and double bond equivalence dbew the subscript w stands for intensity weighted average were calculated by the sum of the intensity weighted chemical parameters divided by the sum of all the intensities belonging to the chemical parameters the final chemical formula assignments were classified into four groups cho chon chos or chons molecular formulas were further assigned to the following groups according to the elementary composition as described by the references hertkorn et al 2006 seidel et al 2015 including polycyclic aromatics saturated fatty acids polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds peptide like formulas sugars and carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds crams the detailed information is provided in the supporting material 2 5 data analysis the stable isotope analyses in r siar model was used to integrate the δ15n and δ13c values to quantify the proportional contributions of the potential carbon sources to the organic carbon in river water based on bayesian parnell et al 2010 the three potential carbon sources in this study were the terrigenous sources plants and soil autochthonous sources phytoplankton and hydrophyte and anthropogenic sources e g sewage the detailed information is provided in the supporting material the main function of the siar package allows the user to specify the data and choose the size of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc run the model was run for 200 000 iterations with a burn in of 50 000 into siar package in this study the differences in dom molecular composition in summer and autumn were analyzed with anova paired t test the normal distribution was conducted before the paired t test using spss 23 0 for windows relationships among the doc source and its molecular composition parameters were tested using spearman s rank correlation matrix with statistical significance set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 riverine organic carbon concentrations doc and poc values in these river waters ranged from 2 05 to 13 82 mg c l and 0 71 to 25 68 mg c l respectively fig 2 in this study both doc and poc concentrations displayed significantly different seasonal trends p 0 05 in four seasons the autumn river showed the highest mean doc and poc values fig 2 table s2 in all river basins the haihe river basin showed the highest mean doc concentration followed by huaihe river basin fig 2a the highest mean poc value was shown in the yellow river basin fig 2b besides poc concentrations in these rivers in mainland china showed a significantly positive correlation with water tsm fig 3 b doc concentration showed a significant positive correlation with water salinity 0 to 1 psu but no significant correlation with chlorophyll a chla concentrations fig 3a and c there is no significant correlation between doc and poc concentrations in all the rivers fig 3d 3 2 stable isotopic composition of riverine dom the δ13c signature of riverine dom showed large variability ranging from 26 8 to 11 2 with the lowest value in winter mean value 22 6 3 6 and highest in summer mean value 15 6 3 1 the δ15n signature of riverine dom showed large variability ranging from 3 1 to 18 fig 4 based on the δ13c and δ15n signatures for the different rivers the water samples in the same season clustered close to each other which indicated that the sources might have significant seasonal differences here we defined that riverine oc mainly originated from three parts the terrigenous sources plants and soils autochthonous sources phytoplankton and hydrophyte and the anthropogenic pollution and waste effluents in this study we defined them as the anthropogenic sources as also described in previous studies fabre et al 2019 raymond et al 2004 the proportional contributions of these carbon sources to dom in these river waters were analyzed based on the δ13c and δ15n signatures fig 5 and fig s2 table s3 the results indicated that most of the dom in these rivers entering marginal seas came from the terrigenous sources with a range of 60 6 68 4 followed by the autochthonous matters 18 6 25 6 and the anthropogenic sewage 7 6 13 7 in four seasons fig 5a in this study the proportion of autochthonous inputs reached the highest value in autumn fig 5a the proportion contributions of anthropogenic sources to dom were similar in all seasons except summer only 7 6 across seven river basins the major contributor to dom was all the terrigenous sources but there was a significant difference in the proportional contribution in different river basins p 0 05 with a maximum of 68 2 in southeastern rivers and a minimum of 54 6 in the huaihe river basin fig 5b the contribution of autochthonous inputs on dom showed small variations 24 8 28 5 across the seven river basins fig 5b the effect of anthropogenic sources on dom was different in seven river basins the contributions of anthropogenic sewage ranged from 7 1 to 16 9 and the contributions in the huaihe river basin and haihe river basin were significantly higher p 0 05 than other river basins fig 5b the relationship between the land use types and proportional contribution mean value of each potential carbon source to dom was also analyzed the results showed that the contribution of c3 plants one of the terrigenous sources to dom was significantly and positively correlated with the percentage of forest area in the basin fig 6 a the contribution of sewage anthropogenic sources to dom was significantly and positively correlated with the percentages of artificial land and farmland in the basin fig 6b and c 3 3 molecular composition of riverine dom as determined by ft icr ms solid phase extracted dom for these river samples in summer and autumn contained between 5648 and 7661 molecular formulas fig s3 table 1 the weighted average molecular weight mw ranges from 360 to 389 da and 364 to 394 da of riverine dom in summer and autumn respectively in both summer and autumn carbohydrates cho and the nitrogen containing compounds chon are the most abundant regarding weighted intensity with the high proportions of 38 81 and 14 22 respectively table 1 the averaged cho in dom from summer surface waters is lower than that from autumn for all rivers except sr and pr the averaged chon in dom from summer surface waters is lower than that from autumn for all rivers except yr and cj the averaged chos and chons in dom from summer surface waters is higher than that from autumn for all rivers except sr and pr table 1 among the seven river basins dom showed a large range of s containing formula contents with the highest value in the haihe river basin and the lowest value in southeastern rivers table 1 although most of the molecular formulas were shared common formulas in both summer and autumn from the same river as observed in the haihe river fig 7 e f there were pools of unique molecular formulas detected only in summer or autumn for instance there were more unique chos and chons formulas detected in summer than those detected in autumn of the haihe river fig 7a b in contrast more unique cho and chon formulas were detected in autumn than that in summer of the haihe river fig 7c d a similar molecular compositional difference between summer and autumn was also observed in all other rivers the large ranges of aiw and dbew values suggested that dom molecular composition in the studied rivers had remarkable differences in the aromaticity and unsaturation degree koch and dittmar 2006 but no significant difference was presented between summer and autumn p 0 05 mlbw is used to estimate the overall lability of the dom with higher mlbw indicating higher molecular lability the summer samples did not show a significantly higher averaged mlbw than those in the autumn p 0 05 in total the highly unsaturated compound group including soil derived products of lignin degradation is the most abundant group of all detected compounds based on the detailed molecular formulas identified from ft icr ms this compound group displayed 4049 and 4297 mean value assigned molecular formulas corresponding to 75 and 78 by relative intensity for the summer and the autumn samples respectively in comparison sugars are the least abundant group and only account for 0 5 of all detected formulas in both summer and autumn table 1 in organic chemistry the organic compounds are generally divided into three classes based on the carbon skeleton structure carbocyclic compound open chain compound and heterocyclic compound simanek 2006 in this study the detailed molecular components of dom of different river waters are analyzed to compare the differences between summer and autumn fig 8 there was no significant difference between the three classes of organic compounds in dom between the two seasons p 0 05 either summer or autumn the carbocyclic compound group including the carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds cram polyphenols and black carbon was the major component of dom in all basins with the proportion of 72 2 93 1 and the highest and lowest values were observed in haihe river basin and southeastern rivers respectively fig 8 secondly the open chain compounds the unsaturated aliphatics and the saturated fatty acids were presented in dom with the proportion of 6 7 21 6 in these rivers the dom in southeastern rivers showed the largest proportion of the open chain compounds in both summer and autumn the other compounds including heterocyclic compounds only occupied 0 3 10 7 of the total molecular formulas 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal variations in sources contribution to riverine doc in this study both doc and poc concentrations displayed significantly different seasonal trends p 0 05 the seasonal changes in oc may be explained by the following reasons chla concentrations generally show higher values in autumn and summer and the metabolism and lysis of phytoplankton could contribute to the oc pool and increase the oc concentration danhiez et al 2017 guillemette et al 2013 we have detected the relationship between the molecular composition of dom with the chla concentration index of the phytoplankton and found that chla concentration had a significant positive correlation with the unsaturated aliphatics in dom p 0 01 fig s4 a previous study also pointed out that dom derived from the phytoplankton contained a large number of aliphatics and the unsaturated aliphatics represented 24 of molecular formulas detected bittar et al 2015 however when we analyzed the relationship between doc and chla concentrations using data in four seasons there was no significant correlation fig 3c which indicated that the autochthonous doc derived from the phytoplankton and hydrophyte was not the most dominant source of riverine doc the riverine doc mainly comes from the allochthonous sources terrigenous and anthropogenic sources and is often affected by meteorological and hydrological conditions dinsmore et al 2013 kang et al 2019 in summer the increased precipitation and discharge may dilute the doc concentration ran et al 2013 the higher temperature in the summer also promotes the biodegradation of doc shin et al 2016 ye et al 2019 besides in the water column the partial transformation of allochthonous doc into poc could be enhanced by the strong sunlight in summer von wachenfeldt et al 2008 most fluvial organic material comes from soils and the tissue of plants on land huang et al 2012 song et al 2018 wen et al 2019 rivers in the equatorial region register higher doc concentrations than those at higher latitudes and the pattern of doc distribution is primarily associated with soil type and soil oc density huang et al 2012 a significant positive correlation was also found between the doc in lake waters and the som density in the drainage catchments and som density exerts a strong influence upon the levels of doc in china s inland waters song et al 2018 wen et al 2019 in this study the average som percentage for the top 20 cm of the soils was calculated by overlaying the catchment boundary of each river catchment fig s5 however there was no significant correlation between som and doc concentration in the estuary p 0 05 and that s probably because the amount and quality of doc from the source site to the estuarine site has undergone significant changes ward et al 2015 doc concentration in the water ecosystem not only depends on the production but also consumption several studies have found that the soil or sediment respiration rates at low salinity levels were higher than in the high salinity levels which means a higher microbial metabolism in the low salinity environment yang et al 2018 this suggested that more energy and more doc would be consumed in the low salinity environment for microbial metabolism and growth brooks et al 1999 straathof et al 2014 if a similar phenomenon occurs in the water column then higher consumption of doc at lower salinity levels would contribute to the positive correlation between the doc concentrations and salinity levels at a certain range e g from 0 to 1 psu as observed in this study fig 3a besides the microbial community structure succession with salinity change has been observed in the aquatic ecosystem rojas jimenez et al 2021 yang et al 2018 and the increasing salinity could potentially lead to osmotic stress to microbes and thus influences the microbial activities edmonds et al 2009 which may result in a lower doc biodegradation and doc accumulation in the higher salinity region although there is a positive correlation between doc and salinity it does not necessarily indicate a genetic cause effect relationship between them but also likely reflects a cooperative dynamic although more evidence should be provided to clarify the mechanism it should be cautioned that the positive correlation between doc and salinity was observed only in very low salinity regions with a narrow range of salinity 0 1 psu and the positive correlation observed here further reinforces the importance of selecting representative locations to better constrain the doc fluxes to the marginal seas poc concentrations in these rivers in mainland china showed a significantly positive correlation with water tsm concentration fig 3b this positive correlation has also been observed in the world river datasets coynel et al 2005 kang et al 2019 the increase of tsm is generally due to soil erosion so the significant positive correlation in this study implies that the input of allochthonous poc had an important influence on the variation of poc concentration in rivers among different basins ludwig et al 1996 although riverine doc and poc in this study were all influenced by the allochthonous matter there was no significant correlation between doc and poc concentrations using data in four seasons fig 3d suggesting that the main transport and delivery mechanisms of doc and poc may be different the spatial heterogeneity of oc concentrations in these rivers may be explained by the complex oc source in different rivers which are affected by the watershed land use types williams et al 2010 wilson and xenopoulos 2013 xenopoulos et al 2021 in all river basins the haihe river basin and huaihe river basin showed the highest mean doc concentration fig 2 the haihe river basin is an important heavy industry zone in china suggesting that the allochthonous carbon from the watershed inputs likely contributed substantially to the doc in rivers by analyzing the land use types the proportions of the artificial land and farmland area are higher in haihe river basin and huaihe river basin compared with other studied river basins fig s1b highly developed industrial and agricultural production and sewage discharge in chinese river basins likely made a significant contribution to riverine doc fig 6b and fig 6c wen et al 2020 the yellow river basin showed the highest mean poc value fig 2 the yellow river is well known in the world for its massive sediment delivery a large amount of carbon mainly found in particulate form was delivered into the ocean accompanied by the transport of suspended particulates and the poc flux was significantly higher than doc 0 41 1012 g yr vs 0 06 1012 g yr xia et al 2016 yu et al 2018 yellow river basin has undergone extensive land use changes and the riverine poc in the yellow river mostly originated from sedimentary rocks and soil horizons ran et al 2013 ran et al 2015 the doc poc ratio fluctuated widely among different seasons and river basins because of different geo climatic features and human disturbances zhang et al 2013 in all basins the averaged doc poc ratio is highest in autumn and lowest in summer fig s6 the value of doc poc ratio is affected by oc sources and it is widely believed that the higher doc poc ratio indicated the more autogenous sources in reverse more allochthonous sources degens et al 1991 zhang et al 2013 based on the doc poc ratio we inferred that the contribution of allochthonous sources to oc in summer was higher than in autumn fig s6 this may be also related to the higher runoff in summer which could carry more suspended particulates and soil particulates from catchment to water 4 2 linking dom source to its molecular complexity spearman s rank correlation analysis showed that the proportion of peptide like formulas in dom positively correlated with the proportion of sewage derived oc table 2 p 0 05 the result first specified the relevance between the sewage discharge and dom molecular composition across multiple chinese rivers the fluorescence eem parafac analysis and the molecular characteristics of dom as measured by ft icr ms all show that wastewater mainly contains peptide like formulas and a strong protein like fluorescence in chinese municipal wastewater goffin et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 shi et al 2021 therefore we speculate that the significant positive correlation in this study indicates that the discharged sewage might be the main source of peptides proteins in river water previous studies have proven that the treated sewage still had a high tryptophan fluorescence intensity and the sewage derived tryptophan signature has been found in some sewage impacted rivers and surface water cabral et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 tryptophan is an amino acid which is the basic unit of peptides dom composition and structure usually decided its bioavailability thus affecting the metabolic process in the aquatic ecosystem artifon et al 2019 shi et al 2016 especially the protein like components in dom may be more liable to biodegradation and had an important influence on the microbial community in the river ecosystem inamdar et al 2012 yu et al 2020 the protein like fluorescent component in dom significantly decreased along the wastewater treatment plants wwtps river lake continuum which was accompanied by significant variations in dom quality wang et al 2019 rivers in arid to semi arid regions of the world have received a major portion of the sewage and wastewater effluent rice et al 2013 the effluent still contains large quantities of dom wang et al 2019 which could increase the proportion of the peptide like formulas in dom of river waters based on the observations of this study besides the discharge of dom accompany by sewage and wastewater effluent may exert detrimental effects on the receiving rivers for example the eutrophication issue dalu et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to further study the composition of sewage derived dom especially for its variations in quantity and quality after it is discharged into receiving water bodies as one component of doc in river water derived from sewage the number proportion of peptide like formulas in dom ranged from 0 18 to 1 5 table 1 considering the significant positive correlation between sewage percentages and relative percentages calculated by isotopic mixing models of peptide like formulas derived from ft icr ms we suggested that the peptide like formulas in river water were mainly derived from the sewage discharge combined with the recent doc flux of each river basin published in liu et al 2020 the contribution of sewage discharge on chinese riverine doc flux could be roughly estimated as 16 11 17 74 gg c yr with the highest value in the yangtze river basin fig s7 this flux is likely underestimated because there are also other organic compounds present in sewage such as polyphenols and carbohydrates gao et al 2013 shi et al 2021 which are not included in this estimation the human disturbance induced the doc flux increase in chinese rivers and increasing wastewater discharge with a growing population was considered to be the main reason liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in this study the proportion of the polyphenols in dom showed a significantly positive relationship with the relative contributions of c3 plant and soil derived oc table 2 p 0 05 polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants with multiple hydroxyl phenols they widely exist inside plants and 8000 polyphenolic compounds have been identified in various plant species quideau et al 2011 polyphenols are usually bio refractory and tend to retain in the soil and surface water environments with the decaying branches and withered leaves the polyphenols in dom showed a higher proportion in autumn than in summer in the same river basin p 0 05 fig 8 besides we compared the forest areas in these studied river basins and found the more forest coverage in the basin the higher proportion of polyphenols was detected in riverine dom fig s8 this phenomenon likely suggests that more plants or fallen leaves in the basin might have a greater contribution to the riverine doc in the form of polyphenols 4 3 limitations and further implications for riverine carbon cycling various climate change modeling studies have projected there will have an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather at the global scale in the future such as floods and tsunami hajian et al 2016 lee et al 2017 woznicki et al 2016 these extreme weather events likely result in the climate and seasonality changes in the whole large river watershed which must have a significant impact on riverine runoff and carbon delivery piao et al 2010 over the past several decades china has already experienced some devastating climate extremes for instance the great flood of yangtze river watershed in 1998 inundated 213 106 ha 21 mha of land with the riverine annual oc flux undoubtedly increased liu et al 2020 furthermore the carbon flux in global fluvial ecosystems to coastal regions may be reduced because of the reckoning based on major rivers and a few rivers in north america and europe cole et al 2007 meybeck and vörösmarty 1999 worrall and burt 2004 studies have shown that the small rivers and mountainous rivers exhibited disproportionately high sediment and carbon transport rates albeit with low discharge huang et al 2017 syvitski et al 2014 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 this study provided the oc concentration and composition in multiple small rivers along the coast to the global riverine carbon data set which are important in better constraining the global fluvial carbon flux besides the riverine dom is undoubtedly affected by land use and land cover changes geomorphology and anthropogenic influences in the watershed shin et al 2016 wen et al 2020 williams et al 2010 considering our observed difference in dom molecular complexity in different discharges further studies are needed to link hydrology with biogeochemical cycling of dom and explore the underlying mechanism to better predict dom cycling in a changing hydrology scenario dawson et al 2008 worrall and burt 2004 the knowledge of anthropogenic activities and their impacts on riverine dom cycling is still not clear our analysis endeavored to include a large dataset that covered the large variability in doc composition and sources in different river basins with various urbanization our data should be applicable to support analyzing the influence of human activities on riverine dom cycling in a changing artificial environment however our dataset did not have the hydrological data during the sampling and the rivers in this study are extensively distributed throughout china over the past decade china has been active in mitigating and adapting the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality and water resources piao et al 2010 therefore some uncertainties are likely if the proposed data of doc composition and sources are applied to the analysis of a large scale riverine dom cycling besides the mean and variance of the δ15n and δ13c of the potential oc sources used in this study were collected from the literature which is similar to other studies alling et al 2008 chu et al 2020 guillemette et al 2013 liu and han 2021 liu et al 2021 minet et al 2017 qi et al 2021 and may result in some errors in the sources contribution analysis results therefore the source apportionment in this study is semi quantitative nevertheless we have tried our best to include end member values reported in chinese watersheds chen et al 2009 chen et al 2005 chu et al 2020

different seasons variations in doc sources further studies are needed to better constrain the end member source samples to reduce the uncertainty of contribution from each end member 5 conclusions this study evaluated the riverine oc concentrations in four seasons from 48 chinese rivers entering marginal seas both doc and poc concentrations displayed a significantly different seasonal trend with the highest mean value in autumn p 0 05 in four seasons most of the dom in these rivers entering marginal seas came from the terrigenous sources 61 6 79 2 followed by the autochthonous inputs 15 3 29 5 and the anthropogenic sewage 5 7 12 6 there is a difference in the anthropogenic sewage contribution to dom in different river basins p 0 05 with the maximum in huaihe river basin and haihe river basin the highly unsaturated compounds are the most abundant molecular formulas detected in riverine dom both in summer and autumn whereas sugars are the least abundant molecular formulas the anthropogenic influence was one of the major factors contributing to the difference in dom composition this study first assessed the contributions of the natural factors and anthropogenic activities on doc concentration and dom composition in chinese rivers entering marginal seas and highlighted the influence of the anthropogenic sewage discharge on molecular compositions of riverine dom the result specified that the discharged sewage likely contributed to the peptide like formulas in riverine dom these findings may facilitate a better assessment of the global riverine carbon budget and

3873,rivers are an important connection between terrestrial ecosystems and the ocean and are hotspots of organic carbon transformation riverine dissolved organic matter dom concentration and composition are sensitive to both regional and global change processes the comparative studies on riverine dom among different rivers especially when it comes to seasonal changes were critical to better constrain the river carbon cycle in this study we analyzed organic carbon concentration dom sources and composition from the estuary locations of 48 chinese rivers using the stable isotopic analysis and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry both dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc concentrations displayed significantly higher mean values in autumn than in summer p 0 05 most of the dom in these rivers entering marginal seas in four seasons came from the terrigenous sources 60 6 68 4 followed by the autochthonous matters 18 6 25 6 and the contribution of the anthropogenic sewage ranged from 7 6 to 13 7 the proportion contributions of terrigenous and anthropogenic sources to dom were similar in all seasons but the contribution of autochthonous inputs showed the highest value in autumn than other seasons p 0 05 although the highly unsaturated compounds are the most abundant molecular formulas detected in all riverine dom the molecular composition of riverine dom shows a large difference among seven river basins the human activity disturbance may be one of the major reasons for dom composition differences the contribution of sewage discharge on chinese riverine dom flux could be roughly estimated as 16 11 17 74 gg c yr this work seeks to provide a foundation for ongoing research of regional and global riverine carbon cycling and put forward the method for evaluating the potential impact of human disturbances on riverine organic carbon components in chinese rivers keywords dissolved organic matter carbon sources

have been used in determining the proportion of oc sources in rivers chen et al 2003 stedmon et al 2003 wen et al 2020 xia et al 2021 one of the most successful methods is the stable isotope analysis which provides a good fingerprint of different oc sources in rivers he et al 2019 wen et al 2020 several source apportionment models and a series of procedures using stable isotope signatures were developed to calculate the contributions of all potential sources to bulk doc including the isosource mixsir isotoper and stable isotope analyses in r siar parnell et al 2010 phillips and gregg 2003 siar is becoming one of the most popular resources due to its precise estimation and open source and it can precisely estimate the sources contributing proportion to a mixture coping with too much variation based on the bayesian approaches parnell et al 2010 besides fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was successfully used to characterize the detailed molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom in fluvial systems as a high resolution technique he et al 2019 kamjunke et al 2017 valle et al 2020 the ultrahigh resolution of ft icr ms allowed the researchers to trace the differences in molecular levels between distinct dom pools kamjunke et al 2017 valle et al 2020 previous studies have proven that the riverine oc transport and composition were co affected by the basin characteristics season hydrology trophic state and human activities bhattacharya and osburn 2020 butman et al 2015 maavara et al 2017 typically dom in aquatic ecosystems is derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources dom composition also varies due to the various sources studies have shown that domestic sewage discharge and agricultural activity have significant influences on dom concentration in rivers wen et al 2020 wen et al 2021 the anthropogenic land use and land cover lulc activity has significant influences on dom molecular composition in rivers fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 xenopoulos et al 2021 a maximum concentration of dom with a remarkably high content of aromatic and humic like material derived from surface soil and litter layers was observed in the yukon river during the spring flush spencer et al 2008 in forested watersheds during non storm periods the low molecular weight dom molecules in the upper soil horizons and leaf debris were tended to contribute to the streams inamdar et al 2012 the degree of dom processing during downstream transport in the congo river basin is a function of landscape characteristics and water residence time lambert et al 2016 however knowledge is lacking in the influence of multi factor superposition on the flux and composition of riverine doc china is the largest asian country and many chinese rivers enter oceans the annual total flux of riverine doc entering the marginal seas in china showed a significant linear increase during 1953 2016 with the value of 2 75 0 13 10 3 pg c yr in the 1950 s but 5 02 0 3 10 3 pg c yr in the 2010 s on average the annual total doc flux increased by 4 1 10 5 pg c yr liu et al 2020 but the sources and composition of riverine doc were not well understood more importantly these river basins are characterized by various types of landforms and varying degrees of human disturbance serving as an ideal case to characterize the source and composition of riverine doc into the marginal sea under changes in both watershed characteristics and local human activities globally the present studies mainly pay attention to estimate long term riverine oc fluxes wang et al 2016 yue et al 2016 and most of these studies were conducted in a single river e g yangtze river the comparative studies on oc fluxes among different rivers were relatively sparse especially when it comes to carbon seasonal changes in different rivers drake et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 besides studies on the river oc flux were mostly conducted near the hydrological stations on the river which are usually far from estuaries whereas the amount and quality of oc from this location to the estuary is likely to change dramatically ward et al 2015 in contrast the related studies conducted by oceanographers using research vessels were usually based on the samples from the coastal ocean and the sampling sites were several kilometers away from the estuary shallow water to avoid standing therefore the accurate data about riverine oc flux into the marginal sea are difficult to access considering the projecting model on the future climate change shows that rainfall and flood will be further increased in the future such as in china nepal and indonesia du et al 2019 li et al 2016 saurav et al 2021 yamamoto et al 2021 it is necessary to better constrain the quantity and quality of riverine doc in this study surface water samples were collected from 48 chinese estuaries 7 river basins in 2019 in four different seasons we considered concentrations sources and the molecular compositions of oc in combination with the stable isotopic analysis and ft icr ms analysis this study aimed to 1 evaluate the concentrations of riverine doc and poc in different seasons and river basins 2 assess the sources of oc that contribute to the doc pools in different river basins and 3 assess the molecular compositions of dom in different river basins our results semi quantified the contributions of the natural and anthropogenic inputs to doc in chinese rivers entering marginal seas for the first time and highlighted the effect of the anthropogenic activities on molecular compositions of riverine dom this work also aims to provide critical background information for ongoing research of regional and global riverine carbon cycling and put forward the method for evaluating the potential impact of natural and human disturbances on riverine oc components 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection from north to south

pearl river fig 1 the drainage area of all studied rivers is detailed in the supporting materials the land use types in these studied river basins are shown in fig s1a the farmland is the dominant land use type in liaohe river basin huaihe river basin and haihe river basin with percentages of 36 9 49 8 and 68 9 respectively fig s1b in other studied river basins the farmland is the secondary use type followed by the forest or grassland fig s1b the percentages of the artificial land in these basins range from 2 4 in yellow river basin to 13 8 in huaihe river basin fig s1b the more watershed characteristics of these river basins were detailed in the supporting materials the sampling campaign in each river was repeated four times covered four seasons in turn in january april july and october respectively in 2019 a total of 192 river water samples were collected fig 1 we grouped all sampled rivers by seven river basins including the liaohe river basin n 20 haihe river basin n 40 yellow river basin n 8 huaihe river basin n 28 yangtze river basin n 12 southeastern rivers n 48 and pearl river basin n 36 for each river the sampling station was purposely designed at the most downstream location assuming that it would be more representative of the whole basin during the sampling we have designed more than one sampling station downstream of each river and we measured the salinity psu water temperature c and ph value of river water in situ using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi 6600 u s we finally adopted the most downstream station with a very similar salinity with the upstream location salinity 1 psu assuming there was no inwelling at this sampling station all in situ data and details of these measurements are shown in supplementary table

samples to prevent isotope fractionation the pretreatment process of dom samples for δ13c analysis first water samplings were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters then 4 ml filtered water samples were transferred to 12 ml amber borosilicate vials with the addition of 1 ml of h3po4 reagent mixture 4 0 g sodium persulfate and 1 0 g anhydrous phosphoric acid were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water and stored at ambient temperature finally stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotopes of the filtrate were analyzed using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer precision of 0 2 for δ13c and 0 5 for δ15n mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the accuracy of δ13c of the instrument is better than 0 06 the isotope composition of dom was reported using delta δ notation and the values of δ13c and δ15n are expressed in parts per thousand relative to the international standard v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite and atmospheric n2 gas with the equation where r is the ratio

gas 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms out of a total of 192 river samples 16 samples were analyzed by ft icr ms these 16 samples were from 8 rivers both july and october across china from north to south including liaohe river haihe river jiyun river yellow river yangtze river huangpu river feiyun river and pearl river all 16 samples c a 1 l each were filtered through 0 45 μm filters to obtain dom then the filtrate contained dom was acidified further isolated by solid phase extraction agilent bond elut ppl 200 mg 3 ml and eluted with meoh dittmar et al 2008 the recovery efficiencies of ppl ranged from 55 to 66 58 on average n 16 on a doc basis ft icr ms were acquired using a 9 4 t bruker solarix mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany hyphenated to an esi source in the negative ion mode to analyze the methanol eluent of spe dom the detailed information on ft icr ms measurement of dom is provided in the supporting material and the measurement was conducted at the heavy oil processing laboratory china university of petroleum located in beijing all 16 samples were analyzed in duplicate to assess the reproducibility of the ft icr

intensity weighted chemical parameters divided by the sum of all the intensities belonging to the chemical parameters the final chemical formula assignments were classified into four groups cho chon chos or chons molecular formulas were further assigned to the following groups according to the elementary composition as described by the references hertkorn et al 2006 seidel et al 2015 including polycyclic aromatics saturated fatty acids polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds peptide like formulas sugars and carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds crams the detailed information is provided in the supporting material 2 5 data analysis the stable isotope analyses in r siar model was used to integrate the δ15n and δ13c values to quantify the proportional contributions of the potential carbon sources to the organic carbon in river water based on bayesian parnell et al 2010 the three potential carbon sources in this study were the terrigenous sources plants and soil autochthonous sources phytoplankton and hydrophyte and anthropogenic sources e g sewage the detailed information is provided in the supporting material the main function of the siar package allows the user to specify the data and choose the size of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc run the model was run for 200 000 iterations with a burn in of 50 000 into siar package in this study the differences in dom molecular composition in summer and autumn were analyzed with anova paired t test the normal distribution was conducted before the paired t test using spss 23 0 for windows relationships among the doc source and its molecular composition parameters were tested using spearman s rank correlation matrix with statistical significance set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 riverine organic carbon concentrations doc and poc values in these river waters ranged from 2 05 to 13 82 mg c l and 0 71 to 25 68 mg c l respectively fig 2 in this study both doc and poc concentrations displayed significantly different seasonal trends p 0 05 in four seasons the autumn river showed the highest mean doc and poc values fig 2 table s2 in all river basins the haihe river basin showed the highest mean doc concentration followed by huaihe river basin fig 2a the highest mean poc value was shown in the yellow river basin fig 2b besides poc concentrations in these rivers in mainland china showed a significantly positive correlation with water tsm fig 3 b doc concentration showed a significant positive correlation with water salinity 0 to 1 psu but no significant correlation with chlorophyll a chla concentrations fig 3a and c there is no significant correlation between doc and poc concentrations in all the rivers fig 3d 3 2 stable isotopic composition of riverine dom the δ13c signature of riverine dom showed large variability ranging from 26 8 to 11 2 with the lowest value in winter mean value 22 6 3 6 and highest in summer mean value 15 6 3 1 the δ15n signature of riverine dom showed large variability ranging from 3 1 to 18 fig 4 based on the δ13c and δ15n signatures for the different rivers the water samples in the same season clustered close to each other which indicated that the sources might have significant seasonal differences here we defined that riverine oc mainly originated from three parts the terrigenous sources plants and soils autochthonous sources phytoplankton and hydrophyte and the anthropogenic pollution and waste effluents in this study we defined them as the anthropogenic sources as also described in previous studies fabre et al 2019 raymond et al 2004 the proportional contributions of these carbon sources to dom in these river waters were analyzed based on the δ13c and δ15n signatures fig 5 and fig s2 table s3 the results indicated that most of the dom in these rivers entering marginal seas came from the terrigenous sources with a range of 60 6 68 4 followed by the autochthonous matters 18 6 25 6 and the anthropogenic sewage 7 6 13 7 in four seasons fig 5a in this study the proportion of autochthonous inputs reached the highest value in autumn fig 5a the proportion contributions of anthropogenic sources to dom were similar in all seasons except summer only 7 6 across seven river basins the major contributor to dom was all the terrigenous sources but there was a significant difference in the proportional contribution in different river basins p 0 05 with a maximum of 68 2 in southeastern rivers and a minimum of 54 6 in the huaihe river basin fig 5b the contribution of autochthonous inputs on dom showed small variations 24 8 28 5 across the seven river basins fig 5b the effect of anthropogenic sources on dom was different in seven river basins the contributions of anthropogenic sewage ranged from 7 1 to 16 9 and the contributions in the huaihe river basin and haihe river basin were significantly higher p 0 05 than other river basins fig 5b the relationship between the land use types and proportional contribution mean value of each potential carbon source to dom was also analyzed the results showed that the contribution of c3 plants one of the terrigenous sources to dom was significantly and positively correlated with the percentage of forest area in the basin fig 6 a the contribution of sewage anthropogenic sources to dom was significantly and positively correlated with the percentages of artificial land and farmland in the basin fig 6b and c 3 3 molecular composition of riverine dom as determined by ft icr ms solid phase extracted dom for these river samples in summer and autumn contained between 5648 and 7661 molecular formulas fig s3 table 1 the weighted average molecular weight mw ranges from 360 to 389 da and 364 to 394 da of riverine dom in summer and autumn respectively in both summer and autumn carbohydrates cho and the nitrogen containing compounds chon are the most abundant regarding weighted intensity with the high proportions of 38 81 and 14 22 respectively table 1 the averaged cho in dom from summer surface waters is lower than that from autumn for all rivers except sr and pr the averaged chon in dom from summer surface waters is lower than that from autumn for all rivers except yr and cj the averaged chos and chons in dom from summer surface waters is higher than that from autumn for all rivers except sr and pr table 1 among the seven river basins dom showed a large range of s containing formula contents with the highest value in the haihe river basin and the lowest value in southeastern rivers table 1 although most of the molecular formulas were shared common formulas in both summer and autumn from the same river as observed in the haihe river fig 7 e f there were pools of unique molecular formulas detected only in summer or autumn for instance there were more unique chos and chons formulas detected in summer than those detected in autumn of the haihe river fig 7a b in contrast more unique cho and chon formulas were detected in autumn than that in summer of the haihe river fig 7c d a similar molecular compositional difference between summer and autumn was also observed in all other rivers the large ranges of aiw and dbew values suggested that dom molecular composition in the studied rivers had remarkable differences in the aromaticity and unsaturation degree koch and dittmar 2006 but no significant difference was presented between summer and autumn p 0 05 mlbw is used to estimate the overall lability of the dom with higher mlbw indicating higher molecular lability the summer samples did not show a significantly higher averaged mlbw than those in the autumn p 0 05 in total the highly unsaturated compound group including soil derived products of lignin degradation is the most abundant group of all detected compounds based on the detailed molecular formulas identified from ft icr ms this compound group displayed 4049 and 4297 mean value assigned molecular formulas corresponding to 75 and 78 by relative intensity for the summer and the autumn samples respectively in comparison sugars are the least abundant group and only account for 0 5 of all detected formulas in both summer and autumn table 1 in organic chemistry the organic compounds are generally divided into three classes based on the carbon skeleton structure carbocyclic compound open chain compound and heterocyclic compound simanek 2006 in this study the detailed molecular components of dom of different river waters are analyzed to compare the differences between summer and autumn fig 8 there was no significant difference between the three classes of organic compounds in dom between the two seasons p 0 05 either summer or autumn the carbocyclic compound group including the carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds cram polyphenols and black carbon was the major component of dom in all basins with the proportion of 72 2 93 1 and the highest and lowest values were observed in haihe river basin and southeastern rivers respectively fig 8 secondly the open chain compounds the unsaturated aliphatics and the saturated fatty acids were presented in dom with the proportion of 6 7 21 6 in these rivers the dom in southeastern rivers showed the largest proportion of the open chain compounds in both summer and autumn the other compounds including heterocyclic compounds only occupied 0 3 10 7 of the total molecular formulas 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal variations in sources contribution to riverine doc in this study both doc and poc concentrations displayed significantly different seasonal trends p 0 05 the seasonal changes in oc may be explained by the following reasons chla concentrations generally show higher values in autumn and summer and the metabolism and lysis of phytoplankton could contribute to the oc pool and increase the oc concentration danhiez et al 2017 guillemette et al 2013 we have detected the relationship between the molecular composition of dom with the chla concentration index of the phytoplankton and found that chla concentration had a significant positive correlation with the unsaturated aliphatics in dom p 0 01 fig s4 a previous study also pointed out that dom derived from the phytoplankton contained a large number of aliphatics and the unsaturated aliphatics represented 24 of molecular formulas detected bittar et al 2015 however when we analyzed the relationship between doc and chla concentrations using data in four seasons there was no significant correlation fig 3c which indicated that the autochthonous doc derived from the phytoplankton and hydrophyte was not the most dominant source of riverine doc the riverine doc mainly comes from the allochthonous sources terrigenous and anthropogenic sources and is often affected by meteorological and hydrological conditions dinsmore et al 2013 kang et al 2019 in summer the increased precipitation and discharge may dilute the doc concentration ran et al 2013 the higher temperature in the summer also promotes the biodegradation of doc shin et al 2016 ye et al 2019 besides in the water column the partial transformation of allochthonous doc into poc could be enhanced by the strong sunlight in summer von wachenfeldt et al 2008 most fluvial organic material comes from soils and the tissue of plants on land huang et al 2012 song et al 2018 wen et al 2019 rivers in the equatorial region register higher doc concentrations than those at higher latitudes and the pattern of doc distribution is primarily associated with soil type and soil oc density huang et al 2012 a significant positive correlation was also found between the doc in lake waters and the som density in the drainage catchments and som density exerts a strong influence upon the levels of doc in china s inland waters song et al 2018 wen et al 2019 in this study the average som percentage for the top 20 cm of the soils was calculated by overlaying the catchment boundary of each river catchment fig s5 however there was no significant correlation between som and doc concentration in the estuary p 0 05 and that s probably because the amount and quality of doc from the source site to the estuarine site has undergone significant changes ward et al 2015 doc concentration in the water ecosystem not only depends on the production but also consumption several studies have found that the soil or sediment respiration rates at low salinity levels were higher than in the high salinity levels which means a higher microbial metabolism in the low salinity environment yang et al 2018 this suggested that more energy and more doc would be consumed in the low salinity environment for microbial metabolism and growth brooks et al 1999 straathof et al 2014 if a similar phenomenon occurs in the water column then higher consumption of doc at lower salinity levels would contribute to the positive correlation between the doc concentrations and salinity levels at a certain range e g from 0 to 1 psu as observed in this study fig 3a besides the microbial community structure succession with salinity change has been observed in the aquatic ecosystem rojas jimenez et al 2021 yang et al 2018 and the increasing salinity could potentially lead to osmotic stress to microbes and thus influences the microbial activities edmonds et al 2009 which may result in a lower doc biodegradation and doc accumulation in the higher salinity region although there is a positive correlation between doc and salinity it does not necessarily indicate a genetic cause effect relationship between them but also likely reflects a cooperative dynamic although more evidence should be provided to clarify the mechanism it should be cautioned that the positive correlation between doc and salinity was observed only in very low salinity regions with a narrow range of salinity 0 1 psu and the positive correlation observed here further reinforces the importance of selecting representative locations to better constrain the doc fluxes to the marginal seas poc concentrations in these rivers in mainland china showed a significantly positive correlation with water tsm concentration fig 3b this positive correlation has also been observed in the world river datasets coynel et al 2005 kang et al 2019 the increase of tsm is generally due to soil erosion so the significant positive correlation in this study implies that the input of allochthonous poc had an important influence on the variation of poc concentration in rivers among different basins ludwig et al 1996 although riverine doc and poc in this study were all influenced by the allochthonous matter there was no significant correlation between doc and poc concentrations using data in four seasons fig 3d suggesting that the main transport and delivery mechanisms of doc and poc may be different the spatial heterogeneity of oc concentrations in these rivers may be explained by the complex oc source in different rivers which are affected by the watershed land use types williams et al 2010 wilson and xenopoulos 2013 xenopoulos et al 2021 in all river basins the haihe river basin and huaihe river basin showed the highest mean doc concentration fig 2 the haihe river basin is an important heavy industry zone in china suggesting that the allochthonous carbon from the watershed inputs likely contributed substantially to the doc in rivers by analyzing the land use types the proportions of the artificial land and farmland area are higher in haihe river basin and huaihe river basin compared with other studied river basins fig s1b highly developed industrial and agricultural production and sewage discharge in chinese river basins likely made a significant contribution to riverine doc fig 6b and fig 6c wen et al 2020 the yellow river basin showed the highest mean poc value fig 2 the yellow river is well known in the world for its massive sediment delivery a large amount of carbon mainly found in particulate form was delivered into the ocean accompanied by the transport of suspended particulates and the poc flux was significantly higher than doc 0 41 1012 g yr vs 0 06 1012 g yr xia et al 2016 yu et al 2018 yellow river basin has undergone extensive land use changes and the riverine poc in the yellow river mostly originated from sedimentary rocks and soil horizons ran et al 2013 ran et al 2015 the doc poc ratio fluctuated widely among different seasons and river basins because of different geo climatic features and human disturbances zhang et al 2013 in all basins the averaged doc poc ratio is highest in autumn and lowest in summer fig s6 the value of doc poc ratio is affected by oc sources and it is widely believed that the higher doc poc ratio indicated the more autogenous sources in reverse more allochthonous sources degens et al 1991 zhang et al 2013 based on the doc poc ratio we inferred that the contribution of allochthonous sources to oc in summer was higher than in autumn fig s6 this may be also related to the higher runoff in summer which could carry more suspended particulates and soil particulates from catchment to water 4 2 linking dom source to its molecular complexity spearman s rank correlation analysis showed that the proportion of peptide like formulas in dom positively correlated with the proportion of sewage derived oc table 2 p 0 05 the result first specified the relevance between the sewage discharge and dom molecular composition across multiple chinese rivers the fluorescence eem parafac analysis and the molecular characteristics of dom as measured by ft icr ms all show that wastewater mainly contains peptide like formulas and a strong protein like fluorescence in chinese municipal wastewater goffin et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 shi et al 2021 therefore we speculate that the significant positive correlation in this study indicates that the discharged sewage might be the main source of peptides proteins in river water previous studies have proven that the treated sewage still had a high tryptophan fluorescence intensity and the sewage derived tryptophan signature has been found in some sewage impacted rivers and surface water cabral et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 tryptophan is an amino acid which is the basic unit of peptides dom composition and structure usually decided its bioavailability thus affecting the metabolic process in the aquatic ecosystem artifon et al 2019 shi et al 2016 especially the protein like components in dom may be more liable to biodegradation and had an important influence on the microbial community in the river ecosystem inamdar et al 2012 yu et al 2020 the protein like fluorescent component in dom significantly decreased along the wastewater treatment plants wwtps river lake continuum which was accompanied by significant variations in dom quality wang et al 2019 rivers in arid to semi arid regions of the world have received a major portion of the sewage and wastewater effluent rice et al 2013 the effluent still contains large quantities of dom wang et al 2019 which could increase the proportion of the peptide like formulas in dom of river waters based on the observations of this study besides the discharge of dom accompany by sewage and wastewater effluent may exert detrimental effects on the receiving rivers for example the eutrophication issue dalu et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to further study the composition of sewage derived dom especially for its variations in quantity and quality after it is discharged into receiving water bodies as one component of doc in river water derived from sewage the number proportion of peptide like formulas in dom ranged from 0 18 to 1 5 table 1 considering the significant positive correlation between sewage percentages and relative percentages calculated by isotopic mixing models of peptide like formulas derived from ft icr ms we suggested that the peptide like formulas in river water were mainly derived from the sewage discharge combined with the recent doc flux of each river basin published in liu et al 2020 the contribution of sewage discharge on chinese riverine doc flux could be roughly estimated as 16 11 17 74 gg c yr with the highest value in the yangtze river basin fig s7 this flux is likely underestimated because there are also other organic compounds present in sewage such as polyphenols and carbohydrates gao et al 2013 shi et al 2021 which are not included in this estimation the human disturbance induced the doc flux increase in chinese rivers and increasing wastewater discharge with a growing population was considered to be the main reason liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in this study the proportion of the polyphenols in dom showed a significantly positive relationship with the relative contributions of c3 plant and soil derived oc table 2 p 0 05 polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants with multiple hydroxyl phenols they widely exist inside plants and 8000 polyphenolic compounds have been identified in various plant species quideau et al 2011 polyphenols are usually bio refractory and tend to retain in the soil and surface water environments with the decaying branches and withered leaves the polyphenols in dom showed a higher proportion in autumn than in summer in the same river basin p 0 05 fig 8 besides we compared the forest areas in these studied river basins and found the more forest coverage in the basin the higher proportion of polyphenols was detected in riverine dom fig s8 this phenomenon likely suggests that more plants or fallen leaves in the basin might have a greater contribution to the riverine doc in the form of polyphenols 4 3 limitations and further implications for riverine carbon cycling various climate change modeling studies have projected there will have an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather at the global scale in the future such as floods and tsunami hajian et al 2016 lee et al 2017 woznicki et al 2016 these extreme weather events likely result in the climate and seasonality changes in the whole large river watershed which must have a significant impact on riverine runoff and carbon delivery piao et al 2010 over the past several decades china has already experienced some devastating climate extremes for instance the great flood of yangtze river watershed in 1998 inundated 213 106 ha 21 mha of land with the riverine annual oc flux undoubtedly increased liu et al 2020 furthermore the carbon flux in global fluvial ecosystems to coastal regions may be reduced because of the reckoning based on major rivers and a few rivers in north america and europe cole et al 2007 meybeck and vörösmarty 1999 worrall and burt 2004 studies have shown that the small rivers and mountainous rivers exhibited disproportionately high sediment and carbon transport rates albeit with low discharge huang et al 2017 syvitski et al 2014 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 this study provided the oc concentration and composition in multiple small rivers along the coast to the global riverine carbon data set which are important in better constraining the global fluvial carbon flux besides the riverine dom is undoubtedly affected by land use and land cover changes geomorphology and anthropogenic influences in the watershed shin et al 2016 wen et al 2020 williams et al 2010 considering our observed difference in dom molecular complexity in different discharges further studies are needed to link hydrology with biogeochemical cycling of dom and explore the underlying mechanism to better predict dom cycling in a changing hydrology scenario dawson et al 2008 worrall and burt 2004 the knowledge of anthropogenic activities and their impacts on riverine dom cycling is still not clear our analysis endeavored to include a large dataset that covered the large variability in doc composition and sources in different river basins with various urbanization our data should be applicable to support analyzing the influence of human activities on riverine dom cycling in a changing artificial environment however our dataset did not have the hydrological data during the sampling and the rivers in this study are extensively distributed throughout china over the past decade china has been active in mitigating and adapting the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality and water resources piao et al 2010 therefore some uncertainties are likely if the proposed data of doc composition and sources are applied to the analysis of a large scale riverine dom cycling besides the mean and variance of the δ15n and δ13c of the potential oc sources used in this study were collected from the literature which is similar to other studies alling et al 2008 chu et al 2020 guillemette et al 2013 liu and han 2021 liu et al 2021 minet et al 2017 qi et al 2021 and may result in some errors in the sources contribution analysis results therefore the source apportionment in this study is semi quantitative nevertheless we have tried our best to include end member values reported in chinese watersheds chen et al 2009 chen et al 2005 chu et al 2020 han et al 2019 he et al 2019 li et al 2010 li et al 2020 wen et al 2020 xia et al 2021 xia et al 2017 yu et al 2010 and our results have captured meaningful spatial different river basins and temporal different seasons variations in doc sources further studies are needed to better constrain the end member source samples to reduce the uncertainty of contribution from each end member 5 conclusions this study evaluated the riverine oc concentrations in four seasons from 48 chinese rivers entering marginal seas both doc and poc concentrations displayed a significantly different seasonal trend with the highest mean value in autumn p 0 05 in four seasons most of the dom in these rivers entering marginal seas came from the terrigenous sources 61 6 79 2 followed by the autochthonous inputs 15 3 29 5 and the anthropogenic sewage 5 7 12 6 there is a difference in the anthropogenic sewage contribution to dom in different river basins p 0 05 with the maximum in huaihe river basin and haihe river basin the highly unsaturated compounds are the most abundant molecular formulas detected in riverine dom both in summer and autumn whereas sugars are the least abundant molecular formulas the anthropogenic influence was one of the major factors contributing to the difference in dom composition this study first assessed the contributions of the natural factors and anthropogenic activities on doc concentration and dom composition in chinese rivers entering marginal seas and highlighted the influence of the anthropogenic sewage discharge on molecular compositions of riverine dom the result specified that the discharged sewage likely contributed to the peptide like formulas in riverine dom these findings may facilitate a better assessment of the global riverine carbon budget and

stormwater management has become alternative solutions this research designed and evaluated a stormwater management system sponge city on city scale the differences between old and new districts the

compared with baseline values the maximum fraction of the conduit full depth decreased for the entire pipe network annual values of total inflow volume tiv and total flooded volume tfv decreased by 32

and 50 40 total phosphorus tp lid on its own allows the city as a whole to control runoff and to largely reduce nps pollution however it has a limited ability to improve drainage capacity adopting grey approaches such as drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as well as storage tanks was proved to be essential for drainage capacity improvement and pollution control on city scale however final pollutant discharge depends on the relative amount of increased nps loads and reduced cso loads after implementing combined sewer separation projects it is usually recommended to increase the nps pollution control target when designing stormwater control system terminal facilities such as riparian zones and storage tanks are encouraged to better control nps pollution methods and conclusions on the comprehensive consideration of urban complex conditions systematic stormwater control and the effectiveness of different measures highlighted in this study on a city scale provide important reference for future urban sustainable stormwater management keywords flooding non point source pollution combined sewer overflow pollution sponge city 1 introduction an increase in urban pluvial flooding non point source nps pollution and combined sewer overflow cso pollution increasingly threaten human life and property in china urban pluvial flooding has been reported across megacities such as shanghai wuhan shenzhen tianjin and beijing characterized by being large in area the loss of life and extensive damage to property jiang et al 2018 qiu 2012 moreover overflow consisting of mixed wastewater and stormwater results in a deterioration in water quality in receiving water bodies qiao et al 2018 sustainable stormwater management ssm concepts and technologies e g low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud have been developed as alternative solutions yang et al 2021 the new concept of using sponge cities for ssm was introduced by the chinese government in 2014 mhurd 2014 beyond lid facilities the sponge city concept has been expanded as an integrated way to systematically address all stormwater related problems in china for systematic control of urban stormwater it is important to undertake investigations on regional scales from cities upwards firstly environmental sustainability including urban pluvial flooding nps pollution and cso pollution control should be fully considered as the primary aim of systematic control qiao et al 2020 secondly the coexistence of old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and varying degrees of pipeline defects currently present in the majority of cities need to be addressed hou et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 accordingly these complex factors e g discharge of domestic sewage the difference between old and new areas and river groundwater infiltration should also be considered in the process of design and evaluation of systematic control however only studies on cities and larger spatial scales can result in these objectives and complex factors to be fully considered and expressed a number of studies have provided perspectives for the design construction or evaluation of ssm on field district or catchment scales ahiablame et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 kong et al 2017 there is currently disagreement on whether grey or green infrastructure is more important for solving stormwater problems e g pluvial flooding and waterlogging bertrand krajewski 2021 hu et al 2019 randall et al 2019 and only a few studies have examined nps pollution yang et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 comprehensive studies examining joint pressures imposed by drainage capacity and flooding as well as nps and cso pollutions are rarely undertaken due to difficulties in implementing ssm on large spatial scales the influence of complex factors and a lack of basic data research related to large scales or city scales is difficult to collect or it is currently lacking therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to design a ssm system sponge city on a city scale by fully considering differences between old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and pipeline defects and 2 to evaluate the efficiency or limitations of project implementation for improving urban stormwater systems i e urban flooding risk as well as nps and cso pollution providing reference for future ssm strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area thirty cities 16 in 2015 and 14 in 2016 were selected as pilot cities for the sponge city initiative sci mhurd 2014 qian an was the only city in the initial selection of scis to be located in north china this city features all of the typical problems associated with northern cities for example having rapid urbanization and an outdated drainage system severe pipeline defects frequent urban flooding and poor water quality compared with other pilot cities the built up area of qian an is relatively small thus the whole urban area can be set as a pilot area qian an is located northeast of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration situated in hebei province its average annual temperature is 10 3 c and multi year average precipitation is 672 mm being part of the warm and semi humid continental climate belt qian an is characterized by frequent rainfall in the summer with about 80 of total rainfall falling from june to september as shown in fig 1 the urban area of qian an occupies an area of 2500 ha the pilot area includes 1096 57 ha of buildings 398 66 ha of roads 368 31 ha of green area 28 25 ha of water and 253 21 ha of unused land accounting for 86 2150 ha of the urban area a combined sewer system is currently operating for the central and northeastern areas of qian an here the main sewers are located along the sanli river having six overflow orifices and two stormwater outlets fig 1a the western and southern areas of the city are served by a separate storm sewer system similar to many other cities in china qian an suffers severe stormwater problems including frequent urban flooding overflow and poor water quality as an example on 25th july 2016 a rainfall event with a 20 year return period occurred in qian an the urban area included 39 obvious waterlogging water points with depths of 0 15 0 35 m and the total ponding area was about 34 33 ha for areas with a combined sewer system 856 pipeline defects were identified in key pipe sections when inspected using a cctv inspection robot and a periscope fig 2 defects included 175 structural defects and 681 functional defects the main problems in the pipelines included deposition 33 76 and tree root 28 39 followed by obstacles 10 75 cracks 7 83 and foreign matter 4 91 groundwater depth level in qian an ranged from 3 to 22 m being relatively shallow for a built up area 3 7 m therefore severe groundwater river infiltration issues exist in this area due to pipeline defects 2 2 construction of the baseline simulation model 2 2 1 model construction a personal computer stormwater management model pcswmm developed by computational hydraulics international chi based on swmm was used in this study james et al 2003 pcswmm can provide user friendly pre and post processors that reduce input errors and offer tools to improve understanding of the results james et al 2003 basic data including sewer system data meteorological data elevation data land use and soil type data were obtained from the local government digital elevation model dem sewer network and land use data were used to delineate the catchment and a total of 472 sub catchments were identified in the study area sub catchment runoff was assigned to the sewer node which was closest to the sub catchment area centroid borris et al 2017 the basic characteristics of the site i e area percentage of impervious area and storm drain layout and the geophysical characteristics of the site i e the in situ soil type were derived from land use soil type and sewer maps the sub catchment slope was calculated using dem data nps modeling contains many complexities e g inherent complexity of stormwater quality processes the available data for model calibration and validation obropta and kardos 2007 to obtain better runoff data for calibration and validation of nps parameters a field rainfall simulator system was applied in this study a total of 15 rainfall events with various rainfall intensities 6 250 mm h were simulated and flow rate and pollutant concentrations were simultaneously monitored further details are presented by hou et al 2020 due to severe pipeline defects sewer pipelines covering the pollution source pipeline network sewage treatment plant were monitored water flow was measured using online flowmeters fl900 hach loveland colorado usa and four pollutants chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids ss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp were analysed within 6 h of water collection following standard methods sepa 2002 based on monitoring results per capita sewage discharge was calculated to be 155 l person per day average concentrations of codcr nh3 n tp and ss were 334 0 mg l 92 3 mg l 7 3 mg l and 79 mg l respectively considering that the monitoring occurred during the dry season groundwater river infiltration unclear sewage inflow and pipeline leakage are the three main forms of abnormal changes in sewage discharge 1 δ q q u q l q i where δq represents the abnormal changes in sewage volume between upstream and downstream nodes m3 d q u represents the unclear sewage inflow due to misconnection m3 d ql represents the amount of sewage leakage m3 d q i represents the amount of groundwater river infiltration m3 d the abnormal changes in sewage volume are calculated by comparing theoretical sewage volume with monitored sewage volume 2 δ q q dn q up q th where qdn and qup represent the monitored sewage volume between downstream and upstream nodes m3 d q th represent the theoretical sewage volume multiply population number within the catchment area between upstream and downstream nodes by per capita sewage discharge m3 d 3 δ l l dn l up l th where ldn and lup represent the monitored sewage load between downstream and upstream nodes t d l th represents the theoretical sewage load m3 d the abnormal change rate in sewage volume of the entire study area was calculated as 32 5 showing the adverse effect of pipeline defects on the combined sewer system by analyzing the sewage volume and load changes in each node groundwater river infiltration was considered as the main forms for the changes then groundwater river infiltration for each node was allocated to nodes in the model hou et al 2019 2 2 2 calibration of hydrological and nps parameters hydrological and nps parameters were previously calibrated and validated by hou et al 2020 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to evaluate fitness between measured and simulated data hydrological and hydraulic parameters were separately calibrated for both dry and rainy seasons during the dry season the manning s roughness for conduit n cdry was calibrated and validated against measured discharge over a two week period nse results for the calibration period and the validation period were 0 9017 and 0 9448 respectively during the rainy season width parameter k width as well as manning s roughness for pervious n perv impervious n imperv and conduit n cwet were calibrated and validated against measured discharge data of four storm events to reflect spatial differences these parameters were separately calibrated and validated for old and new urban districts nse values ranged from 0 529 to 0 873 during calibration and from 0 601 to 0 636 during validation for old urban districts new urban districts performed better with nse values ranging from 0 876 to 0 89 during calibration and from 0 538 to 0 699 during validation nps pollution simulation parameters were determined using field rainfall simulator system data here stormwater pollutants of cod tss nh3 n and tp were examined parameters of maximum possible build up per unit area build up exponent wash off coefficient and wash off exponent for each land use type roofs green area and roads were auto determined using latin hypercube sampling the parameter sets with the best performance in terms of nse were selected apart from nh3 n for roads which had an nse of 0 30 predictions with these parameters performed well for all pollutants nse values for nh3 n prediction were 0 89 and 0 979 for roof and green areas respectively for different surfaces nses ranged from 0 54 to 0 865 for tp from 0 68 to 0 977 for cod and from 0 79 to 0 988 for ss more details are available in hou et al 2020 and calibrated values for these parameters are shown in table 1 2 3 stormwater management system design pcswmm simulation was performed for a city scale stormwater management system design in qian an the average rainfall depth of qian an city from 1984 to 2013 was 622 6 mm the total rainfall in 2003 was 636 5 mm which is the closest to the average rainfall depth therefore 2003 was chosen as the typical year for simulations in this investigation according to the baseline simulation and field investigation results reasons for urban flooding and pollution include small pipe high impervious ratio small slope insufficient drainage capacity of downstream pipelines and broken ends therefore the stormwater management system considers adopting lid concepts as source measures drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as midway control measures and storage tanks as midway and terminal control approaches two schemes were designed scheme i included 188 projects with a total investment of 2 456 billion yuan scheme ii included 184 projects with a total investment of 2 697 billion yuan considering cost benefit and practicability scheme i was selected as the final implementation scheme in scheme i lid implementations i e permeable pavements bio retention cells infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetative wales and storage ponds were set to new and rebuilt areas the total area of lid implementation was 1283 96 ha including 727 20 ha of residential area 206 07 ha of public buildings 350 69 ha of parks and green areas 479 21 ha of unused land and 236 54 ha of roads drainage system rehabilitation and renovation were set according to defects recorded during pipeline inspection a total of 102 km of pipeline were dredged and repaired and 18 pipelines were renovated combined sewer separation projects were designed for drainage and water quality benefits to further solve the problems of stormwater and cso eight stormwater storage tanks were designed including a terminal storage with a volume of 9696 m3 2 4 performance evaluation three scenarios were explored for performance evaluation i the baseline represented the present situation ii the lid scenario included all lid implementations and iii the sponge city scenario represented the stormwater management system notably all measures in both the lid and sponge city scenarios were set in strict accordance with scheme i thus reflecting landing measures rather than imaging measures most lid parameters i e drainage area media composition thickness of each media layer surface ponding depth and underdrain size were obtained from design drawings to accurately express each lid practice parameter conductivity of the soil layer greatly influenced lid simulation which was measured using the double loop method other non structural parameters were calibrated and validated using monitoring data from three bio retention cells at different locations table 2 rainfalls that occurred on 24th july 2018 105 mm 13 h and 7th august 2018 60 mm 10 h were used for calibration and validation respectively agreement between the timing and shape of the observed hydrographs and those computed by the calibrated model was satisfactory for each location during calibration and validation nses ranged from 0 77 to 0 83 and from 0 60 to 0 66 for the three bio retention cells respectively indicating that the calibrated model can generate realistic runoff for the lids the focus of most evaluation models has been on design events i e having a 2 100 year return period luan et al 2017 some scholars pointed out that lid practices are normally implemented as a long term functioning engineering measure and the technical performance in the short term scenarios do not adequately represent the average performance during the long term implementation guan et al 2015 yang et al 2020 yage et al 2020 found that when the rainfall scenario exceeded 1 year the effects on the runoff removal rate was constant therefore continuous modelling was undertaken in this study as 2003 was classified as a typical year data from that year was used to represent average rainfall characteristics in the simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 stormwater quantity and urban flooding control it is reported that the combined application of the lid practices show better performance than single lid practice yang et al 2020 however the collective effect of lid practices on a city scale remains unknown the total area of lid implementation in this study was 1283 96 ha it is very rare that designed lids have an integrated catchment exceeding 1000 ha ma et al 2019 results showed that average rainfall infitration for the urban area increased from 190 mm to 308 mm and the average runoff coefficient rc decreased from 0 52 to 0 36 table 3 the results indicate that lid practices implemented in the pilot area can allow the entire city to effectively control runoff rc is reported to be scale dependent and decreases as area increases cerdan et al 2004 lemma et al 2018 furthermore the runoff control capacity can vary due to different lid practices hydrological pattern installation location and vertical parameter setting bai et al 2019 qin et al 2013 therefore more studies on the collective effect of lid practices on cities or larger spatial scales are needed on the annual scale total inflow volume tiv and total flood volume tfv table 4 were used to further investigate stormwater volume control effects after lid or sponge city application compared with baseline results the reduction rates of tivs were 24 05 and 32 26 for lid and sponge city scenarios respectively under lid 47 02 and sponge city 53 68 scenarios tfvs recorded greater decreases these results indicate that the creation of a sponge city represents a reliable solution towards alleviating increasingly severe urban pluvial flooding faced by qian an city to further explore the impacts of the sci on urban flooding the maximum fractions of conduit full depth of one large rainfall event were examined fig 3 rainfall occurred on 28th july was selected having a total rainfall depth of 118 mm and a mean rainfall intensity of 32 37 mm h even though lids have been implemented on a large scale solely relying on green infrastructure to improve the drainage capacity is not sufficient under intense rainfall conditions lid has a limited ability to mitigate large rainfall events luan et al 2017 and a general lack of available space is a limiting factor for suitable lid implemantation qiao et al 2020 in the sponge city scenario the maximum fraction of the conduit full depth decreased for all pipe networks representing the effectiveness of upgrading existing drainage systems and building large pump stations although china is the most populous country in the world and its economy has continued to develop rapidly for more than three decades the infrastructure in urban areas remains poor and outdated hou et al 2020 xia et al 2017 therefore adopting grey approaches in the sponge city construction is essential and necessary in most cases a hydrograph of the most downstream outlet outfall500 is reprented in fig 4 compared with the baseline an effect of 10 20 min of outflow delay was basically confirmed for all events and peak flow decreased by 6 1 38 28 and 48 99 88 12 under lid and sponge city scenarios respectively as expected the addition of sewer separation and storage tanks in the sponge city scenario had a more obvious control effect the measures effectively delayed peak inflow improved drainage ability and increased storage surprisingly the value for peak flow reduction for a large event that occurred on 7th august was negative the combination of the fast response of the saturated substrate generated by early rain and the slow response of the lid might have caused this negative reduction rate for this event versini et al 2015 reported similar results for several events and certain green roofing scenarios were shown to exert negative effects on peak flow reduction 3 2 nps pollution control effects through lids implementation it has been acknowledged that lids could significantly decrease pollutant loads kong et al 2021 however few studies have evaluated the effects of multiple lid practices on nps loads on large spatial scales kong et al 2021 results from our investigation suggest that lid practices could largely decrease nps pollution on city scale as shown in table 5 annual reduced nps loads of cod ss nh3 n and tp on underlying surfaces were 252 97 t 192 19 t 4 52 t and 1 7 t respectively reduction rates reached 38 13 37 59 35 21 and 37 11 respectively the difference in pollutant load reduction rates of different pollutants was also recorded to be small it is believed that the enormous reduction of nps load through lids significantly alleviates stress on the receiving water bodies however due to differing geological and climatic conditions more investigations are needed to increase our understanding of lid impacts on nps pollution on large spatial scales the spatial variances of nps pollution load reduction for single sub catchments are presented in fig 5 recording pollution load reduction rates ranging from 0 to 99 4 due to different levels of baseline loads various types and sizes of lid measures in each sub catchment pollution load reduction rates recorded significant variations for qian an nps pollution control has achieved a good level of performance for the central area with its combined sewer system as the level of performance is noted to exceed that in the new urban area in the south two reasons are proposed to account for this result firstly most of the central area consists of old residential areas where more lid practices were implemented secondly due to relatively low green coverage nps pollution in the old area was more serious under baseline conditions than that of the new area 3 3 pollution control benefits for receiving rivers pollution control benefits for receiving rivers were examined by analyzing pollutant loads flowing into the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and orifices fig 6 pollutant loads into wwtps representing pollution to be treated remained relatively stable over the year cod and ss loads decreased while nh3 n and tp loads slightly increased pollutant load into orifices represents direct discharge into rivers having the greatest effect on river water quality lid implementation offset pollution pressures to some extent with reduction rates ranging from 34 45 to 38 94 for various pollutants after adding both midway and terminal approaches significant increases in pollution control were found for all pollutants the reduction rates reached 40 96 71 18 41 57 and 50 40 for cod nh3 n ss and tp respectively therefore drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as well as storage tanks are important for pollution control as urban drainage systems in china have not been upgraded with rapid population growth and urban expansion strengthening drainage systems across cities is therefore important for stormwater management it should be noted that after drainage rehabilitation and renovation the pollution load reduction effect varied strongly among different pollutants the reason for this may be due to different concentrations of different pollutants in domestic sewage and stormwater according to hou et al 2020 nps pollution load into rivers will increase due to direct discharge of stormwater and cso pollution will decrease due to combined sewer separation projects therefore a change in pollutant discharge depends on the relative amount of increased nps loads and reduced cso loads nps pollution control objective is suggested to be increased in the sponge city planning and the related design of lid practices hou et al 2020 furthermore terminal facilities such as riparian zones and storage tanks are recommended to avoid the direct discharge of stormwater runoff mckergow et al 2016 the pollutgraph of outfall500 is shown in fig 7 lid measures are generally undertaken on the micro scale and for decentralized facilities that can manage stormwater at the source through natural processes li et al 2019 therefore instantaneous concentrations did not record noticeable changes for the most downstream outlet after lid implementation for cod and ss peak concentrations were higher and durations with high concentraion were longer under the sponge city scenario for nh3 n and tp the peak concentraion significantly decreased for some events concentrations decreased by more than 70 combined with the hydrograph of outfall500 in fig 5 these results indicate that an obvious reduction in pollution load for the majority of downstream outlets depends on a reduction in water volume reduced cso pollution load and an increase in nps pollution load 4 conclusions it is of great significance to undertake urban stormwater control research on regional scales from cities upwards so that multiple objectives and complex factors can be fully considered in this study we designed and evaluated a stormwater management system sponge city for controlling flooding nps pollution and cso pollution systematically at a city scale the sponge city was designed by integrating lid practices drainage system rehabilitation renovation and storage tanks achieving source midway terminal control especially differences between old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and pipeline defects in cities were fully expressed in the process of system design then stormwater control effects were evaluated and compared under lid only and sponge city scenarios the total area of lid implementation exceeded 1000 ha which enables the city to control rainfall runoff to a certain extent greatly reducing nps pollution however lid on its own has a limited ability to improve drainage capacity the adoption of midway and terminal approaches including the rehabilitation and renovation of the drainage system as well as addition of storage tanks has significant positive effects for both water quantity and quality control the designed stormwater management system sponge city is proved to be a no regrets adaption strategy that can offset the pressures of urban flooding and pollution on city scale however nps pollution load will increase and cso pollution load will decrease due to combined sewer separation projects discharge of pollutants into a receiving river depends on the relative amount of increased nps loads and reduced cso loads therefore nps pollution control objective is suggested to be increased in the future

and 50 40 total phosphorus tp lid on its own allows the city as a whole to control runoff and to largely reduce nps pollution however it has a limited ability to improve drainage capacity adopting grey approaches such as drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as well as storage tanks was proved to be essential for drainage capacity improvement and pollution control on city scale however

nps pollution control target when designing stormwater control system terminal facilities such as riparian zones and storage tanks are encouraged to better control nps pollution methods and conclusions on the comprehensive consideration of urban complex conditions systematic stormwater control and the effectiveness of different measures highlighted in this study on a city scale provide important reference for future urban sustainable stormwater management keywords flooding non point source pollution combined sewer overflow pollution sponge city 1 introduction an increase in urban pluvial flooding non point source nps pollution and combined sewer overflow cso pollution increasingly threaten human life and property in china urban pluvial flooding has been reported across megacities such as shanghai wuhan shenzhen tianjin and beijing characterized by being large in area the loss of life and extensive damage to property jiang et al 2018 qiu 2012 moreover overflow consisting of mixed wastewater and stormwater results in a deterioration in water quality in receiving water bodies qiao et al 2018 sustainable stormwater management ssm concepts and technologies e g low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud have been developed as alternative solutions yang et al 2021 the new concept of using sponge cities for ssm was introduced by the chinese government in 2014 mhurd 2014 beyond lid facilities the sponge city concept has been expanded as an integrated way to systematically address all stormwater related problems in china for systematic control of urban stormwater it is important to undertake investigations on regional scales from cities upwards firstly environmental sustainability including urban pluvial flooding nps pollution and cso pollution control should be fully considered as the primary aim of systematic control qiao et al 2020 secondly the coexistence of old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and varying degrees of pipeline defects currently present in the majority of cities need to be addressed hou et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 accordingly these complex factors e g discharge of domestic sewage the difference between old and new areas and river groundwater infiltration should also be considered in the process of design and evaluation of systematic control however only studies on cities and larger spatial scales can result in these objectives and complex factors to be fully considered and expressed a number of studies have provided perspectives for the design construction or evaluation of ssm on field district or catchment scales ahiablame et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 kong et al 2017 there is currently disagreement on whether grey or green infrastructure is more important for solving stormwater problems e g pluvial flooding and waterlogging bertrand krajewski 2021 hu et al 2019 randall et al 2019 and only a few studies have examined nps pollution yang et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 comprehensive studies examining joint pressures imposed by drainage capacity and flooding as well as nps and cso pollutions are rarely undertaken due to difficulties in implementing ssm on large spatial scales the influence of complex factors and a lack of basic data research related to large scales or city scales is difficult to collect or it is currently lacking therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to design a ssm system sponge city on a city scale by fully considering differences between old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and pipeline defects and 2 to evaluate the efficiency or limitations of project implementation for improving urban stormwater systems i e urban flooding risk as well as nps and cso pollution providing reference for future ssm strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area thirty cities 16 in 2015 and 14 in 2016 were selected as pilot cities for the sponge city initiative sci mhurd 2014 qian an was the only city in the initial selection of scis to be located in north china this city features all of the typical problems associated with northern cities for example having rapid urbanization and an outdated drainage system severe pipeline defects frequent urban flooding and poor water quality compared with other pilot cities the built up area of qian an is relatively small thus the whole urban area can be set as a pilot area qian an is located northeast of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration situated in hebei province its average annual temperature is 10 3 c and multi year average precipitation is 672 mm being part of the warm and semi humid continental climate belt qian an is characterized by frequent rainfall in the summer with about 80 of total rainfall falling from june to september as shown in fig 1 the urban area of qian an occupies an area of 2500 ha the pilot area includes 1096 57 ha of buildings 398 66 ha of roads 368 31 ha of green area 28 25 ha of water and 253 21 ha of unused land accounting for 86 2150 ha of the urban area a combined sewer system is currently operating for the central and northeastern areas of qian an here the main sewers are located along the sanli river having six overflow orifices and two stormwater outlets fig 1a the western and southern areas of the city are served by a separate storm sewer system similar to many other cities in china qian an suffers severe stormwater problems including frequent urban flooding overflow and poor water quality as an example on 25th july 2016 a rainfall event with a 20 year return period occurred in qian an the urban area included 39 obvious waterlogging water points with depths of 0 15 0 35 m and the total ponding area was about 34 33 ha for areas with a combined sewer system 856 pipeline defects were identified in key pipe sections when inspected using a cctv inspection robot and a periscope fig 2 defects included 175 structural defects and 681 functional defects the main problems in the pipelines included deposition 33 76 and tree root 28 39 followed by obstacles 10 75 cracks 7 83 and foreign matter 4 91 groundwater depth level in qian an ranged from 3 to 22 m being relatively shallow for a built up area 3 7 m therefore severe groundwater river infiltration issues exist in this area due to pipeline defects 2 2 construction of the baseline simulation model 2 2 1 model construction a personal computer stormwater management model pcswmm developed by computational hydraulics international chi based on swmm was used in this study james et al 2003 pcswmm can provide user friendly pre and post processors that reduce input errors and offer tools to improve understanding of the results james et al 2003 basic data including sewer system data meteorological data elevation data land use and soil type data were obtained from the local government digital elevation model dem sewer network and land use data were used to delineate the catchment and a total of 472 sub catchments were identified in the study area sub catchment runoff was assigned to the sewer node which was closest to the sub catchment area centroid borris et al 2017 the basic characteristics of the site i e area percentage of impervious area and storm drain layout and the geophysical characteristics of the site i e the in situ soil type were derived from land use soil type and sewer maps the sub catchment slope was calculated using dem data nps modeling contains many complexities e g inherent complexity of stormwater quality processes the available data for model calibration and validation obropta and kardos 2007 to obtain better runoff data for calibration and validation of nps parameters a field rainfall simulator system was applied in this study a total of 15 rainfall events with various rainfall intensities 6 250 mm h were simulated and flow rate and pollutant concentrations were simultaneously monitored further details are presented by hou et al 2020 due to severe pipeline defects sewer pipelines covering the pollution source pipeline network sewage treatment plant were monitored water flow was measured using online flowmeters fl900 hach loveland colorado usa and four pollutants chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids ss ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp were analysed within 6 h of water collection following standard methods sepa 2002 based on monitoring results per capita sewage discharge was calculated to be 155 l person per day average concentrations of codcr nh3 n tp and ss were 334 0 mg l 92 3 mg l 7 3 mg l and 79 mg l respectively considering that the monitoring occurred during the dry season groundwater river infiltration unclear sewage inflow and pipeline leakage are the three main forms of abnormal changes in sewage discharge 1 δ q q u q l q i where δq represents the abnormal changes in sewage volume between upstream and downstream nodes m3 d q u represents the unclear sewage inflow due to misconnection m3 d ql represents the amount of sewage leakage m3 d q i represents the amount of groundwater river infiltration m3 d the abnormal changes in sewage volume are calculated by comparing theoretical sewage volume with monitored sewage volume 2 δ q q dn q up q th where qdn and qup represent the monitored sewage volume between downstream and upstream nodes m3 d q th represent the theoretical sewage volume multiply population number within the catchment area between upstream and downstream nodes by per capita sewage discharge m3 d 3 δ l l dn l up l th where ldn and lup represent the monitored sewage load between downstream and upstream nodes t d l th represents the theoretical sewage load m3 d the abnormal change rate in sewage volume of the entire study area was calculated as 32 5 showing the adverse effect of pipeline defects on the combined sewer system by analyzing the sewage volume and load changes in each node groundwater river infiltration was considered as the main forms for the changes then groundwater river infiltration for each node was allocated to nodes in the model hou et al 2019 2 2 2 calibration of hydrological and nps parameters hydrological and nps parameters were previously calibrated and validated by hou et al 2020 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to evaluate fitness between measured and simulated data hydrological and hydraulic parameters were separately calibrated for both dry and rainy seasons during the dry season the manning s roughness for conduit n cdry was calibrated and validated against measured discharge over a two week period nse results for the calibration period and the validation period were 0 9017 and 0 9448 respectively during the rainy season width parameter k width as well as manning s roughness for pervious n perv impervious n imperv and conduit n cwet were calibrated and validated against measured discharge data of four storm events to reflect spatial differences these parameters were separately calibrated and validated for old and new urban districts nse values ranged from 0 529 to 0 873 during calibration and from 0 601 to 0 636 during validation for old urban districts new urban districts performed better with nse values ranging from 0 876 to 0 89 during calibration and from 0 538 to 0 699 during validation nps pollution simulation parameters were determined using field rainfall simulator system data here stormwater pollutants of cod tss nh3 n and tp were examined parameters of maximum possible build up per unit area build up exponent wash off coefficient and wash off exponent for each land use type roofs green area and roads were auto determined using latin hypercube sampling the parameter sets with the best performance in terms of nse were selected apart from nh3 n for roads which had an nse of 0 30 predictions with these parameters performed well for all pollutants nse values for nh3 n prediction were 0 89 and 0 979 for roof and green areas respectively for different surfaces nses ranged from 0 54 to 0 865 for tp from 0 68 to 0 977 for cod and from 0 79 to 0 988 for ss more details are available in hou et al 2020 and calibrated values for these parameters are shown in table 1 2 3 stormwater management system design pcswmm simulation was performed for a city scale stormwater management system design in qian an the average rainfall depth of qian an city from 1984 to 2013 was 622 6 mm the total rainfall in 2003 was 636 5 mm which is the closest to the average rainfall depth therefore 2003 was chosen as the typical year for simulations in this investigation according to the baseline simulation and field investigation results reasons for urban flooding and pollution include small pipe high impervious ratio small slope insufficient drainage capacity of downstream pipelines and broken ends therefore the stormwater management system considers adopting lid concepts as source measures drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as midway control measures and storage tanks as midway and terminal control approaches two schemes were designed scheme i included 188 projects with a total investment of 2 456 billion yuan scheme ii included 184 projects with a total investment of 2 697 billion yuan considering cost benefit and practicability scheme i was selected as the final implementation scheme in scheme i lid implementations i e permeable pavements bio retention cells infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetative wales and storage ponds were set to new and rebuilt areas the total area of lid implementation was 1283 96 ha including 727 20 ha of residential area 206 07 ha of public buildings 350 69 ha of parks and green areas 479 21 ha of unused land and 236 54 ha of roads drainage system rehabilitation and renovation were set according to defects recorded during pipeline inspection a total of 102 km of pipeline were dredged and repaired and 18 pipelines were renovated combined sewer separation projects were designed for drainage and water quality benefits to further solve the problems of stormwater and cso eight stormwater storage tanks were designed including a terminal storage with a volume of 9696 m3 2 4 performance evaluation three scenarios were explored for performance evaluation i the baseline represented the present situation ii the lid scenario included all lid implementations and iii the sponge city scenario represented the stormwater management system notably all measures in both the lid and sponge city scenarios were set in strict accordance with scheme i thus reflecting landing measures rather than imaging measures most lid parameters i e drainage area media composition thickness of each media layer surface ponding depth and underdrain size were obtained from design drawings to accurately express each lid practice parameter conductivity of the soil layer greatly influenced lid simulation which was measured using the double loop method other non structural parameters were calibrated and validated using monitoring data from three bio retention cells at different locations table 2 rainfalls that occurred on 24th july 2018 105 mm 13 h and 7th august 2018 60 mm 10 h were used for calibration and validation respectively agreement between the timing and shape of the observed hydrographs and those computed by the calibrated model was satisfactory for each location during calibration and validation nses ranged from 0 77 to 0 83 and from 0 60 to 0 66 for the three bio retention cells respectively indicating that the calibrated model can generate realistic runoff for the lids the focus of most evaluation models has been on design events i e having a 2 100 year return period luan et al 2017 some scholars pointed out that lid practices are normally implemented as a long term functioning engineering measure and the technical performance in the short term scenarios do not adequately represent the average performance during the long term implementation guan et al 2015 yang et al 2020 yage et al 2020 found that when the rainfall scenario exceeded 1 year the effects on the runoff removal rate was constant therefore continuous modelling was undertaken in this study as 2003 was classified as a typical year data from that year was used to represent average rainfall characteristics in the simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 stormwater quantity and urban flooding control it is reported that the combined application of the lid practices show better performance than single lid practice yang et al 2020 however the collective effect of lid practices on a city scale remains unknown the total area of lid implementation in this study was 1283 96 ha it is very rare that designed lids have an integrated catchment exceeding 1000 ha ma et al 2019 results showed that average rainfall infitration for the urban area increased from 190 mm to 308 mm and the average runoff coefficient rc decreased from 0 52 to 0 36 table 3 the results indicate that lid practices implemented in the pilot area can allow the entire city to effectively control runoff rc is reported to be scale dependent and decreases as area increases cerdan et al 2004 lemma et al 2018 furthermore the runoff control capacity can vary due to different lid practices hydrological pattern installation location and vertical parameter setting bai et al 2019 qin et al 2013 therefore more studies on the collective effect of lid practices on cities or larger spatial scales are needed on the annual scale total inflow volume tiv and total flood volume tfv table 4 were used to further investigate stormwater volume control effects after lid or sponge city application compared with baseline results the reduction rates of tivs were 24 05 and 32 26 for lid and sponge city scenarios respectively under lid 47 02 and sponge city 53 68 scenarios tfvs recorded greater decreases these results indicate that the creation of a sponge city represents a reliable solution towards alleviating increasingly severe urban pluvial flooding faced by qian an city to further explore the impacts of the sci on urban flooding the maximum fractions of conduit full depth of one large rainfall event were examined fig 3 rainfall occurred on 28th july was selected having a total rainfall depth of 118 mm and a mean rainfall intensity of 32 37 mm h even though lids have been implemented on a large scale solely relying on green infrastructure to improve the drainage capacity is not sufficient under intense rainfall conditions lid has a limited ability to mitigate large rainfall events luan et al 2017 and a general lack of available space is a limiting factor for suitable lid implemantation qiao et al 2020 in the sponge city scenario the maximum fraction of the conduit full depth decreased for all pipe networks representing the effectiveness of upgrading existing drainage systems and building large pump stations although china is the most populous country in the world and its economy has continued to develop rapidly for more than three decades the infrastructure in urban areas remains poor and outdated hou et al 2020 xia et al 2017 therefore adopting grey approaches in the sponge city construction is essential and necessary in most cases a hydrograph of the most downstream outlet outfall500 is reprented in fig 4 compared with the baseline an effect of 10 20 min of outflow delay was basically confirmed for all events and peak flow decreased by 6 1 38 28 and 48 99 88 12 under lid and sponge city scenarios respectively as expected the addition of sewer separation and storage tanks in the sponge city scenario had a more obvious control effect the measures effectively delayed peak inflow improved drainage ability and increased storage surprisingly the value for peak flow reduction for a large event that occurred on 7th august was negative the combination of the fast response of the saturated substrate generated by early rain and the slow response of the lid might have caused this negative reduction rate for this event versini et al 2015 reported similar results for several events and certain green roofing scenarios were shown to exert negative effects on peak flow reduction 3 2 nps pollution control effects through lids implementation it has been acknowledged that lids could significantly decrease pollutant loads kong et al 2021 however few studies have evaluated the effects of multiple lid practices on nps loads on large spatial scales kong et al 2021 results from our investigation suggest that lid practices could largely decrease nps pollution on city scale as shown in table 5 annual reduced nps loads of cod ss nh3 n and tp on underlying surfaces were 252 97 t 192 19 t 4 52 t and 1 7 t respectively reduction rates reached 38 13 37 59 35 21 and 37 11 respectively the difference in pollutant load reduction rates of different pollutants was also recorded to be small it is believed that the enormous reduction of nps load through lids significantly alleviates stress on the receiving water bodies however due to differing geological and climatic conditions more investigations are needed to increase our understanding of lid impacts on nps pollution on large spatial scales the spatial variances of nps pollution load reduction for single sub catchments are presented in fig 5 recording pollution load reduction rates ranging from 0 to 99 4 due to different levels of baseline loads various types and sizes of lid measures in each sub catchment pollution load reduction rates recorded significant variations for qian an nps pollution control has achieved a good level of performance for the central area with its combined sewer system as the level of performance is noted to exceed that in the new urban area in the south two reasons are proposed to account for this result firstly most of the central area consists of old residential areas where more lid practices were implemented secondly due to relatively low green coverage nps pollution in the old area was more serious under baseline conditions than that of the new area 3 3 pollution control benefits for receiving rivers pollution control benefits for receiving rivers were examined by analyzing pollutant loads flowing into the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and orifices fig 6 pollutant loads into wwtps representing pollution to be treated remained relatively stable over the year cod and ss loads decreased while nh3 n and tp loads slightly increased pollutant load into orifices represents direct discharge into rivers having the greatest effect on river water quality lid implementation offset pollution pressures to some extent with reduction rates ranging from 34 45 to 38 94 for various pollutants after adding both midway and terminal approaches significant increases in pollution control were found for all pollutants the reduction rates reached 40 96 71 18 41 57 and 50 40 for cod nh3 n ss and tp respectively therefore drainage system rehabilitation and renovation as well as storage tanks are important for pollution control as urban drainage systems in china have not been upgraded with rapid population growth and urban expansion strengthening drainage systems across cities is therefore important for stormwater management it should be noted that after drainage rehabilitation and renovation the pollution load reduction effect varied strongly among different pollutants the reason for this may be due to different concentrations of different pollutants in domestic sewage and stormwater according to hou et al 2020 nps pollution load into rivers will increase due to direct discharge of stormwater and cso pollution will decrease due to combined sewer separation projects therefore a change in pollutant discharge depends on the relative amount of increased nps loads and reduced cso loads nps pollution control objective is suggested to be increased in the sponge city planning and the related design of lid practices hou et al 2020 furthermore terminal facilities such as riparian zones and storage tanks are recommended to avoid the direct discharge of stormwater runoff mckergow et al 2016 the pollutgraph of outfall500 is shown in fig 7 lid measures are generally undertaken on the micro scale and for decentralized facilities that can manage stormwater at the source through natural processes li et al 2019 therefore instantaneous concentrations did not record noticeable changes for the most downstream outlet after lid implementation for cod and ss peak concentrations were higher and durations with high concentraion were longer under the sponge city scenario for nh3 n and tp the peak concentraion significantly decreased for some events concentrations decreased by more than 70 combined with the hydrograph of outfall500 in fig 5 these results indicate that an obvious reduction in pollution load for the majority of downstream outlets depends on a reduction in water volume reduced cso pollution load and an increase in nps pollution load 4 conclusions it is of great significance to undertake urban stormwater control research on regional scales from cities upwards so that multiple objectives and complex factors can be fully considered in this study we designed and evaluated a stormwater management system sponge city for controlling flooding nps pollution and cso pollution systematically at a city scale the sponge city was designed by integrating lid practices drainage system rehabilitation renovation and storage tanks achieving source midway terminal control especially differences between old and new districts the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and pipeline defects in cities were fully expressed in the process of system design then stormwater control effects were evaluated and compared under lid only and sponge city scenarios the total area of lid implementation exceeded 1000 ha which enables the city to control rainfall runoff to a certain extent greatly reducing nps pollution however lid on its own has a limited ability to improve drainage capacity the adoption of midway and terminal approaches including the rehabilitation and renovation of the drainage system as well as addition of storage tanks has significant positive effects for both water quantity and quality control the designed stormwater management system sponge city is proved to be a no regrets adaption strategy that can offset the pressures of urban flooding and pollution on city scale however nps pollution load will increase and cso pollution load will decrease due to combined sewer separation projects discharge of pollutants into a receiving river depends on the relative amount of increased nps loads and reduced cso loads therefore nps pollution control objective is suggested to be increased in the future sponge city planning beyond lids the terminal facilities such as riparian zones and storage tanks are encouraged credit authorship contribution statement xiaoshu hou conceptualization methodology
