21195,routine cleaning of the corroded ship hulls in dry dock maintenance guarantees the smooth operation of the shipping industry deploying the autonomous system to remove the corrosion by water blasting is a feasible approach to ease the burden in manual operation and to reduce water time and energy consumption in this paper the water blasting framework is proposed for a novel robot platform named hornbill with the adhesion mechanism by permanent magnetic self localization by sensor fusion to navigate smoothly on a vertical surface hence we propose a complete waypoint path planning cwpp to re blast the self synthesizing deep convolutional neural network dcnn based corrosion heatmap by initial blasting the optimal cwpp problem including the shortest travel distance and shortest travel time to save water power while ensuring visiting all predefined waypoints by benchmarking output is modeled as the classic travel salesman problem tsp further the pareto optimal trajectory for given tsp has been driven by the reinforcement learning rl technique with a proposed reward function based on the robot s operation during blasting from the experimental results at the shipyard site the proposed rl based cwpp generates the pareto optimal trajectory that enables the water blasting robot to spend about 10 of energy and 9 of water less than the second best evolutionary based optimization method in various workspaces keywords ship maintenance industry corrosion cleaning benchmarking blasting quality reinforcement learning path planning 1 introduction the smoothness of ship hulls is degraded when operated due to the attachment of naval particles and surface corrosion swain and lund 2016 adland et al 2018 moreover the direct exposure of the hull s metal layer leads to the wearing and tearing of the paint layer thereby a ship hull needs to be regularly repainted after 4 5 years of utilization to ensure sustainability gong et al 2019 garbatov et al 2018 corrosion level needs to be routinely evaluated to decide the safety condition of ships dong and frangopol 2015 parween et al 2020 the existing paint and possible rust layers should be appropriately removed before repainting hydro blasting is usually conducted on ship hulls for this purpose adland et al 2018 high pressurized water is jetted onto ship hulls with the aid of heavy machines that were operated by human workers the efficiency cost and safety are the major concerns of the conventional approaches for ship hull blasting which require an extensive human workforce as a result of these concerns robotic researchers attention has drifted toward the development of robotics solutions for facilitating autonomous hydro blasting of ship hulls robotics solutions for automatic inspection and maintenance have proven their versatility in various industries such as building maintenance le et al 2019b 2020a 2018b road maintenance le et al 2019a yi et al 2020 and path tracking shi et al 2020 and service robot yin et al 2020 le et al 2020b similarly many robotic solutions have been proposed for automating the inspection and maintenance work undertaken in dry dock the ship maintenance industry has been benefited from the utilization of many robotic tools attached to ground based structures such as cranes zheng et al 2016 aijazi et al 2016 navarro et al 2013 hachicha et al 2018 however these ground based robotic solutions have low performance when accessing a whole ship hull hence robotic solutions based on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have also been proposed to improve the accessibility to a ship hull kim and chun 2017 bonnin pascual and ortiz 2019 however the existing solutions based on uavs are limited to inspection and they are not strong enough for handling tools such as blasting guns required for maintenance work climbing robot mechanisms are widely utilized in the maintenance and inspection of vertical structures due to their intrinsic accessing ability nansai and mohan 2016 muthugala et al 2019 similarly many climbing robots have been developed targeting the ship maintenance industry huang et al 2017 stepson et al 2017 the majority of these robots are wheeled robots with magnetic adhesion since ship hulls are made of ferromagnetic materials however the scope of the work cited above is limited to the development of hardware design for climbing which targets ship maintenance some of the commercial products have been deployed in the industry practices for ship hull cleaning the vertidrive m3 vertidrivee 2020 robots are designed to effectively remove dirt paint and coatings on various steel surfaces like storage tanks ship hulls and other large steel structures the robot operated only with the manual mode with no sensor integration for simultaneous localization and mapping slam or cleaning benchmarking hullskater 2020 has been designed to be carried with the vessel and can be regularly deployed to remove early stage fouling the hullskater removes bacteria and biofilm from the hull before the macro fouling namely weeds and barnacles can take hold the robot is not autonomous but is remotely piloted in realtime by the staff in a 24 h operations center they are guided by outputs from the hullskaters four spotlight assisted cameras three on the front one on the rear the data has been carried by the robot to a 4g transceiver on the ship via an umbilical cable one complete cleaning should take two to 8 h depending on the vessel so far in the field of ship hull cleaning numerous robotic technologies have been implemented also most of these robotic platforms are available in the commercial marketplace however none of the existing robotics technology addresses the problem of cleaning efficiency that how much percentage of cleanliness has been yielded by the robot according to iso 8501 1 to indicate the hull cleanliness a blasted surface is categorized to a class among class sa 2 5 very good free from visible oil grease and dirt and mill scale rust paint coatings and foreign matters class sa 2 acceptable slight traces of contamination in the form of spots or stripes and class sa 1 not acceptable surface have nonuniform metallic color the ship hull must be maintained to ensure the quality before they start to paint the hull such a cleanliness class was challenging to maintain with a robotic platform due to the ship hull s nonlinear metal surface in our proposed work for the first time we are mapping the cleanliness of the ship hull concerning the defined classes as a benchmarking result we generate an efficient path trajectory leveraging the rl framework to re clean the identified class sa 1 regions ship hull maintenance robots should be equipped with mechanisms for inspecting the surface for decision making majority of these inspection mechanisms utilize computer vision to detect corroded areas of hulls ahuja and shukla 2017 apart from vision systems the utilization of laser based measuring systems for detecting defects could also be observed zhang et al 2018 for example the work jalalian et al 2018 proposed background subtraction techniques based on histogram analysis feedforward neural networks and deep convolutional neural network dcnn have been proposed for detecting corrosion in ortiz et al 2016 and kumar et al 2019 respectively even though many techniques have been proposed for detecting corrosion in ship inspections the scope of systems is not up to the development of a fully integrated solution for ship hull inspection and blasting furthermore the utilization of the methods mentioned above to evaluate blasting quality is doubtful since the surface appearance will be changing from the natural corrosion build ups when the blasting has been applied fernández isla et al fernández isla et al 2013 proposed an integrated solution that can detect corroded areas in a ship hull and subsequently perform spot the blasting on identified corroded areas in this system the blasting is carried out by a blasting manipulator attached to a crane however the system s usability for evaluating the smooth quality of an already blasted surface has not been discussed within the scope in addition path planning for energy efficient coverage of blasting waypoints has not been considered in the work a method for evaluating the quality of the blasting cycle and synthesizing a benchmarking map that could be utilized for spot re blasting has been proposed in muthugala et al 2020 the method uses a self organizing fuzzy logic classifier for categorizing the blasting quality however the work is merely limited to the development of a blasting benchmarking system the path planning and blasting parameter setting for re blasting cycles have not been discussed in the cited work the work li et al 2018 proposed an efficient path planning method for a spot blasting system the proposed method maps the spot blasting process to a travel salesman problem tsp and uses the genetic algorithm ga cheng et al 2020 and reinforcement learning le et al 2020c and motion planning veerajagadheswar et al 2020 to find the optimum path the optimizing criterion is designed to find the shortest path on site experiments with a robotic hardware system have not been conducted and validation has been performed through a highly constrained simulation the main limitation of the work is the assumption of traveling distance as the sole criterion for energy efficiency since the energy usage of a blasting robot operated on a ship hull depends on other aspects such as movement direction horizontal or vertical rotation and water usage in addition time consumption is an essential factor in the industrial process which has not been a concern in this work in the shipyard s extremer hazardous outdoor conditions the autonomous systems such as cleaning robots must be made of durable material and designed with a robust mechanism to operate smoothly on a ship hull surface the advanced perception by sensors and navigation algorithms such as the complete area coverage planning cacp strategy plays an essential role in archiving autonomous and effective operation especially with the optimal global planner to ensure complete coverage a robot can save a tremendous amount of energy and resources such as water in water blasting complete coverage by generating optimal trajectory with obstacle avoidance and safe journey cheng et al 2019 le et al 2018a manimuthu et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2020 are the key objectives that need to be fulfilled by cacp to overcome the limitations of earlier works the robot assisted autonomy framework for ship hull hydro blasting has been designed and implemented in a real shipyard environment we propose a method of assessing the level of corroded areas on the ship hull surface after blasting with deep convolutional neural network dcnn learning to ease the autonomous operations then heatmap for the whole workspace is composed specifically the heatmap with probabilities is plotted from the benchmarking results from the visualization aspect of each corroded area equal to the size of the hydro blasting nozzles mounted on a proposed robot the rl approach for tsp is used to solve the optimization of finding the best navigation trajectory with minimal distance travel to save energy water and time during the water blasting rl s reward function is the 3d distance between defined waypoints that are resulted by thresholding the benchmarked heatmap a trained recurrent neural network with optimal parameters predicts a distribution over different waypoint permutations to derive the shortest costweight route finally the proposed hornbill robot with reconfigurable arms such as perception module and blasting module with the final objective of smooth navigation to perform water blasting on the corroded ship surface is used to verify the proposed autonomous framework an overview of the proposed automated water blasting for corrosion cleaning framework is presented in section 2 section 3 describes corrosion classifier and heatmap generation the reinforcement learning based waypoint path planning is presented in section 4 the novel climbing robot integrated with the proposed autonomous framework is described in detail in section 5 particulars of experimental validation are given in section 6 conclusion with future works are given in section 7 2 proposed methodology the automation system with the reconfigurable manipulator designed to clean and to self evaluate the ship hull surface during the dry dock maintenance is shown in fig 1 the complete processes of the proposed system are depicted as a block diagram in fig 2 usually the ship hull maintenance was carried out through a series of processes we developed the autonomous framework to have a similar process to complete the hydro blasting the proposed robot first starts its autonomous zigzag motion to conduct the initial removing process of painted and corroded layers on the surface the typical outcome of a ship surface after blasting is exampled as the images in fig 3 c the robot would travel on an uneven surface during the process which creates some more gap than the recommended between the nozzle of the blasting module and the surface this causes a pressure loss in the blasting which lead to uncleaned surfaces the examples of badly cleaned surfaces and partially cleaned surfaces and are shown in fig 3a and b respectively such incomplete cleaned surfaces cause issues while repainting the ship hull which will affect its performance during the sailing by forming a more corroded area over time so it is critical to maintain a consistent level of surface cleanliness along with the process of hydro blasting to accomplish the uniformity of the ship hull surface s cleanliness we utilized the benchmarking scheme to change the arm s end effector with a camera the robot performs cleanliness classification based on dcnn from the captured images during the zigzag motion once the coverage is completed a benchmarking map was generated which depicts the surface cleanliness the generated map looks like a heat map wherein the higher the heat intensity of the red color exhibits the lower cleanliness using the generated heat map the robot will create an optimal path to perform re blasting on the uncleaned area with objectives such as shortest navigation distance smallest moving upward and least energies and water consumption while performing the re blasting process the robot will regulate the water pressure selective pressure p a by considering the intensity of surface cleanliness in that particular area these processes improve the efficiency of the automated ship hull blasting and inspection work 3 corroded areas benchmark we propose the benchmarking algorithm to evaluate the severity of the corrosion region the size of the hydro blasting nozzles section across the robot s operating area after finishing the initial zigzag water hydro blasting by hornbill we utilize a googlenet inception v3 cnn architecture szegedy et al 2016 that was pre trained on approximately 1 28 million images 1000 object categories from the 2014 imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge russakovsky et al 2015 and train it on our dataset using transfer learning pan and yang 2009 we collect the dataset from major ship cleaning and maintenance service companies and manually label it to benchmarking categories with expert knowledge the model output will be the probability of surface corrosion level for the input color image obtained from the hornbill s onboard camera after finishing the zigzag water hydro blasting we construct the confusion matrix heatmap of the whole cleaned area by the robot using the output probabilities of the surface corrosion level from dcnn 3 1 deep convolution neural network convolution neural networks are recently used in image classification due to their high accuracy their structure is the basis for many object detection and image classification networks including googlenet inception v3 which we use in our approach cnns consist of four types of layers convolution layer pooling layer relu layer and fully connected layer the combination of convolution layer s and pooling layer s extracts the features from the image this is fed to the fully connected layer s which classifies the image fig 4 shows the structure of a simple cnn the four layers of cnn have been discussed elaborately in the subsequent sections 3 1 1 convolution layer this layer involves applying a filter over the input layer typically multiple filters are applied to the input layer filters are applied using a sliding window which slides over the image and applies the filter to the region covered by the window the input layer is zero padded so that the window can cover the entire input the filter used is called weight function equation 1 is used to compute the activation function f x 1 f x w x b where w represents the filter weights b represents the bias and x represents the input 3 1 2 relu layer this layer applies a relu function to the input layer it is typically used after the convolution layer it is used to remove the negative values which have been formed from the filter equation 2 computes the relu activation function f x 2 f x m a x 0 x where x represents the input layer 3 1 3 pooling layer this layer partitions the input layer into non overlapping regions on which a pooling function is applied each region outputs a single value this reduces the dimension of the input while retaining the essential features 3 1 4 fully connected layer this layer is a typical artificial neural network ann layer it is fully connected to the input layer multiple fully connected layers are used together to classify the image these are used with the final pooling layer as input the final pooling layer represents the extracted features 3 2 transfer learning using inception v3 we use google s inception v3 cnn architecture pre trained to 93 33 top five accuracy on the 1000 object classes 1 28 million images of the 2014 imagenet challenge using the optimal transfer learning technique for the amount of available data we remove the final classification layer and then retrain the original network using our prepared dataset to fine tune the parameters across all the layers during the training process we resize each image to 299 299 pixels to make it compatible with the original dimensions of the network architecture and leverage the default image features learned by the imagenet pre trained network 3 3 benchmarking heatmap generation the benchmarking as a heatmap of the initial blasting area is constructed from the corrosion level probabilities of dcnn our proposed benchmarking algorithm is described in algorithm 1 since we know the robot s length and odometry through localization modules the algorithm runs in realtime while the zigzag movement of the robot to find the heat level of each cell c k number k of the defined grid based workspace as shown in fig 5 b the mean value of surface corrosion probabilities p c resulted from trained dcnn model for camera captured images within this cell is calculated note that the each cell as a range from p x to p x is equal to length of the robot l r as depicted in fig 5a 4 reinforcement learning based hydro blasting by hornbill 4 1 optimal planning for hydro blasting the corresponding 3d location of uncleaned areas after initial blasting provided by the uwb system is defined as waypoints and located at the bottom left corner of each thresholded and classified corroded area generated by the benchmarking algorithm the algorithm depends on these points location to yield an optimal navigation trajectory for robots to re clean the workspace since the objective of minimizing the tour length is the np hard problem of the classic tsp optimization the brute force search for the optimal solution with a large number of points is impractical some practical approaches such as evolutionary based optimizations leveraged by probability techniques are proposed to estimate pareto optimal solutions in this work we applied the reinforcement learning based tsp to address sequencing an optimal trajectory algorithm 1 benchmarking heatmap reconstruction pseudocode we train a recurrent neural network to predict a distribution over different waypoint permutations given a set of waypoints using negative tour length between each waypoint as the reward signal we optimize the recurrent neural network parameters using reinforcement learning with a little engineering and no labels neural networks trained with reinforcement learning can learn intelligent heuristics or distribution over waypoint permutations for the tsp the rl network following the actor critic architecture is shown in fig 6 4 2 neural network architecture for tsp in this work we formalize the problem of complete waypoint path planning as the 3d euclidean tsp given an input state graph represented as a sequence of n locations of waypoint in a three dimensional space s w i i 1 n where each w i x i y i z i r 3 we are concerned on finding the permutation of the nodes i e a tour π that visits each node once except the starting node and has the minimum total length we propose the cost of a tour noted by a permutation π as 3 l π s d π n 1 i 1 n 1 d π i i 1 where d i i 1 α 2 x i x i 1 α 2 y i y i 1 1 α z i z i 1 2 and 2 denotes the l 2 norm and the coefficient α controls the weight of each coordinate component the system will assign the small weight to z coordinate to limit the moving upward in derived trajectory following bello et al 2016 factorizing the probability of a route by the chain rule is used in our neural network architecture as shown in equation 4 4 p π s i 1 n p π i π i s furthermore each component on the right side of equation 4 is processed consecutively by the softmax module similar to bello et al 2016 we use a method called pointer network vinyals et al 2015 consisting of two repeating nervous systems rnn modules encoders and decoders two of which include temporary memory lstm cells hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the organization encoder organizes information s city by street and changes it into an inactive memory group e n c i i 1 n where e n c i r d the contribution to the encoder organization at time step i is a one way insertion of 2d points x i obtained by direct changes of x i shared on complete input advances additional organizational decoder keeps up with its inert memory states d e c i i 1 n where d e c i r d is also kept up by the decoder and at each i progress use a steering system geared towards being popular throughout the upcoming city to visit during the visit when the following city is selected it is passed as a contribution to the following decoding step the contribution of the main decoding step denoted by z in fig 7 is a d dimensional vector that is rewarded as a trained boundary of the nervous system 4 3 optimization with reinforcement learning supervised and oriented learning for np s is difficult problems for example tsp and its variations are undesirable since the model s performance depends on the quality of the supervised labels and it is also expensive on the contrary rl investigates various visits and derives their related rewards offers simplicity and feasibility for training a neural network for the tsp the trajectory length specifying as reward r π s l π s is minimized during the iterations using the costweight as equation 3 our training objective as shown in equation 5 produces the expected reward for the given input graph s 5 j θ s e π p θ s r π s the results of training as output graphs are found from a distribution s and the total training objective as equation 6 6 j θ e s s j θ s the well known reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by williams 1992 is modified to derive an unbiased gradient of 5 with the parameters model θ 7 θ j θ s e π p θ s r π s b φ s θ log p θ π s with b φ s being the baseline a good baseline that estimates the costs of repairing a solution j θ s can stabilize the training process similar to bello et al 2016 we use a second model called critic to decrease the gradients of variances while maintaining them unbiased the critic is trained by the policy model to minimize the mean square error between its rewards and predictions 5 reconfigurable task based hornbill platform the automated hydro blasting framework is implemented and verified in the proposed robot named hornbill 2 0 the upgraded version with the reconfigurable ability of manipulators modularity is the critical feature that we required from the robot to achieve the proposed scheme this means the robot must have an exchangeable payload capability to change between the cleaning and inspection modes in addition it is not straightforward to use inspection cleaning robots available in different industry sectors to move autonomously on the vertical surface such capability was rarely found in the existing platforms which led us to design and develop a new robotic platform in the developed platform it is easier to swap between payloads with weight up to 20 kg such flexibility allows us to achieve our proposed system significantly in the current robot design we focus on the complete autonomy framework to optimize the corrosion cleaning process including initial blasting dcnn based benchmarking and rl cwpp based re blasting tasks together with mechanical design the sensor system for autonomous navigation on the ship hull surface has been added to the current work we integrated the sensors and autonomous algorithm in the same robot hardware design as previous work and validated on a real testbed site moreover in the current design we slightly modified the locomotion system such as wheels and magnetic holders to improve locomotion stability in the previous platform we endured slippages during the locomotion which leads us to incorrect cleanliness prediction and generation of the heatmap such a drawback was reduced with the new design and we could witness the effectiveness with the help of localization the robot mechanical and autonomy architectures are detailed as follows 5 1 mechanical design the proposed hornbill robot was developed under the principle of magnetic adhesion and differential drive locomotion the robot could perform various ship hulls maintenance tasks such as hydro blasting painting and surface benchmarking by replacing the appropriate end effector the robot uses its arm mechanism to perform such maintenance tasks which was designed in such a way so that the effectors can be exchanged with ease fig 8 a represent the outside look of the hornbill the robot s mechanical design is depicted as in fig 8b the hornbill platform was developed with a 535 785 480 mm dimension and a 500 mm length replaceable arm for locomotion we used 2 bldc motors that provide a torque of 55 nm each motor is fixed with a 200 mm diameter rubber wheel which creates higher friction to avoid slippage to reduce the robot s overall weight we constructed the robot with aluminum 6061 alloy material which also protects the electronic components from a high magnetic force the electronics peripherals are well sealed with a waterproof container to insulate the blasting water regarding the magnetic adhesion we used eight pieces of n50 neodymium square magnets with an aspect of 200 20 20 mm each magnet provides a pulling force of 100 kg which means the robot has an overall adhesion force of 800 kg we place four magnets at the center of the front axis two magnets each near the wheels and two half magnets at the caster wheel we maintained an air gap of 5 mm from the magnets to the metal surface with such a pulling force the robot can achieve locomotion with a payload capacity of 300 kg the robot was constructed with a manual reconfigurable arm wherein the main end effector is fixed the arm was designed with a provision to change the end effectors that can perform water blasting painting and benchmarking tasks the arm is constructed with the same aluminum material in order to reduce the weight the robot arm attached with another 25 nm torque 24 v bldc motor enables the robot to carry the load while swinging this arm with the specific end effector since this paper focuses on the water blasting system the arm was connected with a water blasting nozzle also the arm is connected with a water hose that comes from the hydro blasting machine the end effector attached to the robot was a rotating bar which has four nozzles with a size of 0 30 mm diameter the bar will rotate concerning the force that was applied to it since the blasting pressure that we used was 2500 bar it was enough to rotate the bar the bar s length was 150 mm so it creates a circle with the same diameter when the bar rotates so when we start the cleaning process it can clean the surface in a circular shape the whole arm was adequately sealed as shown in fig 1c which restricts the water leakage the same arm was used for the benchmarking purpose where we change the end effector to camera logitech c922 pro color as shown in fig 1d fig 9 shows the communication of hardware components that support autonomous navigation the system includes the base station acted as the main processing unit and robot with built in sensors and actuators the base station and robot communicate through the cable lan network 5 2 sensor system for autonomy navigation on the ship hull surface as mentioned in the previous section we attached a camera on the arm in order to perform the hull surface cleanliness benchmarking task the hornbill robot with water blasting payload and inspection payload is shown in fig 1 the control signals for the sensors and actuators are constructed in the robot operating system ros quigley et al 2009 ros nodes act as a primary communication layer that interacts between the sensor controllers and actuators through lan networks we used jetson xavier as our central processing unit wherein the realtime deep learning classification and rl frameworks are implemented the whole robot was powered through a tethered connection with two separate power supplies of 48 v and 24 v dc for locomotion motor and arm motor respectively accuracy of the robot s current position is critical for autonomous robots to achieve foul free autonomous navigation traditional approaches to get the precise absolute mobile robot position are lidar based slam hess et al 2016 and visual based slam kerl et al 2013 which use features around in its environment to achieve the coordinates there are few drawbacks in traditional slam techniques while we implement it on the hornbill robot due to its open water blasting approach and lack of features on the homogeneous surface which affects sensor operation performances to address that issue we used the precise 3d position industrial grade ultra wideband uwb beacon system the system guarantees position accuracy to 2 cm within a defined workspace up to 30 30 square meters the system consists of a set of stationary beacons and the mobile beacon which can sense each other s position using ultrasonic frequency and pass its global positional value to the receiver end through radiofrequency the beacon system can achieve a position accuracy level of 2 cm when the stationary beacons network was placed with a circular diameter of 30 m the stationary beacon was fixed on top of the robot where it can have a line of sight with other stationary beacons in order to acquire a precise location these positional values are converted into ros based odometry sensor messages and published through the odom beacon topic however the positional values are not always stable and will be affected due to an environmental disturbance lack of line of sight in some places and noise it is also critical to get a proper orientation of the robot while navigating which was not provided by the uwb system to reduce the noise and acquire all the necessary sensory information for autonomous navigation we used the sensor fusion technique d alfonso et al 2015 wherein we fused other positional sensors such as wheel encoders imu inertial sensor the fused information s output provides an accurate 3d position of the robotic system and its orientation values this message was then converted into a ros message to communicate with other ros nodes and layers the ros based sensor fusion flow is depicted fig 10 the filtered robot localization is used by global and local path planning in the same setup for both benchmarking and corrosion sweeping the developed robot offers manual and autonomous modes the manual mode is a default feature in which the robot receives commands from the rc controller consisting of a series of buttons and joysticks the rc receiver was connected to the main computer which receives the commands and decodes the commands passed to the ros layer the ros layer converts the commands into an appropriate ros navigation message in terms of command velocity the manual commands are mostly used during the initial setup and placing the robot precisely at the starting point on the vessel the manual commands are also used to break the robot operations if something goes wrong or the system got stuck in someplace once the initial setup was fine and the human operator thinks the robot can perform the autonomous operation he will switch on the autonomous button to activate the mode the controller is attached with a display that provides a graphical user interface wherein the operator can monitor the robot s process position and benchmarking outputs before the robot starts its autonomous process the system ensures that the robot placement is within the uwb network range the robot receives the location and generates its coverage path to execute the cleaning process the robot does the cleaning as a step process where it will first move for 150 mm towards its trajectory then stops and swing its arm to clean the surface and follows the same throughout the coverage process the total area that needs to be covered can be defined in the gui system by the operator the robot will generate its path with the specified boundary the same applies when the robot is performing the benchmarking process the functions such as hydro blasting and benchmarking and hydro re blasting the unclean areas can be switched manually through the gui the robot would send the acknowledged signal if it finished the defined task 5 3 execution complete coverage re blasting by hornbill the process of autonomous area coverage starts with the initial hydro blasting follows up by benchmarking with the construction of heatmap optimal cwpp generation and re blasting the workspace during initial hydro blasting the first step is to plan a global path from the current robot position since hydro blasting is considered as a full coverage process we used the conventional zigzag path planning technique the path planner expects the user s input parameters which specify the width and height of the workspace area to be cleaned the planner then draws the zigzag pattern and its topic is subscribed by the local planner which uses the robot kinematics model to generate the velocity commands that trigger the appropriate motor frequency to actuate the robot s motion fig 11 shows the flow of path generation and execution the coverage process was executed in steps whereas the robot will break at every 15 cm and wait until the arm completes one cycle one arc after the robot arm sweeps one round the pressure issued by the water jet will strip off the corroded areas on the ship hull metal surface in a circular shape the process will continue in a zigzag pattern until it achieves the coverage within the specified boundaries for re blasting the workspace after the proposed tsp reinforcement learning based optimization scheme derives the trajectory the re blasting mode is selected to clean the workspace by visiting all defined waypoints in particular a process called tsp translation initiates hornbil linear movement from the current waypoint to the goal waypoint the system will select the goal waypoint location w found from the cwpp algorithm the hornbill performs autonomous navigation by clearing the waypoints whereas the sensor inputs continuously localize its current position the robot s present location x w i y w i z w i at waypoint w i is compared with the target location to find the offset if the calculated offset is lower than the defined threshold the robot triggers the mode to clear the next target waypoint on the found trajectory autonomously then while clearing a pair of the waypoint the hornbill executes the hydro blasting process by switching compressor with the predefined pressure 6 experimental results and discussion 6 1 dataset preparation dataset is collected by deploying the robot to capture the corroded areas of real ship hull before and after blasting the expert knowledge labels the collected images there are 25000 images and divided into 80 percent for training and 20 percent for validating some of the collected images for good and bad levels of corroded surfaces are shown in fig 3 the workstation with intel core i7 9750h and gpu 1080 gtx is used to train the model designed in section 3 6 2 benchmarking and heatmap construction for water initial blasted surface we implement the proposed benchmarking and heatmap construction on the real ship hull testbed the blasting robot had blasted the ship hull with 2500 bar previously fig 12 describes the hornbill robot with the benchmarking module which moves in a zigzag path for running the benchmark operation after loading our trained dcnn model the robot classifies the input rgb images during the zigzag moving operation the benchmarking system can archive the realtime operation at 30fps the odometry data is derived by the uwb based sensors fusion system the robot length l r is decided as 0 785 m the algorithm then constructs the heatmap for all workspace sections by selecting an image frame at each 0 785 m the benchmarking heatmap for the robot operated area is obtained by constructing the probabilities output of each image frame from dcnn we test the above experiments with two different workspaces fig 13 represents the tested workspace heatmaps the grid based workspace has a cell size equal to the length of the robot l r the probability of each grid cell s surface corrosion level is derived from dcnn output and registered in the constructed heatmap the lower probability cells describe the cleaner areas figs 13a and b are the 6 6 heatmaps where some areas are left unclean and higher probability values due to the initial hydro blasting errors we experiment with larger cleaning workspace shown in figs 13d and e as 10 10 heatmaps where also uncleaned areas are left with higher probability values and our proposed dcnn model can classify and perform well in realtime fig 14 a d and 14g are the heatmaps of 10 10 workspaces with different corrosion levels ranging from light medium and severe each heatmap with their cell probabilities is shown in fig 14b e and 14h respectively we initially use 2500 bar to remove the tested corroded workspaces because of the nozzle size and distance to the plate however the cleaning efficiency is not uniform based on these observations we can see lower probability cells with very few higher corrosion cells in the output heatmap of light corrosion level workspace in contrast the severe corrosion level workspace generates smaller probability cells we observe a few miss classification while operating the system in realtime however the proposed classifier archives about 96 mean accuracy since our benchmarking algorithm relies on the robot s position the stability and reliability of sensor fusion for robot localization should be maintained during navigation to reduce the benchmarking heatmap construction errors the output heatmap can be used to ensure each initial blasted defined workspace quality meet the industrial standard before applying the new painting layer the rough ship hull surface can lead to degrading the quality of the maintenance work as a result of generating a heatmap for the initial blasting workspace selective spot blasting could be carried out for the areas that did not meet the standard in such cases the unclean area location from the heatmap would be useful in planning an optimal re blasting plan furthermore we can decide the amount of pressure required for the re blasting process by utilizing the representation of the blasting quality categories on the map for example a medium pressure value can be applied for the areas with the medium benchmarking category if the area category is terrible we can apply a higher level of pressure we select the probability of 0 8 for thresholding the cell to proceed to the next step of the trajectory planning of the re blasting process fig 13c and f are the thresholded heatmaps of the 6 6 and 10 10 medium corrosion level workspaces fig 14c f and 14i represent the thresholded heatmaps of the 10 10 light and severe corrosion level workspaces we can observe that the proposed autonomous system is feasible for conducting hydro blasting and benchmarking by changing to an adequate manipulator in realtime furthermore it is able to construct the benchmarking heatmaps for a previously blasted workspace 6 3 results and analysis of rl tsp training we present our training results for rl tsp in this section we use the tensorflow framework for all the software implementations all experiments run on computing nodes with the following specs intel core i7 9750h processor and 16 gb memory we have experimented with 1000 graphs of 20 50 and 100 3d waypoint instances of tsp we use mini batches of 256 sequences of length n 20 n 50 and n 100 the coefficient α 0 3 is selected based on the experimental trials we use adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with an initial learning rate of 1e 3 to minimize the cross entropy loss over each mini batch results are compared in terms of solution quality to google or tools a vehicle routing problem vrp solver that combines local search algorithms cheapest insertion and meta heuristics the heuristic of christofides christofides 1976 the well known lin kernighan heuristic lk h and concorde exact tsp solver which yields an optimal solution table 1 describes our training results compared to or tools local search and solvers that find the optimal solutions we can see that rl training significantly improves over or tools local search algorithms in some instances and is just a few percent worse than optimality at higher instances the results clearly show that our model is competitive with existing heuristics for the tsp both in terms of optimality and running time 6 4 rl cwpp for re blasting we also test the training results against our benchmark heatmap constructed from a real testbed site as a benchmarked workspace of 10 10 with medium corrosion level and 24 waypoints fig 15 shows the benchmarked workspace s output trajectories derived by different methods including spiral zigzag greedy search state of the art evolutionary based optimization methods ga vlašić et al 2019 and aco jia et al 2019 and the proposed method with rl training for experiments the corrosion removal by water blasting using a hydro compressor with the pressures ranging from 500 bar approximately 7250 psi to 2400 bar approximately 35 000 psi is conducted on a tested ship hull the robot performs re blasting by clearing all the 3d waypoints of each cwcp method stored in the database sequentially the control commands generated by the navigation system are sent to the motor drivers to issue appropriate velocities for the differential drive robot kinematics the robot localizes on the surface by the fusion of multiple sensors including industrial uwb systems wheel encoders and imu ensuring the hornbill understands the location in cases of hardware uncertainty circumstances and sensor noise the hornbill operates at a 24 v power system with the operating current sampled at 10 khz and the maximum speed of the motor sets at 80 rpm with a gear ratio of 100 the operator monitors the overall system by the gui installed on the workstation table 2 represents the energy water and travel time spent on all the tested methods by following the proposed algorithm s trajectory which archives the less cost value the energy spent will be smaller according to table 2 with the highest cost value the spiral consumes the highest energy follows by zigzag with a smaller number the best cwpp method concerning saving power consumption and time spent is rl it takes about 15 26 and 5 the energy water and time respectively less than the second best one is aco from the obtained results the proposed cwpp is the feasible method to archive the optimal autonomous ship hull blasting by the hornbill robot fig 16 shows the workspaces before and after the re blasting process by the proposed method with the 10 10 medium corrosion level workspace and including 24 waypoints after thresholding we could see that in the re blasted workspace the areas left uncleaned reduced significantly in comparison with the previously blasted workspace basing on the probabilities output of waypoints after benchmarking the workspace we apply a linear proportional rule to the required pressures generated by the water blasting plump with the pressure in the range of 1850 2450 pa the higher probability the higher the output pressure is set the numerical comparison for the amount of power and water spent between the blasting by a fixed value of pressure and a selective pressure scheme is provided in table 3 the amounts of power and water consumed by selective pressure schemes are reduced by about 5 percent and 16 percent respectively since the pressure outputs are changed smoothly during operation and not set the highest pressure all the operating time both the energy and water usage for selective blasting of the whole workspace are reduced considerably 7 conclusions the rl based optimal reinforcement learning based cwpp for the hornbill robot would be useful for ensuring the blasting quality as well as performing efficient selective re blasting before the new painting layers are applied the proposed autonomous corrosion cleaning system has been validated in both simulation and real environments the optimal cwpp objects function based on robot operation including the shortest travel distance the least moving in the upward direction to save water energy while ensuring visiting all predefined uncleaned waypoints is proposed the optimal path planning has been compared with conventional methods such as zigzag spiral and greedy search this is the initial attempt to deploy the autonomous system to clean the ship hull by water blasting at keppel shipyard in singapore hence the proposed system could enhance the standard of conventional hydro blasting work in the ship hull maintenance industry the proposed automated water blasting framework archives the complete cleaning of the ship hull with objectives of environment and human friendly in ship maintenance although the proposed system is validated on the real vessel surface in the shipyard up to now the platform can work on a relatively small workspace we are in the state of developing the platform to work autonomously in a complex environment with the cluster obstacle layouts once the next version platform complies with ship maintenance standards the optimal cwpp parameter setting will be identified to make the proposed robot operate long term autonomously the potential future researches could focus on the relation between robot kinematic design with the surface friction magnetic force distribution in function of tsp the involvement of friction to navigation strategies the reinforcement learning based heatmap generation in different light conditions

21195,routine cleaning of the corroded ship hulls in dry dock maintenance guarantees the smooth operation of the shipping industry deploying the autonomous system to remove the corrosion by water blasting is a feasible approach to ease the burden in manual operation and to reduce water time and energy consumption in this paper the water blasting framework is proposed for a novel robot platform named hornbill with the adhesion mechanism by permanent magnetic self localization by sensor fusion to navigate smoothly on a vertical surface hence we propose a complete waypoint path planning cwpp to re blast the self synthesizing deep convolutional neural network dcnn based corrosion heatmap by initial blasting the optimal cwpp problem including the shortest travel distance and shortest travel time to save water power while ensuring visiting all predefined waypoints by benchmarking output is modeled as the classic travel salesman problem tsp further the pareto optimal trajectory for given tsp has been driven by the reinforcement learning rl technique with a proposed reward function based on the robot s operation during blasting from the experimental results at the shipyard site the proposed rl based cwpp generates the pareto optimal trajectory that enables the water blasting robot to spend about 10 of energy and 9 of water less than the second best evolutionary based optimization method in various workspaces keywords ship maintenance industry corrosion cleaning benchmarking blasting quality reinforcement learning path planning 1 introduction the smoothness of ship hulls is degraded when operated due to the attachment of naval particles and surface corrosion swain and lund 2016 adland et al 2018 moreover the direct exposure of the hull s metal layer leads to the wearing and tearing of the paint layer thereby a ship hull needs to be regularly repainted after 4 5 years of utilization to ensure sustainability gong et al 2019 garbatov et al 2018 corrosion level needs to be routinely evaluated to decide the safety condition of ships dong and frangopol 2015 parween et al 2020 the existing paint and possible rust layers should be appropriately removed before repainting hydro blasting is usually conducted on ship hulls for this purpose adland et al 2018 high pressurized water is jetted onto ship hulls with the aid of heavy machines that were operated by human workers the efficiency cost and safety are the major concerns of the conventional approaches for ship hull blasting which require an extensive human workforce as a result of these concerns robotic researchers attention has drifted toward the development of robotics solutions for facilitating autonomous hydro blasting of ship hulls robotics solutions for automatic inspection and maintenance have proven their versatility in various industries such as building maintenance le et al 2019b 2020a 2018b road maintenance le et al 2019a yi et al 2020 and path tracking shi et al 2020 and service robot yin et al 2020 le et al 2020b similarly many robotic solutions have been proposed for automating the inspection and maintenance work undertaken in dry dock the ship maintenance industry has been benefited from the utilization of many robotic tools attached to ground based structures such as cranes zheng et al 2016 aijazi et al 2016 navarro et al 2013 hachicha et al 2018 however these ground based robotic solutions have low performance when accessing a whole ship hull hence robotic solutions based on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have also been proposed to improve the accessibility to a ship hull kim and chun 2017 bonnin pascual and ortiz 2019 however the existing solutions based on uavs are limited to inspection and they are not strong enough for handling tools such as blasting guns required for maintenance work climbing robot mechanisms are widely utilized in the maintenance and inspection of vertical structures due to their intrinsic accessing ability nansai and mohan 2016 muthugala et al 2019 similarly many climbing robots have been developed targeting the ship maintenance industry huang et al 2017 stepson et al 2017 the majority of these robots are wheeled robots with magnetic adhesion since ship hulls are made of ferromagnetic materials however the scope of the work cited above is limited to the development of hardware design for climbing which targets ship maintenance some of the commercial products have been deployed in the industry practices for ship hull cleaning the vertidrive m3 vertidrivee 2020 robots are designed to effectively remove dirt paint and coatings on various steel surfaces like storage tanks ship hulls and other large steel structures the robot operated only with the manual mode with no sensor integration for simultaneous localization and mapping slam or cleaning benchmarking hullskater 2020 has been designed to be carried with the vessel and can be regularly deployed to remove early stage fouling the hullskater removes bacteria and biofilm from the hull before the macro fouling namely weeds and barnacles can take hold the robot is not autonomous but is remotely piloted in realtime by the staff in a 24 h operations center they are guided by outputs from the hullskaters four spotlight assisted cameras three on the front one on the rear the data has been carried by the robot to a 4g transceiver on the ship via an umbilical cable one complete cleaning should take two to 8 h depending on the vessel so far in the field of ship hull cleaning numerous robotic technologies have been implemented also most of these robotic platforms are available in the commercial marketplace however none of the existing robotics technology addresses the problem of cleaning efficiency that how much percentage of cleanliness has been yielded by the robot according to iso 8501 1 to indicate the hull cleanliness a blasted surface is categorized to a class among class sa 2 5 very good free from visible oil grease and dirt and mill scale rust paint coatings and foreign matters class sa 2 acceptable slight traces of contamination in the form of spots or stripes and class sa 1 not acceptable surface have nonuniform metallic color the ship hull must be maintained to ensure the quality before they start to paint the hull such a cleanliness class was challenging to maintain with a robotic platform due to the ship hull s nonlinear metal surface in our proposed work for the first time we are mapping the cleanliness of the ship hull concerning the defined classes as a benchmarking result we generate an efficient path trajectory leveraging the rl framework to re clean the identified class sa 1 regions ship hull maintenance robots should be equipped with mechanisms for inspecting the surface for decision making majority of these inspection mechanisms utilize computer vision to detect corroded areas of hulls ahuja and shukla 2017 apart from vision systems the utilization of laser based measuring systems for detecting defects could also be observed zhang et al 2018 for example the work jalalian et al 2018 proposed background subtraction techniques based on histogram analysis feedforward neural networks and deep convolutional neural network dcnn have been proposed for detecting corrosion in ortiz et al 2016 and kumar et al 2019 respectively even though many techniques have been proposed for detecting corrosion in ship inspections the scope of systems is not up to the development of a fully integrated solution for ship hull inspection and blasting furthermore the utilization of the methods mentioned above to evaluate blasting quality is doubtful since the surface appearance will be changing from the natural corrosion build ups when the blasting has been applied fernández isla et al fernández isla et al 2013 proposed an integrated solution that can detect corroded areas in a ship hull and subsequently perform spot the blasting on identified corroded areas in this system the blasting is carried out by a blasting manipulator attached to a crane however the system s usability for evaluating the smooth quality of an already blasted surface has not been discussed within the scope in addition path planning for energy efficient coverage of blasting waypoints has not been considered in the work a method for evaluating the quality of the blasting cycle and synthesizing a benchmarking map that could be utilized for spot re blasting has been proposed in muthugala et al 2020 the method uses a self organizing fuzzy logic classifier for categorizing the blasting quality however the work is merely limited to the development of a blasting benchmarking system the path planning and blasting parameter setting for re blasting cycles have not been discussed in the cited work the work li et al 2018 proposed an efficient path planning method for a spot blasting system the proposed method maps the spot blasting process to a travel salesman problem tsp and uses the genetic algorithm ga cheng et al 2020 and reinforcement learning le et al 2020c and motion planning veerajagadheswar et al 2020 to find the optimum path the optimizing criterion is designed to find the shortest path on site experiments with a robotic hardware system have not been conducted and validation has been performed through a highly constrained simulation the main limitation of the work is the assumption of traveling distance as the sole criterion for energy efficiency since the energy usage of a blasting robot operated on a ship hull depends on other aspects such as movement direction horizontal or vertical rotation and water usage in addition time consumption is an essential factor in the industrial process which has not been a concern in this work in the shipyard s extremer hazardous outdoor conditions the autonomous systems such as cleaning robots must be made of durable material and designed with a robust mechanism to operate smoothly on a ship hull surface the advanced perception by sensors and navigation algorithms such as the complete area coverage planning cacp strategy plays an essential role in archiving autonomous and effective operation especially with the optimal global planner to ensure complete coverage a robot can save a tremendous amount of energy and resources such as water in water blasting complete coverage by generating optimal trajectory with obstacle avoidance and safe journey cheng et al 2019 le et al 2018a manimuthu et al 2019 lakshmanan et al 2020 are the key objectives that need to be fulfilled by cacp to overcome the limitations of earlier works the robot assisted autonomy framework for ship hull hydro blasting has been designed and implemented in a real shipyard environment we propose a method of assessing the level of corroded areas on the ship hull surface after blasting with deep convolutional neural network dcnn learning to ease the autonomous operations then heatmap for the whole workspace is composed specifically the heatmap with probabilities is plotted from the benchmarking results from the visualization aspect of each corroded area equal to the size of the hydro blasting nozzles mounted on a proposed robot the rl approach for tsp is used to solve the optimization of finding the best navigation trajectory with minimal distance travel to save energy water and time during the water blasting rl s reward function is the 3d distance between defined waypoints that are resulted by thresholding the benchmarked heatmap a trained recurrent neural network with optimal parameters predicts a distribution over different waypoint permutations to derive the shortest costweight route finally the proposed hornbill robot with reconfigurable arms such as perception module and blasting module with the final objective of smooth navigation to perform water blasting on the corroded ship surface is used to verify the proposed autonomous framework an overview of the proposed automated water blasting for corrosion cleaning framework is presented in section 2 section 3 describes corrosion classifier and heatmap generation the reinforcement learning based waypoint path planning is presented in section 4 the novel climbing robot integrated with the proposed autonomous framework is described in detail in section 5 particulars of experimental validation are given in section 6 conclusion with future works are given in section 7 2 proposed methodology the automation system with the reconfigurable manipulator designed to clean and to self evaluate the ship hull surface during the dry dock maintenance is shown in fig 1 the complete processes of the proposed system are depicted as a block diagram in fig 2 usually the ship hull maintenance was carried out through a series of processes we developed the autonomous framework to have a similar process to complete the hydro blasting the proposed robot first starts its autonomous zigzag motion to conduct the initial removing process of painted and corroded layers on the surface the typical outcome of a ship surface after blasting is exampled as the images in fig 3 c the robot would travel on an uneven surface during the process which creates some more gap than the recommended between the nozzle of the blasting module and the surface this causes a pressure loss in the blasting which lead to uncleaned surfaces the examples of badly cleaned surfaces and partially cleaned surfaces and are shown in fig 3a and b respectively such incomplete cleaned surfaces cause issues while repainting the ship hull which will affect its performance during the sailing by forming a more corroded area over time so it is critical to maintain a consistent level of surface cleanliness along with the process of hydro blasting to accomplish the uniformity of the ship hull surface s cleanliness we utilized the benchmarking scheme to change the arm s end effector with a camera the robot performs cleanliness classification based on dcnn from the captured images during the zigzag motion once the coverage is completed a benchmarking map was generated which depicts the surface cleanliness the generated map looks like a heat map wherein the higher the heat intensity of the red color exhibits the lower cleanliness using the generated heat map the robot will create an optimal path to perform re blasting on the uncleaned area with objectives such as shortest navigation distance smallest moving upward and least energies and water consumption while performing the re blasting process the robot will regulate the water pressure selective pressure p a by considering the intensity of surface cleanliness in that particular area these processes improve the efficiency of the automated ship hull blasting and inspection work 3 corroded areas benchmark we propose the benchmarking algorithm to evaluate the severity of the corrosion region the size of the hydro blasting nozzles section across the robot s operating area after finishing the initial zigzag water hydro blasting by hornbill we utilize a googlenet inception v3 cnn architecture szegedy et al 2016 that was pre trained on approximately 1 28 million images 1000 object categories from the 2014 imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge russakovsky et al 2015 and train it on our dataset using transfer learning pan and yang 2009 we collect the dataset from major ship cleaning and maintenance service companies and manually label it to benchmarking categories with expert knowledge the model output will be the probability of surface corrosion level for the input color image obtained from the hornbill s onboard camera after finishing the zigzag water hydro blasting we construct the confusion matrix heatmap of the whole cleaned area by the robot using the output probabilities of the surface corrosion level from dcnn 3 1 deep convolution neural network convolution neural networks are recently used in image classification due to their high accuracy their structure is the basis for many object detection and image classification networks including googlenet inception v3 which we use in our approach cnns consist of four types of layers convolution layer pooling layer relu layer and fully connected layer the combination of convolution layer s and pooling layer s extracts the features from the image this is fed to the fully connected layer s which classifies the image fig 4 shows the structure of a simple cnn the four layers of cnn have been discussed elaborately in the subsequent sections 3 1 1 convolution layer this layer involves applying a filter over the input layer typically multiple filters are applied to the input layer filters are applied using a sliding window which slides over the image and applies the filter to the region covered by the window the input layer is zero padded so that the window can cover the entire input the filter used is called weight function equation 1 is used to compute the activation function f x 1 f x w x b where w represents the filter weights b represents the bias and x represents the input 3 1 2 relu layer this layer applies a relu function to the input layer it is typically used after the convolution layer it is used to remove the negative values which have been formed from the filter equation 2 computes the relu activation function f x 2 f x m a x 0 x where x represents the input layer 3 1 3 pooling layer this layer partitions the input layer into non overlapping regions on which a pooling function is applied each region outputs a single value this reduces the dimension of the input while retaining the essential features 3 1 4 fully connected layer this layer is a typical artificial neural network ann layer it is fully connected to the input layer multiple fully connected layers are used together to classify the image these are used with the final pooling layer as input the final pooling layer represents the extracted features 3 2 transfer learning using inception v3 we use google s inception v3 cnn architecture pre trained to 93 33 top five accuracy on the 1000 object classes 1 28 million images of the 2014 imagenet challenge using the optimal transfer learning technique for the amount of available data we remove the final classification layer and then retrain the original network using our prepared dataset to fine tune the parameters across all the layers during the training process we resize each image to 299 299 pixels to make it compatible with the original dimensions of the network architecture and leverage the default image features learned by the imagenet pre trained network 3 3 benchmarking heatmap generation the benchmarking as a heatmap of the initial blasting area is constructed from the corrosion level probabilities of dcnn our proposed benchmarking algorithm is described in algorithm 1 since we know the robot s length and odometry through localization modules the algorithm runs in realtime while the zigzag movement of the robot to find the heat level of each cell c k number k of the defined grid based workspace as shown in fig 5 b the mean value of surface corrosion probabilities p c resulted from trained dcnn model for camera captured images within this cell is calculated note that the each cell as a range from p x to p x is equal to length of the robot l r as depicted in fig 5a 4 reinforcement learning based hydro blasting by hornbill 4 1 optimal planning for hydro blasting the corresponding 3d location of uncleaned areas after initial blasting provided by the uwb system is defined as waypoints and located at the bottom left corner of each thresholded and classified corroded area generated by the benchmarking algorithm the algorithm depends on these points location to yield an optimal navigation trajectory for robots to re clean the workspace since the objective of minimizing the tour length is the np hard problem of the classic tsp optimization the brute force search for the optimal solution with a large number of points is impractical some practical approaches such as evolutionary based optimizations leveraged by probability techniques are proposed to estimate pareto optimal solutions in this work we applied the reinforcement learning based tsp to address sequencing an optimal trajectory algorithm 1 benchmarking heatmap reconstruction pseudocode we train a recurrent neural network to predict a distribution over different waypoint permutations given a set of waypoints using negative tour length between each waypoint as the reward signal we optimize the recurrent neural network parameters using reinforcement learning with a little engineering and no labels neural networks trained with reinforcement learning can learn intelligent heuristics or distribution over waypoint permutations for the tsp the rl network following the actor critic architecture is shown in fig 6 4 2 neural network architecture for tsp in this work we formalize the problem of complete waypoint path planning as the 3d euclidean tsp given an input state graph represented as a sequence of n locations of waypoint in a three dimensional space s w i i 1 n where each w i x i y i z i r 3 we are concerned on finding the permutation of the nodes i e a tour π that visits each node once except the starting node and has the minimum total length we propose the cost of a tour noted by a permutation π as 3 l π s d π n 1 i 1 n 1 d π i i 1 where d i i 1 α 2 x i x i 1 α 2 y i y i 1 1 α z i z i 1 2 and 2 denotes the l 2 norm and the coefficient α controls the weight of each coordinate component the system will assign the small weight to z coordinate to limit the moving upward in derived trajectory following bello et al 2016 factorizing the probability of a route by the chain rule is used in our neural network architecture as shown in equation 4 4 p π s i 1 n p π i π i s furthermore each component on the right side of equation 4 is processed consecutively by the softmax module similar to bello et al 2016 we use a method called pointer network vinyals et al 2015 consisting of two repeating nervous systems rnn modules encoders and decoders two of which include temporary memory lstm cells hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the organization encoder organizes information s city by street and changes it into an inactive memory group e n c i i 1 n where e n c i r d the contribution to the encoder organization at time step i is a one way insertion of 2d points x i obtained by direct changes of x i shared on complete input advances additional organizational decoder keeps up with its inert memory states d e c i i 1 n where d e c i r d is also kept up by the decoder and at each i progress use a steering system geared towards being popular throughout the upcoming city to visit during the visit when the following city is selected it is passed as a contribution to the following decoding step the contribution of the main decoding step denoted by z in fig 7 is a d dimensional vector that is rewarded as a trained boundary of the nervous system 4 3 optimization with reinforcement learning supervised and oriented learning for np s is difficult problems for example tsp and its variations are undesirable since the model s performance depends on the quality of the supervised labels and it is also expensive on the contrary rl investigates various visits and derives their related rewards offers simplicity and feasibility for training a neural network for the tsp the trajectory length specifying as reward r π s l π s is minimized during the iterations using the costweight as equation 3 our training objective as shown in equation 5 produces the expected reward for the given input graph s 5 j θ s e π p θ s r π s the results of training as output graphs are found from a distribution s and the total training objective as equation 6 6 j θ e s s j θ s the well known reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by williams 1992 is modified to derive an unbiased gradient of 5 with the parameters model θ 7 θ j θ s e π p θ s r π s b φ s θ log p θ π s with b φ s being the baseline a good baseline that estimates the costs of repairing a solution j θ s can stabilize the training process similar to bello et al 2016 we use a second model called critic to decrease the gradients of variances while maintaining them unbiased the critic is trained by the policy model to minimize the mean square error between its rewards and predictions 5 reconfigurable task based hornbill platform the automated hydro blasting framework is implemented and verified in the proposed robot named hornbill 2 0 the upgraded version with the reconfigurable ability of manipulators modularity is the critical feature that we required from the robot to achieve the proposed scheme this means the robot must have an exchangeable payload capability to change between the cleaning and inspection modes in addition it is not straightforward to use inspection cleaning robots available in different industry sectors to move autonomously on the vertical surface such capability was rarely found in the existing platforms which led us to design and develop a new robotic platform in the developed platform it is easier to swap between payloads with weight up to 20 kg such flexibility allows us to achieve our proposed system significantly in the current robot design we focus on the complete autonomy framework to optimize the corrosion cleaning process including initial blasting dcnn based benchmarking and rl cwpp based re blasting tasks together with mechanical design the sensor system for autonomous navigation on the ship hull surface has been added to the current work we integrated the sensors and autonomous algorithm in the same robot hardware design as previous work and validated on a real testbed site moreover in the current design we slightly modified the locomotion system such as wheels and magnetic holders to improve locomotion stability in the previous platform we endured slippages during the locomotion which leads us to incorrect cleanliness prediction and generation of the heatmap such a drawback was reduced with the new design and we could witness the effectiveness with the help of localization the robot mechanical and autonomy architectures are detailed as follows 5 1 mechanical design the proposed hornbill robot was developed under the principle of magnetic adhesion and differential drive locomotion the robot could perform various ship hulls maintenance tasks such as hydro blasting painting and surface benchmarking by replacing the appropriate end effector the robot uses its arm mechanism to perform such maintenance tasks which was designed in such a way so that the effectors can be exchanged with ease fig 8 a represent the outside look of the hornbill the robot s mechanical design is depicted as in fig 8b the hornbill platform was developed with a 535 785 480 mm dimension and a 500 mm length replaceable arm for locomotion we used 2 bldc motors that provide a torque of 55 nm each motor is fixed with a 200 mm diameter rubber wheel which creates higher friction to avoid slippage to reduce the robot s overall weight we constructed the robot with aluminum 6061 alloy material which also protects the electronic components from a high magnetic force the electronics peripherals are well sealed with a waterproof container to insulate the blasting water regarding the magnetic adhesion we used eight pieces of n50 neodymium square magnets with an aspect of 200 20 20 mm each magnet provides a pulling force of 100 kg which means the robot has an overall adhesion force of 800 kg we place four magnets at the center of the front axis two magnets each near the wheels and two half magnets at the caster wheel we maintained an air gap of 5 mm from the magnets to the metal surface with such a pulling force the robot can achieve locomotion with a payload capacity of 300 kg the robot was constructed with a manual reconfigurable arm wherein the main end effector is fixed the arm was designed with a provision to change the end effectors that can perform water blasting painting and benchmarking tasks the arm is constructed with the same aluminum material in order to reduce the weight the robot arm attached with another 25 nm torque 24 v bldc motor enables the robot to carry the load while swinging this arm with the specific end effector since this paper focuses on the water blasting system the arm was connected with a water blasting nozzle also the arm is connected with a water hose that comes from the hydro blasting machine the end effector attached to the robot was a rotating bar which has four nozzles with a size of 0 30 mm diameter the bar will rotate concerning the force that was applied to it since the blasting pressure that we used was 2500 bar it was enough to rotate the bar the bar s length was 150 mm so it creates a circle with the same diameter when the bar rotates so when we start the cleaning process it can clean the surface in a circular shape the whole arm was adequately sealed as shown in fig 1c which restricts the water leakage the same arm was used for the benchmarking purpose where we change the end effector to camera logitech c922 pro color as shown in fig 1d fig 9 shows the communication of hardware components that support autonomous navigation the system includes the base station acted as the main processing unit and robot with built in sensors and actuators the base station and robot communicate through the cable lan network 5 2 sensor system for autonomy navigation on the ship hull surface as mentioned in the previous section we attached a camera on the arm in order to perform the hull surface cleanliness benchmarking task the hornbill robot with water blasting payload and inspection payload is shown in fig 1 the control signals for the sensors and actuators are constructed in the robot operating system ros quigley et al 2009 ros nodes act as a primary communication layer that interacts between the sensor controllers and actuators through lan networks we used jetson xavier as our central processing unit wherein the realtime deep learning classification and rl frameworks are implemented the whole robot was powered through a tethered connection with two separate power supplies of 48 v and 24 v dc for locomotion motor and arm motor respectively accuracy of the robot s current position is critical for autonomous robots to achieve foul free autonomous navigation traditional approaches to get the precise absolute mobile robot position are lidar based slam hess et al 2016 and visual based slam kerl et al 2013 which use features around in its environment to achieve the coordinates there are few drawbacks in traditional slam techniques while we implement it on the hornbill robot due to its open water blasting approach and lack of features on the homogeneous surface which affects sensor operation performances to address that issue we used the precise 3d position industrial grade ultra wideband uwb beacon system the system guarantees position accuracy to 2 cm within a defined workspace up to 30 30 square meters the system consists of a set of stationary beacons and the mobile beacon which can sense each other s position using ultrasonic frequency and pass its global positional value to the receiver end through radiofrequency the beacon system can achieve a position accuracy level of 2 cm when the stationary beacons network was placed with a circular diameter of 30 m the stationary beacon was fixed on top of the robot where it can have a line of sight with other stationary beacons in order to acquire a precise location these positional values are converted into ros based odometry sensor messages and published through the odom beacon topic however the positional values are not always stable and will be affected due to an environmental disturbance lack of line of sight in some places and noise it is also critical to get a proper orientation of the robot while navigating which was not provided by the uwb system to reduce the noise and acquire all the necessary sensory information for autonomous navigation we used the sensor fusion technique d alfonso et al 2015 wherein we fused other positional sensors such as wheel encoders imu inertial sensor the fused information s output provides an accurate 3d position of the robotic system and its orientation values this message was then converted into a ros message to communicate with other ros nodes and layers the ros based sensor fusion flow is depicted fig 10 the filtered robot localization is used by global and local path planning in the same setup for both benchmarking and corrosion sweeping the developed robot offers manual and autonomous modes the manual mode is a default feature in which the robot receives commands from the rc controller consisting of a series of buttons and joysticks the rc receiver was connected to the main computer which receives the commands and decodes the commands passed to the ros layer the ros layer converts the commands into an appropriate ros navigation message in terms of command velocity the manual commands are mostly used during the initial setup and placing the robot precisely at the starting point on the vessel the manual commands are also used to break the robot operations if something goes wrong or the system got stuck in someplace once the initial setup was fine and the human operator thinks the robot can perform the autonomous operation he will switch on the autonomous button to activate the mode the controller is attached with a display that provides a graphical user interface wherein the operator can monitor the robot s process position and benchmarking outputs before the robot starts its autonomous process the system ensures that the robot placement is within the uwb network range the robot receives the location and generates its coverage path to execute the cleaning process the robot does the cleaning as a step process where it will first move for 150 mm towards its trajectory then stops and swing its arm to clean the surface and follows the same throughout the coverage process the total area that needs to be covered can be defined in the gui system by the operator the robot will generate its path with the specified boundary the same applies when the robot is performing the benchmarking process the functions such as hydro blasting and benchmarking and hydro re blasting the unclean areas can be switched manually through the gui the robot would send the acknowledged signal if it finished the defined task 5 3 execution complete coverage re blasting by hornbill the process of autonomous area coverage starts with the initial hydro blasting follows up by benchmarking with the construction of heatmap optimal cwpp generation and re blasting the workspace during initial hydro blasting the first step is to plan a global path from the current robot position since hydro blasting is considered as a full coverage process we used the conventional zigzag path planning technique the path planner expects the user s input parameters which specify the width and height of the workspace area to be cleaned the planner then draws the zigzag pattern and its topic is subscribed by the local planner which uses the robot kinematics model to generate the velocity commands that trigger the appropriate motor frequency to actuate the robot s motion fig 11 shows the flow of path generation and execution the coverage process was executed in steps whereas the robot will break at every 15 cm and wait until the arm completes one cycle one arc after the robot arm sweeps one round the pressure issued by the water jet will strip off the corroded areas on the ship hull metal surface in a circular shape the process will continue in a zigzag pattern until it achieves the coverage within the specified boundaries for re blasting the workspace after the proposed tsp reinforcement learning based optimization scheme derives the trajectory the re blasting mode is selected to clean the workspace by visiting all defined waypoints in particular a process called tsp translation initiates hornbil linear movement from the current waypoint to the goal waypoint the system will select the goal waypoint location w found from the cwpp algorithm the hornbill performs autonomous navigation by clearing the waypoints whereas the sensor inputs continuously localize its current position the robot s present location x w i y w i z w i at waypoint w i is compared with the target location to find the offset if the calculated offset is lower than the defined threshold the robot triggers the mode to clear the next target waypoint on the found trajectory autonomously then while clearing a pair of the waypoint the hornbill executes the hydro blasting process by switching compressor with the predefined pressure 6 experimental results and discussion 6 1 dataset preparation dataset is collected by deploying the robot to capture the corroded areas of real ship hull before and after blasting the expert knowledge labels the collected images there are 25000 images and divided into 80 percent for training and 20 percent for validating some of the collected images for good and bad levels of corroded surfaces are shown in fig 3 the workstation with intel core i7 9750h and gpu 1080 gtx is used to train the model designed in section 3 6 2 benchmarking and heatmap construction for water initial blasted surface we implement the proposed benchmarking and heatmap construction on the real ship hull testbed the blasting robot had blasted the ship hull with 2500 bar previously fig 12 describes the hornbill robot with the benchmarking module which moves in a zigzag path for running the benchmark operation after loading our trained dcnn model the robot classifies the input rgb images during the zigzag moving operation the benchmarking system can archive the realtime operation at 30fps the odometry data is derived by the uwb based sensors fusion system the robot length l r is decided as 0 785 m the algorithm then constructs the heatmap for all workspace sections by selecting an image frame at each 0 785 m the benchmarking heatmap for the robot operated area is obtained by constructing the probabilities output of each image frame from dcnn we test the above experiments with two different workspaces fig 13 represents the tested workspace heatmaps the grid based workspace has a cell size equal to the length of the robot l r the probability of each grid cell s surface corrosion level is derived from dcnn output and registered in the constructed heatmap the lower probability cells describe the cleaner areas figs 13a and b are the 6 6 heatmaps where some areas are left unclean and higher probability values due to the initial hydro blasting errors we experiment with larger cleaning workspace shown in figs 13d and e as 10 10 heatmaps where also uncleaned areas are left with higher probability values and our proposed dcnn model can classify and perform well in realtime fig 14 a d and 14g are the heatmaps of 10 10 workspaces with different corrosion levels ranging from light medium and severe each heatmap with their cell probabilities is shown in fig 14b e and 14h respectively we initially use 2500 bar to remove the tested corroded workspaces because of the nozzle size and distance to the plate however the cleaning efficiency is not uniform based on these observations we can see lower probability cells with very few higher corrosion cells in the output heatmap of light corrosion level workspace in contrast the severe corrosion level workspace generates smaller probability cells we observe a few miss classification while operating the system in realtime however the proposed classifier archives about 96 mean accuracy since our benchmarking algorithm relies on the robot s position the stability and reliability of sensor fusion for robot localization should be maintained during navigation to reduce the benchmarking heatmap construction errors the output heatmap can be used to ensure each initial blasted defined workspace quality meet the industrial standard before applying the new painting layer the rough ship hull surface can lead to degrading the quality of the maintenance work as a result of generating a heatmap for the initial blasting workspace selective spot blasting could be carried out for the areas that did not meet the standard in such cases the unclean area location from the heatmap would be useful in planning an optimal re blasting plan furthermore we can decide the amount of pressure required for the re blasting process by utilizing the representation of the blasting quality categories on the map for example a medium pressure value can be applied for the areas with the medium benchmarking category if the area category is terrible we can apply a higher level of pressure we select the probability of 0 8 for thresholding the cell to proceed to the next step of the trajectory planning of the re blasting process fig 13c and f are the thresholded heatmaps of the 6 6 and 10 10 medium corrosion level workspaces fig 14c f and 14i represent the thresholded heatmaps of the 10 10 light and severe corrosion level workspaces we can observe that the proposed autonomous system is feasible for conducting hydro blasting and benchmarking by changing to an adequate manipulator in realtime furthermore it is able to construct the benchmarking heatmaps for a previously blasted workspace 6 3 results and analysis of rl tsp training we present our training results for rl tsp in this section we use the tensorflow framework for all the software implementations all experiments run on computing nodes with the following specs intel core i7 9750h processor and 16 gb memory we have experimented with 1000 graphs of 20 50 and 100 3d waypoint instances of tsp we use mini batches of 256 sequences of length n 20 n 50 and n 100 the coefficient α 0 3 is selected based on the experimental trials we use adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with an initial learning rate of 1e 3 to minimize the cross entropy loss over each mini batch results are compared in terms of solution quality to google or tools a vehicle routing problem vrp solver that combines local search algorithms cheapest insertion and meta heuristics the heuristic of christofides christofides 1976 the well known lin kernighan heuristic lk h and concorde exact tsp solver which yields an optimal solution table 1 describes our training results compared to or tools local search and solvers that find the optimal solutions we can see that rl training significantly improves over or tools local search algorithms in some instances and is just a few percent worse than optimality at higher instances the results clearly show that our model is competitive with existing heuristics for the tsp both in terms of optimality and running time 6 4 rl cwpp for re blasting we also test the training results against our benchmark heatmap constructed from a real testbed site as a benchmarked workspace of 10 10 with medium corrosion level and 24 waypoints fig 15 shows the benchmarked workspace s output trajectories derived by different methods including spiral zigzag greedy search state of the art evolutionary based optimization methods ga vlašić et al 2019 and aco jia et al 2019 and the proposed method with rl training for experiments the corrosion removal by water blasting using a hydro compressor with the pressures ranging from 500 bar approximately 7250 psi to 2400 bar approximately 35 000 psi is conducted on a tested ship hull the robot performs re blasting by clearing all the 3d waypoints of each cwcp method stored in the database sequentially the control commands generated by the navigation system are sent to the motor drivers to issue appropriate velocities for the differential drive robot kinematics the robot localizes on the surface by the fusion of multiple sensors including industrial uwb systems wheel encoders and imu ensuring the hornbill understands the location in cases of hardware uncertainty circumstances and sensor noise the hornbill operates at a 24 v power system with the operating current sampled at 10 khz and the maximum speed of the motor sets at 80 rpm with a gear ratio of 100 the operator monitors the overall system by the gui installed on the workstation table 2 represents the energy water and travel time spent on all the tested methods by following the proposed algorithm s trajectory which archives the less cost value the energy spent will be smaller according to table 2 with the highest cost value the spiral consumes the highest energy follows by zigzag with a smaller number the best cwpp method concerning saving power consumption and time spent is rl it takes about 15 26 and 5 the energy water and time respectively less than the second best one is aco from the obtained results the proposed cwpp is the feasible method to archive the optimal autonomous ship hull blasting by the hornbill robot fig 16 shows the workspaces before and after the re blasting process by the proposed method with the 10 10 medium corrosion level workspace and including 24 waypoints after thresholding we could see that in the re blasted workspace the areas left uncleaned reduced significantly in comparison with the previously blasted workspace basing on the probabilities output of waypoints after benchmarking the workspace we apply a linear proportional rule to the required pressures generated by the water blasting plump with the pressure in the range of 1850 2450 pa the higher probability the higher the output pressure is set the numerical comparison for the amount of power and water spent between the blasting by a fixed value of pressure and a selective pressure scheme is provided in table 3 the amounts of power and water consumed by selective pressure schemes are reduced by about 5 percent and 16 percent respectively since the pressure outputs are changed smoothly during operation and not set the highest pressure all the operating time both the energy and water usage for selective blasting of the whole workspace are reduced considerably 7 conclusions the rl based optimal reinforcement learning based cwpp for the hornbill robot would be useful for ensuring the blasting quality as well as performing efficient selective re blasting before the new painting layers are applied the proposed autonomous corrosion cleaning system has been validated in both simulation and real environments the optimal cwpp objects function based on robot operation including the shortest travel distance the least moving in the upward direction to save water energy while ensuring visiting all predefined uncleaned waypoints is proposed the optimal path planning has been compared with conventional methods such as zigzag spiral and greedy search this is the initial attempt to deploy the autonomous system to clean the ship hull by water blasting at keppel shipyard in singapore hence the proposed system could enhance the standard of conventional hydro blasting work in the ship hull maintenance industry the proposed automated water blasting framework archives the complete cleaning of the ship hull with objectives of environment and human friendly in ship maintenance although the proposed system is validated on the real vessel surface in the shipyard up to now the platform can work on a relatively small workspace we are in the state of developing the platform to work autonomously in a complex environment with the cluster obstacle layouts once the next version platform complies with ship maintenance standards the optimal cwpp parameter setting will be identified to make the proposed robot operate long term autonomously the potential future researches could focus on the relation between robot kinematic design with the surface friction magnetic force distribution in function of tsp the involvement of friction to navigation strategies the reinforcement learning based heatmap generation in different light conditions

21196,large eddy simulation les technique is adopted to analyze the subcritical flow around the cruciform cylinders and then the influence of the reynolds number and the blockage ratio on the flow pattern and the hydrodynamic force is numerically investigated in details a recirculation flow is observed at the rear of the intersection center and an up flow is induced along the spanwise direction under the action of the up flow the vortex formation region of the spanwise cylinder is stretched and the vortex induced vibration viv caused by the kármán vortex shedding is suppressed in addition the wake region of the cruciform cylinders can be divided into three regions the recirculation region the transition region and the kármán vortex region three types of flow pattern of the cruciform cylinders which are the cylinder dominated pattern the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern can be identified for different blockage ratios furthermore the drag coefficient the root mean square r m s of the lift fluctuation and the strouhal number of the cruciform cylinders are calculated and compared with that of the isolated cylinder keywords cruciform cylinders vortex flow drag coefficient large eddy simulation 1 introduction the cruciform circular cylinder which is composed of two circular cylinders with same length and diameter is commonly used in various engineering applications it is generally considered as a basic element of the net structure see fig 1 such as the fish cage the heat exchanger the damping screen and the truss structures etc therefore the study on the flow past the cruciform cylinders is useful to understand the basic three dimensional flow pattern around the net structure and to develop a general prediction tool of the force on the net structure which is of interest over a wide range of engineering applications in the past decades some experimental studies on the flow past the cruciform circular cylinder were reported in several of researches osaka et al 1983 a b was earliest to experimentally investigate the turbulent wake behind two cruciform cylinders in unsteady flow re 8000 it was found that the intersection of cylinders induced a secondary flow which was recirculated towards the wake center and outwards along the spanwise cylinder axis and this secondary flow caused the back pressure on the cylinder surface around the intersection center became high zdravkovich 1983 and 1985 found that the secondary flow originated from the intersection was characterized by four pairs of symmetrically trailing vortices on the cylinder surface and it caused an increase in the local drag coefficient then fox 1991 and shirakashi et al 1994 carried out experiments to investigate the vortex shedding from two cylinders in the cruciform arrangement with a small gap it was found that the flow pattern in the near wake of the cruciform cylinders was dominated by one of two types of three dimensional vortices the trailing vortex tv and the necklace vortex nv bae et al 2001 measured the kármán vortex induced vibration kviv of the cruciform cylinders with a gap and found kviv was effectively suppressed when the gap between the cylinders was less than half of the cylinder diameter lader et al 2014 designed a specially made cruciform model consisting of the intersecting cylinder and the central sphere to investigate the effect of the intersection in uniform flow it was found that the drag coefficient of the central sphere was much higher than that of the single sphere without the cruciform configuration and the increase of drag coefficient was depended on the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the sphere diameter recently we used the cruciform cylinder element to experimentally analyze the hydrodynamic coefficient of net panels with different net solidities net materials and knot patterns for the reynolds number in the range of 102 25 re 103 87 tang et al 2018 in which the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficient of net structure and the reynolds number and the net solidity blockage ratio was obtained through fitting the experimental data however due to the limitation of measuring techniques in the laboratory experiments the details for the interaction between the cruciform cylinders and the flow cannot be achieved thus numerical simulations as a complementary method of laboratory experiments were adopted to reveal the flow pattern and hydrodynamic characteristics of the cruciform cylinders in several literatures deng et al 2007 employed the virtual boundary method to simulate the uniform flow past the cruciform cylinders with a gap at re 150 it was found that the peak amplitude of viv for the cruciform cylinders was lower than that for the isolated cylinder while the resonance region for the cruciform cylinders was wider recently bi et al 2017 used the shear stress transport sst k ω model to investigate the effect of the attack angle on the drag force on the cruciform cylinders for the subcritical reynold number zhao and lu 2018 used the direct numerical simulation dns to investigate the local flow patterns near the intersection center and their effect on the drag force for reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 500 in general the existing experimental and numerical studies for the hydrodynamic characteristics of cruciform cylinders are limited especially the effect of the blockage ratio and reynolds number of the cruciform cylinders without gap was never reported therefore this study is aimed at the numerical investigation of the wake characteristics and the force coefficient of the cruciform cylinders for different reynolds numbers 300 re 1800 and blockage ratios 0 0975 b r 0 75 the large eddy simulation les which has been proved to be a high efficiency and a precision tool for studying the dynamics of subcritical reynolds number flows yeon 2014 is employed for analyzing the turbulence around the cruciform cylinders moreover a comparison of hydrodynamic characteristics between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different blockage ratios is also presented 2 numerical model in this study the well established large eddy simulation les is calculated by the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam c libraries and the physical fields are discretized by the finite volume method fvm the pressure velocity coupling is based on the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso method the advection terms in the momentum equations are discretized by the gauss lust scheme which blends the linear scheme and linear upwind scheme the gauss linear scheme is adopted for the pressure terms and the gauss linear corrected scheme is applied for the laplacian terms the time derivative terms are discretized by the backward scheme the details of numerical model are given as follows 2 1 numerical method the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations for large eddy evolution are filtered typically using the grid resolution resulting in the continuity equation for the incompressible fluid can be written as 1 u i x i 0 where u i x i t is the grid filtered velocity component and the resolved navier stokes equation for describing the momentum conservation of the incompressible fluid is given by 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where t is the time ρ is the fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and p is the grid filtered pressure the subgrid scale sgs stress tensor τ i j is defined as τ i j u i u j u i u j which accounts for the effect of sgs on the resolved scales it should be noted that the item of τ i j is not closure and must be calculated by the closed sgs model in this study the dynamic k equation subgrid scale dksgs model is employed for the les the main concept of which is to derive the sgs kinetic energy by solving its transport equation the multiple studies referring to deardorff 1973 schumann 1975 horiuti 1985 menon and kim 1996 and chai and mahesh 2012 have reported that the dksgs model has a good performance in the les of incompressible flows and the dynamic one equation for sgs kinetic energy k s 0 5 u i 2 u i 2 can be given in the following form 3 k s t u i k s x i τ i j u i x j ε x i ν t k s x i and in turns the subgrid stresses τ i j can be modeled using the sgs eddy viscosity ν t as follows 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 δ i j k s where δ i j is the kronecker symbol 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 6 ν t c v k s 1 2 δ where δ is the grid scale filter width and the characteristic width of the test filter δ typically δ 2 δ is used to determine the space dependent model coefficient c v as given 7 2 c v m i j l i j 1 3 δ i j l k k where 8 m i j δ k 1 2 s i j δ k s

the dissipation rate model coefficient c ε can be determined based on the test filter level as follows 13 c ε ν u i x j u i x j u ˆ i x j u ˆ i x j k 3 2 δ 1 k s 3 2 δ 1 2 2 mesh dependency and model validation the cruciform cylinders model consists of the equal length horizontal and vertical circular cylinders intersecting at the middle point the diameter of each cylinder is considered as a constant of 10 mm the horizontal and vertical cylinders span the whole section of computational domain it means that the width and height of the numerical computational domain change with the spanwise length of the cruciform cylinders in turn affecting the blockage ratio which is defined as the ratio of the projected area of the intersecting cylinders in the flow direction to the section area of numerical computational domain to ensure a fully developed turbulence flow in the near wake the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary are respectively l a 10 d and l b 20 d away from the center line of cylinders as shown in fig 2 to imitate the periodic arrangement of the cruciform cylinders in the net structure see fig 1 the periodic boundary condition is employed on side walls side 1 1 1 2 2 1 and 2 2 in fig 2 side 1 1 and side 1 2 or side 2 1 and side 2 2 are the source boundary and the target boundary of each other at the inlet a uniform velocity component u in the x direction is given and the pressure gradient in the flow direction is zero at the outlet the pressure and the velocity gradients are specified as zero on the cylinder surface no slip boundary condition u i 0 is adopted the initial value for the flow velocity is set equal to the inlet velocity and the initial pressure is set to zero in the whole domain the computational mesh is chosen based on the mesh dependence study as follows the computational mesh for the cruciform cylinders is generated using the hexahedron finite element due to the les depends strongly on the grid resolution 40 layers of meshes are adopted around the cylinder surface to refine the near field grid and the thickness of the first mesh is selected according to the dimensionless wall distance y u f δ ν where u f is the friction velocity at the nearest wall and δ is the distance to the nearest wall to ensure the fidelity of the near wake flow simulation in the subcritical reynolds number the value of the dimensionless wall distance is set as 0 105 referring to the suggested value for dns by tong et al 2015 and zhao et al 2009 the distance between the outer boundaries of the rectangular mesh refinement domain to the cylinder surface is set as 0 5 d and the mesh size in the cylindrical spanwise direction is 0 1 d as shown in fig 3 outside the mesh refinement region the mesh size is set as 0 1 d the number of the grids along the cylinder circumstance is determined by the mesh dependency study as follows to investigate the effect of the mesh density on the numerical accuracy three mesh distributions are generated for the flow past an isolated cylinder at r e 1000 as shown in table 1 the numbers of cells along the cylinder circumstance on the cylinder surface for mesh 1 2 and 3 are 64 80 and 96 respectively the computational domain and the location of the isolated cylinder are same as those shown in fig 2 the computation time is specified based on the non dimensional time t u t d which is set as t 400 for establishing a fully developed flow field the numerical results including the mean drag coefficient the root mean square r m s of the lift coefficient the pressure coefficient and the strouhal number for the three mesh distributions are shown in table 1 in this study c d is the drag coefficient and c d is the mean drag coefficient c l is the lift coefficient and c l is the root mean square r m s of lift coefficient st is the strouhal number which are respectively defined as 14 c d f x 0 5 ρ u 2 a p 15 c l f y 0 5 ρ u 2 a p 16 s t f s d u where f x is the drag force acting on the cylinder in the x direction and f y is the lift force acting on the cylinder in the y direction a p is the projected area f s is the frequency of the fluctuating lift force which is found from the fast fourier transition analysis of the lift coefficient the mean pressure coefficient c p is defined as 17 c p p l p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p l is the local pressure on the cylinder surface and p is the free stream pressure it should be clarified for the following discussion that c p b and c p s are the mean pressure coefficient at the base point and at the front stagnation point respectively the base point is defined as the aft point on the cylinder surface along the flow direction α 180 and the stagnation point is the point at α 0 in this study the results of the mesh dependence study show that the differences in the drag coefficient the r m s of the lift coefficient and the strouhal number between the mesh 2 and the mesh 3 are 2 39 1 19 and 0 94 respectively it indicates that the numerical results are not sensitive to the mesh density when the mesh distribution is as fine as mesh 3 and the numerical results of mesh 3 agree well with the numerical results in the previous researches therefore the number of cells along the cylinder circumstance is set to 96 for the cruciform cylinders in this study to further validate the numerical model the distributions of pressure coefficients on the cylinder surface along circumferential direction for mesh 3 are compared with the existing data a good agreement of the present pressure coefficients with the published numerical results from zhao et al 2009 and lei et al 2001 is achieved as shown in fig 4 all three studies show that the minimum pressure coefficient c p m i n occurs at α 75 which is consistent with the previous researches in addition to the mesh dependency study the mesh 4 with a larger domain size but same mesh density as the mesh 3 for flow past a single cylinder is used to investigate the effect of domain size on the simulation as shown in table 2 due to the configuration requirements of two intersecting cylinders both the width and the height of the computational domain in this study must be equal to the length of the cylinder therefore the blockage ratios of the cylinder are same for both mesh 3 and mesh 4 only the length of the computational domain for mesh 4 is changed to l a 16 d and l b 29 d which is used in zhao et al 2009 and longer than l a 10 d and l b 20 d in mesh 3 the simulation results for mesh 3 and mesh 4 in table 2 show that the differences between the two computational domains can be negligible with the maximum difference of 4 88 in the mean drag coefficient however the number of cells increases from 3 3 million in mesh 3 to 5 0 million in mesh 4 and in turn about 1 5 times of increase in the computing time in consideration of computational efficiency the computational domain size with l a 10 d and l b 20 d is adequate in this study 3 numerical results the numerical calculations were performed on a computer workstation located in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china twenty two processors were used for each calculation the simulations were carried out under the maximum courant number of 0 5 to ensure the computational stability numerical simulations were carried out in two case groups to investigate the effect of reynolds number re on the wake flow around the cruciform cylinders group 1 g1 was carried out for reynolds number ranging from 300 to 1800 at a constant aspect ratio l d 10 and group 2 g2 was carried out for different aspect ratios l d 2 20 at re 1000 to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio b r the detailed grid parameters for g1 and g2 were listed in table 3 and table 4 respectively to make a comparison between the cruciform cylinders and an isolated cylinder the same computation parameter and domain size used in g1 and g2 were applied to simulate the flow past an isolated cylinder 3 1 wake flow features 3 1 1 the effect of reynolds number to identify the wake flow modes around cruciform cylinders in subcritical reynolds numbers the three dimensional streamlines at re 300 based on the mean velocity are used as shown in fig 5 it is found that when the flow passes the cruciform cylinders a recirculation motion of the wake flow can be obviously observed in the downstream of the intersection center which is consistent with the experimental results in osaka et al 1983 a b after recirculating the wake flow diverges from the intersecting center and points to the ends of cylinders forming an up flow due to the existence of the up flow the wake vortex near the ends of cruciform cylinders spreads in spanwise direction to form a three dimensional trailing vortex tv the formation of this tv vortex is similar to that behind the two cylinders in a cruciform arrangement with a small gap s 0 5 d at re 100 reported by zhao and lu 2018 to identify the wake vortex features of the cruciform cylinders for different reynolds numbers the three dimensional vortex structures are firstly presented by the iso surface of the second negative eigenvalue λ 2 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and the anti symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively jeong and hussain 1995 demonstrated that the eigenvalue λ 2 could represent the topology and geometry of the vortex cores correctly in both high re and low re flows fig 6 shows the instant iso surfaces of λ 2 0 01 λ 2 m a x gray in the three dimensional view and the side view the x z plane for the different reynolds numbers the surfaces of cruciform cylinders are colored by blue it is found that the near wake vortex of the cruciform cylinders is composed of two patterns of vortex shedding one is the trailing vortex which periodically sheds from the spanwise cylinder the other is that due to the recirculation flow behind the intersection center the vortex street at the rear of spanwise cylinders is truncated and broken into a large number of small scale vortices shedding from the center named central vortices at the starting point of the subcritical reynolds number re 300 the central vortex shedding occurs within about 2 5d from the intersecting center and the wake vortex street behind the spanwise cylinders is parallel to the cylinders which is defined as p mode vortex shedding in zhao and lu 2018 when the reynolds number is 600 small scale vortices appears in whole wake region indicating the wake flow has been full turbulence with the further increasing reynolds number the number of the small scale vortices increases significantly and the vortex tube in the spanwise direction is broken due to the strong three dimensional effect to investigate the effect of reynolds number on the formation of the central vortex and the trailing vortex the three dimensional iso surfaces of the mean x component velocity u x 0 in the case of g1 are shown in fig 7 the results show that the vortex formation of the cruciform cylinders maintains orthogonal symmetric about the x y plane and x z plane in the subcritical reynolds number according to the different formation mechanisms three regions of the vortex formation at the rear of the cruciform cylinders are confirmed as a the recirculation region b the kármán vortex region and c the transition region between the recirculation region and the kármán vortex region streamlines at re 300 based on the mean velocity are plotted in fig 7 a to illustrate the determination of the formation regions in the recirculation region the wake flow is dominated by the recirculation flow behind the intersecting center and the boundaries of this region are considered to locate at the first inflection point p1 of contour lines of u x 0 in the x y or x z plane in the kármán vortex region the effect of recirculation flow becomes insignificant and the wake flow is dominated by the kármán vortex shedding according to the variation of the contour of u x 0 along the cylinder axis the inner boundaries of the kármán vortex region are defined at the second inflection point p2 the transition region is defined as an area between the recirculation region and kármán vortex region for re 300 the width and the length of the recirculation region is 4 8d and 5 7d respectively the gaps between the recirculation region and kármán vortex region in different cylinder axial directions are both equal to 1 0 d with the increasing reynolds number the cross flow velocity around the intersection center increases and the pressure gradient at the rear of the center also increases this induces that the flow passing the intersection center recirculates earlier and the longitudinal length of the recirculation region decreases meanwhile due to more flow is forced to surround the intersection center the divagation of the central flow reduces which induce the transition region is compressed and the kármán vortex region grows in the spanwise direction as the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the change in these vortex formations becomes insignificant indicating the limited effect of reynolds number to investigate the evolution of the wake vortex behind the cruciform cylinders along the z direction for different reynolds numbers the contours of the vorticity in the x y plane at z d 1 5 of the cruciform cylinders in re 300 1800 are shown in fig 8 because the time average flow field around the cruciform cylinders is symmetric characteristics of the wake vorticities in another cylinder axis are similar to that shown in fig 8 and the wake vortex formation is also plotted in fig 8 using the blue solid line it is found that due to the recirculation flow behind the intersection center the shear layer around the cylinder at z d 1 0 diverges towards spanwise direction and the wake vortices in the contour of u x 0 are disordered as shown in the first row of fig 8 with the increasing reynolds number the size of the contour of u x 0 at z d 1 0 slightly reduces indicating that the recirculation flow caused by the intersection will be compressed toward the center under the action of high flow rates on the other hand with the increasing distance from the center the effect of the recirculation flow reduces and the shear layers at two sides of the cylinder converge towards the center line it leads to that the size of the formation region of the cylinder the length of the contour of u x 0 in the central line insignificantly reduces and its minimum occurs at about z d 2 0 as the z direction distance further increases the near wake vortices of the cylinder experience the effect of the up flow and the length of the formation region increases for z d 4 0 the change in the near wake vortex becomes little to investigate the difference of the kármán vortex shedding between the spanwise cylinder of the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder the contours of the vorticity in the section plane of the isolated cylinder for different reynolds numbers are presented in the last row of fig 8 it is found that the core of the near wall vortex at the rear of the cruciform cylinders appears at farther downstream than that of the isolated cylinder and the length of the formation region l f of the cruciform cylinders is almost 2 times longer than that of the isolated cylinder for given reynolds number for the cruciform cylinders the length of the formation region l f is 2 8 d at re 300 while it is approximately 1 3d for the isolated cylinder as shown in figs 8 a 5 and a 6 as the reynolds number increases to 600 l f of the cruciform cylinders slightly decreases to 2 5d and that of the isolated cylinder increases to 1 4d with further increasing reynolds number the values of l f for the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder change insignificantly this downstream shift of the near wall vortex means that the spanwise cylinder of the cruciform cylinders is little affected by the kármán vortex street and the viv of the cruciform cylinders is suppressed to find out the reason of the near wake vortex shift the streamlines in the wake region behind the end of the cruciform cylinders at re 300 and 600 are tracked as shown in fig 9 and the streamlines in the wake region behind the end of the isolated cylinder are also presented observations of streamlines show that the wake vortices of the cruciform cylinders are seriously affected by three dimensional spanwise flow caused by the intersection center while the three dimensional effect of the isolated cylinder is insignificant for the cruciform cylinders the flow passing the intersection center reverses in the downstream region and rejoins at the rear of the center when the recirculating flow reaches the rear surface of the cruciform cylinders its flow direction turns towards the downstream region respectively along four spanwise directions of the cruciform cylinders forming four pairs of up flows under the action of the up flows the near wall vortices of the spanwise cylinders are entrained away from the structural surface 3 1 2 the effect of the blockage ratio to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio b r on the wake flow of the cruciform cylinders the three dimensional iso surfaces of the mean x component velocity u x 0 for b r ranging from 0 0975 to 0 360 at re 1000 in g2 are shown in fig 10 the results indicate that the average flow field around the cruciform cylinders maintains orthogonal symmetric for various blockage ratios while there is a significant change in the wake vortex formation at the high blockage ratio b r 0 360 fig 10 a the formation of the kármán vortex at the rear of the spanwise cylinder disappears and most flows in the near wake region are forced to recirculate in downstream of intersection center with the decreasing blockage ratio the longitudinal length of the recirculation region gradually decreases and the formation of the kármán vortex begins to appear outside 3d off the center however fig 10 c shows that the length of the vortex formation in the wake of the spanwise cylinder varies along the spanwise direction indicating that the wake flows of the spanwise cylinder is affected by the central recirculation flow when the blockage ratio is 0 190 the vortex formation of the spanwise cylinder stabilizes and three wake regions the kármán vortex the recirculation and the transition region can be distinguished as the blockage ratio further decreases to 0 0975 the recirculation and the transition regions change little while the size of the vortex formation decreases from 3 0d off the center to the end in spanwise direction it indicates that at the low blockage ratio the effect of the up flow caused by the intersection center weakens and the wake vortex at the end of the cruciform cylinders will be similar to that of the isolated cylinder to investigate the effect of the blockage on the near wall vortex shedding the contours of the vorticity at z axis end of the cruciform cylinders in g2 for different aspect ratios are presented in fig 11 and the vorticity in the center plane of the isolated cylinder at re 1000 is also shown in fig 11 f for comparison the results of the cruciform cylinders show that when the aspect ratio is l d 5 the strongly recirculating flow caused by the high blockage drives the shear layer to the sides of the cylinder the separated opposite vortex pair rejoins at about 5d downstream of the cylinder and then sheds towards downstream with the increasing aspect ratio the vortex formation at the cylinder end increases and the shear layer in the wake of the cylinder gradually converges to the wake line and in turns the vortex shedding point moves towards the rear surface of the cylinder however the vortex formation region at the end of the cruciform cylinders with l d 10 is still much longer than that of the isolated cylinder indicating that the effect of the intersection center on the spanwise cylinder cannot be ignored when the aspect ratio is as large as l d 20 the spanwise flow caused by the intersection center becomes insignificant at the end of the cruciform cylinders and the wake formation at the end of the cruciform cylinders becomes similar to that of the isolated cylinder 3 2 pressure and force 3 2 1 pressure distribution the effect of the reynolds number on pressure distributions around the cruciform cylinders is investigated the semi circumference variations of the pressure coefficient c p of the cruciform cylinders in g1 at different z axis positions are shown in fig 12 due to the average flow field around the cruciform cylinders is ortho symmetric pressure distributions in other spanwise directions are similar to that in fig 12 for a comparison with the isolated cylinder the pressure coefficient distributions on the isolated cylinder are plotted by the red dashed line the results indicate that the stagnation pressure coefficient c p s of the cruciform cylinders changes little for different positions and is generally larger than that of the isolated cylinder in the tested reynolds range however there is a relatively large difference in the base pressure coefficient c p b for different positions of the cruciform cylinders which c p b decreases with the increasing distance from the intersection center this variation of the base pressure indicates that the wake flow near the intersection center is more sluggish than that at the ends of the cruciform cylinders in addition it is found that the effect of the intersecting center on pressure distributions is remarkable within the range of z 3 0 d the pressure coefficient along circumferential direction in the sectional plane located at z 0 5 d is largest with the increasing distance from z 0 5d to z 3 0d the zero pressure point c p 0 moves forward while the negative pressure inflection point the separation point moves backward along circumferential direction when z is beyond 3 0d the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface changes insignificantly this suggests that the boundary layer separation from the cylinder surface near the intersection center z 3 0 d occurs earlier than that at the ends of the cylinders z 3 0 d which is consistent with the change in the wake region fig 7 to further investigate the influence of the intersecting cylinders on the stagnation pressure a comparison of c p s between the intersection cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different reynolds numbers is presented fig 13 indicates that the stagnation pressure coefficients c p s of the isolated cylinder simulated in this study corresponds well with the prediction of c p s 1 8 r e proposed by grove et al 1964 correlation coefficient r 0 996 however c p s of the cruciform cylinders is much larger than that of the isolated cylinder it can be explained as that the existence of the intersection center increases the blockage of the spanwise cylinder and thus the positive pressure on the front surface also increases as the reynolds number increases the influence scope of the intersection center decreases as mentioned in section 3 1 1 inducing that the distinction of the stagnation pressure coefficient between the cruciform cylinders and the single cylinder decreases from 15 6 at re 300 to 9 9 at re 1200 when reynolds number is beyond 1200 the c p s of the intersection cylinder does not change with the reynolds number and it maintains around c p s 1 1 after fitting the results the formula of c p s 1 1 18 r e is proposed in this study to predict the stagnation pressure coefficient of the intersecting cylinders for 300 re 1800 the base pressure coefficient c p b distributions in the base line 5 z d 5 of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are plotted in fig 14 the results show that at low reynolds number of re 300 the profile of the base pressure coefficient distribution displays a unique curve with two peaks symmetrical about the central plane and the peaks appear at z 0 3 d with the increasing distance off the center in the range of 0 3 z d 2 4 the effect of the central recirculation flow decreases and the c p b gradually decreases for z d 2 4 the wake flow transforms from the recirculation region to the kármán vortex region and c p b on the cruciform cylinders gradually increases when reynolds number increases to 600 two peaks of c p b are replaced by one peak at the point of z d 0 and the width of the peak reduce to 3 6d z d 1 8 however the effect of the recirculation flow on the kármán vortex region still exists and there is an increase of c p b near the end of the cruciform cylinders until the reynolds number is beyond 1000 the variation of c p b along the spanwise direction is limited in the range of z d 3 0 when the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the change in the c p b distribution along the spanwise direction is insignificant for various reynolds numbers in addition the variation of c p b from the center to the cylinder end gives a good evidence of the existence of the up flow along the spanwise direction to investigate the effect of the blockage on the pressure distributions of the cruciform cylinders the semi circumference variations of the pressure coefficient at the end of the cruciform cylinders in g2 are shown in fig 15 it is found that the pressure on the surface of the spanwise cylinder strongly depends on the blockage ratio at the high blockage b r 0 750 the range of positive pressure on the cylinder surface is α 60⁰ and the inflection point of the negative pressure corresponding to the separation angle occurs at α 146⁰ as the blockage ratio decreases from 0 750 to 0 305 the value of the pressure on the spanwise cylinder rapidly decreases meanwhile the zero pressure point and the separation point moves forward to α 35⁰ and 110⁰ respectively when the blockage ratio is below 0 305 the variation of the pressure on the spanwise cylinder with the blockage ratio is insignificant and the pressure distribution becomes similar to that of the isolated cylinder fig 16 shows the variations of the base pressure coefficient of the cruciform cylinders along the spanwise direction for different blockage ratios it is found that the behaviors of the cruciform cylinders can be divided into three patterns for different blockage ratios at the high blockage ratio ranging from 0 750 to 0 438 the base pressure of the cruciform cylinders slightly fluctuates along the spanwise direction in such blockage ratio range the behavior of the cruciform cylinders in flow is the orthogonal solid pattern which most of inflow is forced to surround the intersection center forming an ortho symmetry recirculation bubble and no kármán vortex shedding occurs at the spanwise cylinder when the blockage ratio is 0 360 the base pressure coefficient at z 0 relatively increases and a one peak waveform appears in the spanwise distribution of the base pressures according to the wake flow observation in sec 3 2 2 the transition region from the recirculation flow to the kármán vortex shedding appears near the end of the spanwise cylinder indicating the cylindrical feature of the cruciform cylinders begins to emerge in 0 190 b r 0 360 the relative deviation between the base pressure at the center and the end of the cruciform cylinders increases with the decreasing blockage ratio and the base pressure near the end becomes steady gradually named the mixed pattern due to effect of the up flow the viv of the cruciform cylinders caused by the kármán vortex shedding is suppressed when the blockage ratio is as small as 0 0975 the edges of the recirculation region and the transition region locate at 2d and 3d off the center respectively and fig 16 h shows that the base pressure of spanwise cylinder decreases along the spanwise direction in the range of 3 z d 5 8 indicating the up flow gradually weakens for z 5 8d the base pressure maintains constant and its value is close to that of the isolated cylinder it indicates that at such blockage the effect of the intersection center on the wake flow of the cruciform cylinders is limited and the cylindrical characteristic dominated the behavior of the cruciform cylinders named cylinder dominated pattern 3 2 2 hydrodynamic force the time histories of the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are shown in fig 17 due to the symmetric flow field the lift coefficients of the cruciform cylinders in the z axis and y axis are similar and the y component of force coefficient is used to analyze the lift coefficient c l in this study the results show that the calculated time is long enough to obtain the steady time history of the force coefficients of the cruciform cylinders the fluctuation of c d of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 2 8 of the average drag coefficient for 300 re 1800 indicating that the kármán vortex shedding of the spanwise cylinder has little influence on the c d the fluctuation of the lift coefficient remains at a small value the average oscillation amplitude is lower than 0 0318 according to the spectrum of c l see fig 17 c the peaks in the lift force time history for re 300 1800 are found to be st 0 22 0 25 the variations of c l and st of the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different reynolds number are shown in fig 18 it is found that c l of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 0 019 for re 1800 which is approximately one twentieth of that of the isolated cylinder however the st of the cruciform cylinders is generally 15 8 larger than that of the isolated cylinder it is due to the existence of the intersection center increases the blockage effect on the spanwise cylinder and in turns an increase of the strouhal number the results give a good evidence of that the cruciform cylinders can effectively reduce the oscillation amplitude of the lift force caused by the kármán vortex shedding to investigate the variation of the lift fluctuation along the cylinder axis c l s of the cruciform cylinders with b r 0 190 in the positive z axis for different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 19 it is found that c l s of the cruciform cylinders approximately remains a small value c l s 0 025 within 1 0 d from the intersection center for different reynolds numbers with the increasing distance from the center c l s slightly reduces and the minimum of c l s occurs at the outer boundary of the recirculation region see fig 7 and then c l s gradually increases along the cylinder axis and reaches its maximum at the end of cylinder z d 5 however the value of c l s at z d 5 is still more than 6 times smaller than the lift coefficient of a single cylinder see fig 18 a indicating that the lift fluctuation caused by the kármán vortex shedding is significantly reduced even at ends of the cruciform cylinders fig 19 also indicates that c l s of the cruciform cylinders increases with the increasing reynolds number when the reynolds number is beyond 1500 the distribution of c l s along the cylinder axis changes little with the reynolds number to investigate the frequency of the lift fluctuation along the cylinder axis the frequency of the sectional lift coefficient for the z axis cylinder at re 300 and 600 are calculated by the fft transform contours of the amplitude of c l in the z st plane at a re 300 and b re 600 are shown in fig 20 in fig 20 the outer boundary of the recirculation region and the inner boundary of the karman vortex region are marked by the blue and red dot dash lines respectively and strouhal numbers of the total lift coefficient of the cruciform cylinder at re 300 and 600 are plotted by the black dash line it is found that although st of the total lift coefficient is equal to the vortex shedding of spanwise cylinders the lift fluctuation in the recirculation region is maintained in low frequency st 0 13 only in the kármán vortex region the lift fluctuation is dominated by the vortex shedding of the spanwise cylinders and the frequency of the sectional lift coefficient is equal to the frequency of the vortex shedding this indicates that oscillation of the total lift coefficient is mainly caused by the parts of the cruciform cylinders in the kármán vortex region to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio on the lift fluctuation the variations of c l and st of the cruciform cylinders in g2 are shown in fig 21 the results show that due to different behavior patterns of the cruciform cylinders with various blocking ratio the lift fluctuation expresses different characteristics for the orthogonal solid pattern b r 0 360 the c l and st of the cruciform cylinders are close to zero with the decreasing blockage ratio the behavior of the cruciform cylinders transforms to the mixed pattern inducing an increase of strouhal number however due to the effect of the up flow the c l changes insignificant and maintains around 0 01 when the blockage ratio is 0 210 the strouhal number suddenly increases to 0 2467 indicating the behavior of the cruciform cylinders is entering the cylinder dominated pattern with the further decreasing blockage ratio the c l gradually increases and the st decreases at b r 0 0975 the strouhal number of the cruciform cylinders is consistent with that of the isolated cylinder and the c l is about a quarter of that of the isolated cylinder to investigate the effect of the reynolds number on c d of the cruciform cylinders the mean drag coefficients c d of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are shown in fig 22 and the mean drag coefficients of the isolated cylinder calculated in present study are also plotted for a comparison the results indicate that the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is larger than that of the isolated cylinder and the difference between them reduces from 7 21 to 3 21 with the increasing reynolds number to investigate the difference of c d between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder the mean sectional drag coefficients c d s of the cruciform cylinders in the positive z axis are shown in fig 23 it is found that the c d s in the kármán vortex region is similar to c d of the isolated cylinder see fig 22 while there is an increase of the c d s in the recirculation region and transition region this induces that c d of the cruciform cylinders is larger than that of the isolated cylinder with the increasing reynolds number the spanwise size of the recirculation and the transition region reduces and the c d s in the transition region becomes similar to that in the kármán vortex region when the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the distribution of c d s of the cruciform cylinders changes little with the reynolds number and the difference of c d between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder maintains around 3 21 in general the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is little however the mean drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders strongly depends on the blockage ratio fig 24 shows the variation of the c d of the cruciform cylinders in g2 and the c d of the isolated cylinder at re 1000 are plotted by the blue dashed line according to the behavior patterns of the cruciform cylinders in flow the variation of the c d for different blockage ratios can be divided into three corresponding stages and these stages can be expressed by a piecewise function given as follows 18 c d 0 985 b r 1 072 c y l i n d e r d o m i n a t e d s t a g e b r 0 19 14 267 b r 2 2 741 b r 1 263 m i x e d s t a g e 0 19 b r 0 36 0 820 1 b r 2 161 o r t h o g o n a l s o l i d s t a g e 0 36 b r 0 75 for the cylinder dominated stage b r 0 19 the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders grows linearly with the blockage ratio however due to the small growth gradient the c d of the cruciform cylinders maintains close to that of the isolated cylinder in the mixed stage 0 19 b r 0 36 the influence of the intersection center increases with the increasing blockage ratio and more flows are forced to recirculate in the wake it induces that the c d of the cruciform cylinders increases with the square of the blockage ratio in the orthogonal solid stage 0 36 b r 0 75 the cylinder characteristic of the cruciform cylinders disappears and the flow past the cruciform cylinders can be considered as the narrow gap flow according to the continuity equation the velocity of the cross flow around the cruciform cylinders can be roughly estimated as u 1 b r and thus the c d of the cruciform cylinders is assumed to be a power function of the void ratio 1 b r in this stage after fitting calculated results the c d of the cruciform cylinders is determined as eq 18 with the correlation coefficient beyond 0 99 4 conclusions numerical simulations of the flow past the cruciform cylinders with the aspect ratio of 10 are conducted for the subcritical reynolds number ranging from 300 to 1800 the effects of the reynolds number and the blockage ratio on the vortex shedding pattern and the force coefficients are comprehensively analyzed the main conclusions are summarized as follows i it is found that when the flows pass through the cruciform cylinders with l d 10 a three dimensional recirculating flow is created in the wake region of the intersection center this recirculation flow induces the up flow along the spanwise direction which suppresses the viv of the cruciform cylinders caused by the kármán vortex shedding with the increasing reynolds number the size of the recirculation region slightly decreases however the influence of the kármán vortex shedding remains insignificant ii the behavior of the cruciform cylinders in flow strongly depends on the blockage ratio and it can be classified into three patterns the cylinder dominated pattern the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern in the orthogonal solid pattern 0 36 b r 0 75 almost all flows are forced to surround the intersection center and there is only the recirculation region in the wake of the cruciform cylinders when the cruciform cylinders is in the mixed pattern 0 19 b r 0 36 a narrow transition region appears outside of the recirculation indicating the cylindrical character of the cruciform cylinders emerges with the decreasing blockage ratio in this pattern the kármán vortex formation region grows however the kármán vortex shedding at the end of the cylinder is still affected by the up flow in the cylinder dominated pattern 0 0975 b r 0 19 the effect of the intersection center is limited within 3 d off the center and the up flow weakens along the spanwise direction when the spanwise distance off the center is beyond 5 8 d the wake vortex of the spanwise cylinder is little affected by the up flow and consistent with that of the isolated cylinder iii it is found that for the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern c l of the cruciform cylinders maintains close to zero at b r 0 19 c l of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 0 019 for re 1800 which is about one twentieth of that of the isolated cylinder as the blockage ratio decreases to 0 0975 the c l of the cruciform cylinders increases to a quarter of that for the isolated cylinder however for the mixed pattern the strouhal number increases with the decreasing blockage ratio and a sudden rise of st occurs at b r 0 210 with the further decreasing blockage ratio the st of the cruciform cylinders gradually decreases to the same value as that of the isolated cylinder iv the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is small while the effect of the blockage ratio on the drag coefficient is strong for the cylinder dominated pattern c d of the cruciform cylinders increases linearly with the increasing blockage ratio and the value of c d of the cruciform cylinders in this pattern remains close to that of the isolated cylinder at b r 0 19 c d of the cruciform cylinders becomes larger than that of the isolated cylinder and this difference decreases with the increasing reynolds number with further increasing blockage ratio the growth gradient of c d of the cruciform cylinders increases a piecewise function is proposed to estimate c d of the cruciform cylinders for different behavior patterns here credit authorship contribution statement ming fu tang software data curation writing original draft writing original draft

21196,large eddy simulation les technique is adopted to analyze the subcritical flow around the cruciform cylinders and then the influence of the reynolds number and the blockage ratio on the flow pattern and the hydrodynamic force is numerically investigated in details a recirculation flow is observed at the rear of the intersection center and an up flow is induced along the spanwise direction under the action of the up flow the vortex formation region of the spanwise cylinder is stretched and the vortex induced vibration viv caused by the kármán vortex shedding is suppressed in addition the wake region of the cruciform cylinders can be divided into three regions the recirculation region the transition region and the kármán vortex region three types of flow pattern of the cruciform cylinders which are the cylinder dominated pattern the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern can be identified for different blockage ratios furthermore the drag coefficient the root mean square r m s of the lift fluctuation and the strouhal number of the cruciform cylinders are calculated and compared with that of the isolated cylinder keywords cruciform cylinders vortex flow drag coefficient large eddy simulation 1 introduction the cruciform circular cylinder which is composed of two circular cylinders with same length and diameter is commonly used in various engineering applications it is generally considered as a basic element of the net structure see fig 1 such as the fish cage the heat exchanger the damping screen and the truss structures etc therefore the study on the flow past the cruciform cylinders is useful to understand the basic three dimensional flow pattern around the net structure and to develop a general prediction tool of the force on the net structure which is of interest over a wide range of engineering applications in the past decades some experimental studies on the flow past the cruciform circular cylinder were reported in several of researches osaka et al 1983 a b was earliest to experimentally investigate the turbulent wake behind two cruciform cylinders in unsteady flow re 8000 it was found that the intersection of cylinders induced a secondary flow which was recirculated towards the wake center and outwards along the spanwise cylinder axis and this secondary flow caused the back pressure on the cylinder surface around the intersection center became high zdravkovich 1983 and 1985 found that the secondary flow originated from the intersection was characterized by four pairs of symmetrically trailing vortices on the cylinder surface and it caused an increase in the local drag coefficient then fox 1991 and shirakashi et al 1994 carried out experiments to investigate the vortex shedding from two cylinders in the cruciform arrangement with a small gap it was found that the flow pattern in the near wake of the cruciform cylinders was dominated by one of two types of three dimensional vortices the trailing vortex tv and the necklace vortex nv bae et al 2001 measured the kármán vortex induced vibration kviv of the cruciform cylinders with a gap and found kviv was effectively suppressed when the gap between the cylinders was less than half of the cylinder diameter lader et al 2014 designed a specially made cruciform model consisting of the intersecting cylinder and the central sphere to investigate the effect of the intersection in uniform flow it was found that the drag coefficient of the central sphere was much higher than that of the single sphere without the cruciform configuration and the increase of drag coefficient was depended on the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the sphere diameter recently we used the cruciform cylinder element to experimentally analyze the hydrodynamic coefficient of net panels with different net solidities net materials and knot patterns for the reynolds number in the range of 102 25 re 103 87 tang et al 2018 in which the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficient of net structure and the reynolds number and the net solidity blockage ratio was obtained through fitting the experimental data however due to the limitation of measuring techniques in the laboratory experiments the details for the interaction between the cruciform cylinders and the flow cannot be achieved thus numerical simulations as a complementary method of laboratory experiments were adopted to reveal the flow pattern and hydrodynamic characteristics of the cruciform cylinders in several literatures deng et al 2007 employed the virtual boundary method to simulate the uniform flow past the cruciform cylinders with a gap at re 150 it was found that the peak amplitude of viv for the cruciform cylinders was lower than that for the isolated cylinder while the resonance region for the cruciform cylinders was wider recently bi et al 2017 used the shear stress transport sst k ω model to investigate the effect of the attack angle on the drag force on the cruciform cylinders for the subcritical reynold number zhao and lu 2018 used the direct numerical simulation dns to investigate the local flow patterns near the intersection center and their effect on the drag force for reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 500 in general the existing experimental and numerical studies for the hydrodynamic characteristics of cruciform cylinders are limited especially the effect of the blockage ratio and reynolds number of the cruciform cylinders without gap was never reported therefore this study is aimed at the numerical investigation of the wake characteristics and the force coefficient of the cruciform cylinders for different reynolds numbers 300 re 1800 and blockage ratios 0 0975 b r 0 75 the large eddy simulation les which has been proved to be a high efficiency and a precision tool for studying the dynamics of subcritical reynolds number flows yeon 2014 is employed for analyzing the turbulence around the cruciform cylinders moreover a comparison of hydrodynamic characteristics between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different blockage ratios is also presented 2 numerical model in this study the well established large eddy simulation les is calculated by the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam c libraries and the physical fields are discretized by the finite volume method fvm the pressure velocity coupling is based on the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso method the advection terms in the momentum equations are discretized by the gauss lust scheme which blends the linear scheme and linear upwind scheme the gauss linear scheme is adopted for the pressure terms and the gauss linear corrected scheme is applied for the laplacian terms the time derivative terms are discretized by the backward scheme the details of numerical model are given as follows 2 1 numerical method the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations for large eddy evolution are filtered typically using the grid resolution resulting in the continuity equation for the incompressible fluid can be written as 1 u i x i 0 where u i x i t is the grid filtered velocity component and the resolved navier stokes equation for describing the momentum conservation of the incompressible fluid is given by 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where t is the time ρ is the fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and p is the grid filtered pressure the subgrid scale sgs stress tensor τ i j is defined as τ i j u i u j u i u j which accounts for the effect of sgs on the resolved scales it should be noted that the item of τ i j is not closure and must be calculated by the closed sgs model in this study the dynamic k equation subgrid scale dksgs model is employed for the les the main concept of which is to derive the sgs kinetic energy by solving its transport equation the multiple studies referring to deardorff 1973 schumann 1975 horiuti 1985 menon and kim 1996 and chai and mahesh 2012 have reported that the dksgs model has a good performance in the les of incompressible flows and the dynamic one equation for sgs kinetic energy k s 0 5 u i 2 u i 2 can be given in the following form 3 k s t u i k s x i τ i j u i x j ε x i ν t k s x i and in turns the subgrid stresses τ i j can be modeled using the sgs eddy viscosity ν t as follows 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 δ i j k s where δ i j is the kronecker symbol 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 6 ν t c v k s 1 2 δ where δ is the grid scale filter width and the characteristic width of the test filter δ typically δ 2 δ is used to determine the space dependent model coefficient c v as given 7 2 c v m i j l i j 1 3 δ i j l k k where 8 m i j δ k 1 2 s i j δ k s

validation the cruciform cylinders model consists of the equal length horizontal and vertical circular cylinders intersecting at the middle point the diameter of each cylinder is considered as a constant of 10 mm the horizontal and vertical cylinders span the whole section of computational domain it means that the width and height of the numerical computational domain change with the spanwise length of the cruciform cylinders in turn affecting the blockage ratio which is defined as the ratio of the projected area of the intersecting cylinders in the flow direction to the section area of numerical computational domain to ensure a fully developed turbulence flow in the near wake the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary are respectively l a 10 d and l b 20 d away from the center line of cylinders as shown in fig 2 to imitate the periodic arrangement of the cruciform cylinders in the net structure see fig 1 the periodic boundary condition is employed on side walls side 1 1 1 2 2 1 and 2 2 in fig 2 side 1 1 and side 1 2 or side 2 1 and side 2 2 are the source boundary and the target boundary of each other at the inlet a uniform velocity component u in the x direction is given and the pressure gradient in the flow direction is zero at the outlet the pressure and the velocity gradients are specified as zero on the cylinder surface no slip boundary condition u i 0 is adopted the initial value for the flow velocity is set equal to the inlet velocity and the initial pressure is set to zero in the whole domain the computational mesh is chosen based on the mesh dependence study as follows the computational mesh for the cruciform cylinders is generated using the hexahedron finite element due to the les depends strongly on the grid resolution 40 layers of meshes are adopted around the cylinder surface to refine the near field grid and the thickness of the first mesh is selected according to the dimensionless wall distance y u f δ ν where u f is the friction velocity at the nearest wall and δ is the distance to the nearest wall to ensure the fidelity of the near wake flow simulation in the subcritical reynolds number the value of the dimensionless wall distance is set as 0 105 referring to the suggested value for dns by tong et al 2015 and zhao et al 2009 the distance between the outer boundaries of the rectangular mesh refinement domain to the cylinder surface is set as 0 5 d and the mesh size in the cylindrical spanwise direction is 0 1 d as shown in fig 3 outside the mesh refinement region the mesh size is set as 0 1 d the number of the grids along the cylinder circumstance is determined by the mesh dependency study as follows to investigate the effect of the mesh density on the numerical accuracy three mesh distributions are generated for the flow past an isolated cylinder at r e 1000 as shown in table 1 the numbers of cells along the cylinder circumstance on the cylinder surface for mesh 1 2 and 3 are 64 80 and 96 respectively the computational domain and the location of the isolated cylinder are same as those shown in fig 2 the computation time is specified based on the non dimensional time t u t d which is set as t 400 for establishing a fully developed flow field the numerical results including the mean drag coefficient the root mean square r m s of the lift coefficient the pressure coefficient and the strouhal number for the three mesh distributions are shown in table 1 in this study c d is the drag coefficient and c d is the mean drag coefficient c l is the lift coefficient and c l is the root mean square r m s of lift coefficient st is the strouhal number which are respectively defined as 14 c d f x 0 5 ρ u 2 a p 15 c l f y 0 5 ρ u 2 a p 16 s t f s d u where f x is the drag force acting on the cylinder in the x direction and f y is the lift force acting on the cylinder in the y direction a p is the projected area f s is the frequency of the fluctuating lift force which is found from the fast fourier transition analysis of the lift coefficient the mean pressure coefficient c p is defined as 17 c p p l p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p l is the local pressure on the cylinder surface and p is the free stream pressure it should be clarified for the following discussion that c p b and c p s are the mean pressure coefficient at the base point and at the front stagnation point respectively the base point is defined as the aft point on the cylinder surface along the flow direction α 180 and the stagnation point is the point at α 0 in this study the results of the mesh dependence study show that the differences in the drag coefficient the r m s of the lift coefficient and the strouhal number between the mesh 2 and the mesh 3 are 2 39 1 19 and 0 94 respectively it indicates that the numerical results are not sensitive to the mesh density when the mesh distribution is as fine as mesh 3 and the numerical results of mesh 3 agree well with the numerical results in the previous researches therefore the number of cells along the cylinder circumstance is set to 96 for the cruciform cylinders in this study to further validate the numerical model the distributions of pressure coefficients on the cylinder surface along circumferential direction for mesh 3 are compared with the existing data a good agreement of the present pressure coefficients with the published numerical results from zhao et al 2009 and lei et al 2001 is achieved as shown in fig 4 all three studies show that the minimum pressure coefficient c p m i n occurs at α 75 which is consistent with the previous researches in addition to the mesh dependency study the mesh 4 with a larger domain size but same mesh density as the mesh 3 for flow past a single cylinder is used to investigate the effect of domain size on the simulation as shown in table 2 due to the configuration requirements of two intersecting cylinders both the width and the height of the computational domain in this study must be equal to the length of the cylinder therefore the blockage ratios of the cylinder are same for both mesh 3 and mesh 4 only the length of the computational domain for mesh 4 is changed to l a 16 d and l b 29 d which is used in zhao et al 2009 and longer than l a 10 d and l b 20 d in mesh 3 the simulation results for mesh 3 and mesh 4 in table 2 show that the differences between the two computational domains can be negligible with the maximum difference of 4 88 in the mean drag coefficient however the number of cells increases from 3 3 million in mesh 3 to 5 0 million in mesh 4 and in turn about 1 5 times of increase in the computing time in consideration of computational efficiency the computational domain size with l a 10 d and l b 20 d is adequate in this study 3 numerical results the numerical calculations were performed on a computer workstation located in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china twenty two processors were used for each calculation the simulations were carried out under the maximum courant number of 0 5 to ensure the computational stability numerical simulations were carried out in two case groups to investigate the effect of reynolds number re on the wake flow around the cruciform cylinders group 1 g1 was carried out for reynolds number ranging from 300 to 1800 at a constant aspect ratio l d 10 and group 2 g2 was carried out for different aspect ratios l d 2 20 at re 1000 to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio b r the detailed grid parameters for g1 and g2 were listed in table 3 and table 4 respectively to make a comparison between the cruciform cylinders and an isolated cylinder the same computation parameter and domain size used in g1 and g2 were applied to simulate the flow past an isolated cylinder 3 1 wake flow features 3 1 1 the effect of reynolds number to identify the wake flow modes around cruciform cylinders in subcritical reynolds numbers the three dimensional streamlines at re 300 based on the mean velocity are used as shown in fig 5 it is found that when the flow passes the cruciform cylinders a recirculation motion of the wake flow can be obviously observed in the downstream of the intersection center which is consistent with the experimental results in osaka et al 1983 a b after recirculating the wake flow diverges from the intersecting center and points to the ends of cylinders forming an up flow due to the existence of the up flow the wake vortex near the ends of cruciform cylinders spreads in spanwise direction to form a three dimensional trailing vortex tv the formation of this tv vortex is similar to that behind the two cylinders in a cruciform arrangement with a small gap s 0 5 d at re 100 reported by zhao and lu 2018 to identify the wake vortex features of the cruciform cylinders for different reynolds numbers the three dimensional vortex structures are firstly presented by the iso surface of the second negative eigenvalue λ 2 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and the anti symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively jeong and hussain 1995 demonstrated that the eigenvalue λ 2 could represent the topology and geometry of the vortex cores correctly in both high re and low re flows fig 6 shows the instant iso surfaces of λ 2 0 01 λ 2 m a x gray in the three dimensional view and the side view the x z plane for the different reynolds numbers the surfaces of cruciform cylinders are colored by blue it is found that the near wake vortex of the cruciform cylinders is composed of two patterns of vortex shedding one is the trailing vortex which periodically sheds from the spanwise cylinder the other is that due to the recirculation flow behind the intersection center the vortex street at the rear of spanwise cylinders is truncated and broken into a large number of small scale vortices shedding from the center named central vortices at the starting point of the subcritical reynolds number re 300 the central vortex shedding occurs within about 2 5d from the intersecting center and the wake vortex street behind the spanwise cylinders is parallel to the cylinders which is defined as p mode vortex shedding in zhao and lu 2018 when the reynolds number is 600 small scale vortices appears in whole wake region indicating the wake flow has been full turbulence with the further increasing reynolds number the number of the small scale vortices increases significantly and the vortex tube in the spanwise direction is broken due to the strong three dimensional effect to investigate the effect of reynolds number on the formation of the central vortex and the trailing vortex the three dimensional iso surfaces of the mean x component velocity u x 0 in the case of g1 are shown in fig 7 the results show that the vortex formation of the cruciform cylinders maintains orthogonal symmetric about the x y plane and x z plane in the subcritical reynolds number according to the different formation mechanisms three regions of the vortex formation at the rear of the cruciform cylinders are confirmed as a the recirculation region b the kármán vortex region and c the transition region between the recirculation region and the kármán vortex region streamlines at re 300 based on the mean velocity are plotted in fig 7 a to illustrate the determination of the formation regions in the recirculation region the wake flow is dominated by the recirculation flow behind the intersecting center and the boundaries of this region are considered to locate at the first inflection point p1 of contour lines of u x 0 in the x y or x z plane in the kármán vortex region the effect of recirculation flow becomes insignificant and the wake flow is dominated by the kármán vortex shedding according to the variation of the contour of u x 0 along the cylinder axis the inner boundaries of the kármán vortex region are defined at the second inflection point p2 the transition region is defined as an area between the recirculation region and kármán vortex region for re 300 the width and the length of the recirculation region is 4 8d and 5 7d respectively the gaps between the recirculation region and kármán vortex region in different cylinder axial directions are both equal to 1 0 d with the increasing reynolds number the cross flow velocity around the intersection center increases and the pressure gradient at the rear of the center also increases this induces that the flow passing the intersection center recirculates earlier and the longitudinal length of the recirculation region decreases meanwhile due to more flow is forced to surround the intersection center the divagation of the central flow reduces which induce the transition region is compressed and the kármán vortex region grows in the spanwise direction as the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the change in these vortex formations becomes insignificant indicating the limited effect of reynolds number to investigate the evolution of the wake vortex behind the cruciform cylinders along the z direction for different reynolds numbers the contours of the vorticity in the x y plane at z d 1 5 of the cruciform cylinders in re 300 1800 are shown in fig 8 because the time average flow field around the cruciform cylinders is symmetric characteristics of the wake vorticities in another cylinder axis are similar to that shown in fig 8 and the wake vortex formation is also plotted in fig 8 using the blue solid line it is found that due to the recirculation flow behind the intersection center the shear layer around the cylinder at z d 1 0 diverges towards spanwise direction and the wake vortices in the contour of u x 0 are disordered as shown in the first row of fig 8 with the increasing reynolds number the size of the contour of u x 0 at z d 1 0 slightly reduces indicating that the recirculation flow caused by the intersection will be compressed toward the center under the action of high flow rates on the other hand with the increasing distance from the center the effect of the recirculation flow reduces and the shear layers at two sides of the cylinder converge towards the center line it leads to that the size of the formation region of the cylinder the length of the contour of u x 0 in the central line insignificantly reduces and its minimum occurs at about z d 2 0 as the z direction distance further increases the near wake vortices of the cylinder experience the effect of the up flow and the length of the formation region increases for z d 4 0 the change in the near wake vortex becomes little to investigate the difference of the kármán vortex shedding between the spanwise cylinder of the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder the contours of the vorticity in the section plane of the isolated cylinder for different reynolds numbers are presented in the last row of fig 8 it is found that the core of the near wall vortex at the rear of the cruciform cylinders appears at farther downstream than that of the isolated cylinder and the length of the formation region l f of the cruciform cylinders is almost 2 times longer than that of the isolated cylinder for given reynolds number for the cruciform cylinders the length of the formation region l f is 2 8 d at re 300 while it is approximately 1 3d for the isolated cylinder as shown in figs 8 a 5 and a 6 as the reynolds number increases to 600 l f of the cruciform cylinders slightly decreases to 2 5d and that of the isolated cylinder increases to 1 4d with further increasing reynolds number the values of l f for the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder change insignificantly this downstream shift of the near wall vortex means that the spanwise cylinder of the cruciform cylinders is little affected by the kármán vortex street and the viv of the cruciform cylinders is suppressed to find out the reason of the near wake vortex shift the streamlines in the wake region behind the end of the cruciform cylinders at re 300 and 600 are tracked as shown in fig 9 and the streamlines in the wake region behind the end of the isolated cylinder are also presented observations of streamlines show that the wake vortices of the cruciform cylinders are seriously affected by three dimensional spanwise flow caused by the intersection center while the three dimensional effect of the isolated cylinder is insignificant for the cruciform cylinders the flow passing the intersection center reverses in the downstream region and rejoins at the rear of the center when the recirculating flow reaches the rear surface of the cruciform cylinders its flow direction turns towards the downstream region respectively along four spanwise directions of the cruciform cylinders forming four pairs of up flows under the action of the up flows the near wall vortices of the spanwise cylinders are entrained away from the structural surface 3 1 2 the effect of the blockage ratio to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio b r on the wake flow of the cruciform cylinders the three dimensional iso surfaces of the mean x component velocity u x 0 for b r ranging from 0 0975 to 0 360 at re 1000 in g2 are shown in fig 10 the results indicate that the average flow field around the cruciform cylinders maintains orthogonal symmetric for various blockage ratios while there is a significant change in the wake vortex formation at the high blockage ratio b r 0 360 fig 10 a the formation of the kármán vortex at the rear of the spanwise cylinder disappears and most flows in the near wake region are forced to recirculate in downstream of intersection center with the decreasing blockage ratio the longitudinal length of the recirculation region gradually decreases and the formation of the kármán vortex begins to appear outside 3d off the center however fig 10 c shows that the length of the vortex formation in the wake of the spanwise cylinder varies along the spanwise direction indicating that the wake flows of the spanwise cylinder is affected by the central recirculation flow when the blockage ratio is 0 190 the vortex formation of the spanwise cylinder stabilizes and three wake regions the kármán vortex the recirculation and the transition region can be distinguished as the blockage ratio further decreases to 0 0975 the recirculation and the transition regions change little while the size of the vortex formation decreases from 3 0d off the center to the end in spanwise direction it indicates that at the low blockage ratio the effect of the up flow caused by the intersection center weakens and the wake vortex at the end of the cruciform cylinders will be similar to that of the isolated cylinder to investigate the effect of the blockage on the near wall vortex shedding the contours of the vorticity at z axis end of the cruciform cylinders in g2 for different aspect ratios are presented in fig 11 and the vorticity in the center plane of the isolated cylinder at re 1000 is also shown in fig 11 f for comparison the results of the cruciform cylinders show that when the aspect ratio is l d 5 the strongly recirculating flow caused by the high blockage drives the shear layer to the sides of the cylinder the separated opposite vortex pair rejoins at about 5d downstream of the cylinder and then sheds towards downstream with the increasing aspect ratio the vortex formation at the cylinder end increases and the shear layer in the wake of the cylinder gradually converges to the wake line and in turns the vortex shedding point moves towards the rear surface of the cylinder however the vortex formation region at the end of the cruciform cylinders with l d 10 is still much longer than that of the isolated cylinder indicating that the effect of the intersection center on the spanwise cylinder cannot be ignored when the aspect ratio is as large as l d 20 the spanwise flow caused by the intersection center becomes insignificant at the end of the cruciform cylinders and the wake formation at the end of the cruciform cylinders becomes similar to that of the isolated cylinder 3 2 pressure and force 3 2 1 pressure distribution the effect of the reynolds number on pressure distributions around the cruciform cylinders is investigated the semi circumference variations of the pressure coefficient c p of the cruciform cylinders in g1 at different z axis positions are shown in fig 12 due to the average flow field around the cruciform cylinders is ortho symmetric pressure distributions in other spanwise directions are similar to that in fig 12 for a comparison with the isolated cylinder the pressure coefficient distributions on the isolated cylinder are plotted by the red dashed line the results indicate that the stagnation pressure coefficient c p s of the cruciform cylinders changes little for different positions and is generally larger than that of the isolated cylinder in the tested reynolds range however there is a relatively large difference in the base pressure coefficient c p b for different positions of the cruciform cylinders which c p b decreases with the increasing distance from the intersection center this variation of the base pressure indicates that the wake flow near the intersection center is more sluggish than that at the ends of the cruciform cylinders in addition it is found that the effect of the intersecting center on pressure distributions is remarkable within the range of z 3 0 d the pressure coefficient along circumferential direction in the sectional plane located at z 0 5 d is largest with the increasing distance from z 0 5d to z 3 0d the zero pressure point c p 0 moves forward while the negative pressure inflection point the separation point moves backward along circumferential direction when z is beyond 3 0d the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface changes insignificantly this suggests that the boundary layer separation from the cylinder surface near the intersection center z 3 0 d occurs earlier than that at the ends of the cylinders z 3 0 d which is consistent with the change in the wake region fig 7 to further investigate the influence of the intersecting cylinders on the stagnation pressure a comparison of c p s between the intersection cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different reynolds numbers is presented fig 13 indicates that the stagnation pressure coefficients c p s of the isolated cylinder simulated in this study corresponds well with the prediction of c p s 1 8 r e proposed by grove et al 1964 correlation coefficient r 0 996 however c p s of the cruciform cylinders is much larger than that of the isolated cylinder it can be explained as that the existence of the intersection center increases the blockage of the spanwise cylinder and thus the positive pressure on the front surface also increases as the reynolds number increases the influence scope of the intersection center decreases as mentioned in section 3 1 1 inducing that the distinction of the stagnation pressure coefficient between the cruciform cylinders and the single cylinder decreases from 15 6 at re 300 to 9 9 at re 1200 when reynolds number is beyond 1200 the c p s of the intersection cylinder does not change with the reynolds number and it maintains around c p s 1 1 after fitting the results the formula of c p s 1 1 18 r e is proposed in this study to predict the stagnation pressure coefficient of the intersecting cylinders for 300 re 1800 the base pressure coefficient c p b distributions in the base line 5 z d 5 of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are plotted in fig 14 the results show that at low reynolds number of re 300 the profile of the base pressure coefficient distribution displays a unique curve with two peaks symmetrical about the central plane and the peaks appear at z 0 3 d with the increasing distance off the center in the range of 0 3 z d 2 4 the effect of the central recirculation flow decreases and the c p b gradually decreases for z d 2 4 the wake flow transforms from the recirculation region to the kármán vortex region and c p b on the cruciform cylinders gradually increases when reynolds number increases to 600 two peaks of c p b are replaced by one peak at the point of z d 0 and the width of the peak reduce to 3 6d z d 1 8 however the effect of the recirculation flow on the kármán vortex region still exists and there is an increase of c p b near the end of the cruciform cylinders until the reynolds number is beyond 1000 the variation of c p b along the spanwise direction is limited in the range of z d 3 0 when the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the change in the c p b distribution along the spanwise direction is insignificant for various reynolds numbers in addition the variation of c p b from the center to the cylinder end gives a good evidence of the existence of the up flow along the spanwise direction to investigate the effect of the blockage on the pressure distributions of the cruciform cylinders the semi circumference variations of the pressure coefficient at the end of the cruciform cylinders in g2 are shown in fig 15 it is found that the pressure on the surface of the spanwise cylinder strongly depends on the blockage ratio at the high blockage b r 0 750 the range of positive pressure on the cylinder surface is α 60⁰ and the inflection point of the negative pressure corresponding to the separation angle occurs at α 146⁰ as the blockage ratio decreases from 0 750 to 0 305 the value of the pressure on the spanwise cylinder rapidly decreases meanwhile the zero pressure point and the separation point moves forward to α 35⁰ and 110⁰ respectively when the blockage ratio is below 0 305 the variation of the pressure on the spanwise cylinder with the blockage ratio is insignificant and the pressure distribution becomes similar to that of the isolated cylinder fig 16 shows the variations of the base pressure coefficient of the cruciform cylinders along the spanwise direction for different blockage ratios it is found that the behaviors of the cruciform cylinders can be divided into three patterns for different blockage ratios at the high blockage ratio ranging from 0 750 to 0 438 the base pressure of the cruciform cylinders slightly fluctuates along the spanwise direction in such blockage ratio range the behavior of the cruciform cylinders in flow is the orthogonal solid pattern which most of inflow is forced to surround the intersection center forming an ortho symmetry recirculation bubble and no kármán vortex shedding occurs at the spanwise cylinder when the blockage ratio is 0 360 the base pressure coefficient at z 0 relatively increases and a one peak waveform appears in the spanwise distribution of the base pressures according to the wake flow observation in sec 3 2 2 the transition region from the recirculation flow to the kármán vortex shedding appears near the end of the spanwise cylinder indicating the cylindrical feature of the cruciform cylinders begins to emerge in 0 190 b r 0 360 the relative deviation between the base pressure at the center and the end of the cruciform cylinders increases with the decreasing blockage ratio and the base pressure near the end becomes steady gradually named the mixed pattern due to effect of the up flow the viv of the cruciform cylinders caused by the kármán vortex shedding is suppressed when the blockage ratio is as small as 0 0975 the edges of the recirculation region and the transition region locate at 2d and 3d off the center respectively and fig 16 h shows that the base pressure of spanwise cylinder decreases along the spanwise direction in the range of 3 z d 5 8 indicating the up flow gradually weakens for z 5 8d the base pressure maintains constant and its value is close to that of the isolated cylinder it indicates that at such blockage the effect of the intersection center on the wake flow of the cruciform cylinders is limited and the cylindrical characteristic dominated the behavior of the cruciform cylinders named cylinder dominated pattern 3 2 2 hydrodynamic force the time histories of the drag coefficient c d and the lift coefficient c l of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are shown in fig 17 due to the symmetric flow field the lift coefficients of the cruciform cylinders in the z axis and y axis are similar and the y component of force coefficient is used to analyze the lift coefficient c l in this study the results show that the calculated time is long enough to obtain the steady time history of the force coefficients of the cruciform cylinders the fluctuation of c d of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 2 8 of the average drag coefficient for 300 re 1800 indicating that the kármán vortex shedding of the spanwise cylinder has little influence on the c d the fluctuation of the lift coefficient remains at a small value the average oscillation amplitude is lower than 0 0318 according to the spectrum of c l see fig 17 c the peaks in the lift force time history for re 300 1800 are found to be st 0 22 0 25 the variations of c l and st of the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder for different reynolds number are shown in fig 18 it is found that c l of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 0 019 for re 1800 which is approximately one twentieth of that of the isolated cylinder however the st of the cruciform cylinders is generally 15 8 larger than that of the isolated cylinder it is due to the existence of the intersection center increases the blockage effect on the spanwise cylinder and in turns an increase of the strouhal number the results give a good evidence of that the cruciform cylinders can effectively reduce the oscillation amplitude of the lift force caused by the kármán vortex shedding to investigate the variation of the lift fluctuation along the cylinder axis c l s of the cruciform cylinders with b r 0 190 in the positive z axis for different reynolds numbers are shown in fig 19 it is found that c l s of the cruciform cylinders approximately remains a small value c l s 0 025 within 1 0 d from the intersection center for different reynolds numbers with the increasing distance from the center c l s slightly reduces and the minimum of c l s occurs at the outer boundary of the recirculation region see fig 7 and then c l s gradually increases along the cylinder axis and reaches its maximum at the end of cylinder z d 5 however the value of c l s at z d 5 is still more than 6 times smaller than the lift coefficient of a single cylinder see fig 18 a indicating that the lift fluctuation caused by the kármán vortex shedding is significantly reduced even at ends of the cruciform cylinders fig 19 also indicates that c l s of the cruciform cylinders increases with the increasing reynolds number when the reynolds number is beyond 1500 the distribution of c l s along the cylinder axis changes little with the reynolds number to investigate the frequency of the lift fluctuation along the cylinder axis the frequency of the sectional lift coefficient for the z axis cylinder at re 300 and 600 are calculated by the fft transform contours of the amplitude of c l in the z st plane at a re 300 and b re 600 are shown in fig 20 in fig 20 the outer boundary of the recirculation region and the inner boundary of the karman vortex region are marked by the blue and red dot dash lines respectively and strouhal numbers of the total lift coefficient of the cruciform cylinder at re 300 and 600 are plotted by the black dash line it is found that although st of the total lift coefficient is equal to the vortex shedding of spanwise cylinders the lift fluctuation in the recirculation region is maintained in low frequency st 0 13 only in the kármán vortex region the lift fluctuation is dominated by the vortex shedding of the spanwise cylinders and the frequency of the sectional lift coefficient is equal to the frequency of the vortex shedding this indicates that oscillation of the total lift coefficient is mainly caused by the parts of the cruciform cylinders in the kármán vortex region to investigate the effect of the blockage ratio on the lift fluctuation the variations of c l and st of the cruciform cylinders in g2 are shown in fig 21 the results show that due to different behavior patterns of the cruciform cylinders with various blocking ratio the lift fluctuation expresses different characteristics for the orthogonal solid pattern b r 0 360 the c l and st of the cruciform cylinders are close to zero with the decreasing blockage ratio the behavior of the cruciform cylinders transforms to the mixed pattern inducing an increase of strouhal number however due to the effect of the up flow the c l changes insignificant and maintains around 0 01 when the blockage ratio is 0 210 the strouhal number suddenly increases to 0 2467 indicating the behavior of the cruciform cylinders is entering the cylinder dominated pattern with the further decreasing blockage ratio the c l gradually increases and the st decreases at b r 0 0975 the strouhal number of the cruciform cylinders is consistent with that of the isolated cylinder and the c l is about a quarter of that of the isolated cylinder to investigate the effect of the reynolds number on c d of the cruciform cylinders the mean drag coefficients c d of the cruciform cylinders in g1 are shown in fig 22 and the mean drag coefficients of the isolated cylinder calculated in present study are also plotted for a comparison the results indicate that the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is larger than that of the isolated cylinder and the difference between them reduces from 7 21 to 3 21 with the increasing reynolds number to investigate the difference of c d between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder the mean sectional drag coefficients c d s of the cruciform cylinders in the positive z axis are shown in fig 23 it is found that the c d s in the kármán vortex region is similar to c d of the isolated cylinder see fig 22 while there is an increase of the c d s in the recirculation region and transition region this induces that c d of the cruciform cylinders is larger than that of the isolated cylinder with the increasing reynolds number the spanwise size of the recirculation and the transition region reduces and the c d s in the transition region becomes similar to that in the kármán vortex region when the reynolds number is beyond 1200 the distribution of c d s of the cruciform cylinders changes little with the reynolds number and the difference of c d between the cruciform cylinders and the isolated cylinder maintains around 3 21 in general the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is little however the mean drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders strongly depends on the blockage ratio fig 24 shows the variation of the c d of the cruciform cylinders in g2 and the c d of the isolated cylinder at re 1000 are plotted by the blue dashed line according to the behavior patterns of the cruciform cylinders in flow the variation of the c d for different blockage ratios can be divided into three corresponding stages and these stages can be expressed by a piecewise function given as follows 18 c d 0 985 b r 1 072 c y l i n d e r d o m i n a t e d s t a g e b r 0 19 14 267 b r 2 2 741 b r 1 263 m i x e d s t a g e 0 19 b r 0 36 0 820 1 b r 2 161 o r t h o g o n a l s o l i d s t a g e 0 36 b r 0 75 for the cylinder dominated stage b r 0 19 the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders grows linearly with the blockage ratio however due to the small growth gradient the c d of the cruciform cylinders maintains close to that of the isolated cylinder in the mixed stage 0 19 b r 0 36 the influence of the intersection center increases with the increasing blockage ratio and more flows are forced to recirculate in the wake it induces that the c d of the cruciform cylinders increases with the square of the blockage ratio in the orthogonal solid stage 0 36 b r 0 75 the cylinder characteristic of the cruciform cylinders disappears and the flow past the cruciform cylinders can be considered as the narrow gap flow according to the continuity equation the velocity of the cross flow around the cruciform cylinders can be roughly estimated as u 1 b r and thus the c d of the cruciform cylinders is assumed to be a power function of the void ratio 1 b r in this stage after fitting calculated results the c d of the cruciform cylinders is determined as eq 18 with the correlation coefficient beyond 0 99 4 conclusions numerical simulations of the flow past the cruciform cylinders with the aspect ratio of 10 are conducted for the subcritical reynolds number ranging from 300 to 1800 the effects of the reynolds number and the blockage ratio on the vortex shedding pattern and the force coefficients are comprehensively analyzed the main conclusions are summarized as follows i it is found that when the flows pass through the cruciform cylinders with l d 10 a three dimensional recirculating flow is created in the wake region of the intersection center this recirculation flow induces the up flow along the spanwise direction which suppresses the viv of the cruciform cylinders caused by the kármán vortex shedding with the increasing reynolds number the size of the recirculation region slightly decreases however the influence of the kármán vortex shedding remains insignificant ii the behavior of the cruciform cylinders in flow strongly depends on the blockage ratio and it can be classified into three patterns the cylinder dominated pattern the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern in the orthogonal solid pattern 0 36 b r 0 75 almost all flows are forced to surround the intersection center and there is only the recirculation region in the wake of the cruciform cylinders when the cruciform cylinders is in the mixed pattern 0 19 b r 0 36 a narrow transition region appears outside of the recirculation indicating the cylindrical character of the cruciform cylinders emerges with the decreasing blockage ratio in this pattern the kármán vortex formation region grows however the kármán vortex shedding at the end of the cylinder is still affected by the up flow in the cylinder dominated pattern 0 0975 b r 0 19 the effect of the intersection center is limited within 3 d off the center and the up flow weakens along the spanwise direction when the spanwise distance off the center is beyond 5 8 d the wake vortex of the spanwise cylinder is little affected by the up flow and consistent with that of the isolated cylinder iii it is found that for the mixed pattern and the orthogonal solid pattern c l of the cruciform cylinders maintains close to zero at b r 0 19 c l of the cruciform cylinders is not more than 0 019 for re 1800 which is about one twentieth of that of the isolated cylinder as the blockage ratio decreases to 0 0975 the c l of the cruciform cylinders increases to a quarter of that for the isolated cylinder however for the mixed pattern the strouhal number increases with the decreasing blockage ratio and a sudden rise of st occurs at b r 0 210 with the further decreasing blockage ratio the st of the cruciform cylinders gradually decreases to the same value as that of the isolated cylinder iv the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of the cruciform cylinders is small while the effect of the blockage ratio on the drag coefficient is strong for the cylinder dominated pattern c d of the cruciform cylinders increases linearly with the increasing blockage ratio and the value of c d of the cruciform cylinders in this pattern remains close to that of the isolated cylinder at b r 0 19 c d of the cruciform cylinders becomes larger than that of the isolated cylinder and this difference decreases with the increasing reynolds number with further increasing blockage ratio the growth gradient of c d of the cruciform cylinders increases a piecewise function is proposed to estimate c d of the cruciform cylinders for different behavior patterns here credit authorship contribution statement ming fu tang software data curation writing original draft writing original draft

21197,in this study a numerical analysis technique was developed to simulate the collision between level ice and a rigid structure the traditional drucker prager plasticity model was combined with damage mechanics to simulate the material behavior of ice and linked with the element erosion technique to analyze the fracture behavior of level ice colliding with the structure to consider the fluid force acting on broken ice flakes both hydrostatic pressure and drag force were considered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique a numerical analysis of the four point bending test was performed and the results were compared with the experimental results obtained by the in situ bending test the proposed analysis technique was applied to the level ice structure interaction problem and the ice resistance experienced by the moving structure was numerically calculated the ice resistances acting on the rigid structure under several different forward speeds were obtained and compared with the model test results moreover the level ice fracture pattern which depended on the forward speed of the structure was investigated keywords finite element method level ice drucker prager element erosion damage mechanics ice resistance pressure penetration 1 introduction according to a report from the us geological survey usgs 22 of the world s undiscovered oil and gas reserves are in the arctic ocean moreover with the melting of sea ice in the arctic ocean because of the increase in temperature induced by global warming various arctic routes have been newly pioneered and the duration of navigations in the north pole has also increased throughout the year as a consequence of the paradoxical benefit of global warming the potential of resource development and transportation route shortening in the arctic region has increased accordingly the countries along the arctic ocean are actively promoting resource development and route utilization in the arctic region in line with this trend some coastal countries of the arctic are planning to export liquefied natural gas lng to northeast asia via ice breaking lng carriers and to have such ships built by major shipbuilders this trend which is related to the rapid changes in the arctic has led to an increase in the demand for ships and offshore platforms operating in the region moreover in view of the necessity of the sound design of related structures the importance of arctic engineering is increasing unlike ships and offshore platforms operating in open seas vessels operating in the arctic environment are directly exposed to the risk of collision with various forms of sea ice accordingly from the perspective of reliable structural design for the arctic environment the estimation of ice loads caused by sea ice collision with the structure is crucial in this regard various methods such as experimental numerical and analytical techniques have been employed each with its own advantages and disadvantages the experimental method refers to an approach of estimating ice loads by performing a model test in an ice tank the method also includes the full scale measurement of ice loads acting on structures operating in the arctic region considering the stochastic nature of ice loads full scale measurement is the most reliable approach for ice load estimation compared with the other methods however it is not easy to implement because of the considerable time and cost it demands accordingly the implementation of a scale model test in an ice tank is an attractive alternative but with certain drawbacks in addition to the time and cost that this model test entails the ice size and thickness which depend on the ice tank capacity are also limited in contrast the numerical and analytical methods are satisfactory alternatives to the experimental approach because the problems related to the full scale measurement of loads can be overcome in line with this considerable effort has been devoted to conducting research using either the numerical or analytical method lindqvist 1989 developed a simple analytical model through which ice resistance of a ship navigating through level ice can be estimated wedge shaped bow was considered in this model and total ice resistance was divided into crushing breaking and submersion one each of which is calculated based on ice thickness ice strength and friction riska et al 1997 derived empirical formula for ice resistance acting on a ship the formula is based upon the full scale measurement data obtained from a number of ships navigating through baltic sea spencer and jones 2001 proposed ice resistance prediction model which is derived after dividing total ice resistance into four categories i e open water resistance ice buoyancy resistance ice clearing resistance and ice breaking resistance they calculated ice breaking resistance by subtracting ice resistance of pre sawn ice condition from total ice resistance sawamura et al 2010 developed a numerical method to calculate ice load navigating through the level ice a 3 dof motion equation was applied for ship motion and a circle contact algorithm was used to detect contact between the hull and level ice during continuous breaking process ice breaking force was separately calculated using finite element methods consider interaction effect between ice and surrounding fluids lubbad and løset 2011 detected the real time contact between a moving structure and level ice the ice loads resulting from different ice failure modes were semi analytically calculated in the time domain they also calculated the collision between structures and level ice in the time domain by introducing certain assumptions such as the shape of broken ice as wedges breaking length as a constant value and the number of cracks as random variables within a certain range these assumptions are advantageous to real time simulation because they can reduce the computational cost required for analysis however in using these assumptions the question of whether the simulation appropriately reflects the interaction between the ice and structure arises many researchers have attempted the use of the numerical approach because it can more realistically simulate the interaction between the structure and level ice to accurately analyze this interaction both crushing and continuous bending failures have to be precisely simulated for this purpose researchers have tested many numerical schemes such as the finite element method fem discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and moving particle semi implicit mps method lu 2014 and lu et al 2014 performed finite element analysis using cohesive elements to calculate the ice load acting on conical structures colliding with level ice a special energy dissipation mechanism was introduced to ensure the stability of the numerical solution and the random spatial distribution of material properties was considered to eliminate the mesh size dependency of the bending failure of level ice li et al 2020 applied the extended finite element method xfem to estimate the ice load acting at the midship section of a turning arctic vessel in addition an artificial neural network inference system was established based on the analysis results under various conditions daley et al 2014 simulated the ice load acting on an arctic vessel navigating through a pack ice region they utilized massive parallel programming on a gpu enabled workstation to obtain the statistical distribution of the ice load faster than the real time kim and kim 2019 a used the fem to calculate the ice load acting on a ship passing through an ice floe region and applied it to the fatigue analysis induced by the fluctuating ice load they considered both drag and buoyance forces acting on the floating ice floes and introduced pressure penetration relationship for the efficient simulation of local crushing behavior they also tried to shorten the analysis time by introducing the periodic media analysis technique to ensure the efficiency of the long term simulation required for extracting the ice load statistics ren et al 2020 performed a simulation by applying the particle based mps method to calculate the ice load sustained by wedge type vessels breaking through level ice in addition various studies have been conducted to calculate the ice load acting on structures using particle methods such as sph and dem zhang et al 2017 long et al 2020 lu et al 2012a b simulated the fracture of wedge shaped level ice colliding with the conical structure by applying the xfem dem and fem and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each method from the perspective of accuracy and efficiency in this study the finite element analysis procedure with element erosion techniques based on damage mechanics was developed to accurately simulate continuous ice breaking which is the most important physics in ice load estimation the element erosion technique is widely used in many engineering fields to simulate material failure and may be employed to adequately simulate continuous ice failure to achieve this goal the damage based drucker prager model implemented in abaqus a commercial finite element program was used the simulation of fluid forces acting on broken ice flakes was realized via surface and body forces which were implemented using a user subroutine to verify the validity of the proposed numerical method the four point bending test by kujala et al 1990 was simulated using the proposed method and the results were compared with experimental data to examine the adequacy of the analysis procedure material property and fracture model finally the model tests performed by lubbad and løset 2011 to investigate the ice resistance of the conical structure cutting through thin level ice were analyzed the calculated ice resistance was compared with the model test results 2 theoretical background 2 1 failure of level ice ice fractures are known to appear in various forms depending on the shape of the structure the relative velocity of the structure and level ice the ice thickness etc in general the collision of level ice with sloped structures first causes local crushing failure in the area where the structure and ice come into contact after the structure has penetrated the level ice through progressive crushing failures a vertical load acts on the ice causing it to bend out of plane which results in a sequential out of plane bending failure in the radial and circumferential directions the schematic of the generation mechanism of radial and circumferential cracks caused by the out of plane bending of level ice colliding with inclined structures is shown in fig 1 the crack in the radial direction is first caused by the downward vertical load resulting in the division of level ice into two or three wedges in the local area with the downward vertical load still acting the segmented wedges subsequently experience cracks in the circumferential direction and finally undergo a secondary bending fracture bending failure is a fracture phenomenon occurring at a relatively large length scale hence an element based numerical analysis may be easily used to assess the bending failure by applying a sufficiently small element size compared with the fracture length however in the case of crushing failure the situation is extremely different the use of finite sized elements for the analysis is difficult because the failure process occurs continuously at a minute length scale for the crushing failure analysis at the small length scale the well known pressure area relationship is widely used lubbad and løset 2011 2 2 drucker prager plasticity model the material properties of ice are determined by various factors such as temperature salinity crystallinity porosity and stress triaxiality ice tends to exhibit a ductile behavior it hardens after reaching the yield strain at a low strain rate it also exhibits a brittle behavior and rapidly softens after yielding at a high strain rate the typical strain rate dependency of the stress strain relationship of ice is shown in fig 2 a ice also exhibits different failure behaviors depending on the three dimensional stress state that it is exposed to as shown in fig 2 b the higher the degree of confinement i e high stress triaxiality the greater the failure stress this characteristic naturally suggests the use of the drucker prager plasticity model for ice failure simulation the yield surface of the mises hill plasticity model where the strain energy induced by the deviatoric stress is considered as the basis for yielding is a cylinder in the three dimensional principal stress space accordingly the yielding of the material is independent of hydrostatic stress in contrast the drucker prager plasticity model incorporates the effect of hydrostatic pressure into the mises hill model the former is known to be suitable for materials whose yield behavior is affected by hydrostatic stress hence it well suits materials such as soil rock and ice the yield surface of the drucker prager plasticity model which is a function of hydrostatic stress p equivalent stress q friction angle β and cohesion d is shown in eq 1 below the friction angle and cohesion are material properties that can be obtained through a triaxial compression test of the material 1 f q p t a n β d the hydrostatic stress and equivalent stress are defined as follows 2 p 1 3 t r a c e σ q 3 2 s s 3 j 2 where σ is the stress tensor s is the stress deviator defined as σ p i j 2 is the second stress invariant the hardening behavior after the yielding of the drucker prager model can be obtained through a uniaxial material test it is generally defined by the relationship between the stress acting on the material and the plastic strain that the material experiences to attain the brittle behavior of ice after yielding the damage mechanics model was introduced forcing the material to rapidly lose its load carrying capacity for this the original hardening behavior of the drucker prager model of undamaged material was modified by introducing a damage index 2 3 damage mechanics model damage such as micro cavities or cracks which occur during material deformation reduces the area of the section that can resist the load it results in a stiffness degradation of the material and a reduction in its load carrying capacity ultimately leading to material failure the continuum damage mechanics model originally proposed by kachanov 1967 defines the reduction ratio of cross sections within the material as a single state variable called damage through which the material failure is to be simulated the stress experienced by the damaged material may be categorized as follows true stress induced by area reduction σ in fig 3 and apparent stress area reduction neglected σ in fig 3 a conceptual representation of the true and apparent stresses sustained by the damaged material nho et al 1992 is shown in fig 3 to simulate the damage behavior of materials it is necessary to define the damage initiation criterion and its evolution law which define the material behavior from the start of damage to the point of complete failure in this study the damage is assumed to initiate when the equivalent plastic strain ε p l in the material reaches a certain critical value which is defined as the equivalent damage initiation plastic strain ε o p l before this damage initiation point is reached the damage index d is assumed to be 0 as the load continues to increase the damage evolves as the plastic strain further develops in the material and the damage index similarly increases both the true stress σ and young s modulus are assumed to decrease depending on the absolute magnitude of the damage index at the end of the damage evolution i e when the equivalent plastic strain reaches the failure strain ε f p l the material completely loses its load carrying capacity and the damage index becomes 1 the schematic of this damage evolution process is illustrated in fig 4 during the damage evolution process the true stress and young s modulus drop depending on the damage level that the material experiences the relationship between the true and apparent quantities is given by the following 3 σ 1 d σ e 1 d e o although the damage index evolution may be defined in various ways in this study the energy concept was used as the basis for its definition the fracture energy g f is defined as the work done by the external load during the damage evolution process hence it may be defined as the area below the stress plastic strain curve for the unique relationship between the fracture energy and damage evolution process the damage is assumed to evolve proportionally to the equivalent plastic strain as follows 4 d a ε p l ε f p l where a is the proportionality coefficient the fracture energy which corresponds to the area below the stress plastic strain curve can be estimated by 5 g f ε o p l ε f p l σ d ε p l the fracture energy can be evaluated by combining eqs 4 and 5 as given by 6 g f σ y o ε f p l 2 where σ y o is the stress at the location where damage initiates once the damage index value reaches 1 the corresponding element is excluded from the analysis to simulate cracks 2 4 buoyancy and drag the level ice that collides with the structure is broken into small pieces or ice flakes which slide down to the lower part of the inclined structure and generate a resistance against buoyancy on the structure to determine this resistance induced by the ice flakes hydrostatic pressure was applied to the free surface of finite elements comprising the ice flakes using a user subroutine eq 7 represents the hydrostatic pressure acting on the submerged ice flakes the hydrostatic pressure applied to the surface of all ice flake elements that are below the water line level is given by 7 p s t a t i c ρ w g y y 0 0 y 0 where ρ w is water density g is the gravitational acceleration y is the vertical coordinate y 0 corresponds to the water line it is necessary to apply buoyancy to the newly exposed element faces after the adjacent elements erode because the proposed analysis method uses an element erosion technique in which elements are removed to implement the fracture behavior of ice to this end the hydrostatic pressure was applied to the surface of all elements as shown in fig 5 a this allows the hydrostatic pressure to act on all internal element faces in the opposite direction such that the pressures acting on those faces shared by adjacent elements cancel each other if the elements are eroded because of failure as shown in fig 5 b the hydrostatic pressure only continues to act on the newly exposed element faces left figure in fig 5 shows hydrostatic pressure acting on the outer surface of ice block and right figure shows transparent view under same situation which demonstrates that the hydrostatic pressure is acting on the shared element face in opposite direction the ice flakes detached from the level ice after the bending failure are subjected to hydrodynamic drag force because of their relative velocity with respect to the surrounding seawater they experience rotational motion with large accelerations because of the release of elastic energy during the elastic deformation before the bending failure occurs however they tend to have relatively low acceleration as they slide on the structure surface into the water consequently the flakes moving below the water surface are dominated by the viscosity induced drag force mainly because of their relative velocity with respect to the stationary water in this study the rayleigh damping model was applied to approximate the drag force acting on the ice flakes eq 8 is the governing finite element equation with the inclusion of rayleigh damping which is given in the form of mass proportional damping the explicit fem uses the lumped mass approach thus m and α m are both diagonal matrices this implies that α m functions as a damping on rigid bodies which are the broken ice flakes in this case 8 m x α m x k x f where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively f and x are the nodal external force and displacement vector respectively α is the rayleigh damping factor the damping factor has to be determined empirically because the fluid forces acting on the ice flakes are idealized by the rayleigh damping model 2 5 macroscopic crushing model in the early stage particularly when the structure collides with the level ice high pressure develops on a small contact area resulting in the local crushing failure of ice this failure occurs within an area whose length scale is extremely small making it considerably difficult to accurately simulate the crushing failure in the large length scale analysis designed for global ice load estimation to overcome this problem a macroscopic modeling technique was applied to simulate the crushing fractures occurring in the small length scale by allowing the local penetration of the structure into the surface of intact ice lu et al 2012a b kim and kim 2019 b the schematic of the crushing failure that occurs at the early stage of the ice structure contact representing the edge of level ice falling off because of the local high pressure acting on the small contact area is shown in fig 6 a the numerical analysis using finite sized elements indicates the extinction of elements exposed to localized high pressures fig 6 b resulting in a brief interval during which the structure is free to move without resistance from ice this is a phenomenon caused by the relatively large element size compared to the length scale in the crushing failure and may be avoided if an extremely fine mesh is applied however the use of a fine mesh size in the global ice load estimation would never be a practical approach because of the excessively large computational burden involved fig 6 c indicates that this problem can be overcome using the macroscopic modeling technique by allowing the structure to penetrate the level ice the macro modeling of crushing failure can be defined by the pressure penetration relationship between the two surfaces in contact generally the maximum pressure produced by the contact is considered as the breaking strength of the ice material the schematic of an example of the pressure penetration relationship where the critical contact pressure p c does not exceed the compressive strength of the ice is shown in fig 7 it is reasonable to set the critical penetration δ c to be the length of the element near the contact area until the pressure penetration relationship reaches point δ c p c the pressure may be modeled to increase linearly as in a or exponentially as in b as shown in the figure this relationship may be determined based on the data obtained experimentally or empirically in this study exponentially increasing pressure penetration curve i e curve b was selected this pressure penetration relationship does not stand on very concrete mechanical background hence needs to be explored more in detail especially to have connections with experimentally observed phenomenon i e pressure area relationship 3 application to four point bending test 3 1 analysis model to verify the validity of the numerical method presented in this paper the numerical simulation of the four point bending test performed by kujala et al 1990 was implemented and the adequacy of the proposed numerical method including the material and fracture models was verified kujala et al 1990 conducted the four point bending test in the field to measure the strength of sea ice in the gulf of finland the shape of the loading rig used for this test at the site is shown in fig 8 the two upper support points at both ends of the ice test piece are fixed in space and the load is applied to the ice specimen when the two lower supports located below the specimen move upward the gap between the two upper support points is 2 m and that between the two lower support points is 1 m as the test proceeds the load acting on the test piece and the displacement at the center of the test piece are measured five tests were performed to check repeatability the ice specimen used for the four point bending test is 4 325 m long and has a square cross section with a height and width of 0 4 m the finite element model for the four point bending test is shown in fig 9 the element used for the ice specimen is an eight node hexahedra with a reduced integration its average size is 0 04 m the upper and lower supports were meshed with discrete rigid elements and the total number of elements used was approximately 30 000 to prevent the penetration of mating surfaces the contact condition was applied between the supports and ice specimen moreover to push the ice specimen upward at a given constant speed 0 00275 m s a forced displacement was imposed on the lower supports the material properties for simulating the behavior of the ice test specimen are summarized in table 1 the material properties associated with the undamaged drucker prager yield conditions are reproduced from zhang et al 2017 wherein numerical simulation of the four point bending test was successfully performed the properties of the damaged material were chosen in such a manner that the simulation reproduced the rapid drop in the load carrying capacity after yielding occurred as listed in table 1 damage initiation strain is set to be arbitrarily small so that fracture takes place right after the material reaches yield point which reflects brittle nature of ice material fracture energy is also set to be small and 7 5 j m 2 is approximately derived value based on the softening curve presented in zhang et al 2017 3 2 analysis results the distribution of the damage sustained by the ice specimen during the four point bending simulation is shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the damage initially starts from the upper middle part of the ice specimen that is exposed to the hydrostatic tension stress this phenomenon is induced by the smaller radius of the drucker prager yield surface when the hydrostatic tension stress is present as the load increases the damaged region gradually expands in the direction of specimen thickness eventually the damage index value in the upper area of the lower support point reaches 1 leading to the erosion of elements in that region crack initiation and propagation occur simultaneously in the upper areas of the two lower support points because of the complete symmetry of the numerical model this pattern is also observed in the analysis results of zhang et al 2017 the time histories of the loads obtained from the numerical analysis experimental data and the simulation results obtained by kujala et al 1990 are compared in fig 11 the figure clearly shows that the loads tend to increase linearly over time and then suddenly drop at approximately 0 5 s when the cracks rapidly propagate through the ice specimen thickness this is the typical behavior of brittle materials the foregoing confirms that the load time history given by the present numerical analysis corresponds well with the average result of the five experiments of kujala et al 1990 4 level ice structure interaction analysis 4 1 finite element model the shapes and main dimensions of the colliding conical structure and level ice are shown in fig 12 this was the test model in the basin test performed by lubbad and løset 2011 in the hamburg ship model basin the height and upper and lower diameters of the conical structure are 9 08 16 95 and 7 7 m respectively the thickness width and length of the level ice are 0 33 40 and 100 m respectively the actual dimensions of the level ice were greater than these however considering the efficiency of the numerical computation a smaller size was used in the analysis the initial vertical position of the level ice is set to match the position where the diameter of the conical structure is 13 24 m and subject to both gravitational acceleration and buoyancy the finite element model applied to the analysis is shown in fig 13 the conical structure was meshed with rigid shell elements and the level ice with six node wedge elements the two wedge elements were arranged in the thickness direction and a relatively small mesh size with an average length of 0 3 m was used throughout the entire central region of the level ice where fracture was mainly expected to occur the total number of elements and nodes used in the analysis were 125 268 and 95 053 respectively except in the vertical direction the rear end of the level ice denoted by a was fully constrained to prevent the ice from drifting back as a result of the collision with the conical structure the symmetric condition was applied along the side edges denoted by b and c the conical structure traveled through the level ice with prescribed constant velocities of 0 128 0 317 0 633 0 791 0 949 and 1 202 m s the pressure penetration relationship described in the earlier section was applied between the conical structure and level ice to achieve the local crushing failure the self contact condition was also imposed on the entire element comprising the level ice this self contact condition enables the collision among the broken ice flakes as well as that between the unbroken level ice and broken ice flakes the same pressure penetration relationship was applied to the self contact condition the critical contact pressure was set to 1 mpa and the critical penetration was set to 0 4 m table 2 summarizes the material properties which are based on the values in lubbad and løset 2011 and are applied to the analysis the damage related material properties were set to be the same as those in the four point bending simulation two different damping coefficients were used in the analysis to determine their influence because of the uncertainties related to the rayleigh damping model damping coefficient of 3 and 5 were used in the analysis and are determined empirically frictions among contacting bodies were not taken into account in the analysis 4 2 analysis results the continuous ice breaking process during the level ice structure collision when the forward speed of the structure is 0 791 m s and damping coefficient is 5 is shown in fig 14 based on the detailed investigation of the local failure behavior of ice the fracture process of level ice was observed as following the five steps listed below step 1 during the early stage of level ice structure contact local crushing failure is initiated via the penetration of the structure into the level ice edge step 2 as the penetration load increases radial cracks develop because of the out of plane bending and several cantilever plates form in the radial direction step 3 circumferential cracks develop because of bending and wedge shaped or curved trapezoid shaped ice flakes are generated step 4 the ice flakes rotate because of the release of elastic strain energy and collide with the conical structure at the end of rotation step 5 the ice flakes slide along the surface of the conical structure down into the water and finally drift to both sides of the conical structure the fracture patterns of level ice at the initial contact and continuous breaking stages are shown in fig 15 during the initial contact stage a single radial crack along the centerline of level ice develops and the subsequent downward vertical load from the structure forces the development of two circumferential cracks eventually this generates two quarter circle shaped ice flakes the fracture pattern slightly changes when the ice breaking process reaches a steady state as shown in fig 15 b as the structure comes into contact with the rounded free edge of level ice two or three radial cracks develop generating several curved trapezoid shaped cantilever plates as the structure moves further forward circumferential cracks develop and broken ice flakes are generated the formation of radial and circumferential cracks during the continuous breaking stage is extremely stochastic this is because the broken ice flakes in the previous contact are stuck between the structure and level ice causing the contact to be highly irregular this fracture pattern is typically observed when the level ice collides with an ice breaker with a sloped bow as shown in fig 16 the time histories of the global ice load of the moving conical structure with respect to the forward speed when α is 5 are shown in fig 17 global ice load is directly picked at the reference point through which rigid body motion of cone structure is controlled local ice load is extracted based on the contact pressure between ice material and cone structure and it is calculated based upon pressure penetration relationship during the penetration stage of the structure into the level ice the average global ice load tends to increase gradually over time once it reaches the steady state the average ice load also remains at a certain level for all cases the global ice load fluctuates with a certain minimum magnitude which is considered to be induced by the buoyancy acting on the submerged broken ice flakes the global ice load fluctuation may be ascribed to the continuous bending failure occurring around the perimeter of the conical structure the minimum global ice load and fluctuation range tend to increase as the speed of the structure increases as clearly shown in fig 17 a f this indicates that average global ice load increases with the speed of the structure to observe the temporal characteristics of the global ice load in detail a zoomed in view of its time histories between 40 and 60 s is presented in fig 18 when the forward speed is 0 128 m s the ice load gradually increases over time and then rapidly drops once it reaches a certain level this pattern is repeated and may be attributed to the ice load build up because of the penetration of the structure into the level ice edges and the elastic deformation of level ice until cracks form in both radial and circumferential directions the repetition of this saw tooth pattern is presumed to be induced by the multiple collisions of the structure with the newly formed free edges of level ice a similar pattern in global ice load fluctuation is also observed when the structure speed increases it is noteworthy that the period of ice peaks tends to decrease with this increase this is because the time spent for the structure to reach the newly generated free edges of level ice decreases moreover the size of broken ice flakes becomes smaller as the speed of the structure increases in contrast the fluctuation range and minimum level of global ice load tend to increase with speed as shown in fig 17 the minimum level of global ice load is considered to be mainly induced by the drag forces acting on the submerged ice flakes touching the structure surface therefore this drag force causes the tendency of the minimum level of global ice load to increase with speed the increasing tendency of the fluctuation range of the global ice load can be attributed to the dynamic effect of the bending failure of level ice during the bending failure triggered by the circumferential crack the distance from the free edge to the circumferential crack decreases because of the inertia effect and the critical load required for the bending failure increases accordingly the local ice load time histories for different forward speed cases which are given in terms of the local contact pressure on the outer surface of the conical structure are shown in fig 19 unlike the global ice load the peaks are well separated along the time axis each peak is considered to be induced by the contact between the conical structure and level ice fig 19 well demonstrates that the interval between adjacent peaks tends to decrease as the forward speed increases because of the shorter travel time between two consecutive contacts further with the increase in the forward speed the ice flake size becomes smaller the peaks do not exhibit any significant difference however the average local ice load increases with the increase in speed because of the shorter peak intervals the average local ice load distribution and probability of contact along the perimeter of the conical structure near the water line are shown in fig 20 the location was measured using the angle from the forepeak to the left side of the conical structure corresponding to 0 and 90 respectively the local ice load time histories were extracted along the perimeter and averaged throughout the entire time span the calculated average local ice loads were normalized by the case with 0 and 1 202 m s the number of local ice load peaks at each location was extracted from the local ice load time histories and was assumed to match the number of contacts between the structure and level ice in terms of the probability of contact between the structure and level ice fig 20 clearly demonstrates that the difference among the forward speeds is negligible it was observed that more contacts occurred at the forepeak of the cone i e 0 and gradually decreased toward the side of the cone it is noteworthy that the circumferential distribution of the average local ice load generally well follows the contact probability distribution however the correspondence becomes weak when the forward speed is low it is presumed that a longer simulation time is required to achieve more reliable statistical analysis results to further conduct a detailed investigation of the local ice load spatial distribution this load does not include the drag induced load acting on the submerged ice flakes and may therefore be regarded as a bending induced local ice load fig 20 clearly demonstrates that the bending induced global ice load which is the summation of the local ice loads increases as the forward speed of the structure increases the shapes of broken ice flakes considered for all forward speeds are shown in fig 21 even though the flakes are extremely irregular in form their general shape is a wedge or curved trapezoid irregular shapes of broken ice flakes may have something to do with numerical noise which is inevitable when explicit code is applied one important factor that influences this randomness is brittle nature of ice material model used in this simulation which is numerically very sensitive an important observation on the shape of broken ice flakes is that their size decreases as the structure speed increases as discussed earlier this is caused by the dynamic effects that occur during the level ice bending failure this tendency was also reported in the full scale measurement and numerical simulation varsta 1983 lubbad et al 2008 sawamura 2010 lu et al 2012a b to quantitatively assess the size of ice flakes with respect to the change in the forward speed of the cone structure the size of individual ice flakes in the radial direction was measured by visual inspection fig 22 shows how the sizes of broken ice flakes for two different forward speed cases was measured by inspection the lines in the radial direction were placed on top of the fracture patterns obtained by the numerical simulation and the probability distribution of ice flake sizes was derived the discrete probability distributions of ice flake sizes for all forward speed cases are shown in fig 23 indicating that the standard deviation tends to decrease as the forward speed increases this also leads to the conclusion that the average ice flake size decreases as the forward speed increases which has been qualitatively discussed based on fig 21 fig 24 shows the variation in the average ice flake size with respect to the forward speed of the cone structure at three average ranges all upper 30 and upper 10 the average ice flake size trend with respect to the forward speed did not exhibit any significant difference among the three average ranges clearly showing the decreasing trend with the increase in forward speed the comparison of the global mean ice load sustained by the cone structure between the numerical analysis and experiment of lubbad and løset 2011 is shown in fig 25 two different rayleigh damping coefficients were used in the numerical analysis resulting in different global mean ice load curves the global mean ice load was found to increase proportionally with the increase in forward speed as expected the different damping coefficients led to different slopes it is extremely difficult to definitively identify the source of the deviation between the numerical analysis results and experimental data however the approximation of the hydrodynamic load acting on the broken ice flakes may have an important effect to improve the accuracy of the numerical analysis results especially with respect to certain dynamic effects that occur during the rotation stage of broken ice flakes triggered by the release of elastic energy a more accurate modeling of the hydrodynamic load acting on the flakes is necessary during the rotation stage of broken ice flakes there may be very complicated dynamic action of fluids surrounding the ice flakes such as ventilation effect of fluids together with added mass effect both of which were not considered in this study this dynamic effect must be more distinct when the forward speed of the cone structure is high in which case the effects of the dynamic motion of the ice flakes and surrounding fluid are considerable there potentially might have been mesh size dependency on the analysis results and this needs to be discussed with care in this study the mesh size was chosen in such a way that element size is far smaller than the average broken ice flake size in which case stress calculation for bending failure might have been done in successfully way from crack initiation point of view but once crack forms stress singularity takes place and stress near the crack tip cannot be captured without specially designed fe model e g singularity element along crack tip or cohesive model etc this is important for crack propagation phase it may be argued that crack propagation phase is less important than crack initiation in case of ice fracture due to its brittle nature what is more important is whether this coarse mesh can capture crack path correctly which seems to be achieved in satisfactory way in the analysis however this needs to be clarified and further studies are required on this direct numerical analysis carried out in this study has some pros and cons compared to the existing other direct analysis method and semi analytic method semi analytic method enables one to simulate ship level ice interaction problem in real time scale leading to the application to onboard advisory system or arctic vessel simulator however semi analytic approach introduces some assumptions such as the shape of broken ice flakes number of wedges breaking length etc reasonable estimation of these parameters is necessary and some of them are empirically determined on the contrary current numerical simulation is direct analysis method where those assumptions are not necessary even though direct analysis takes times and material parameters are difficult to set up it will give us chance to have some insight into the nature of ice breaking process which is good for harmonization of both approaches 5 conclusions in this study a numerical analysis technique was proposed using a damage based erosion model to investigate the interaction phenomenon between level ice and a moving conical structure the proposed numerical method was validated by applying it to the four point bending test performed by kujala et al 1990 the applicability of the method was also verified through the analysis of the collision behavior between level ice and the moving conical structure the following are some of the conclusions derived from this research a material model combining the drucker prager plasticity and damage based erosion model was proposed to simulate the fracture behavior of sea ice a hardening behavior was achieved when the undamaged drucker prager material model was modified by introducing the damage mechanics concept with this modification the rapid loss in the load carrying capacity was properly simulated and the typical brittle behavior of ice was immediately exhibited after the initial yielding to simulate the fluid forces acting on the broken ice flakes the hydrostatic pressure and drag force were applied to all elements comprising the level ice using a user subroutine particular consideration was given to the hydrostatic pressure model through which the buoyancy force could remain active on newly created ice faces after the erosion of adjacent ice elements the contact condition using a special pressure penetration relationship was applied to efficiently model the crushing failure of ice from a macroscopic perspective it was suggested that the critical pressure should not be allowed to exceed the compressive strength of the ice material and the critical penetration should be determined based on the size of the finite element near the contact area to validate the proposed numerical analysis technique a simulation of the four point bending test conducted in full scale at the site was implemented and the results were compared with those of the experiment the time history of the load obtained by the proposed analysis technique exhibited an acceptable correspondence with the experimental results the global ice loads acting downward on the conical structure colliding with the level ice were analyzed using the proposed analysis technique and the results were compared with those of the model test the proposed numerical method was observed to be capable of simulating the formation of radial and circumferential crack patterns in the level ice moreover the global ice load tended to increase with the forward speed of the cone structure the number of contacts along the cone structure perimeter induced by the collision with the free edge of level ice tended to decrease at a position away from the cone structure forepeak this tendency did not change with the change in forward speed of the structure the local mean ice load also followed this trend however the tendency became extremely low when the forward speed was low the size of broken ice flakes was found to decrease as the forward speed of the cone structure increased fully agreeing with the full scale measurements and other numerical analysis results the ice flake size was quantitatively assessed through visual inspection confirming the decreasing trend of the average ice flake size with the increase in the forward speed the global ice loads obtained by the numerical analysis using two different rayleigh damping coefficients exhibited linearly increasing trends with respect to the forward speed of the cone structure the two curves were found to approximate the experimental data with some deviations the deviation between the numerical analysis results and experimental data may have been induced by the complicated hydrodynamic action occurring during the ice flake rotation stage

21197,in this study a numerical analysis technique was developed to simulate the collision between level ice and a rigid structure the traditional drucker prager plasticity model was combined with

problem and the ice resistance experienced by the moving structure was numerically calculated the ice resistances acting on the rigid structure under several different forward speeds were obtained and compared with the model test results moreover the level ice fracture pattern which depended on the forward speed of the structure was investigated keywords finite element method level ice drucker prager element erosion damage mechanics ice resistance pressure penetration 1 introduction according to a report from the us geological survey usgs 22 of the world s undiscovered oil and gas reserves are in the arctic ocean moreover with the melting of sea ice in the arctic ocean because of the increase in temperature induced by global warming various arctic routes have been newly pioneered and the duration of navigations in the north pole has also increased throughout the year as a consequence of the paradoxical benefit of global warming the potential of resource development and transportation route shortening in the arctic region has increased accordingly the countries along the arctic ocean are actively promoting resource development and route utilization in the arctic region in line with this trend some coastal countries of the arctic are planning to export liquefied natural gas lng to northeast asia via ice breaking lng carriers and to have such ships built by major shipbuilders this trend which is related to the rapid changes in the arctic has led to an increase in the demand for ships and offshore platforms operating in the region moreover in view of the necessity of the sound design of related structures the importance of arctic engineering is increasing unlike ships and offshore platforms operating in open seas vessels operating in the arctic environment are directly exposed to the risk of collision with various forms of sea ice accordingly from the perspective of reliable structural design for the arctic environment the estimation of ice loads caused by sea ice collision with the structure is crucial in this regard various methods such as experimental numerical and analytical techniques have been employed each with its own advantages and disadvantages the experimental method refers to an approach of estimating ice loads by performing a model test in an ice tank the method also includes the full scale measurement of ice loads acting on structures operating in the arctic region considering the stochastic nature of ice loads full scale measurement is the most reliable approach for ice load estimation compared with the other methods however it is not easy to implement because of the considerable time and cost it demands accordingly the implementation of a scale model test in an ice tank is an attractive alternative but with certain drawbacks in addition to the time and cost that this model test entails the ice size and thickness which depend on the ice tank capacity are also limited in contrast the numerical and analytical methods are satisfactory alternatives to the experimental approach because the problems related to the full scale measurement of loads can be overcome in line with this considerable effort has been devoted to conducting research using either the numerical or analytical method lindqvist 1989 developed a simple analytical model through which ice resistance of a ship navigating through level ice can be estimated wedge shaped bow was considered in this model and total ice resistance was divided into crushing breaking and submersion one each of which is calculated based on ice thickness ice strength and friction riska et al 1997 derived empirical formula for ice resistance acting on a ship the formula is based upon the full scale measurement data obtained from a number of ships navigating through baltic sea spencer and jones 2001 proposed ice resistance prediction model which is derived after dividing total ice resistance into four categories i e open water resistance ice buoyancy resistance ice clearing resistance and ice breaking resistance they calculated ice breaking resistance by subtracting ice resistance of pre sawn ice condition from total ice resistance sawamura et al 2010 developed a numerical method to calculate ice load navigating through the level ice a 3 dof motion equation was applied for ship motion and a circle contact algorithm was used to detect contact between the hull and level ice during continuous breaking process ice breaking force was separately calculated using finite element methods consider interaction effect between ice and surrounding fluids lubbad and løset 2011 detected the real time contact between a moving structure and level ice the ice loads resulting from different ice failure modes were semi analytically calculated in the time domain they also calculated the collision between structures and level ice in the time domain by introducing certain assumptions such as the shape of broken ice as wedges breaking length as a constant value and the number of cracks as random variables within a certain range these assumptions are advantageous to real time simulation because they can reduce the computational cost required for analysis however in using these assumptions the question of whether the simulation appropriately reflects the interaction between the ice and structure arises many researchers have attempted the use of the numerical approach because it can more realistically simulate the interaction between the structure and level ice to accurately analyze this interaction both crushing and continuous bending failures have to be precisely simulated for this purpose researchers have tested many numerical schemes such as the finite element method fem discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and moving particle semi implicit mps method lu 2014 and lu et al 2014 performed finite element analysis using cohesive elements to calculate the ice load acting on conical structures colliding with level ice a special energy dissipation mechanism was introduced to ensure the stability of the numerical solution and the random spatial distribution of material properties was considered to eliminate the mesh size dependency of the bending failure of level ice li et al 2020 applied the extended finite element method xfem to estimate the ice load acting at the midship section of a turning arctic vessel in addition an artificial neural network inference system was established based on the analysis results under various conditions daley et al 2014 simulated the ice load acting on an arctic vessel navigating through a pack ice region they utilized massive parallel programming on a gpu enabled workstation to obtain the statistical distribution of the ice load faster than the real time kim and kim 2019 a used the fem to calculate the ice load acting on a ship passing through an ice floe region and applied it to the fatigue analysis induced by the fluctuating ice load they considered both drag and buoyance forces acting on the floating ice floes and introduced pressure penetration relationship for the efficient simulation of local crushing behavior they also tried to shorten the analysis time by introducing the periodic media analysis technique to ensure the efficiency of the long term simulation required for extracting the ice load statistics ren et al 2020 performed a simulation by applying the particle based mps method to calculate the ice load sustained by wedge type vessels breaking through level ice in addition various studies have been conducted to calculate the ice load acting on structures using particle methods such as sph and dem zhang et al 2017 long et al 2020 lu et al 2012a b simulated the fracture of wedge shaped level ice colliding with the conical structure by applying the xfem dem and fem and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each method from the perspective of accuracy and efficiency in this study the finite element analysis procedure with element erosion techniques based on damage mechanics was developed to accurately simulate continuous ice breaking which is the most important physics in ice load estimation the element erosion technique is widely used in many engineering fields to simulate material failure and may be employed to adequately simulate continuous ice failure to achieve this goal the damage based drucker prager model implemented in abaqus a commercial finite element program was used the simulation of fluid forces acting on broken ice flakes was realized via surface and body forces which were implemented using a user subroutine to verify the validity of the proposed numerical method the four point bending test by kujala et al 1990 was simulated using the proposed method and the results were compared with experimental data to examine the adequacy of the analysis procedure material property and fracture model finally the model tests performed by lubbad and løset 2011 to investigate the ice resistance of the conical structure cutting through thin level ice were analyzed the calculated ice resistance was compared with the model test results 2 theoretical background 2 1 failure of level ice ice fractures are known to appear in various forms depending on the shape of the structure the relative velocity of the structure and level ice the ice thickness etc in general the collision of level ice with sloped structures first causes local crushing failure in the area where the structure and ice come into contact after the structure has penetrated the level ice through progressive crushing failures a vertical load acts on the ice causing it to bend out of plane which results in a sequential out of plane bending failure in the radial and circumferential directions the schematic of the generation mechanism of radial and circumferential cracks caused by the out of plane bending of level ice colliding with inclined structures is shown in fig 1 the crack in the radial direction is first caused by the downward vertical load resulting in the division of level ice into two or three wedges in the local area with the downward vertical load still acting the segmented wedges subsequently experience cracks in the circumferential direction and finally undergo a secondary bending fracture bending failure is a fracture phenomenon occurring at a relatively large length scale hence an element based numerical analysis may be easily used to assess the bending failure by applying a sufficiently small element size compared with the fracture length however in the case of crushing failure the situation is extremely different the use of finite sized elements for the analysis is difficult because the failure process occurs continuously at a minute length scale for the crushing failure analysis at the small length scale the well known pressure area relationship is widely used lubbad and løset 2011 2 2 drucker prager plasticity model the material properties of ice are determined by various factors such as temperature salinity crystallinity porosity and stress triaxiality ice tends to exhibit a ductile behavior it hardens after reaching the yield strain at a low strain rate it also exhibits a brittle behavior and rapidly softens after yielding at a high strain rate the typical strain rate dependency of the stress strain relationship of ice is shown in fig 2 a ice also exhibits different failure behaviors depending on the three dimensional stress state that it is exposed to as shown in fig 2 b the higher the degree of confinement i e high stress triaxiality the greater the failure stress this characteristic naturally suggests the use of the drucker prager plasticity model for ice failure simulation the yield surface of the mises hill plasticity model where the strain energy induced by the deviatoric stress is considered as the basis for yielding is a cylinder in the three dimensional principal stress space accordingly the yielding of the material is independent of hydrostatic stress in contrast the drucker prager plasticity model incorporates the effect of hydrostatic pressure into the mises hill model the former is known to be suitable for materials whose yield behavior is affected by hydrostatic stress hence it well suits materials such as soil rock and ice the yield surface of the drucker prager plasticity model which is a function of hydrostatic stress p equivalent stress q friction angle β and cohesion d is shown in eq 1 below the friction angle and cohesion are material properties that can be obtained through a triaxial compression test of the material 1 f q p t a n β d the hydrostatic stress and equivalent stress are defined as follows 2 p 1 3 t r a c e σ q 3 2 s s 3 j 2 where σ is the stress tensor s is the stress deviator defined as σ p i j 2 is the second stress invariant the hardening behavior after the yielding of the drucker prager model can be obtained through a uniaxial material test it is generally defined by the relationship between the stress acting on the material and the plastic strain that the material experiences to attain the brittle behavior of ice after yielding the damage mechanics model was introduced forcing the material to rapidly lose its load carrying capacity for this the original hardening behavior of the drucker prager model of undamaged material was modified by introducing a damage index 2 3 damage mechanics model damage such as micro cavities or cracks which occur during material deformation reduces the area of the section that can resist the load it results in a stiffness degradation of the material and a reduction in its load carrying capacity ultimately leading to material failure the continuum damage mechanics model originally proposed by kachanov 1967 defines the reduction ratio of cross sections within the material as a single state variable called damage through which the material failure is to be simulated the stress experienced by the damaged material may be categorized as follows true stress induced by area reduction σ in fig 3 and apparent stress area reduction neglected σ in fig 3 a conceptual representation of the true and apparent stresses sustained by the damaged material nho et al 1992 is shown in fig 3 to simulate the damage behavior of materials it is necessary to define the damage initiation criterion and its evolution law which define the material behavior from the start of damage to the point of complete failure in this study the damage is assumed to initiate when the equivalent plastic strain ε p l in the material reaches a certain critical value which is defined as the equivalent damage initiation plastic strain ε o p l before this damage initiation point is reached the damage index d is assumed to be 0 as the load continues to increase the damage evolves as the plastic strain further develops in the material and the damage index similarly increases both the true stress σ and young s modulus are assumed to decrease depending on the absolute magnitude of the damage index at the end of the damage evolution i e when the equivalent plastic strain reaches the failure strain ε f p l the material completely loses its load carrying capacity and the damage index becomes 1 the schematic of this damage evolution process is illustrated in fig 4 during the damage evolution process the true stress and young s modulus drop depending on the damage level that the material experiences the relationship between the true and apparent quantities is given by the following 3 σ 1 d σ e 1 d e o although the damage index evolution may be defined in various ways in this study the energy concept was used as the basis for its definition the fracture energy g f is defined as the work done by the external load during the damage evolution process hence it may be defined as the area below the stress plastic strain curve for the unique relationship between the fracture energy and damage evolution process the damage is assumed to evolve proportionally to the equivalent plastic strain as follows 4 d a ε p l ε f p l where a is the proportionality coefficient the fracture energy which corresponds to the area below the stress plastic strain curve can be estimated by 5 g f ε o p l ε f p l σ d ε p l the fracture energy can be evaluated by combining eqs 4 and 5 as given by 6 g f σ y o ε f p l 2 where σ y o is the stress at the location where damage initiates once the damage index value reaches 1 the corresponding element is excluded from the analysis to simulate cracks 2 4 buoyancy and drag the level ice that collides with the structure is broken into small pieces or ice flakes which slide down to the lower part of the inclined structure and generate a resistance against buoyancy on the structure to determine this resistance induced by the ice flakes hydrostatic pressure was applied to the free surface of finite elements comprising the ice flakes using a user subroutine eq 7 represents the hydrostatic pressure acting on the submerged ice flakes the hydrostatic pressure applied to the surface of all ice flake elements that are below the water line level is given by 7 p s t a t i c ρ w g y y 0 0 y 0 where ρ w is water density g is the gravitational acceleration y is the vertical coordinate y 0 corresponds to the water line it is necessary to apply buoyancy to the newly exposed element faces after the adjacent elements erode because the proposed analysis method uses an element erosion technique in which elements are removed to implement the fracture behavior of ice to this end the hydrostatic pressure was applied to the surface of all elements as shown in fig 5 a this allows the hydrostatic pressure to act on all internal element faces in the opposite direction such that the pressures acting on those faces shared by adjacent elements cancel each other if the elements are eroded because of failure as shown in fig 5 b the hydrostatic pressure only continues to act on the newly exposed element faces left figure in fig 5 shows hydrostatic pressure acting on the outer surface of ice block and right figure shows transparent view under same situation which demonstrates that the hydrostatic pressure is acting on the shared element face in opposite direction the ice flakes detached from the level ice after the bending failure are subjected to hydrodynamic drag force because of their relative velocity with respect to the surrounding seawater they experience rotational motion with large accelerations because of the release of elastic energy during the elastic deformation before the bending failure occurs however they tend to have relatively low acceleration as they slide on the structure surface into the water consequently the flakes moving below the water surface are dominated by the viscosity induced drag force mainly because of their relative velocity with respect to the stationary water in this study the rayleigh damping model was applied to approximate the drag force acting on the ice flakes eq 8 is the governing finite element equation with the inclusion of rayleigh damping which is given in the form of mass proportional damping the explicit fem uses the lumped mass approach thus m and α m are both diagonal matrices this implies that α m functions as a damping on rigid bodies which are the broken ice flakes in this case 8 m x α m x k x f where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively f and x are the nodal external force and displacement vector respectively α is the rayleigh damping factor the damping factor has to be determined empirically because the fluid forces acting on the ice flakes are idealized by the rayleigh damping model 2 5 macroscopic crushing model in the early stage particularly when the structure collides with the level ice high pressure develops on a small contact area resulting in the local crushing failure of ice this failure occurs within an area whose length scale is extremely small making it considerably difficult to accurately simulate the crushing failure in the large length scale analysis designed for global ice load estimation to overcome this problem a macroscopic modeling technique was applied to simulate the crushing fractures occurring in the small length scale by allowing the local penetration of the structure into the surface of intact ice lu et al 2012a b kim and kim 2019 b the schematic of the crushing failure that occurs at the early stage of the ice structure contact representing the edge of level ice falling off because of the local high pressure acting on the small contact area is shown in fig 6 a the numerical analysis using finite sized elements indicates the extinction of elements exposed to localized high pressures fig 6 b resulting in a brief interval during which the structure is free to move without resistance from ice this is a phenomenon caused by the relatively large element size compared to the length scale in the crushing failure and may be avoided if an extremely fine mesh is applied however the use of a fine mesh size in the global ice load estimation would never be a practical approach because of the excessively large computational burden involved fig 6 c indicates that this problem can be overcome using the macroscopic modeling technique by allowing the structure to penetrate the level ice the macro modeling of crushing failure can be defined by the pressure penetration relationship between the two surfaces in contact generally the maximum pressure produced by the contact is considered as the breaking strength of the ice material the schematic of an example of the pressure penetration relationship where the critical contact pressure p c does not exceed the compressive strength of the ice is shown in fig 7 it is reasonable to set the critical penetration δ c to be the length of the element near the contact area until the pressure penetration relationship reaches point δ c p c the pressure may be modeled to increase linearly as in a or exponentially as in b as shown in the figure this relationship may be determined based on the data obtained experimentally or empirically in this study exponentially increasing pressure penetration curve i e curve b was selected this pressure penetration relationship does not stand on very concrete mechanical background hence needs to be explored more in detail especially to have connections with experimentally observed phenomenon i e pressure area relationship 3 application to four point bending test 3 1 analysis model to verify the validity of the numerical method presented in this paper the numerical simulation of the four point bending test performed by kujala et al 1990 was implemented and the adequacy of the proposed numerical method including the material and fracture models was verified kujala et al 1990 conducted the four point bending test in the field to measure the strength of sea ice in the gulf of finland the shape of the loading rig used for this test at the site is shown in fig 8 the two upper support points at both ends of the ice test piece are fixed in space and the load is applied to the ice specimen when the two lower supports located below the specimen move upward the gap between the two upper support points is 2 m and that between the two lower support points is 1 m as the test proceeds the load acting on the test piece and the displacement at the center of the test piece are measured five tests were performed to check repeatability the ice specimen used for the four point bending test is 4 325 m long and has a square cross section with a height and width of 0 4 m the finite element model for the four point bending test is shown in fig 9 the element used for the ice specimen is an eight node hexahedra with a reduced integration its average size is 0 04 m the upper and lower supports were meshed with discrete rigid elements and the total number of elements used was approximately 30 000 to prevent the penetration of mating surfaces the contact condition was applied between the supports and ice specimen moreover to push the ice specimen upward at a given constant speed 0 00275 m s a forced displacement was imposed on the lower supports the material properties for simulating the behavior of the ice test specimen are summarized in table 1 the material properties associated with the undamaged drucker prager yield conditions are reproduced from zhang et al 2017 wherein numerical simulation of the four point bending test was successfully performed the properties of the damaged material were chosen in such a manner that the simulation reproduced the rapid drop in the load carrying capacity after yielding occurred as listed in table 1 damage initiation strain is set to be arbitrarily small so that fracture takes place right after the material reaches yield point which reflects brittle nature of ice material fracture energy is also set to be small and 7 5 j m 2 is approximately derived value based on the softening curve presented in zhang et al 2017 3 2 analysis results the distribution of the damage sustained by the ice specimen during the four point bending simulation is shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the damage initially starts from the upper middle part of the ice specimen that is exposed to the hydrostatic tension stress this phenomenon is induced by the smaller radius of the drucker prager yield surface when the hydrostatic tension stress is present as the load increases the damaged region gradually expands in the direction of specimen thickness eventually the damage index value in the upper area of the lower support point reaches 1 leading to the erosion of elements in that region crack initiation and propagation occur simultaneously in the upper areas of the two lower support points because of the complete symmetry of the numerical model this pattern is also observed in the analysis results of zhang et al 2017 the time histories of the loads obtained from the numerical analysis experimental data and the simulation results obtained by kujala et al 1990 are compared in fig 11 the figure clearly shows that the loads tend to increase linearly over time and then suddenly drop at approximately 0 5 s when the cracks rapidly propagate through the ice specimen thickness this is the typical behavior of brittle materials the foregoing confirms that the load time history given by the present numerical analysis corresponds well with the average result of the five experiments of kujala et al 1990 4 level ice structure interaction analysis 4 1 finite element model the shapes and main dimensions of the colliding conical structure and level ice are shown in fig 12 this was the test model in the basin test performed by lubbad and løset 2011 in the hamburg ship model basin the height and upper and lower diameters of the conical structure are 9 08 16 95 and 7 7 m respectively the thickness width and length of the level ice are 0 33 40 and 100 m respectively the actual dimensions of the level ice were greater than these however considering the efficiency of the numerical computation a smaller size was used in the analysis the initial vertical position of the level ice is set to match the position where the diameter of the conical structure is 13 24 m and subject to both gravitational acceleration and buoyancy the finite element model applied to the analysis is shown in fig 13 the conical structure was meshed with rigid shell elements and the level ice with six node wedge elements the two wedge elements were arranged in the thickness direction and a relatively small mesh size with an average length of 0 3 m was used throughout the entire central region of the level ice where fracture was mainly expected to occur the total number of elements and nodes used in the analysis were 125 268 and 95 053 respectively except in the vertical direction the rear end of the level ice denoted by a was fully constrained to prevent the ice from drifting back as a result of the collision with the conical structure the symmetric condition was applied along the side edges denoted by b and c the conical structure traveled through the level ice with prescribed constant velocities of 0 128 0 317 0 633 0 791 0 949 and 1 202 m s the pressure penetration relationship described in the earlier section was applied between the conical structure and level ice to achieve the local crushing failure the self contact condition was also imposed on the entire element comprising the level ice this self contact condition enables the collision among the broken ice flakes as well as that between the unbroken level ice and broken ice flakes the same pressure penetration relationship was applied to the self contact condition the critical contact pressure was set to 1 mpa and the critical penetration was set to 0 4 m table 2 summarizes the material properties which are based on the values in lubbad and løset 2011 and are applied to the analysis the damage related material properties were set to be the same as those in the four point bending simulation two different damping coefficients were used in the analysis to determine their influence because of the uncertainties related to the rayleigh damping model damping coefficient of 3 and 5 were used in the analysis and are determined empirically frictions among contacting bodies were not taken into account in the analysis 4 2 analysis results the continuous ice breaking process during the level ice structure collision when the forward speed of the structure is 0 791 m s and damping coefficient is 5 is shown in fig 14 based on the detailed investigation of the local failure behavior of ice the fracture process of level ice was observed as following the five steps listed below step 1 during the early stage of level ice structure contact local crushing failure is initiated via the penetration of the structure into the level ice edge step 2 as the penetration load increases radial cracks develop because of the out of plane bending and several cantilever plates form in the radial direction step 3 circumferential cracks develop because of bending and wedge shaped or curved trapezoid shaped ice flakes are generated step 4 the ice flakes rotate because of the release of elastic strain energy and collide with the conical structure at the end of rotation step 5 the ice flakes slide along the surface of the conical structure down into the water and finally drift to both sides of the conical structure the fracture patterns of level ice at the initial contact and continuous breaking stages are shown in fig 15 during the initial contact stage a single radial crack along the centerline of level ice develops and the subsequent downward vertical load from the structure forces the development of two circumferential cracks eventually this generates two quarter circle shaped ice flakes the fracture pattern slightly changes when the ice breaking process reaches a steady state as shown in fig 15 b as the structure comes into contact with the rounded free edge of level ice two or three radial cracks develop generating several curved trapezoid shaped cantilever plates as the structure moves further forward circumferential cracks develop and broken ice flakes are generated the formation of radial and circumferential cracks during the continuous breaking stage is extremely stochastic this is because the broken ice flakes in the previous contact are stuck between the structure and level ice causing the contact to be highly irregular this fracture pattern is typically observed when the level ice collides with an ice breaker with a sloped bow as shown in fig 16 the time histories of the global ice load of the moving conical structure with respect to the forward speed when α is 5 are shown in fig 17 global ice load is directly picked at the reference point through which rigid body motion of cone structure is controlled local ice load is extracted based on the contact pressure between ice material and cone structure and it is calculated based upon pressure penetration relationship during the penetration stage of the structure into the level ice the average global ice load tends to increase gradually over time once it reaches the steady state the average ice load also remains at a certain level for all cases the global ice load fluctuates with a certain minimum magnitude which is considered to be induced by the buoyancy acting on the submerged broken ice flakes the global ice load fluctuation may be ascribed to the continuous bending failure occurring around the perimeter of the conical structure the minimum global ice load and fluctuation range tend to increase as the speed of the structure increases as clearly shown in fig 17 a f this indicates that average global ice load increases with the speed of the structure to observe the temporal characteristics of the global ice load in detail a zoomed in view of its time histories between 40 and 60 s is presented in fig 18 when the forward speed is 0 128 m s the ice load gradually increases over time and then rapidly drops once it reaches a certain level this pattern is repeated and may be attributed to the ice load build up because of the penetration of the structure into the level ice edges and the elastic deformation of level ice until cracks form in both radial and circumferential directions the repetition of this saw tooth pattern is presumed to be induced by the multiple collisions of the structure with the newly formed free edges of level ice a similar pattern in global ice load fluctuation is also observed when the structure speed increases it is noteworthy that the period of ice peaks tends to decrease with this increase this is because the time spent for the structure to reach the newly generated free edges of level ice decreases moreover the size of broken ice flakes becomes smaller as the speed of the structure increases in contrast the fluctuation range and minimum level of global ice load tend to increase with speed as shown in fig 17 the minimum level of global ice load is considered to be mainly induced by the drag forces acting on the submerged ice flakes touching the structure surface therefore this drag force causes the tendency of the minimum level of global ice load to increase with speed the increasing tendency of the fluctuation range of the global ice load can be attributed to the dynamic effect of the bending failure of level ice during the bending failure triggered by the circumferential crack the distance from the free edge to the circumferential crack decreases because of the inertia effect and the critical load required for the bending failure increases accordingly the local ice load time histories for different forward speed cases which are given in terms of the local contact pressure on the outer surface of the conical structure are shown in fig 19 unlike the global ice load the peaks are well separated along the time axis each peak is considered to be induced by the contact between the conical structure and level ice fig 19 well demonstrates that the interval between adjacent peaks tends to decrease as the forward speed increases because of the shorter travel time between two consecutive contacts further with the increase in the forward speed the ice flake size becomes smaller the peaks do not exhibit any significant difference however the average local ice load increases with the increase in speed because of the shorter peak intervals the average local ice load distribution and probability of contact along the perimeter of the conical structure near the water line are shown in fig 20 the location was measured using the angle from the forepeak to the left side of the conical structure corresponding to 0 and 90 respectively the local ice load time histories were extracted along the perimeter and averaged throughout the entire time span the calculated average local ice loads were normalized by the case with 0 and 1 202 m s the number of local ice load peaks at each location was extracted from the local ice load time histories and was assumed to match the number of contacts between the structure and level ice in terms of the probability of contact between the structure and level ice fig 20 clearly demonstrates that the difference among the forward speeds is negligible it was observed that more contacts occurred at the forepeak of the cone i e 0 and gradually decreased toward the side of the cone it is noteworthy that the circumferential distribution of the average local ice load generally well follows the contact probability distribution however the correspondence becomes weak when the forward speed is low it is presumed that a longer simulation time is required to achieve more reliable statistical analysis results to further conduct a detailed investigation of the local ice load spatial distribution this load does not include the drag induced load acting on the submerged ice flakes and may therefore be regarded as a bending induced local ice load fig 20 clearly demonstrates that the bending induced global ice load which is the summation of the local ice loads increases as the forward speed of the structure increases the shapes of broken ice flakes considered for all forward speeds are shown in fig 21 even though the flakes are extremely irregular in form their general shape is a wedge or curved trapezoid irregular shapes of broken ice flakes may have something to do with numerical noise which is inevitable when explicit code is applied one important factor that influences this randomness is brittle nature of ice material model used in this simulation which is numerically very sensitive an important observation on the shape of broken ice flakes is that their size decreases as the structure speed increases as discussed earlier this is caused by the dynamic effects that occur during the level ice bending failure this tendency was also reported in the full scale measurement and numerical simulation varsta 1983 lubbad et al 2008 sawamura 2010 lu et al 2012a b to quantitatively assess the size of ice flakes with respect to the change in the forward speed of the cone structure the size of individual ice flakes in the radial direction was measured by visual inspection fig 22 shows how the sizes of broken ice flakes for two different forward speed cases was measured by inspection the lines in the radial direction were placed on top of the fracture patterns obtained by the numerical simulation and the probability distribution of ice flake sizes was derived the discrete probability distributions of ice flake sizes for all forward speed cases are shown in fig 23 indicating that the standard deviation tends to decrease as the forward speed increases this also leads to the conclusion that the average ice flake size decreases as the forward speed increases which has been qualitatively discussed based on fig 21 fig 24 shows the variation in the average ice flake size with respect to the forward speed of the cone structure at three average ranges all upper 30 and upper 10 the average ice flake size trend with respect to the forward speed did not exhibit any significant difference among the three average ranges clearly showing the decreasing trend with the increase in forward speed the comparison of the global mean ice load sustained by the cone structure between the numerical analysis and experiment of lubbad and løset 2011 is shown in fig 25 two different rayleigh damping coefficients were used in the numerical analysis resulting in different global mean ice load curves the global mean ice load was found to increase proportionally with the increase in forward speed as expected the different damping coefficients led to different slopes it is extremely difficult to definitively identify the source of the deviation between the numerical analysis results and experimental data however the approximation of the hydrodynamic load acting on the broken ice flakes may have an important effect to improve the accuracy of the numerical analysis results especially with respect to certain dynamic effects that occur during the rotation stage of broken ice flakes triggered by the release of elastic energy a more accurate modeling of the hydrodynamic load acting on the flakes is necessary during the rotation stage of broken ice flakes there may be very complicated dynamic action of fluids surrounding the ice flakes such as ventilation effect of fluids together with added mass effect both of which were not considered in this study this dynamic effect must be more distinct when the forward speed of the cone structure is high in which case the effects of the dynamic motion of the ice flakes and surrounding fluid are considerable there potentially might have been mesh size dependency on the analysis results and this needs to be discussed with care in this study the mesh size was chosen in such a way that element size is far smaller than the average broken ice flake size in which case stress calculation for bending failure might have been done in successfully way from crack initiation point of view but once crack forms stress singularity takes place and stress near the crack tip cannot be captured without specially designed fe model e g singularity element along crack tip or cohesive model etc this is important for crack propagation phase it may be argued that crack propagation phase is less important than crack initiation in case of ice fracture due to its brittle nature what is more important is whether this coarse mesh can capture crack path correctly which seems to be achieved in satisfactory way in the analysis however this needs to be clarified and further studies are required on this direct numerical analysis carried out in this study has some pros and cons compared to the existing other direct analysis method and semi analytic method semi analytic method enables one to simulate ship level ice interaction problem in real time scale leading to the application to onboard advisory system or arctic vessel simulator however semi analytic approach introduces some assumptions such as the shape of broken ice flakes number of wedges breaking length etc reasonable estimation of these parameters is necessary and some of them are empirically determined on the contrary current numerical simulation is direct analysis method where those assumptions are not necessary even though direct analysis takes times and material parameters are difficult to set up it will give us chance to have some insight into the nature of ice breaking process which is good for harmonization of both approaches 5 conclusions in this study a numerical analysis technique was proposed using a damage based erosion model to investigate the interaction phenomenon between level ice and a moving conical structure the proposed numerical method was validated by applying it to the four point bending test performed by kujala et al 1990 the applicability of the method was also verified through the analysis of the collision behavior between level ice and the moving conical structure the following are some of the conclusions derived from this research a material model combining the drucker prager plasticity and damage based erosion model was proposed to simulate the fracture behavior of sea ice a hardening behavior was achieved when the undamaged drucker prager material model was modified by introducing the damage mechanics concept with this modification the rapid loss in the load carrying capacity was properly simulated and the typical brittle behavior of ice was immediately exhibited after the initial yielding to simulate the fluid forces acting on the broken ice flakes the hydrostatic pressure and drag force were applied to all elements comprising the level ice using a user subroutine particular consideration was given to the hydrostatic pressure model through which the buoyancy force could remain active on newly created ice faces after the erosion of adjacent ice elements the contact condition using a special pressure penetration relationship was applied to efficiently model the crushing failure of ice from a macroscopic perspective it was suggested that the critical pressure should not be allowed to exceed the compressive strength of the ice material and the critical penetration should be determined based on the size of the finite element near the contact area to validate the proposed numerical analysis technique a simulation of the four point bending test conducted in full scale at the site was implemented and the results were compared with those of the experiment the time history of the load obtained by the proposed analysis technique exhibited an acceptable correspondence with the experimental results the global ice loads acting downward on the conical structure colliding with the level ice were analyzed using the proposed analysis technique and the results were compared with those of the model test the proposed numerical method was observed to be capable of simulating the formation of radial and circumferential crack patterns in the level ice moreover the global ice load tended to increase with the forward speed of the cone structure the number of contacts along the cone structure perimeter induced by the collision with the free edge of level ice tended to decrease at a position away from the cone structure forepeak this tendency did not change with the change in forward speed of the structure the local mean ice load also followed this trend however the tendency became extremely low when the forward speed was low the size of broken ice flakes was found to decrease as the forward speed of the cone structure increased fully agreeing with the full scale measurements and other numerical analysis results the ice flake size was quantitatively assessed through visual inspection confirming the decreasing trend of the average ice flake size with the increase in the forward speed the global ice loads obtained by the numerical analysis using two different rayleigh damping coefficients exhibited linearly increasing trends with respect to the forward speed of the cone structure the two curves were found to approximate the experimental data with some deviations the deviation between the numerical analysis results and experimental data may have been induced by the complicated hydrodynamic action occurring during the ice flake rotation stage

21198,in this study the structural torsional behavior of module joints of steel composite hollow reinforced concrete rc for submerged floating tunnels sfts was evaluated experimentally and analytically the proposed precast model for the sft had initial stiffness values similar to those of the continuous model however the maximum torsional moment of the precast model was lower than that of the continuous model the torsional moment capacity of the precast model was evaluated by analytical and experimental studies as well as a parametric study the main parameters included the thickness and connection states of the inner tubes sizes of the shear keys and tensile forces of the prestressed concrete pc tendons among the four parameters the thickness and connection state of the inner tubes had a more dominant influence additionally the sizes of the shear keys influenced the integration of the concrete parts during the design of the sft module joint these effective parameters should be considered for the improvement of the sft structural performance keywords submerged floating tunnel torsional behavior composite experimental study 1 introduction submerged floating tunnels sfts are a novel kind of water spanning structures that cross lakes rivers and seas it is possible to pre fabricate tunnel segments and mooring systems on land and then assemble the entire structure in the target water bodies because the underground excavation of the seabed to immerse tunnels and underwater piers for long span bridges over the sea is not required sfts compared to conventional maritime and underwater transport structures are more advantageous in terms of construction management won and kim 2018 another alternative is a floating bridge floating bridges are transportation systems installed on the water in norway floating pontoon bridge have been constructed for crossing the fjord npra 1994 jang et al 2020 studied static behavior of a floating cable stayed bridge under dead load the floating elements of sfts in water consist of tunnel segments with joints the tunnels are bored inside the ground at the landfalls and connected to fixed end joints as shown in fig 1 they are anchored on the seabed by tension legs the concept of sfts was presented decades ago in norway japan and china however sfts have not been built until now this is because the motion characteristics and performance of the structure under various environmental loads and the ground reaction force at the anchor point in the seabed have not yet been clearly analyzed recently the significance of maritime spatial utilization has become more prominent gathering momentum for the study unlike ordinary land structures floating offshore structures exhibit dynamic characteristics that are sensitive to continuously changing environmental loads such as wind waves and tides several researchers have conducted studies on the dynamic behavior of sfts under major marine environmental loads such as waves tides earthquakes and tsunamis jin and kim 2020 studied tunnel mooring train coupled dynamic analysis for sft also they studied time domain hydro elastic analysis of a sft with mooring lines under extreme wave and seismic excitations jin and kim 2018 jin et al 2020 researched the coupled dynamic analysis of a tension leg type sft using a time domain analysis lin et al 2018 studied the dynamic response analysis of sfts by considering a fluid vehicle tunnel interaction lee et al 2016 evaluated the seismic behavior of sfts with a rectangular cross section yang et al 2017 researched the hydrodynamic response of sfts under random waves xiang et al 2020 studied mechanical behaviors under a local anchor cable failure and carried out an experiment won and kim 2018 studied the feasibility of sfts moored by an inclined tendon system won et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic analysis of a new type of sft with suspension cables although these studies on the global dynamic analyses of the fluid structure have been well advanced there has been no attempt to study the behavior of the tunnel structure in an actual construction to safely operate sfts it is necessary to ensure the structural stability of the tunnels against the continuous environmental load for the sft not only the bending and the shear load are dominant but also the torsional load on the joints which has large potentials when the tension legs supporting the sft are broken or the loads are unevenly applied during construction therefore it is necessary to study a new joint that can improve the continuity by improving the structural weaknesses although there are hardly any actual structures that are subjected to pure torsion only it is necessary to verify the pure torsional behavior which is used to analyze the overall torsional behavior when combined loads are applied on the sft additionally evaluations of the torsional stiffness of continuous reinforced concrete rc beams and buildings as well as torsional failures caused by earthquakes are increasing consequently there is a growing interest in torsion in this study a static pure torsional loading test on module joints was performed based on the cross section of steel composite hollow columns proposed by han et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 a novel module joint type for the sft is proposed in this study the failure modes and torsional behavior characteristics with the connection variables of this joint are experimentally and numerically evaluated 2 hydrodynamic behavior of the sft 2 1 hydrodynamic response characteristics of the sft in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics on members of a tether stabilized sft model were evaluated under different wave loads the abaqus aqua simulia lnc 2020 fe program which has been used in previous studies by won et al 2019 2019 for the time domain fluid structure analysis technique of sfts under regular and irregular waves was used to perform the numerical analysis the proposed analysis model was verified by comparing the analysis results with the experimental results the finite element modeling of the sft was based on prototype designs specifically developed for the jeju strait in south korea a potential site for the installation of an sft the environmental conditions under which the sft is installed are shown in table 1 the water depth is 180 m and the wave height and wave period are considered as 10 85 m and 14 37 s respectively the arbitrary tunnel unit model has a diameter and thickness of 23 m and 1 m respectively and the clearance depth at which the sft is located below the water surface is 60 m the mooring system was designed with inclined tethers to add the necessary horizontal support stiffness the material for the tethers had the properties of api x70 which is commonly used in marine risers the cross section of the tethers has an outer diameter and thickness of 0 553 m and 0 04 m respectively the spacing interval of the tether was 50 m along the length of the tunnel and a total of seven sets were installed for the entire model the sft body was assumed reinforced concrete and the tethers were applied pipe of api x70 elastic modulus of reinforced concrete is 30 gpa poisson ratio is 0 16 and density is 2400 kg m 3 elastic modulus of tether is 210 gpa yield strength is 482 6 mpa ultimate tensile strength is 565 4 mpa and poisson ratio is 0 3 each sft module is assumed to be a continuum fig 3 illustrates the installation concept of the sft this model was designed with inclined tethers on both sides of the tunnel the tunnel has a total length of 300 m in this model the tunnel is considered as straight therefore tethers with an angle are used to restrain the tunnel s horizontal motion the buoyancy to weight ratio bwr considered in the analysis is 1 2 the tunnel and tethers were modeled as a three dimensional beam and truss elements respectively they were connected by the multipoint constraint option mpc considering the tunnel tether connection points all tethers were connected to the seabed and applied as a hinged condition the installation angle of the tethers was 30 against the z axis considering irregular waves in the time domain analysis a linear superimposition method which is a technique using a certain number of regular wave components as random numbers was applied for the wave loads here the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum was used as the wave spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 this spectrum was established based on data collected during jonswap it considered wave interactions for long time durations and distances as nonlinear to improve its measurements a coefficient factor γ was added to the pierson moskowitz spectrum the peak enhancement factor usually has an upper limit of about 7 it was assumed approximately 3 3 in this study it provides some uncertainty to the wave power estimates 1 s j ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 4 5 ω p ω 4 γ r 2 r e x p ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p

respectively this wave condition was applied to the model as a term of the external force of dynamic analysis additionally considering the angle of incidence which is the angle between the propagation direction of the wave front and the sft the motion and resisting capacity of the model were analyzed and the angle varied between 0 20 and 40 to the y axis the results of the hydrodynamic analysis of the sft are as follows the sway and heave of the sft model were plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the sway which is the motion of the sft in the acting direction of the wave had a slight deformation within 0 04 m the heave was initially increased until 1 5 m under the influence of the bwr and deformation occurred slightly based on the raised wave height it was observed that the deformation depending on the angle of incidence rarely occurred and had similar patterns because the tethers support these motions a section moment occurs in the cross section of the sft fig 6 shows an absolute maximum section moment in the x axis which indicates the torsional moment the lowest torsional moment was generated at the landfall of the mooring line where it was fixed and the highest occurred at the center point of tether space because the sft was supported by tethers fig 7 and fig 8 exhibit the section moments of the sft in the y axis and z axis respectively the section moment of the sft had the highest torsional moment value as shown in fig 9 and the lowest moment was at the z axis therefore it was inferred that the torsional moment is one of the most significant design considerations for the sft the largest torsional moment was 1 5 gn m in this analysis therefore it can be deduced that a torsional moment of 15 gn m or more should be exerted when designing the module joint of the sft in consideration of uncertainties such as the wave impact load stress of tendon was investigated maximum stress of tendons was 187 mpa it was less than yield strength of 482 6 mpa 3 proposal and design of joints for the sft 3 1 proposed joints for sft modules the construction procedure for the basic design of sft modules is very important special construction steps are needed for installation in the middle of water in this study the construction procedures presented in fig 10 were proposed considering underwater environmental conditions first foundations such as suction anchors gravity type or pile type are installed on the seabed subsequently tethers are linked to each foundation they are located at target points using buoys for connection with the tunnel modules of the sfts the tunnel modules are produced on land and transported by a tugboat or floating dock ship because they can float by themselves the transported sft module is submerged using cranes in mother vessels it is then connected to the existing module segment between tethers and they are linked to achieve a safe transport system the joints of the sft modules should have good structural performance fig 11 shows a concept design of the sft module joint the structural joint method and function of the water stop are highly significant for the connection of the prefabricated tunnel modules this system has a composite hollow rc section as shown in fig 2 the cross section of the precast model consists of concrete longitudinal reinforcements and an inner tube therefore the connection methods for these three components should be proposed typically the prestressed method including shear keys can be used for connecting reinforced concrete units prefabricated construction procedures should be performed inside the tunnel to connect the sft tunnel modules unlike land structure constructions such as bridges and buildings moreover the post tensioned method uses steel strands and tendons which pass through precast modules in sleeves service loads are applied to connect both sides of the tunnel modules then the arched tendons are pulled tight and anchored against the inside of each module additionally a water stop component is required to prevent water from flowing into the tunnel it consists of gina gaskets and omega seals which are used between the section joint elements of the immersed tunnels it has multiple functions which include the transfer of the hydrostatic load motion forces between each module and high water seals the gina gasket is installed outside the joint and the omega seal is installed inside the empty box as shown in fig 11 after the omega seal is installed inside the empty space it is filled with mortar and reinforcements finally an inner tube is fabricated using bolts and steel plates as noted above joints should have resistance performance against bending shear and torsional forces in this study a suitable shear key against these forces was proposed it has intaglio and emboss shapes as shown in fig 12 this method could increase the resistance performance against the aforementioned external forces 3 2 design of specimen and test program to verify the proposed joint a structural experimental test was performed in reality a lab cannot perfectly produce a real model the experiment was performed under the assumption that the thickness rebar diameter tether diameter and shear key size of the sft specimen were fabricated the produced specimen didn t perfectly simulate the real sft scale in table 1 these hypothesized experimental models provide qualitative information about the reinforced concrete joints presented in this study after verification in section 4 through finite element analysis variable analysis was performed to perform the torsional structural experiment an effective test method should be proposed two loads should act on two points of the model to realize torsional moment hence in this study the test method shown in fig 13 was proposed to evaluate the torsional behavior this test method consists of three parts a loading part a support part and an experiment section further a push over test was conducted to evaluate the torsional behavior two actuators were used for the two loads they created torsional moments and had a capacity of 2000 kn each the loading part was rotated by the two loads the interval of the installed actuators was 1 m the joint experiment section had a total length of 1 m and the joint was located at the center of the specimen the support part was fixed on the floor by prestressed bars the actuators had load cells for measuring each load additionally linear variable displacement transducers were installed at both ends 50 cm from the center line the displacement of each actuator was controlled and its velocity was 0 01 mm s to avoid the dynamic effect fig 14 presents the details of the precast test specimen fig 14 a shows the cross section and shear keys the outer and inner diameters of the tunnel were 840 mm and 391 2 mm respectively the hoop and longitudinal reinforcements consisted of two layers all hoop and longitudinal reinforcements of the second layer had a diameter of 13 mm the longitudinal reinforcements of the first layer were 16 mm in diameter sheath tubes with diameters of 30 mm were installed between the two layers for the pc tendons with diameters of 15 mm the shear keys with emboss and intaglio shapes were six in total reinforcements with a diameter of 3 mm were arranged in the shear keys additionally the thickness of the inner tube was 7 mm fig 14 b exhibits the steel plates bolts and bolt holes to connect the inner tube two steel plates were rounded to fit inside the diameter of the section with the bolt holes the thickness of the steel plates was 7 5 mm one side of the steel plates had 26 bolt holes which were arranged in columns at an interval of 122 9 mm the total number of bolts was 52 high tension m16 bolts were applied to join the steel plates and inner tube nuts were welded on the outside of the inner tube fig 14 c shows the section between the experimental section and support part or loading part the joint between them was reinforced using an h beam to prevent damages further fig 14 d illustrates the arrangement of the reinforcements in the support and loading parts the size of the support part was 1840 mm 1840 mm which was larger than the loading part the thickness of the loading and support parts was 600 mm and reinforcements with diameters of 16 mm were applied subsequently a continuous model was designed as a comparative specimen all components such as the concrete inner tube and longitudinal reinforcements were connected differently from the precast model as shown in fig 15 the hoop reinforcements were arranged at an interval of 100 mm and there were no shear keys a post tension load of 120 kn was applied for an initial compression stress post tensioned concrete was applied in two specimens in bonded post tensioning method tendons were permanently bonded to the sft module by in situ grouting fig 16 shows the fabrication procedure of the specimens which include the precast and continuous specimens for the precast specimen the reinforcements sheath tubes inner tubes and shear keys in the steel molds were first arranged as shown in fig 16 a the concrete was then placed in the mold and the precast units were fabricated including the shear keys as shown in fig 16 b the inner tube of the precast segment unit was connected using high tension bolts before the fabrication of both sides to the loading and support parts as shown in fig 16 c and d after the connection fabrication of the precast segment units the loading and support parts were produced through the assembled mold and h beam arrangement of reinforcements and placing of concrete as shown in fig 16 e finally the specimen was fabricated completely and set in the test laboratory as shown in fig 16 f two actuators connected to the loading and support parts were fixed using prestressed bars on the floor the compressive strength of the concrete was measured by cylindrical concrete specimens in a compression test machine it was calculated from the failure load the average compressive strength of the concrete was 35 1 mpa and the elastic modulus was 34 961 mpa additionally a tensile coupon test of the steel members was performed steel coupons were subjected to tension loads by a universal testing machine the steel members used in this specimen were the inner tubes steel plates reinforcements and pc tendons three samples of each of the test steel coupons were produced the average yield strength and average tensile strength of the steel plates were 439 mpa and 540 mpa respectively and those of the inner tube were 282 mpa and 409 mpa respectively the material properties of the reinforcements were an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 540 mpa and tensile strength of 647 mpa finally the tendons had an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 1700 mpa and tensile strength of 1950 mpa strain gauges were attached to investigate the characteristics of the components as shown in fig 17 concrete strain gauges were attached on the concrete surface at an angle of 45 from the horizontal axis steel strain gauges were attached on the inside and outside of the hoop reinforcements hoop rebars and longitudinal reinforcements vertical rebars as well as the inner tube particularly the steel strain gauges of the reinforcements were attached to both of the precast segment units 3 3 test results based on the test method mentioned in the previous section the experiment was performed on the two specimens from the results the relationship between the torsional moment and torsional angle was deduced as shown in fig 18 the ceb fip model code 1990 proposed idealized trilinear diagram the state 1 is linear elastic and uncracked zone the state 2 is cracked zone the state 3 is plastic conditions experimental results were illustrated each state zone according to this code as shown fig 18 the cracking torsional moment were 500 kn m and 420 kn m respectively in the state 2 elongation of tendons and crushed shear key were occurred here tendons could lose their initial tension because crack of grouting and shear keys finally the state 3 had fully plastic conditions the maximum torsional moments of the continuous and precast models were 1180 kn m and 760 kn m respectively this is because the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided under common conditions which were similar to the prestressed forces of the pc tendons and connected inner tubes the longitudinal reinforcements of 32 each in the continuous model were connected as shown in fig 15 the uniform behavior of the two specimens can be confirmed by the crack patterns shown in fig 19 fig 19 shows the failure state and crack patterns of the two specimens at their ultimate limit state the overall crack patterns were quite similar shear crack patterns were observed at 45 from the horizontal axis however the precast model had a crack line of discontinuity around the joint as shown in fig 19 b the precast model had surface discontinuity on the concrete and the longitudinal reinforcements were divided the discontinuity was resisted on the inner tube pc tendons and shear keys after reaching the torsional moment at the plastic zone surface symptoms such as scaling spalling and delamination were observed on the cover concrete in the previous section the strain gauges were attached to specific components fig 20 shows the measured data of each strain gauge the longitudinal and hoop reinforcements were comprised of two layers the strain gauges on these reinforcements were identified as inside and outside reinforcements the hoop and longitudinal reinforcements were expressed as hoop rebars and vertical rebars respectively for the ease of expression fig 20 a d show the measured strain data on the hoop reinforcements of the outside layer the several strain gauges of the precast model shown in fig 20 a and b were changed at a torsional moment of 200 kn m it means that the strain gauges l ho 6 r ho 4 r ho 3 approached yield point of steel reinforcement because precast model didn t fully connect by concrete conversely the strains of the continuous model shown in fig 20 c and d were changed after reaching a torsional moment of 400 kn m it can be inferred that the load transfer mechanism of the precast model was uneven because components such as the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided this tendency is also observed at the hoop reinforcements of the inside layer as shown in fig 20 e h the maximum strain of the hoop reinforcements of the outside layer was larger than that of the inside layer through comparison between fig 20 b and f this is because of the increase in the torsional strain toward the outside of the section the maximum strain of the outside hoop reinforcements was 3000e 6 or more whereas the maximum strain of the inside hoop reinforcements was 1700e 6 fig 21 plots the measured strain data of the longitudinal reinforcements the strain values of the longitudinal reinforcements of the precast model were less than 0 0015 as shown in fig 21 a b e and f and were transformed from a tensile to compressive state this change was according to the cracks of the shear keys and bolting of the inner tubes and steel plates because the longitudinal reinforcements were unconnected on the other hand the strain values of the longitudinal reinforcements of the continuous model reached 0 0025 as shown in fig 21 c d g and h all the longitudinal reinforcements of the continuous model had a similar tendency finally we measured the strain at the inner tube concrete surface and reinforcements fig 22 a and b illustrate the measured strain data at the concrete surface in the precast model the joint deformations occurred as soon as there was a gap between the shear keys and the longitudinal reinforcements discontinued conversely the concrete surface of the continuous model showed plastic behavior at a torsional moment of 480 kn m fig 22 c and d show the strain of the inner tubes in each model the strain of the inner tube in the precast model was larger than that of the continuous model indicating that the precast model tends to depend more on the performance of the inner tube than the continuous model this is because the system mainly resists torsional moment using the shear keys and inner tube however the continuous model resists torsional moment using the concrete inner tube and longitudinal reinforcements 4 parametric study using finite element analysis 4 1 verification of analysis model in this experimental study the test was conducted for the two specimens therefore the behavior of the precast model was evaluated by considering various parameters which include the size of the shear keys tensile forces of the pc tendon thickness of the inner tubes and connection of the inner tubes in this section the precast model was analyzed using a commercial finite element program simulia the analysis model was verified by comparison with the experimental results fig 23 shows the fe model of the precast segment module the target range was only considered for 1 m of the precast model without the loading and support parts as shown in fig 14 d the shear keys had dimensions similar to the experimental specimen and the angle of the shear key was 20 as shown in fig 23 a concrete was applied as a solid element c3d8r the components were simulated using solid elements c3d8r truss elements t3d2 and beam elements b31 in the concrete hoop and longitudinal reinforcements and pc tendons respectively as shown in fig 23 b the thickness of the inner tubes was 7 5 mm here because the rate of convergence in the numerical analysis would be reduced by considering the bolts nuts and steel plates the steel plates connecting the inner tubes were omitted the inner tubes were constrained using the tie option which provides that the tubes were connected compulsively for the interaction between the reinforcements the pc tendons and concrete were merged using the embedded constraint option the prestress of the pc tendons was 679 mpa by a tensile strength of 120 kn the friction coefficient of each concrete surface and shear keys was assumed as 0 3 the boundary conditions of the load and reference points were assumed at both center points of the cross section and the end section was connected with the reference points using the mpc option the torsional moment was subjected to one reference point and the opposite reference point was constrained with 6 of freedom the material properties were defined to verify the fe analysis model the basic material properties applied for the steel members are listed in table 3 additionally the plastic material properties were considered using the bilinear method the strength of steel was increasing from the yield strength to tensile strength the concrete compressive strength was assumed as 35 mpa based on the experimental test results however the material model of the concrete should be obtained from the descending curve after the peak strength the descending curve of the compressive and tensile strength of the material models could not be obtained from the experimental study the ascending curve of the concrete material model from the experimental results was used to define the descending curves of the tensile and compressive strength the ceb fip model code 90 1993 model code was used as shown in fig 24 a the concrete material model in abaqus simulia was applied to the concrete damaged plasticity option coefficients such as the dilation angle eccentricity k and the viscosity parameter should be assumed for the concrete damaged plasticity table 3 shows the basic material properties and coefficients of the concrete damaged plasticity the dilation angle eccentricity fb0 fco k and viscosity parameter were set as 25 0 1 1 10 0 667 and 0 001 respectively these parameters were in reference to grassl et al 2013 for steel properties test results were applied as shown table 2 it was presented stress strain curve as fig 24 b the yield strength and tensile strength of the steel plates were 439 mpa and 540 mpa respectively and those of the inner tube were 282 mpa and 409 mpa respectively the material properties of the reinforcements were an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 540 mpa and tensile strength of 647 mpa finally the tendons had an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 1700 mpa and tensile strength of 1950 mpa initial tension of tendons was developed by using predefined field option in abaqus when analysis was beginning the initial tension was instantly developed the number of concrete elements is 17232 steel rebar is 4170 steel plate is 5762 tendon is 67 the fe analysis was performed based on the proposed material properties modeling and boundary conditions fig 25 plots the comparison between the experimental and analysis results fig 25 a shows the comparison results of precast models the analysis results within 0 02 of strain has very similar tendency with experimental study and it had larger than experimental study after 0 02 of strain fig 25 b is comparison results of continuous specimen analysis model had one inflection point in the contrast experimental model has two inflection point as shown fig 18 analysis results didn t have state 3 range because analysis was finished by distortion of meshes in this reason state 3 range couldn t be investigated however analysis results had similar tendency on state 1 and 2 ranges this is because of material nonlinearity of steel and concrete this nonlinear behavior at the joint was caused by complex factors including the damage and failure of the shear keys reduction of the tensile forces of the pc tendons and clearance of the bolting connections because the analysis model idealized the tensile forces of the pc tendons there was composite behavior between the concrete and inner tubes and the connection of the tubes although the model does not capture every nuance of the experimental data it still captures the initial stiffness and general shape of the experimental curve particularly for the precast model for this reason the model of the precast specimen is used to make some qualitative parametric studies for the connection in this study the behavior tendency of the joint of the proposed precast model was evaluated according to the parameters fig 26 illustrates the distribution of the stress and deformation in the analysis model the distribution of the von mises stress in the concrete shown in fig 26 a and b was concentrated on the shear keys because the pc tendons were connected at the center of the shear keys from fig 26 b it can be confirmed that the pc tendons had the maximum stress of approximately 1200 mpa around the joint additionally the stress distribution of the inner tube was concentrated at the joint as shown in fig 26 c the maximum von mises stress of the tube was 300 mpa which was higher than the yield stress of 285 mpa in table 2 4 2 parametric study the parametric study was conducted to evaluate the behavior of the precast model according to various variables including the shape of the shear key tensile force of the pc tendons thickness of the inner tube and connection state of the inner tube first the shape of the shear key controlled the angle as shown in fig 27 the angles of the emboss shear keys were 15 20 and 30 the 15 angle model was the fitted case between the emboss and intaglio keys fig 28 a shows the analysis results according to the shape of the shear keys the initial stiffness and strength were reduced with the reduction of the angle two inflection points were observed at the elastic range for the 15 case the slope changed at torsional moments of 500 kn m and 750 kn m the 30 case demonstrated the lowest torsional moment among the shear key shapes it reached the plastic zone at approximately 400 kn m however the torsional moment was increased after the shear keys came into contact with other shear keys it can be inferred that the shape of the emboss and intaglio shear keys were well fitted the second parameter was the tensile force of the pc tendons which was set as 80 kn 120 kn and 160 kn all the cases had similar stiffness values at the elastic range however the maximum torsional moment was slightly different the increase of the tensile forces of the pc tendons improved the torsional performance of the precast model the third parameter was the thickness of the inner tube which was set as 1 mm 4 mm 7 mm and 10 mm as shown in fig 28 c the increase of the thickness of the inner tube caused an increase in the stiffness and strength of the torsional moment capacity the 1 mm and 4 mm cases had inflection points at the elastic range whereas the 10 mm case was at the linear elastic range the final parameter was the connection state of the inner tube the inner tube of the connected and unconnected cases was compared as shown in fig 28 d the connected case demonstrated a torsional moment capacity that was four times that of the unconnected case the unconnected case had low stiffness and torsional moment strength of 200 kn m based on the analysis of the parametric study in fig 28 it can be deduced that the most effective factors for the torsional performance of the precast model are the thickness and connection state of the inner tube as well as the size of the shear keys additionally the tensile forces of the pc tendons contribute to the improvement of the unconnected inner tube model however the thickness of the inner tube and well fitted shear keys are more effective in increasing the torsional performance of the precast model the sft used a basic concept where the inner tubes were connected by bolting or welding 5 summary and conclusions in this study the structural torsional behavior of module joints of a steel composite hollow rc for the sft was studied experimentally and analytically 1 the precast module segment joint was proposed based on a steel composite hollow rc member to verify its performance experimental and numerical studies were performed additionally a parametric study was conducted to analyze the effect of the thickness of the inner tube size of the shear keys tensile force of the pc tendons and connection state of the inner tubes 2 the test specimens were the precast and continuous models the relationship between the torsional moment and torsional angle was evaluated the initial tangent stiffness of the two specimens had similar values in both the analysis and experiment results however the precast specimen reached the plastic zone after approximately 300 kn m conversely the continuous model reached the plastic zone after approximately 500 kn m the maximum torsional moments of the continuous and precast models were 1180 kn m and 760 kn m respectively this is because the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided under common conditions which were similar to the prestressed force of the pc tendons and connected inner tubes the longitudinal reinforcements of 32 ea in the continuous model were connected 3 the verification of the analysis method is necessary for the evaluation of the analysis model with assumed boundary conditions material properties and elements from the results the final strength and initial tangential stiffness of the two results had similar values and tendencies however the torsional moment from the experimental results was lower than that of the analysis results at twist angles ranging from 0 005 to 0 025 this indicated that the joint showed nonlinear behavior after the yield strength the non linearity at the joint may be as a result of the estimated complex factors such as the damage and failure of the shear keys reduction of the tensile forces of the pc tendons and clearance of the bolting connections this is because the analysis model idealized the tensile force of the pc tendons the composite behavior between the concrete and inner tube and connection of the inner tubes 4 in the parametric study the most effective factors for the torsional performance of the precast model were the thickness and connection state of the inner tube as well as the size of shear keys further the tensile force of the pc tendons contributed to the improvement of the unconnected inner tube model credit authorship contribution statement deokhee won conceptualization methodology software data

21198,in this study the structural torsional behavior of module joints of steel composite hollow reinforced concrete rc for submerged floating tunnels sfts was evaluated experimentally and analytically the proposed precast model for the sft had initial stiffness values similar to those of the continuous model however the maximum torsional moment of the precast model was lower than that of the continuous model the torsional moment capacity of the precast model was evaluated by analytical and experimental studies as well as a parametric study the main parameters included the thickness and connection states of the inner tubes sizes of the shear keys and tensile forces of the prestressed concrete pc tendons among the four parameters the thickness and connection state of the inner tubes had a more dominant influence additionally the sizes of the shear keys influenced the integration of the concrete parts during the design of the sft module joint these effective parameters should be considered for the improvement of the sft structural performance keywords submerged floating tunnel torsional behavior composite experimental study 1 introduction submerged floating tunnels sfts are a novel kind of water spanning structures that cross lakes rivers and seas it is possible to pre fabricate tunnel segments and mooring systems on land and then assemble the entire structure in the target water bodies because the underground excavation of the seabed to immerse tunnels and underwater piers for long span bridges over the sea is not required sfts compared to conventional maritime and underwater transport structures are more advantageous in terms of construction management won and kim 2018 another alternative is a floating bridge floating bridges are transportation systems installed on the water in norway floating pontoon bridge have been constructed for crossing the fjord npra 1994 jang et al 2020 studied static behavior of a floating cable stayed bridge under dead load the floating elements of sfts in water consist of tunnel segments with joints the tunnels are bored inside the ground at the landfalls and connected to fixed end joints as shown in fig 1 they are anchored on the seabed by tension legs the concept of sfts was presented decades ago in norway japan and china however sfts have not been built until now this is because the motion characteristics and performance of the structure under various environmental loads and the ground reaction force at the anchor point in the seabed have not yet been clearly analyzed recently the significance of maritime spatial utilization has become more prominent gathering momentum for the study unlike ordinary land structures floating offshore structures exhibit dynamic characteristics that are sensitive to continuously changing environmental loads such as wind waves and tides several researchers have conducted studies on the dynamic behavior of sfts under major marine environmental loads such as waves tides earthquakes and tsunamis jin and kim 2020 studied tunnel mooring train coupled dynamic analysis for sft also they studied time domain hydro elastic analysis of a sft with mooring lines under extreme wave and seismic excitations jin and kim 2018 jin et al 2020 researched the coupled dynamic analysis of a tension leg type sft using a time domain analysis lin et al 2018 studied the dynamic response analysis of sfts by considering a fluid vehicle tunnel interaction lee et al 2016 evaluated the seismic behavior of sfts with a rectangular cross section yang et al 2017 researched the hydrodynamic response of sfts under random waves xiang et al 2020 studied mechanical behaviors under a local anchor cable failure and carried out an experiment won and kim 2018 studied the feasibility of sfts moored by an inclined tendon system won et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic analysis of a new type of sft with suspension cables although these studies on the global dynamic analyses of the fluid structure have been well advanced there has been no attempt to study the behavior of the tunnel structure in an actual construction to safely operate sfts it is necessary to ensure the structural stability of the tunnels against the continuous environmental load for the sft not only the bending and the shear load are dominant but also the torsional load on the joints which has large potentials when the tension legs supporting the sft are broken or the loads are unevenly applied during construction therefore it is necessary to study a new joint that can improve the continuity by improving the structural weaknesses although there are hardly any actual structures that are subjected to pure torsion only it is necessary to verify the pure torsional behavior which is used to analyze the overall torsional behavior when combined loads are applied on the sft additionally evaluations of the torsional stiffness of continuous reinforced concrete rc beams and buildings as well as torsional failures caused by earthquakes are increasing consequently there is a growing interest in torsion in this study a static pure torsional loading test on module joints was performed based on the cross section of steel composite hollow columns proposed by han et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 a novel module joint type for the sft is proposed in this study the failure modes and torsional behavior characteristics with the connection variables of this joint are experimentally and numerically evaluated 2 hydrodynamic behavior of the sft 2 1 hydrodynamic response characteristics of the sft in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics on members of a tether stabilized sft model were evaluated under different wave loads the abaqus aqua simulia lnc 2020 fe program which has been used in previous studies by won et al 2019 2019 for the time domain fluid structure analysis technique of sfts under regular and irregular waves was used to perform the numerical analysis the proposed analysis model was verified by comparing the analysis results with the experimental results the finite element modeling of the sft was based on prototype designs specifically developed for the jeju strait in south korea a potential site for the installation of an sft the environmental conditions under which the sft is installed are shown in table 1 the water depth is 180 m and the wave height and wave period are considered as 10 85 m and 14 37 s respectively the arbitrary tunnel unit model has a diameter and thickness of 23 m and 1 m respectively and the clearance depth at which the sft is located below the water surface is 60 m the mooring system was designed with inclined tethers to add the necessary horizontal support stiffness the material for the tethers had the properties of api x70 which is commonly used in marine risers the cross section of the tethers has an outer diameter and thickness of 0 553 m and 0 04 m respectively the spacing interval of the tether was 50 m along the length of the tunnel and a total of seven sets were installed for the entire model the sft body was assumed reinforced concrete and the tethers were applied pipe of api x70 elastic modulus of reinforced concrete is 30 gpa poisson ratio is 0 16 and density is 2400 kg m 3 elastic modulus of tether is 210 gpa yield strength is 482 6 mpa ultimate tensile strength is 565 4 mpa and poisson ratio is 0 3 each sft module is assumed to be a continuum fig 3 illustrates the installation concept of the sft this model was designed with inclined tethers on both sides of the tunnel the tunnel has a total length of 300 m in this model the tunnel is considered as straight therefore tethers with an angle are used to restrain the tunnel s horizontal motion the buoyancy to weight ratio bwr considered in the analysis is 1 2 the tunnel and tethers were modeled as a three dimensional beam and truss elements respectively they were connected by the multipoint constraint option mpc considering the tunnel tether connection points all tethers were connected to the seabed and applied as a hinged condition the installation angle of the tethers was 30 against the z axis considering irregular waves in the time domain analysis a linear superimposition method which is a technique using a certain number of regular wave components as random numbers was applied for the wave loads here the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum was used as the wave spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 this spectrum was established based on data collected during jonswap it considered wave interactions for long time durations and distances as nonlinear to improve its measurements a coefficient factor γ was added to the pierson moskowitz spectrum the peak enhancement factor usually has an upper limit of about 7 it was assumed approximately 3 3 in this study it provides some uncertainty to the wave power estimates 1 s j ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 4 5 ω p ω 4 γ r 2 r e x p ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p

relative fluid velocity ρ is fluid density δ v t is the relative tangential velocity of the fluid δ v n is the relative transverse velocity of the fluid h is the exponent for tangential drag respectively this wave condition was applied to the model as a term of the external force of dynamic analysis additionally considering the angle of incidence which is the angle between the propagation direction of the wave front and the sft the motion and resisting capacity of the model were analyzed and the angle varied between 0 20 and 40 to the y axis the results of the hydrodynamic analysis of the sft are as follows the sway and heave of the sft model were plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the sway which is the motion of the sft in the acting direction of the wave had a slight deformation within 0 04 m the heave was initially increased until 1 5 m under the influence of the bwr and deformation occurred slightly based on the raised wave height it was observed that the deformation depending on the angle of incidence rarely occurred and had similar patterns because the tethers support these motions a section moment occurs in the cross section of the sft fig 6 shows an absolute maximum section moment in the x axis which indicates the torsional moment the lowest torsional moment was generated at the landfall of the mooring line where it was fixed and the highest occurred at the center point of tether space because the sft was supported by tethers fig 7 and fig 8 exhibit the section moments of the sft in the y axis and z axis respectively the section moment of the sft had the highest torsional moment value as shown in fig 9 and the lowest moment was at the z axis therefore it was inferred that the torsional moment is one of the most significant design considerations for the sft the largest torsional moment was 1 5 gn m in this analysis therefore it can be deduced that a torsional moment of 15 gn m or more should be exerted when designing the module joint of the sft in consideration of uncertainties such as the wave impact load stress of tendon was investigated maximum stress of tendons was 187 mpa it was less than yield strength of 482 6 mpa 3 proposal and design of joints for the sft 3 1 proposed joints for sft modules the construction procedure for the basic design of sft modules is very important special construction steps are needed for installation in the middle of water in this study the construction procedures presented in fig 10 were proposed considering underwater environmental conditions first foundations such as suction anchors gravity type or pile type are installed on the seabed subsequently tethers are linked to each foundation they are located at target points using buoys for connection with the tunnel modules of the sfts the tunnel modules are produced on land and transported by a tugboat or floating dock ship because they can float by themselves the transported sft module is submerged using cranes in mother vessels it is then connected to the existing module segment between tethers and they are linked to achieve a safe transport system the joints of the sft modules should have good structural performance fig 11 shows a concept design of the sft module joint the structural joint method and function of the water stop are highly significant for the connection of the prefabricated tunnel modules this system has a composite hollow rc section as shown in fig 2 the cross section of the precast model consists of concrete longitudinal reinforcements and an inner tube therefore the connection methods for these three components should be proposed typically the prestressed method including shear keys can be used for connecting reinforced concrete units prefabricated construction procedures should be performed inside the tunnel to connect the sft tunnel modules unlike land structure constructions such as bridges and buildings moreover the post tensioned method uses steel strands and tendons which pass through precast modules in sleeves service loads are applied to connect both sides of the tunnel modules then the arched tendons are pulled tight and anchored against the inside of each module additionally a water stop component is required to prevent water from flowing into the tunnel it consists of gina gaskets and omega seals which are used between the section joint elements of the immersed tunnels it has multiple functions which include the transfer of the hydrostatic load motion forces between each module and high water seals the gina gasket is installed outside the joint and the omega seal is installed inside the empty box as shown in fig 11 after the omega seal is installed inside the empty space it is filled with mortar and reinforcements finally an inner tube is fabricated using bolts and steel plates as noted above joints should have resistance performance against bending shear and torsional forces in this study a suitable shear key against these forces was proposed it has intaglio and emboss shapes as shown in fig 12 this method could increase the resistance performance against the aforementioned external forces 3 2 design of specimen and test program to verify the proposed joint a structural experimental test was performed in reality a lab cannot perfectly produce a real model the experiment was performed under the assumption that the thickness rebar diameter tether diameter and shear key size of the sft specimen were fabricated the produced specimen didn t perfectly simulate the real sft scale in table 1 these hypothesized experimental models provide qualitative information about the reinforced concrete joints presented in this study after verification in section 4 through finite element analysis variable analysis was performed to perform the torsional structural experiment an effective test method should be proposed two loads should act on two points of the model to realize torsional moment hence in this study the test method shown in fig 13 was proposed to evaluate the torsional behavior this test method consists of three parts a loading part a support part and an experiment section further a push over test was conducted to evaluate the torsional behavior two actuators were used for the two loads they created torsional moments and had a capacity of 2000 kn each the loading part was rotated by the two loads the interval of the installed actuators was 1 m the joint experiment section had a total length of 1 m and the joint was located at the center of the specimen the support part was fixed on the floor by prestressed bars the actuators had load cells for measuring each load additionally linear variable displacement transducers were installed at both ends 50 cm from the center line the displacement of each actuator was controlled and its velocity was 0 01 mm s to avoid the dynamic effect fig 14 presents the details of the precast test specimen fig 14 a shows the cross section and shear keys the outer and inner diameters of the tunnel were 840 mm and 391 2 mm respectively the hoop and longitudinal reinforcements consisted of two layers all hoop and longitudinal reinforcements of the second layer had a diameter of 13 mm the longitudinal reinforcements of the first layer were 16 mm in diameter sheath tubes with diameters of 30 mm were installed between the two layers for the pc tendons with diameters of 15 mm the shear keys with emboss and intaglio shapes were six in total reinforcements with a diameter of 3 mm were arranged in the shear keys additionally the thickness of the inner tube was 7 mm fig 14 b exhibits the steel plates bolts and bolt holes to connect the inner tube two steel plates were rounded to fit inside the diameter of the section with the bolt holes the thickness of the steel plates was 7 5 mm one side of the steel plates had 26 bolt holes which were arranged in columns at an interval of 122 9 mm the total number of bolts was 52 high tension m16 bolts were applied to join the steel plates and inner tube nuts were welded on the outside of the inner tube fig 14 c shows the section between the experimental section and support part or loading part the joint between them was reinforced using an h beam to prevent damages further fig 14 d illustrates the arrangement of the reinforcements in the support and loading parts the size of the support part was 1840 mm 1840 mm which was larger than the loading part the thickness of the loading and support parts was 600 mm and reinforcements with diameters of 16 mm were applied subsequently a continuous model was designed as a comparative specimen all components such as the concrete inner tube and longitudinal reinforcements were connected differently from the precast model as shown in fig 15 the hoop reinforcements were arranged at an interval of 100 mm and there were no shear keys a post tension load of 120 kn was applied for an initial compression stress post tensioned concrete was applied in two specimens in bonded post tensioning method tendons were permanently bonded to the sft module by in situ grouting fig 16 shows the fabrication procedure of the specimens which include the precast and continuous specimens for the precast specimen the reinforcements sheath tubes inner tubes and shear keys in the steel molds were first arranged as shown in fig 16 a the concrete was then placed in the mold and the precast units were fabricated including the shear keys as shown in fig 16 b the inner tube of the precast segment unit was connected using high tension bolts before the fabrication of both sides to the loading and support parts as shown in fig 16 c and d after the connection fabrication of the precast segment units the loading and support parts were produced through the assembled mold and h beam arrangement of reinforcements and placing of concrete as shown in fig 16 e finally the specimen was fabricated completely and set in the test laboratory as shown in fig 16 f two actuators connected to the loading and support parts were fixed using prestressed bars on the floor the compressive strength of the concrete was measured by cylindrical concrete specimens in a compression test machine it was calculated from the failure load the average compressive strength of the concrete was 35 1 mpa and the elastic modulus was 34 961 mpa additionally a tensile coupon test of the steel members was performed steel coupons were subjected to tension loads by a universal testing machine the steel members used in this specimen were the inner tubes steel plates reinforcements and pc tendons three samples of each of the test steel coupons were produced the average yield strength and average tensile strength of the steel plates were 439 mpa and 540 mpa respectively and those of the inner tube were 282 mpa and 409 mpa respectively the material properties of the reinforcements were an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 540 mpa and tensile strength of 647 mpa finally the tendons had an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 1700 mpa and tensile strength of 1950 mpa strain gauges were attached to investigate the characteristics of the components as shown in fig 17 concrete strain gauges were attached on the concrete surface at an angle of 45 from the horizontal axis steel strain gauges were attached on the inside and outside of the hoop reinforcements hoop rebars and longitudinal reinforcements vertical rebars as well as the inner tube particularly the steel strain gauges of the reinforcements were attached to both of the precast segment units 3 3 test results based on the test method mentioned in the previous section the experiment was performed on the two specimens from the results the relationship between the torsional moment and torsional angle was deduced as shown in fig 18 the ceb fip model code 1990 proposed idealized trilinear diagram the state 1 is linear elastic and uncracked zone the state 2 is cracked zone the state 3 is plastic conditions experimental results were illustrated each state zone according to this code as shown fig 18 the cracking torsional moment were 500 kn m and 420 kn m respectively in the state 2 elongation of tendons and crushed shear key were occurred here tendons could lose their initial tension because crack of grouting and shear keys finally the state 3 had fully plastic conditions the maximum torsional moments of the continuous and precast models were 1180 kn m and 760 kn m respectively this is because the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided under common conditions which were similar to the prestressed forces of the pc tendons and connected inner tubes the longitudinal reinforcements of 32 each in the continuous model were connected as shown in fig 15 the uniform behavior of the two specimens can be confirmed by the crack patterns shown in fig 19 fig 19 shows the failure state and crack patterns of the two specimens at their ultimate limit state the overall crack patterns were quite similar shear crack patterns were observed at 45 from the horizontal axis however the precast model had a crack line of discontinuity around the joint as shown in fig 19 b the precast model had surface discontinuity on the concrete and the longitudinal reinforcements were divided the discontinuity was resisted on the inner tube pc tendons and shear keys after reaching the torsional moment at the plastic zone surface symptoms such as scaling spalling and delamination were observed on the cover concrete in the previous section the strain gauges were attached to specific components fig 20 shows the measured data of each strain gauge the longitudinal and hoop reinforcements were comprised of two layers the strain gauges on these reinforcements were identified as inside and outside reinforcements the hoop and longitudinal reinforcements were expressed as hoop rebars and vertical rebars respectively for the ease of expression fig 20 a d show the measured strain data on the hoop reinforcements of the outside layer the several strain gauges of the precast model shown in fig 20 a and b were changed at a torsional moment of 200 kn m it means that the strain gauges l ho 6 r ho 4 r ho 3 approached yield point of steel reinforcement because precast model didn t fully connect by concrete conversely the strains of the continuous model shown in fig 20 c and d were changed after reaching a torsional moment of 400 kn m it can be inferred that the load transfer mechanism of the precast model was uneven because components such as the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided this tendency is also observed at the hoop reinforcements of the inside layer as shown in fig 20 e h the maximum strain of the hoop reinforcements of the outside layer was larger than that of the inside layer through comparison between fig 20 b and f this is because of the increase in the torsional strain toward the outside of the section the maximum strain of the outside hoop reinforcements was 3000e 6 or more whereas the maximum strain of the inside hoop reinforcements was 1700e 6 fig 21 plots the measured strain data of the longitudinal reinforcements the strain values of the longitudinal reinforcements of the precast model were less than 0 0015 as shown in fig 21 a b e and f and were transformed from a tensile to compressive state this change was according to the cracks of the shear keys and bolting of the inner tubes and steel plates because the longitudinal reinforcements were unconnected on the other hand the strain values of the longitudinal reinforcements of the continuous model reached 0 0025 as shown in fig 21 c d g and h all the longitudinal reinforcements of the continuous model had a similar tendency finally we measured the strain at the inner tube concrete surface and reinforcements fig 22 a and b illustrate the measured strain data at the concrete surface in the precast model the joint deformations occurred as soon as there was a gap between the shear keys and the longitudinal reinforcements discontinued conversely the concrete surface of the continuous model showed plastic behavior at a torsional moment of 480 kn m fig 22 c and d show the strain of the inner tubes in each model the strain of the inner tube in the precast model was larger than that of the continuous model indicating that the precast model tends to depend more on the performance of the inner tube than the continuous model this is because the system mainly resists torsional moment using the shear keys and inner tube however the continuous model resists torsional moment using the concrete inner tube and longitudinal reinforcements 4 parametric study using finite element analysis 4 1 verification of analysis model in this experimental study the test was conducted for the two specimens therefore the behavior of the precast model was evaluated by considering various parameters which include the size of the shear keys tensile forces of the pc tendon thickness of the inner tubes and connection of the inner tubes in this section the precast model was analyzed using a commercial finite element program simulia the analysis model was verified by comparison with the experimental results fig 23 shows the fe model of the precast segment module the target range was only considered for 1 m of the precast model without the loading and support parts as shown in fig 14 d the shear keys had dimensions similar to the experimental specimen and the angle of the shear key was 20 as shown in fig 23 a concrete was applied as a solid element c3d8r the components were simulated using solid elements c3d8r truss elements t3d2 and beam elements b31 in the concrete hoop and longitudinal reinforcements and pc tendons respectively as shown in fig 23 b the thickness of the inner tubes was 7 5 mm here because the rate of convergence in the numerical analysis would be reduced by considering the bolts nuts and steel plates the steel plates connecting the inner tubes were omitted the inner tubes were constrained using the tie option which provides that the tubes were connected compulsively for the interaction between the reinforcements the pc tendons and concrete were merged using the embedded constraint option the prestress of the pc tendons was 679 mpa by a tensile strength of 120 kn the friction coefficient of each concrete surface and shear keys was assumed as 0 3 the boundary conditions of the load and reference points were assumed at both center points of the cross section and the end section was connected with the reference points using the mpc option the torsional moment was subjected to one reference point and the opposite reference point was constrained with 6 of freedom the material properties were defined to verify the fe analysis model the basic material properties applied for the steel members are listed in table 3 additionally the plastic material properties were considered using the bilinear method the strength of steel was increasing from the yield strength to tensile strength the concrete compressive strength was assumed as 35 mpa based on the experimental test results however the material model of the concrete should be obtained from the descending curve after the peak strength the descending curve of the compressive and tensile strength of the material models could not be obtained from the experimental study the ascending curve of the concrete material model from the experimental results was used to define the descending curves of the tensile and compressive strength the ceb fip model code 90 1993 model code was used as shown in fig 24 a the concrete material model in abaqus simulia was applied to the concrete damaged plasticity option coefficients such as the dilation angle eccentricity k and the viscosity parameter should be assumed for the concrete damaged plasticity table 3 shows the basic material properties and coefficients of the concrete damaged plasticity the dilation angle eccentricity fb0 fco k and viscosity parameter were set as 25 0 1 1 10 0 667 and 0 001 respectively these parameters were in reference to grassl et al 2013 for steel properties test results were applied as shown table 2 it was presented stress strain curve as fig 24 b the yield strength and tensile strength of the steel plates were 439 mpa and 540 mpa respectively and those of the inner tube were 282 mpa and 409 mpa respectively the material properties of the reinforcements were an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 540 mpa and tensile strength of 647 mpa finally the tendons had an elastic modulus of 205 gpa yield strength of 1700 mpa and tensile strength of 1950 mpa initial tension of tendons was developed by using predefined field option in abaqus when analysis was beginning the initial tension was instantly developed the number of concrete elements is 17232 steel rebar is 4170 steel plate is 5762 tendon is 67 the fe analysis was performed based on the proposed material properties modeling and boundary conditions fig 25 plots the comparison between the experimental and analysis results fig 25 a shows the comparison results of precast models the analysis results within 0 02 of strain has very similar tendency with experimental study and it had larger than experimental study after 0 02 of strain fig 25 b is comparison results of continuous specimen analysis model had one inflection point in the contrast experimental model has two inflection point as shown fig 18 analysis results didn t have state 3 range because analysis was finished by distortion of meshes in this reason state 3 range couldn t be investigated however analysis results had similar tendency on state 1 and 2 ranges this is because of material nonlinearity of steel and concrete this nonlinear behavior at the joint was caused by complex factors including the damage and failure of the shear keys reduction of the tensile forces of the pc tendons and clearance of the bolting connections because the analysis model idealized the tensile forces of the pc tendons there was composite behavior between the concrete and inner tubes and the connection of the tubes although the model does not capture every nuance of the experimental data it still captures the initial stiffness and general shape of the experimental curve particularly for the precast model for this reason the model of the precast specimen is used to make some qualitative parametric studies for the connection in this study the behavior tendency of the joint of the proposed precast model was evaluated according to the parameters fig 26 illustrates the distribution of the stress and deformation in the analysis model the distribution of the von mises stress in the concrete shown in fig 26 a and b was concentrated on the shear keys because the pc tendons were connected at the center of the shear keys from fig 26 b it can be confirmed that the pc tendons had the maximum stress of approximately 1200 mpa around the joint additionally the stress distribution of the inner tube was concentrated at the joint as shown in fig 26 c the maximum von mises stress of the tube was 300 mpa which was higher than the yield stress of 285 mpa in table 2 4 2 parametric study the parametric study was conducted to evaluate the behavior of the precast model according to various variables including the shape of the shear key tensile force of the pc tendons thickness of the inner tube and connection state of the inner tube first the shape of the shear key controlled the angle as shown in fig 27 the angles of the emboss shear keys were 15 20 and 30 the 15 angle model was the fitted case between the emboss and intaglio keys fig 28 a shows the analysis results according to the shape of the shear keys the initial stiffness and strength were reduced with the reduction of the angle two inflection points were observed at the elastic range for the 15 case the slope changed at torsional moments of 500 kn m and 750 kn m the 30 case demonstrated the lowest torsional moment among the shear key shapes it reached the plastic zone at approximately 400 kn m however the torsional moment was increased after the shear keys came into contact with other shear keys it can be inferred that the shape of the emboss and intaglio shear keys were well fitted the second parameter was the tensile force of the pc tendons which was set as 80 kn 120 kn and 160 kn all the cases had similar stiffness values at the elastic range however the maximum torsional moment was slightly different the increase of the tensile forces of the pc tendons improved the torsional performance of the precast model the third parameter was the thickness of the inner tube which was set as 1 mm 4 mm 7 mm and 10 mm as shown in fig 28 c the increase of the thickness of the inner tube caused an increase in the stiffness and strength of the torsional moment capacity the 1 mm and 4 mm cases had inflection points at the elastic range whereas the 10 mm case was at the linear elastic range the final parameter was the connection state of the inner tube the inner tube of the connected and unconnected cases was compared as shown in fig 28 d the connected case demonstrated a torsional moment capacity that was four times that of the unconnected case the unconnected case had low stiffness and torsional moment strength of 200 kn m based on the analysis of the parametric study in fig 28 it can be deduced that the most effective factors for the torsional performance of the precast model are the thickness and connection state of the inner tube as well as the size of the shear keys additionally the tensile forces of the pc tendons contribute to the improvement of the unconnected inner tube model however the thickness of the inner tube and well fitted shear keys are more effective in increasing the torsional performance of the precast model the sft used a basic concept where the inner tubes were connected by bolting or welding 5 summary and conclusions in this study the structural torsional behavior of module joints of a steel composite hollow rc for the sft was studied experimentally and analytically 1 the precast module segment joint was proposed based on a steel composite hollow rc member to verify its performance experimental and numerical studies were performed additionally a parametric study was conducted to analyze the effect of the thickness of the inner tube size of the shear keys tensile force of the pc tendons and connection state of the inner tubes 2 the test specimens were the precast and continuous models the relationship between the torsional moment and torsional angle was evaluated the initial tangent stiffness of the two specimens had similar values in both the analysis and experiment results however the precast specimen reached the plastic zone after approximately 300 kn m conversely the continuous model reached the plastic zone after approximately 500 kn m the maximum torsional moments of the continuous and precast models were 1180 kn m and 760 kn m respectively this is because the longitudinal reinforcements and concrete were divided under common conditions which were similar to the prestressed force of the pc tendons and connected inner tubes the longitudinal reinforcements of 32 ea in the continuous model were connected 3 the verification of the analysis method is necessary for the evaluation of the analysis model with assumed boundary conditions material properties and elements from the results the final strength and initial tangential stiffness of the two results had similar values and tendencies however the torsional moment from the experimental results was lower than that of the analysis results at twist angles ranging from 0 005 to 0 025 this indicated that the joint showed nonlinear behavior after the yield strength the non linearity at the joint may be as a result of the estimated complex factors such as the damage and failure of the shear keys reduction of the tensile forces of the pc tendons and clearance of the bolting connections this is because the analysis model idealized the tensile force of the pc tendons the composite behavior between the concrete and inner tube and connection of the inner tubes 4 in the parametric study the most effective factors for the torsional performance of the precast model were the thickness and connection state of the inner tube as well as the size of shear keys further the tensile force of the pc tendons contributed to the improvement of the unconnected inner tube model credit authorship contribution statement deokhee won conceptualization methodology software data

21199,offshore wind turbines owts are vulnerable to ice induced vibrations iiv when they are located in ice prone regions with drifting sea ice the ice induced frequency lock in fli phenomenon will cause excessive vibration and fatigue damage of owts the present study characterizes the ice induced fli of owts under various ice conditions through coupled analysis and mitigates the significant fli response using a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 3d ptmd based on the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline monopile owt model a numerical model of the owt with a 3d ptmd is established wherein the interaction between the blades and the tower is modeled and soil effect is considered aerodynamic loading is computed using the blade element momentum bem method where the prandtl s tip loss factor and the glauert correction are considered a coupled simulation program based on määttänen blenkarn model is developed to simulate ice structure interactions different ice velocities thicknesses and attack angles in the bohai sea are chosen to study the ice structure interactions and characterize the fli research results show that the fli of the monopile owt occurs when the ice velocity is between 0 01 m s to 0 06 m s and the ice thickness is 7 cm and 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s when the ice thickness is 32 cm when the fli happens the 3d ptmd has significant effectiveness in mitigating the root mean square and peak response of the nacelle tower and the foundation in fore aft and side side directions the present study enhances the understanding of ice induced fli and provides a feasible solution for vibration control of owts in ice prone areas keywords offshore wind turbines ice induced vibration response mitigation pendulum tuned mass damper 1 introduction with the depletion of fossil resources and the huge demand for green energy the development of renewable and sustainable energy is becoming increasingly attractive gipe 2018 as a promising renewable energy source offshore wind energy sector is experiencing rapid growth globally due to its advantages such as higher wind speeds lower turbulences less visual impacts and noise pollution compared with onshore wind power jahangiri and sun 2019 in 2019 the global offshore wind power capacity was increased by 6 1 gw an increase of 35 5 compared with 2018 many of the offshore wind farms are located in cold regions e g danish waters the baltic sea and the china bohai sea in the past decade offshore wind energy has increased rapidly in china and a total capacity of 2 4 gw offshore wind farms were installed in the china sea region by 2019 council gwe 2020 recently china started to construct offshore wind farms in the bohai sea due to the rich wind resources shallow water and low penetration of wind energy sector in this area tian et al 2019 however the annually frozen condition in the bohai sea poses a huge threat to the structural safety of the owts and adversely affects their power generation performance one of the main concerns for the engineering community in cold areas with ice infested water is the significant ice loading and ice induced vibration to mitigate ice induced vibrations iivs several solutions have been proposed a common approach is to install cones at the ice structure interface which is widely used in offshore oil gas platforms huang et al 2013 yue et al 2000 the ice breaking cone can reduce the ice load acting on the structure by changing the ice failure mode from crushing failure to bending failure however it does not fundamentally solve the iiv issues and the remaining ice force can cause severe tower vibrations mróz et al 2008 furthermore excessive vibration may still occur due to periodic ice loading caused by the intermittent fracture of ice sheets colliding the conical structure and the ice induced frequency lock in fli may occur when the ice loading frequency resonates with the structural natural frequency in addition the tower diameters of monopile owts are usually between 3 m and 8 m which will render the maximum diameter of the cones mounted on the monopile as large as 10 m causing ice to accumulate more easily when the ice accumulation happens it will increase the ice loading dramatically which is severely harmful to the safety of the owt also designing ice cones for jacket type owts is challenging as the distance between the legs at the mean sea level msl is much smaller than that of the offshore oil platforms there is not enough clear distance for crushed ice drifts through the jacket if each leg is equipped with an ice cone another solution to mitigate iiv of owts in ice covered sea areas is to use various types of dampers which has been widely studied and applied in civil structures such as high rise buildings reinforced concrete structures and bridges hoang et al 2016 khodaie 2020 li et al 2011 in recent years the vibration control techniques have been studied to protect owts murtagh et al 2008 studied the control of the wind turbine along wind vibration using a passive tuned mass damper tmd it was found that the passive tmd can effectively suppress the fore aft response of the wind turbine tower under the random wind loading buckley et al 2018 used a tuned liquid column damper tlcd to control the structural vibration of wind turbines considering the soil structure interaction the authors concluded that tlcd is a viable method in the vibration control of owt zhang et al 2014 investigated the performance of roller damper for mitigation of edgewise vibration in rotating wind turbine blades research findings indicated that the damper can effectively reduce the structural response of wind turbine blades zuo et al 2017 proposed using multiple tuned mass dampers mtmds to control the multiple modal vibrations of offshore wind turbine tower under multiple hazards it was shown that mtmds can effectively control both the fundamental and higher vibration modes and enhance the control effectiveness jahangiri and sun 2020 used a 3d ptmd and dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers 2ptmds to mitigate three dimensional vibrations of a spar type floating owt under wind and wave loadings the author found that the 2ptmds experienced a smaller stroke than that of traditional linear tmds ghassempour et al 2019 investigated load mitigation of the nrel 5 mw monopile owt using an omnidirectional tmd under operational and parked rotor conditions the results demonstrated that the wind velocity in operational condition shall be considered on the tuning frequency of the tmd to attain the optimal reduction of structural vibrations semi active tmds stmd are also investigated in the vibration control of owts by many researchers due to their ability to retuning natural frequencies and damping properties arrigan et al 2011 carried out research into the effectiveness of the stmds in reducing flapwise vibrations of wind turbine blades and found that stmds could achieve significant reduction when the blades dynamic parameters changed sun 2018a 2018b compared the stmd with the traditional tmd and found that the stmd demonstrated consistent effectiveness in controlling the response of owt under multi hazards such as wind wave and earthquake and damage while existing literature in this area has made remarkable progress toward dynamics modeling and mitigation of owts few of them have considered ice loading and iiv mitigation which is critically important for owts located in cold marine regions shi et al 2016 proposed a semi empirical ice load model and investigated the influence of ice loads on a monopile type owt and found that ice loads could induce significant vibrations to the wind turbine heinonen et al 2011 utilized the simulation platform onwind simulated the interaction between level ice and two monopile type owts with different structural stiffness and found that both owts were sensitive on fli vibration depending on ice velocity the author further developed two submodules icefloe and icedyn heinonen et al 2017 and integrated the models with the aero hydro elastic fast code jonkman et al 2005 to enhance the cost efficient owt structural design in terms of the vibration control of owts in regions with cold climates kärnä et al 2004 utilized a tmd to mitigate the remaining vibration of a slender owt mounted with ice breaking cone on the waterline and found that the remaining vibration can be further reduced after installing the tmd ye et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of the ice breaking cone and the tmd for reducing aerodynamic and ice loading acting on the monopile owt their results indicated that tmd could mitigate the side side vibration while it is ineffective in reducing the structural response in the fore aft direction when the ice breaking cone is not mounted on the owt in reality the ice drifting direction is mainly influenced by wind and current directions owts always suffer from bi directional vibration fore aft and side side due to vortex induced cross wind vibration or misalignment between wind and wave ice however most of the existing literature only focuses on unidirectional response mitigation to mitigate the bi directional vibrations simultaneously sun et al 2018 2019a 2019b proposed a 3d ptmd to control the excessive vibration of the owt in fore aft and side side directions the authors validated the effectiveness of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the bi directional vibration of the monopile owt under wind wave and seismic loading however ice loading was not taken into consideration in these studies to mitigate ice induced vibration this paper further investigates ice induced fli of an nrel 5 mw monopile owt and bi directional vibration mitigation of the owt subjected to combined ice and wind loading novelty of the present study is on one hand characterizing the ice induced fli of the owt under various ice conditions ice velocity and thickness via a coupled analysis program to simulate the ice structure interaction on the other hand effectiveness of a 3d ptmd in mitigating the iiv in the case of fli is evaluated in this paper the aerodynamic loading is computed using the blade element momentum bem method and the ice loading is simulated using a coupled analysis program based on the määttänen blenkarn model structural response characteristics under various ice conditions are analyzed and the critical ice conditions that cause the occurrence of fli are identified to mitigate the large structural response in the case of fli an integrated iiv analysis model coupled with a 3d ptmd is established using ansys performance of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the iiv in fore aft and side side directions is examined under different wind ice misalignment angles results show that the 3d ptmd is effective in mitigating the bi directional vibration caused by wind and ice loading and it is found that the 3d ptmd is suitable for practical application the present paper is structured as follows in the second part the turbulent wind field and bem theory are described and the simulated aerodynamic loads on the blades are presented in the third part the characteristics of ice structure interaction are discussed and the coupled analysis program developed base on self excited vibration model is depicted modeling and modal results of the nrel 5 mw monopile owt and the ice environmental conditions are described in the fourth part the fifth part investigates the dynamic response of the owt under different ice velocities and thicknesses presents characteristics of the ice induced fli and examines the performance of the 3d ptmd in the mitigation of iiv conclusions are discussed in the final part 2 aerodynamic loads at present several methods have been developed to estimate the aerodynamic load on the owts including bem theory actuator line model alm general dynamic wake gdw and computational fluid dynamics cfd method wan et al 2017 the classic bem method is adopted in the present study 2 1 turbulent wind the steady wind field rarely exists in the real marine environment to compute the aerodynamic load realistically and accurately the iec kaimal spectral model is employed to represent the wind turbulence firstly which is given by 1 s w f w 4 i 2 l c 1 6 f w l c v 5 3 where s w f w is the power spectrum density function f w is the wind frequency in hz i is the wind turbulence intensity v is mean velocity and l c is an integral scale parameter in the present research the logarithmic wind speed profile is adopted to calculate the mean velocity the cross spectrum is implemented to account for the spatial dependency of wind velocity at different points which is described by the following equation 2 s i j f w c o h i j f w s i i f w s j j f w where s ij is the cross spectra between two arbitrary points i and j s ii and s jj are the auto spectra at points i and j respectively referring to the iec spectral mode iec 2009 the spatial coherence function is expressed as 3 c o h i j f w exp a f w l v h u b 0 12 l l c 2 where l is the distance between point i and j on the grid a is the coherence decrement v h u b is the mean wind speed at the hub height based on eqs 1 3 a three dimensional wind field profile covering the domain of the rotor disk is generated using the turbsim program jonkman et al 2012 a 31 31 velocity grids as conceptually illustrated in fig 1 is produced to represent the three dimensional wind field matlab code has been developed to map the full wind field profile onto each span station of the rotating blades 2 2 bem theory the bem theory divides the wind blade into n elements and assumes that there is no dependency along the blade span therefore the aerodynamic force on each element can be calculated independently based on lift and drag coefficients of each airfoil as shown in fig 2 taking the ith blade element to analyze the local velocities and aerodynamic loading acting on the ith section where r is the rotor radius dr and c r are the element span length and the chord length at the element mid span respectively then the relative wind velocity v rel can be expressed as the vector sum of the axial and the tangential velocity i e 4 v r e l v 1 b 2 ω r 1 b 2 where ω is the rotation velocity r is the distance between the ith blade element and the rotor center b and b are the axial velocity and tangential velocity induction factors respectively the lift force dp l which is perpendicular and the drag force dp d which is parallel to the relative velocity can be determined by 5 d p l 1 2 c l ρ v r e l 2 c r d r d p d 1 2 c d ρ v r e l 2 c r d r where ρ is the air density c l and c d are the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient respectively then the normal and tangential forces dp n and dp t can be calculated by the geometrical relationship with the following equation 6 d p n d p l cos ϕ d p d sin ϕ d p t d p l sin ϕ d p d cos ϕ where ϕ is the flow angle ϕ α θ in which α is the wind attack angel and θ is the summation of the pitch angle and the twist angle which is predetermined by the airfoil eqs 4 6 illustrate the main procedure to obtain the aerodynamic load however in the real application iterations are needed to determine the unknown parameters of b and b therefore a matlab code has been developed to compute the time series of p n and p t in this paper based on the algorithm proposed in ref hansen 2015 randtl s tip loss factor and glauert correction are considered in the matlab code fig 3 demonstrates the aerodynamic loading of one blade corresponding to an average wind speed 12 m s at the hub height and a turbulence intensity of 10 the corresponding frequently characteristics of simulated aerodynamic loadings are calculated and shown in fig 4 it can be found that both the frequency spectrums of the normal and tangential wind forces have peaks at 0 2 hz and multiples of 0 2 hz this is caused by the rotation of the blade as its speed is 12 rpm 3 modeling of ice loading and coupled analysis program 3 1 self excited vibration various ice structure interaction models have been proposed by researchers ye et al 2019 in principle they can be divided into two categories forced vibration first proposed by matlock et al 1971 and self excited vibration theory svt by määttänen 1988 the svt considers the relationship between sea ice compressive strength and stress rate and has been gradually recognized by researchers as more and more experiments and field observations support this theory popko and georgiadou 2015 therefore the svt is adopted to simulate ice structure interaction in this paper as shown in fig 5 based on the svt the ice compressive strength changes nonlinearly and undergoes three phases ductile ductile brittle and brittle crushing as the stress rate increases accordingly ice structure interaction falls into three categories shown in fig 6 1 intermittent crushing of ice with low velocities and a saw tooth load quasi static structural response fig 6 a 2 steady state structural response under intermediate ice velocities fig 6 b 3 continuous brittle crushing of high ice velocity ice with random ice load and structural response fig 6 c määttänen argued that the negative damping during the ice structure interaction causes self excited vibration and fli vibrations are expected to occur in the ductile brittle transition region the red dashed line shown in fig 5 3 2 ice load model of svt määttänen blenkarn model is applied to estimate dynamic ice load on narrow vertical structures based on svt määttänen 1998 blenkarn 1970 in which the compressive strength of ice depends on the relative velocity between the ice and structure at the waterline and the size of the nominal contact area of the ice i e 7 σ c f v i c e x a 0 a where v ice is the ice velocity x is the velocity of the structure at the waterline a is the nominal contact area which is the projected area of the intact ice feature on the structure a 0 is the reference area of 1 m2 based on määttänen 1998 the crushing strength can be calculated as 8 σ c 0 σ 0 a 0 a 2 0 7 8 σ 18 57 σ 2 13 0 σ 3 2 91 σ 4 0 σ 1 3 1 σ 1 3 the stress rate is defined by blenkarn 1970 as 9 σ v i c e x 8 σ 0 π d where σ is ice stress rate and σ 0 is a reference strength which is 2 mpa eq 9 was originally used for narrow structures in case of wide structures määttänen 1998 suggested replacing the dimeter d by one or two times of the ice thickness h ice to improve the applicability in this study two times of the ice thickness is utilized then the dynamic ice load is determined as 10 f i c e t a σ c σ v i c e x t through eq 7 to eq 10 one can find that the ice load is proportional to the ice crushing strength when the contact area of ice is constant therefore the change of crushing strength results in ice force fluctuations which depends largely on the stiffness of the structure and the ice velocity from eq 8 and eq 9 it can be found that the stress rate becomes negative and the crushing strength decreases to zero when the velocity of the structure at the waterline is temporarily higher than the ice speed this indicates that a gap between the ice and the structure occurs and thus the ice force is zero at this moment as this paper mainly focuses on the fli vibration of the wind turbines no amendment of the määttänen blenkarn model is made at higher ice velocity in the present study due to lack of detailed sea ice data instead this will be helpful to determine the upper bound of ice speed corresponding to the ductile brittle transition i e it is unnecessary to continue increasing the ice velocity when searching for the range of ice velocity that causes the fli vibration 3 3 coupled analysis program the equation of motion eom of the owt in ice covered water can be written as 11 m x c x k x f i c e t f c u r r e n t t f wind t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the owt respectively variables x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement response vector of the owt f ice and f current represent the dynamic ice load and the current drag force respectively f wind represents the wind aerodynamic load on the blades which can be calculated based on the bem theory as described above in the paper when the owt is equipped with a 3d ptmd eq 11 can be changed as 12 m x c x k x f i c e t f c u r r e n t t f wind t f d a m p t f i n e r t i a t where f damp and f inertia are the damping force and inertia force resulting from the 3d ptmd motion which is elaborated in section 5 2 1 since f ice in eq 11 and eq 12 is a function of the velocity response of the wind turbine structure at msl iterations are needed to solve the eom to determine the structural response a coupled analysis program is developed in this paper and the detailed solution process is shown in fig 7 4 numerical model 4 1 general configuration in this study the nrel 5 mw reference otw model is used it is supported by a baseline monopile foundation developed in the second phase of the offshore code comparison oc3 project jonkman et al 2010 conducted by nrel as shown in fig 8 in fig 8 a the tower placed on the top of a transition piece 10 m above the msl has a height of 87 6 m the nacelle is supported by the tower and its elevation is 90 m above the msl it is attached to a 3 m diameter hub which connects to a 63 m radius 3 bladed rotor the substructure spans from an elevation of 10 m to the mudline with a water depth of 20 m and the monopile embedment depth is 34 m other main properties of this baseline owt are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 8 a the global coordinate system originates at the intersection of the monopile center and the msl the x and y axis of the coordinate system is perpendicular and parallel to the blade rotating plane respectively and the right handed coordinate system is used the wind ice misaligned angle is denoted by β a 3d ptmd is installed at the tower top to attenuate the response of the structure as illustrated in fig 8 a when the wind turbine is subjected to misaligned wind current and ice loading the tower will undergo bi directional vibrations and the pendulum will move along the spherical surface fig 8 b to absorb the kinetic energy of the tower a local coordinate system x p y p z p o p is established originating at the static equilibrium position of the pendulum viscous dampers are introduced to dissipate the absorbed kinetic energy as shown in fig 8 c ball hinge connections are used at both ends of the dampers 4 2 finite element model fig 9 illustrates the whole finite element model of the otw coupled with 3d ptmd established using ansys as shown in fig 9 a the blade is modeled by elastic euler bernoulli beam elements and the detailed parameters can be found in ref jonkman et al 2009 the nacelle and hub are modeled using the beam4 element the weights of the nacelle and hub are simulated via the mass21 element at their centers of gravity beam188 is adopted to model the tower considering its tapered section pipe59 is used to model the substructure and the added hydrodynamic mass is considered the modulus of elasticity of the tower and substructure material is 210 gpa and the density is 8500 kg m3 to account for the additional mass of paint flanges bolts etc the 3d ptmd is modeled using one link180 element one mass21 element and two combin14 elements one is parallel and the other is perpendicular to x p z p plane which correspond to the pendulum length mass and viscous dampers of the 3d ptmd respectively as shown in fig 9 b the top end of the link element is connected to the tower top with three translational degrees of freedoms coupled with the tower top node the other end is used to build the mass of the pendulum for the two combin14 elements nodes i are completely coupled six degrees of freedoms to the nearest node of the tower and the other ends are connected to the pendulum mass see fig 9 lumped parameter model lpm is employed to consider the soil and structure interaction ssi referring to carswell et al 2015 the pile is simplified to be a rigid bar with a length of l e as shown in fig 9 c the soil effects are represented by a translational spring with stiffness coefficients k x x and a rotational spring with coefficient k x φ located at the end of the rigid bar a viscous rotational dash pot damper with coefficient c x φ is introduced at the mudline to represent viscous damping from cyclic pile soil interaction the subscript x refers to horizontal in plane translation degree of freedom and the φ refers to the in plane rotational degree of freedom in xz plane the lpm properties k x x k x φ c x φ and l e are 3 89 109 n m 1 14 1011 nm rad 9 34 108 nm s rad and 7 6 m respectively carswell et al 2015 as the soil around the pile is assumed to be axisymmetric its properties in yz plane are the same as in xz plane 4 3 modal properties under different conditions modal analysis of the owt is implemented with and without considering the ssi effects the first ten mode shapes are illustrated in fig 10 table 2 tabulates the calculated natural frequencies of the first ten modes of the owt with different boundary conditions in table 2 the first two modes almost symmetric in side side and fore aft directions are the tower fundamental mode the 3rd to the 5th modes are the blade flapwise fundamental mode and the 6th to 8th modes are the blade edgewise fundamental mode the 9th to 10th modes are the blade flapwise second mode shape when considering the ssi the natural frequencies of the tower are decreased by around 9 7 compared with the fixed boundary condition scenario which agrees well with the results presented in jonkman et al 2010 in comparison consideration of ssi brings minor changes to the natural frequencies of the blade modes 4 4 description of environment conditions the location where the zhuang he offshore wind farm is constructed in the bohai sea area is selected for analysis in this paper the location and ice conditions are shown in fig 11 the solid black pentagram in fig 11 a represents the offshore wind farm location the sea surface is covered by ice during the severe ice period as observed at one of the stations near the farm as shown in fig 11 b and the average severe ice period lasts about 39 days according to the field monitoring statistical data from the national marine environmental monitoring center the site specific level ice thickness ranges from 2 cm to 7 cm in the one year return period as shown in fig 11 c the reckoned maximum ice thickness is 32 cm in the 50 year return period which is much larger than the recommended value of 20 4 cm in the specification q hsn 3000 2002 in the present paper two representative ice thicknesses the normal ice thickness of 7 cm and the extreme ice thickness of 32 cm are considered according to the monitoring data in the target sea area the misalignment between wind and ice loading occurs for a general case four representative wind ice misalignment angles 0 30 60 90 are considered to assess the wind ice loading induced vibration and the performance of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the structural responses as shown in fig 8 wind velocity is perpendicular to the rotation plane and the ice direction changes from 0 to 90 with 30 as an interval hub height mean wind velocity is 12 m s with a turbulence intensity of 10 the current load is taken into account the direction of the current load is assumed to be identical with the floating ice a linear profile is employed to calculate the current load acting on the substructure with the surface velocity set as the ice velocity and the bottom velocity equal to zero 5 results 5 1 response and fli vibration analysis of uncontrolled wind turbine a self excited vibration coupled analysis program is developed based on ansys apdl and the määttänen blenkarn model the total simulation time is 300s and the time step is set to be 0 01 s to search for the fli vibration conditions different ice velocities increased from 0 01 m s with a velocity step of 0 01 m s until the fli vibration disappears and the ice tends to brittle crushing are chosen to calculate the wind turbine responses fig 12 illustrates the displacement responses of the tower top under different ice velocities when β is 0 and the ice thickness is 7 cm as shown in fig 12 a the displacement response of the tower top in the fore aft direction is low when the ice velocity is 0 01 m s the approximate steady state response occurs when the ice velocity is between 0 02 m s and 0 06 m s and the response magnitude is gradually increased as the ice velocity increases signaling that the fli vibration occurs when the ice velocity falls in this range when the ice velocity reaches 0 07 m s one can find that the structural response decreases and finally stays at a low level indicating that the fli vibration vanishes when the ice velocity goes beyond v ice 0 06 m s from fig 12 b it can be found that the structural responses of tower top in the side side direction are smaller compared with the fore aft direction and the time response histories are almost identical under different ice velocities because only tangential wind loads are applied in this direction fig 13 shows the bi directional displacement response time histories of the owt base under different ice velocities similar to the results presented in fig 12 the foundation displacement response increases as the ice velocity increases and reaches the maximum when v ice 0 06 m s after that the foundation dynamic response decreases when the ice velocity further increases also one can find that the response frequency of the tower base is different from that of the tower top when the ice velocity increases to 0 07 m s in which the response frequency is much higher than that of the tower top detailed discussions are presented in the following frequency domain analysis results fig 14 and fig 15 illustrate the displacement responses of the tower top and base when the ice thickness is 32 cm and β is 0 only 5 typical ice velocities are shown the history responses of other cases are similar to v ice 0 05 m s and are not shown in this paper as shown in figs 14 a and fig 15 a similar observations can be made as in figs 12 a and fig 13 a where the ice thickness is 7 cm in fig 14 a when the ice velocity is 0 02 m s the structural response is minimal when the ice velocity gradually increases from 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s the structural response increases significantly and exhibits steady state characteristics when the ice velocity increases beyond 0 09 m s the response of the owt decreases dramatically to a low level obviously these changes are due to the mechanism of the svt comparing figs 14 a and fig 15 a one can find that the vibration frequency of the tower base is different from that of the tower top after the ice velocity is higher than 0 03 m s especially when the velocity is 0 10 m s whose vibration frequency is much higher than that of the tower top more details are discussed in the following frequency domain analysis results comparing the case of 32 cm ice thickness with the case of 7 cm one can find that the ice velocities that cause the fli of the owt are different fig 16 presents the fourier spectrum of the displacement time histories of the tower top the base and the corresponding ice loading in the fore aft direction under the two ice thickness scenarios when the ice thickness is 7 cm as shown in fig 16 a one can observe that the frequencies of the ice load distribute in a range of 0 05 hz 1 4 hz when the ice velocity is 0 01 m s and the dominant frequencies are 0 56 hz and 0 75 hz respectively when the ice velocity is larger than 0 01 m s between 0 02 m s and 0 06 m s the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacements is 0 28 hz also the fourier spectra of the ice loads in these cases show that large energy is cumulated at 0 28 hz signaling that the fli vibration occurs and the ice loads are locked at the first mode frequency of the wind turbine for instance when the ice velocity is 0 03 m s the dominant frequency of the ice load is 0 28 hz and the other peak frequencies are multiples of 0 28 hz when the ice velocity increases to 0 07 m s one can observe that the dominant frequency of tower top displacement response becomes 0 2 hz which is the dominant frequency of the wind load as shown in fig 4 in this case the main frequency of the ice load becomes 1 47 hz which is off from any mode natural frequencies as a result the ice load caused by this ice velocity of 0 07 m s has weak effect on the structural response of the tower top which is also demonstrated in fig 12 a when the wind turbine is subjected to extreme ice condition with an ice thickness of 32 cm similar frequency domain characteristics of tower top and base displacement and ice loading can also be found in fig 16 b one can find that the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacement response is 0 2 hz when the ice velocity is smaller than 0 02 m s which matches the 1 p rotational frequency of the wind turbine when the ice velocity is between 0 03 m s and 0 09 m s the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacements is 0 28 hz also the fourier spectra of the ice loads in these cases illustrate that large energy is cumulated at 0 28 hz as a result fli vibration occurs and the ice loads are locked at the first mode frequency of the wind turbine in addition it can be observed in fig 16 b that the tower base displacement response fourier spectra have other dominant frequency components besides 0 28 hz which is also shown in fig 15 and mentioned in previous discussions when the ice velocity increases to 0 1 m s the dominant frequency of tower top displacement response becomes 0 2 hz which is similar to the conclusion in fig 16 a when v ice is 0 07 m s to comprehensively show the wind ice loads induced tower top response and the fli phenomenon the amplitude of the tower top displacement time history under selected wind ice misalignment angles are shown in fig 17 where the domain enclosed by solid black lines denotes the cases that the fli vibration occurs through comparing fig 17 a with fig 17 b one can find that the range of ice velocity causing fli is wider under the extreme ice thickness of 32 cm than that under the normal ice thickness of 7 cm it also can be observed that when the ice thickness is smaller the misaligned angle has a remarkable effect on the domain where the fli happens for example the ice velocity range causing the fli is 0 02 0 06 m s when β is 0 in comparison the range is reduced to 0 02 0 03 m s when β is 90 the ice velocity range causing fli is slightly changed from 0 03 0 09 m s to 0 04 0 08 m s when β changes to 90 moreover one can find in fig 17 that the response amplitude of the tower top corresponding to the fli scenarios are more significant than that of other cases it should be noted that the maximal response amplitude is 1 425 m when the ice thickness is 7 cm and it is slightly smaller than of the peak value 1 454 m when the ice thickness is 32 cm this indicates that significant structural response occurs and poses a severe threat to the performance and safety of owts even when the ice thickness is not severe therefore effective vibration control measures are necessary for the owts located in the ice infested waters 5 2 response of controlled wind turbine under misaligned wind and ice loading 5 2 1 optimum design of the 3d ptmd to mitigate the significant fli vibration of the owt under wind and ice loading the 3d ptmd is utilized in this paper the process of tuning the 3d ptmd consists of defining values for its stiffness and damping in terms of the mass ratio between the absorber and the main structure the optimal design parameters of the 3d ptmd can be obtained by numerical search methods as it is time consuming to search the optimal design parameters and the fitting expression of the optimal frequency ratio f o and damping ratioζ o of the 3d ptmd with respect to the mass ratio μ has been provided based on the previous research by the author sun and jahangiri 2018 therefore the design parameters are directly determined by utilizing the fitting expression in ref sun et al 2018 which is given as 13 f o 7 6 μ 2 2 5 μ 1 ξ o 2 7 μ 2 μ 0 062 where μ is the mass ratio which is defined as the ratio of the 3d ptmd mass to the total mass of the owt furthermore the optimum length and damping coefficient of the pendulum can be determined by 14 l p g 2 π f p 2 c p x c p y 4 π f p m p ς o where g is the acceleration of gravity l p is the length of the pendulum f p is the frequency of the 3d ptmd m p is the mass of the 3d ptmd and c px c px is the damping coefficient of the damper in x and y direction respectively the 3d ptmd frequency is tuned based on the fundamental frequency of the structure considering the ssi which is 0 289 hz considering the limited space of the tower top sun et al 2018 μ is set to 2 in this paper and the calculated pendulum mass m p is 13 9 t using eq 13 one can obtain that f o is 0 95 andζ o is 0 081 then the frequency of the pendulum f p is 0 274 hz with these parameters selected the performance of the 3d ptmd will be evaluated when the owt is subjected to wind and ice loading 5 2 2 response comparison of the owt with and without the 3d ptmd fig 18 illustrates the displacement response histories of the wind turbine with and without the 3d ptmd when fli happens taking the case of v ice 0 08 m s h ice 32 cm and β 0 as an example one can clearly observe in fig 18 that both the vibration of the tower top nacelle and base foundation are dramatically reduced when the 3d ptmd is used to further exam the bi directional mitigation performance of the 3d ptmd the motion trajectory of the tower top nacelle with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misaligned wind and ice loading are presented in fig 19 the ice thickness is 32 cm and ice velocity is 0 08 m s it is found in fig 19 a that the side side displacement is minimal when wind and ice loading are aligned in comparison the trajectory of the tower top nacelle becomes more complex as the wind ice misaligned angle increased as shown in fig 19 b d respectively through comparison one can clearly find in fig 19 that the 3d ptmd can dramatically mitigate the motion of the tower top nacelle both in the fore aft and the side side directions the tower base bi directional response with and without the 3d ptmd under different wind ice misalignment angles are presented in fig 20 a d respectively it can be observed that the 3d ptmd can significantly reduce the vibration of the tower base in all the four different misalignment angles 5 2 3 response reduction evaluation of the 3d ptmd to further quantitatively evaluate the mitigation effect of 3d ptmd the peak and root mean square rms reduction ratio of the tower top and base displacement are calculated as following 15 r p e a k d w o p e a k d w p e a k d w o 100 r r m s d w o r m s d w r m s d w o r m s 100 where the r prek and r rms represent the peak and root mean square rms response reduction ratio of the owt respectively d w p e a k d w o p e a k are the displacement peak of the owt and d w r m s d w o r m s are the rms of the owt with and without the 3d ptmd respectively the results of r prek and r rms of the tower top and base displacement are calculated for all the simulated scenarios and shown in fig 21 to fig 24 in fig 21 a one can find that the 3d ptmd can reduce the tower top nacelle fore aft peak response when the ice thickness is 7 cm and the maximal reduction ratio is 51 8 the rms responses in the fore aft direction can be dramatically mitigated in almost all the cases especially for the fli cases in which the maximal reduction ratio is 93 7 as shown in fig 21 c as shown in fig 21 b and d the peak and rms responses in the side side direction can be attenuated by up to 62 8 and 87 7 respectively one can also find that in some cases the 3d ptmd has slight adverse impacts on the wind turbine in the side side direction however it should be noted that these cases are the non frequency lock in cases which means the wind turbine is at low vibration levels therefore the negative influence caused by 3d ptmd is not obvious fig 22 a d illustrates the reduction effect of the 3d ptmd on the tower base under the normal ice thickness one can clearly find that the 3d ptmd can also have positive impacts on mitigating the tower base vibration especially for the fli cases the peak and rms of the tower base displacement can be reduced maximally by 41 3 and 77 9 in the fore aft direction and by 58 5 and 77 8 in the side side direction respectively similar mitigating effects can be found both on the tower top nacelle and tower base foundation response under the extreme ice condition h ice 32 cm as shown in fig 23 and fig 24 compared with fig 21 it can be found that the 3d ptmd exerts better performance in the tower top nacelle fluctuation control when the ice thickness is 32 cm it can reduce the tower top nacelle fore aft peak response maximally by 52 5 and by 77 9 in the side side direction and the rms can be reduced by 94 7 and 95 5 in the fore aft and side side directions respectively as illustrated in fig 24 a d both the peak and rms response of the tower base foundation in bi direction are mitigated the maximum reduction ratio of the tower base fore aft peak and rms side side peak and rms are 42 2 86 8 66 8 and 91 5 respectively the adverse impacts both on the tower top and base response are also observed in figs 23 and 24 as explained before the negative effect is minimal 6 conclusions the present paper characterizes iiv of a 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine and finds the critical ice conditions ice thickness and the corresponding velocities causing the fli phenomenon a 3d ptmd is used to mitigate the significant structural response of the owt under wind and ice loading when fli happens a couple program based on the määttänen blenkarn model is developed to simulate the interaction between the substructure and the floating ice based on the presented results and discussion the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the ice frequency is locked at the first mode of the owt both under one year and fifty year return period ice conditions in the bohai sea the range of ice velocity causing the fli vibration is from 0 01 m s to 0 06 m s when the ice thickness is 7 cm and changes to 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s when the ice thickness is 32 cm the developed method and the obtained results can be used for analysis and design of monopile owts to be constructed in ice prone marine area 2 although misaligned angles β influences the distribution and range of ice velocities causing fli vibration the fli phenomenon is observed in all the four misaligned angles between wind and ice loadings therefore bi directional vibration control measures should be taken for the owts in ice infested water 3 when fli happens the 3d ptmd can dramatically mitigate the bi directional response of the owt under misaligned wind and ice loading the rms and peak responses of the nacelle tower top and tower base can be significantly mitigated especially for the fli scenarios the rms and peak response of the tower top can be reduced by up to 95 5 and 77 9 and by 91 5 and 66 8 for the tower base in summary if conditions are met fli will happen to monopile owt subjected to ice loading regardless of normal or extreme ice conditions a well designed 3d ptmd can effectively mitigate the iiv of the owts in the icing sea area without installing ice breaking cones it is noted that as a passive control strategy the 3d ptmd might lose part of its effectiveness when the locked frequency is off the target frequency therefore an adaptive control strategy which can accommodate ice loading variations and uncertainties will be studied in

21199,offshore wind turbines owts are vulnerable to ice induced vibrations iiv when they are located in ice prone regions with drifting sea ice the ice induced frequency lock in fli phenomenon will cause excessive vibration and fatigue damage of owts the present study characterizes the ice induced fli of owts under various ice conditions through coupled analysis and mitigates the significant fli response using a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 3d ptmd based on the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline monopile owt model a numerical model of the owt with a 3d ptmd is established wherein the interaction between the blades and the tower is modeled and soil effect is considered aerodynamic loading is computed using the blade element momentum bem method where the prandtl s tip loss factor and the glauert correction are considered a coupled simulation program based on määttänen blenkarn model is developed to simulate ice structure interactions different ice velocities thicknesses and attack angles in the bohai sea are chosen to study the ice structure interactions and characterize the fli research results show that the fli of the monopile owt occurs when the ice velocity is between 0 01 m s to 0 06 m s and the ice thickness is 7 cm and 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s when the ice thickness is 32 cm when the fli happens the 3d ptmd has significant effectiveness in mitigating the root mean square and peak response of the nacelle tower and the foundation in fore aft and side side directions the present study enhances the understanding of ice induced fli and provides a feasible solution for vibration control of owts in ice prone areas keywords offshore wind turbines ice induced vibration response mitigation pendulum tuned mass damper 1 introduction with the depletion of fossil resources and the huge demand for green energy the development of renewable and sustainable energy is becoming increasingly attractive gipe 2018 as a promising renewable energy source offshore wind energy sector is experiencing rapid growth globally due to its advantages such as higher wind speeds lower turbulences less visual impacts and noise pollution compared with onshore wind power jahangiri and sun 2019 in 2019 the global offshore wind power capacity was increased by 6 1 gw an increase of 35 5 compared with 2018 many of the offshore wind farms are located in cold regions e g danish waters the baltic sea and the china bohai sea in the past decade offshore wind energy has increased rapidly in china and a total capacity of 2 4 gw offshore wind farms were installed in the china sea region by 2019 council gwe 2020 recently china started to construct offshore wind farms in the bohai sea due to the rich wind resources shallow water and low penetration of wind energy sector in this area tian et al 2019 however the annually frozen condition in the bohai sea poses a huge threat to the structural safety of the owts and adversely affects their power generation performance one of the main concerns for the engineering community in cold areas with ice infested water is the significant ice loading and ice induced vibration to mitigate ice induced vibrations iivs several solutions have been proposed a common approach is to install cones at the ice structure interface which is widely used in offshore oil gas platforms huang et al 2013 yue et al 2000 the ice breaking cone can reduce the ice load acting on the structure by changing the ice failure mode from crushing failure to bending failure however it does not fundamentally solve the iiv issues and the remaining ice force can cause severe tower vibrations mróz et al 2008 furthermore excessive vibration may still occur due to periodic ice loading caused by the intermittent fracture of ice sheets colliding the conical structure and the ice induced frequency lock in fli may occur when the ice loading frequency resonates with the structural natural frequency in addition the tower diameters of monopile owts are usually between 3 m and 8 m which will render the maximum diameter of the cones mounted on the monopile as large as 10 m causing ice to accumulate more easily when the ice accumulation happens it will increase the ice loading dramatically which is severely harmful to the safety of the owt also designing ice cones for jacket type owts is challenging as the distance between the legs at the mean sea level msl is much smaller than that of the offshore oil platforms there is not enough clear distance for crushed ice drifts through the jacket if each leg is equipped with an ice cone another solution to mitigate iiv of owts in ice covered sea areas is to use various types of dampers which has been widely studied and applied in civil structures such as high rise buildings reinforced concrete structures and bridges hoang et al 2016 khodaie 2020 li et al 2011 in recent years the vibration control techniques have been studied to protect owts murtagh et al 2008 studied the control of the wind turbine along wind vibration using a passive tuned mass damper tmd it was found that the passive tmd can effectively suppress the fore aft response of the wind turbine tower under the random wind loading buckley et al 2018 used a tuned liquid column damper tlcd to control the structural vibration of wind turbines considering the soil structure interaction the authors concluded that tlcd is a viable method in the vibration control of owt zhang et al 2014 investigated the performance of roller damper for mitigation of edgewise vibration in rotating wind turbine blades research findings indicated that the damper can effectively reduce the structural response of wind turbine blades zuo et al 2017 proposed using multiple tuned mass dampers mtmds to control the multiple modal vibrations of offshore wind turbine tower under multiple hazards it was shown that mtmds can effectively control both the fundamental and higher vibration modes and enhance the control effectiveness jahangiri and sun 2020 used a 3d ptmd and dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers 2ptmds to mitigate three dimensional vibrations of a spar type floating owt under wind and wave loadings the author found that the 2ptmds experienced a smaller stroke than that of traditional linear tmds ghassempour et al 2019 investigated load mitigation of the nrel 5 mw monopile owt using an omnidirectional tmd under operational and parked rotor conditions the results demonstrated that the wind velocity in operational condition shall be considered on the tuning frequency of the tmd to attain the optimal reduction of structural vibrations semi active tmds stmd are also investigated in the vibration control of owts by many researchers due to their ability to retuning natural frequencies and damping properties arrigan et al 2011 carried out research into the effectiveness of the stmds in reducing flapwise vibrations of wind turbine blades and found that stmds could achieve significant reduction when the blades dynamic parameters changed sun 2018a 2018b compared the stmd with the traditional tmd and found that the stmd demonstrated consistent effectiveness in controlling the response of owt under multi hazards such as wind wave and earthquake and damage while existing literature in this area has made remarkable progress toward dynamics modeling and mitigation of owts few of them have considered ice loading and iiv mitigation which is critically important for owts located in cold marine regions shi et al 2016 proposed a semi empirical ice load model and investigated the influence of ice loads on a monopile type owt and found that ice loads could induce significant vibrations to the wind turbine heinonen et al 2011 utilized the simulation platform onwind simulated the interaction between level ice and two monopile type owts with different structural stiffness and found that both owts were sensitive on fli vibration depending on ice velocity the author further developed two submodules icefloe and icedyn heinonen et al 2017 and integrated the models with the aero hydro elastic fast code jonkman et al 2005 to enhance the cost efficient owt structural design in terms of the vibration control of owts in regions with cold climates kärnä et al 2004 utilized a tmd to mitigate the remaining vibration of a slender owt mounted with ice breaking cone on the waterline and found that the remaining vibration can be further reduced after installing the tmd ye et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of the ice breaking cone and the tmd for reducing aerodynamic and ice loading acting on the monopile owt their results indicated that tmd could mitigate the side side vibration while it is ineffective in reducing the structural response in the fore aft direction when the ice breaking cone is not mounted on the owt in reality the ice drifting direction is mainly influenced by wind and current directions owts always suffer from bi directional vibration fore aft and side side due to vortex induced cross wind vibration or misalignment between wind and wave ice however most of the existing literature only focuses on unidirectional response mitigation to mitigate the bi directional vibrations simultaneously sun et al 2018 2019a 2019b proposed a 3d ptmd to control the excessive vibration of the owt in fore aft and side side directions the authors validated the effectiveness of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the bi directional vibration of the monopile owt under wind wave and seismic loading however ice loading was not taken into consideration in these studies to mitigate ice induced vibration this paper further investigates ice induced fli of an nrel 5 mw monopile owt and bi directional vibration mitigation of the owt subjected to combined ice and wind loading novelty of the present study is on one hand characterizing the ice induced fli of the owt under various ice conditions ice velocity and thickness via a coupled analysis program to simulate the ice structure interaction on the other hand effectiveness of a 3d ptmd in mitigating the iiv in the case of fli is evaluated in this paper the aerodynamic loading is computed using the blade element momentum bem method and the ice loading is simulated using a coupled analysis program based on the määttänen blenkarn model structural response characteristics under various ice conditions are analyzed and the critical ice conditions that cause the occurrence of fli are identified to mitigate the large structural response in the case of fli an integrated iiv analysis model coupled with a 3d ptmd is established using ansys performance of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the iiv in fore aft and side side directions is examined under different wind ice misalignment angles results show that the 3d ptmd is effective in mitigating the bi directional vibration caused by wind and ice loading and it is found that the 3d ptmd is suitable for practical application the present paper is structured as follows in the second part the turbulent wind field and bem theory are described and the simulated aerodynamic loads on the blades are presented in the third part the characteristics of ice structure interaction are discussed and the coupled analysis program developed base on self excited vibration model is depicted modeling and modal results of the nrel 5 mw monopile owt and the ice environmental conditions are described in the fourth part the fifth part investigates the dynamic response of the owt under different ice velocities and thicknesses presents characteristics of the ice induced fli and examines the performance of the 3d ptmd in the mitigation of iiv conclusions are discussed in the final part 2 aerodynamic loads at present several methods have been developed to estimate the aerodynamic load on the owts including bem theory actuator line model alm general dynamic wake gdw and computational fluid dynamics cfd method wan et al 2017 the classic bem method is adopted in the present study 2 1 turbulent wind the steady wind field rarely exists in the real marine environment to compute the aerodynamic load realistically and accurately the iec kaimal spectral model is employed to represent the wind turbulence firstly which is given by 1 s w f w 4 i 2 l c 1 6 f w l c v 5 3 where s w f w is the power spectrum density function f w is the wind frequency in hz i is the wind turbulence intensity v is mean velocity and l c is an integral scale parameter in the present research the logarithmic wind speed profile is adopted to calculate the mean velocity the cross spectrum is implemented to account for the spatial dependency of wind velocity at different points which is described by the following equation 2 s i j f w c o h i j f w s i i f w s j j f w where s ij is the cross spectra between two arbitrary points i and j s ii and s jj are the auto spectra at points i and j respectively referring to the iec spectral mode iec 2009 the spatial coherence function is expressed as 3 c o h i j f w exp a f w l v h u b 0 12 l l c 2 where l is the distance between point i and j on the grid a is the coherence decrement v h u b is the mean wind speed at the hub height based on eqs 1 3 a three dimensional wind field profile covering the domain of the rotor disk is generated using the turbsim program jonkman et al 2012 a 31 31 velocity grids as conceptually illustrated in fig 1 is produced to represent the three dimensional wind field matlab code has been developed to map the full wind field profile onto each span station of the rotating blades 2 2 bem theory the bem theory divides the wind blade into n elements and assumes that there is no dependency along the blade span therefore the aerodynamic force on each element can be calculated independently based on lift and drag coefficients of each airfoil as shown in fig 2 taking the ith blade element to analyze the local velocities and aerodynamic loading acting on the ith section where r is the rotor radius dr and c r are the element span length and the chord length at the element mid span respectively then the relative wind velocity v rel can be expressed as the vector sum of the axial and the tangential velocity i e 4 v r e l v 1 b 2 ω r 1 b 2 where ω is the rotation velocity r is the distance between the ith blade element and the rotor center b and b are the axial velocity and tangential velocity induction factors respectively the lift force dp l which is perpendicular and the drag force dp d which is parallel to the relative velocity can be determined by 5 d p l 1 2 c l ρ v r e l 2 c r d r d p d 1 2 c d ρ v r e l 2 c r d r where ρ is the air density c l and c d are the lift force coefficient and drag force coefficient respectively then the normal and tangential forces dp n and dp t can be calculated by the geometrical relationship with the following equation 6 d p n d p l cos ϕ d p d sin ϕ d p t d p l sin ϕ d p d cos ϕ where ϕ is the flow angle ϕ α θ in which α is the wind attack angel and θ is the summation of the pitch angle and the twist angle which is predetermined by the airfoil eqs 4 6 illustrate the main procedure to obtain the aerodynamic load however in the real application iterations are needed to determine the unknown parameters of b and b therefore a matlab code has been developed to compute the time series of p n and p t in this paper based on the algorithm proposed in ref hansen 2015 randtl s tip loss factor and glauert correction are considered in the matlab code fig 3 demonstrates the aerodynamic loading of one blade corresponding to an average wind speed 12 m s at the hub height and a turbulence intensity of 10 the corresponding frequently characteristics of simulated aerodynamic loadings are calculated and shown in fig 4 it can be found that both the frequency spectrums of the normal and tangential wind forces have peaks at 0 2 hz and multiples of 0 2 hz this is caused by the rotation of the blade as its speed is 12 rpm 3 modeling of ice loading and coupled analysis program 3 1 self excited vibration various ice structure interaction models have been proposed by researchers ye et al 2019 in principle they can be divided into two categories forced vibration first proposed by matlock et al 1971 and self excited vibration theory svt by määttänen 1988 the svt considers the relationship between sea ice compressive strength and stress rate and has been gradually recognized by researchers as more and more experiments and field observations support this theory popko and georgiadou 2015 therefore the svt is adopted to simulate ice structure interaction in this paper as shown in fig 5 based on the svt the ice compressive strength changes nonlinearly and undergoes three phases ductile ductile brittle and brittle crushing as the stress rate increases accordingly ice structure interaction falls into three categories shown in fig 6 1 intermittent crushing of ice with low velocities and a saw tooth load quasi static structural response fig 6 a 2 steady state structural response under intermediate ice velocities fig 6 b 3 continuous brittle crushing of high ice velocity ice with random ice load and structural response fig 6 c määttänen argued that the negative damping during the ice structure interaction causes self excited vibration and fli vibrations are expected to occur in the ductile brittle transition region the red dashed line shown in fig 5 3 2 ice load model of svt määttänen blenkarn model is applied to estimate dynamic ice load on narrow vertical structures based on svt määttänen 1998 blenkarn 1970 in which the compressive strength of ice depends on the relative velocity between the ice and structure at the waterline and the size of the nominal contact area of the ice i e 7 σ c f v i c e x a 0 a where v ice is the ice velocity x is the velocity of the structure at the waterline a is the nominal contact area which is the projected area of the intact ice feature on the structure a 0 is the reference area of 1 m2 based on määttänen 1998 the crushing strength can be calculated as 8 σ c 0 σ 0 a 0 a 2 0 7 8 σ 18 57 σ 2 13 0 σ 3 2 91 σ 4 0 σ 1 3 1 σ 1 3 the stress rate is defined by blenkarn 1970 as 9 σ v i c e x 8 σ 0 π d where σ is ice stress rate and σ 0 is a reference strength which is 2 mpa eq 9 was originally used for narrow structures in case of wide structures määttänen 1998 suggested replacing the dimeter d by one or two times of the ice thickness h ice to improve the applicability in this study two times of the ice thickness is utilized then the dynamic ice load is determined as 10 f i c e t a σ c σ v i c e x t through eq 7 to eq 10 one can find that the ice load is proportional to the ice crushing strength when the contact area of ice is constant therefore the change of crushing strength results in ice force fluctuations which depends largely on the stiffness of the structure and the ice velocity from eq 8 and eq 9 it can be found that the stress rate becomes negative and the crushing strength decreases to zero when the velocity of the structure at the waterline is temporarily higher than the ice speed this indicates that a gap between the ice and the structure occurs and thus the ice force is zero at this moment as this paper mainly focuses on the fli vibration of the wind turbines no amendment of the määttänen blenkarn model is made at higher ice velocity in the present study due to lack of detailed sea ice data instead this will be helpful to determine the upper bound of ice speed corresponding to the ductile brittle transition i e it is unnecessary to continue increasing the ice velocity when searching for the range of ice velocity that causes the fli vibration 3 3 coupled analysis program the equation of motion eom of the owt in ice covered water can be written as 11 m x c x k x f i c e t f c u r r e n t t f wind t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the owt respectively variables x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement response vector of the owt f ice and f current represent the dynamic ice load and the current drag force respectively f wind represents the wind aerodynamic load on the blades which can be calculated based on the bem theory as described above in the paper when the owt is equipped with a 3d ptmd eq 11 can be changed as 12 m x c x k x f i c e t f c u r r e n t t f wind t f d a m p t f i n e r t i a t where f damp and f inertia are the damping force and inertia force resulting from the 3d ptmd motion which is elaborated in section 5 2 1 since f ice in eq 11 and eq 12 is a function of the velocity response of the wind turbine structure at msl iterations are needed to solve the eom to determine the structural response a coupled analysis program is developed in this paper and the detailed solution process is shown in fig 7 4 numerical model 4 1 general configuration in this study the nrel 5 mw reference otw model is used it is supported by a baseline monopile foundation developed in the second phase of the offshore code comparison oc3 project jonkman et al 2010 conducted by nrel as shown in fig 8 in fig 8 a the tower placed on the top of a transition piece 10 m above the msl has a height of 87 6 m the nacelle is supported by the tower and its elevation is 90 m above the msl it is attached to a 3 m diameter hub which connects to a 63 m radius 3 bladed rotor the substructure spans from an elevation of 10 m to the mudline with a water depth of 20 m and the monopile embedment depth is 34 m other main properties of this baseline owt are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 8 a the global coordinate system originates at the intersection of the monopile center and the msl the x and y axis of the coordinate system is perpendicular and parallel to the blade rotating plane respectively and the right handed coordinate system is used the wind ice misaligned angle is denoted by β a 3d ptmd is installed at the tower top to attenuate the response of the structure as illustrated in fig 8 a when the wind turbine is subjected to misaligned wind current and ice loading the tower will undergo bi directional vibrations and the pendulum will move along the spherical surface fig 8 b to absorb the kinetic energy of the tower a local coordinate system x p y p z p o p is established originating at the static equilibrium position of the pendulum viscous dampers are introduced to dissipate the absorbed kinetic energy as shown in fig 8 c ball hinge connections are used at both ends of the dampers 4 2 finite element model fig 9 illustrates the whole finite element model of the otw coupled with 3d ptmd established using ansys as shown in fig 9 a the blade is modeled by elastic euler bernoulli beam elements and the detailed parameters can be found in ref jonkman et al 2009 the nacelle and hub are modeled using the beam4 element the weights of the nacelle and hub are simulated via the mass21 element at their centers of gravity beam188 is adopted to model the tower considering its tapered section pipe59 is used to model the substructure and the added hydrodynamic mass is considered the modulus of elasticity of the tower and substructure material is 210 gpa and the density is 8500 kg m3 to account for the additional mass of paint flanges bolts etc the 3d ptmd is modeled using one link180 element one mass21 element and two combin14 elements one is parallel and the other is perpendicular to x p z p plane which correspond to the pendulum length mass and viscous dampers of the 3d ptmd respectively as shown in fig 9 b the top end of the link element is connected to the tower top with three translational degrees of freedoms coupled with the tower top node the other end is used to build the mass of the pendulum for the two combin14 elements nodes i are completely coupled six degrees of freedoms to the nearest node of the tower and the other ends are connected to the pendulum mass see fig 9 lumped parameter model lpm is employed to consider the soil and structure interaction ssi referring to carswell et al 2015 the pile is simplified to be a rigid bar with a length of l e as shown in fig 9 c the soil effects are represented by a translational spring with stiffness coefficients k x x and a rotational spring with coefficient k x φ located at the end of the rigid bar a viscous rotational dash pot damper with coefficient c x φ is introduced at the mudline to represent viscous damping from cyclic pile soil interaction the subscript x refers to horizontal in plane translation degree of freedom and the φ refers to the in plane rotational degree of freedom in xz plane the lpm properties k x x k x φ c x φ and l e are 3 89 109 n m 1 14 1011 nm rad 9 34 108 nm s rad and 7 6 m respectively carswell et al 2015 as the soil around the pile is assumed to be axisymmetric its properties in yz plane are the same as in xz plane 4 3 modal properties under different conditions modal analysis of the owt is implemented with and without considering the ssi effects the first ten mode shapes are illustrated in fig 10 table 2 tabulates the calculated natural frequencies of the first ten modes of the owt with different boundary conditions in table 2 the first two modes almost symmetric in side side and fore aft directions are the tower fundamental mode the 3rd to the 5th modes are the blade flapwise fundamental mode and the 6th to 8th modes are the blade edgewise fundamental mode the 9th to 10th modes are the blade flapwise second mode shape when considering the ssi the natural frequencies of the tower are decreased by around 9 7 compared with the fixed boundary condition scenario which agrees well with the results presented in jonkman et al 2010 in comparison consideration of ssi brings minor changes to the natural frequencies of the blade modes 4 4 description of environment conditions the location where the zhuang he offshore wind farm is constructed in the bohai sea area is selected for analysis in this paper the location and ice conditions are shown in fig 11 the solid black pentagram in fig 11 a represents the offshore wind farm location the sea surface is covered by ice during the severe ice period as observed at one of the stations near the farm as shown in fig 11 b and the average severe ice period lasts about 39 days according to the field monitoring statistical data from the national marine environmental monitoring center the site specific level ice thickness ranges from 2 cm to 7 cm in the one year return period as shown in fig 11 c the reckoned maximum ice thickness is 32 cm in the 50 year return period which is much larger than the recommended value of 20 4 cm in the specification q hsn 3000 2002 in the present paper two representative ice thicknesses the normal ice thickness of 7 cm and the extreme ice thickness of 32 cm are considered according to the monitoring data in the target sea area the misalignment between wind and ice loading occurs for a general case four representative wind ice misalignment angles 0 30 60 90 are considered to assess the wind ice loading induced vibration and the performance of the 3d ptmd in mitigating the structural responses as shown in fig 8 wind velocity is perpendicular to the rotation plane and the ice direction changes from 0 to 90 with 30 as an interval hub height mean wind velocity is 12 m s with a turbulence intensity of 10 the current load is taken into account the direction of the current load is assumed to be identical with the floating ice a linear profile is employed to calculate the current load acting on the substructure with the surface velocity set as the ice velocity and the bottom velocity equal to zero 5 results 5 1 response and fli vibration analysis of uncontrolled wind turbine a self excited vibration coupled analysis program is developed based on ansys apdl and the määttänen blenkarn model the total simulation time is 300s and the time step is set to be 0 01 s to search for the fli vibration conditions different ice velocities increased from 0 01 m s with a velocity step of 0 01 m s until the fli vibration disappears and the ice tends to brittle crushing are chosen to calculate the wind turbine responses fig 12 illustrates the displacement responses of the tower top under different ice velocities when β is 0 and the ice thickness is 7 cm as shown in fig 12 a the displacement response of the tower top in the fore aft direction is low when the ice velocity is 0 01 m s the approximate steady state response occurs when the ice velocity is between 0 02 m s and 0 06 m s and the response magnitude is gradually increased as the ice velocity increases signaling that the fli vibration occurs when the ice velocity falls in this range when the ice velocity reaches 0 07 m s one can find that the structural response decreases and finally stays at a low level indicating that the fli vibration vanishes when the ice velocity goes beyond v ice 0 06 m s from fig 12 b it can be found that the structural responses of tower top in the side side direction are smaller compared with the fore aft direction and the time response histories are almost identical under different ice velocities because only tangential wind loads are applied in this direction fig 13 shows the bi directional displacement response time histories of the owt base under different ice velocities similar to the results presented in fig 12 the foundation displacement response increases as the ice velocity increases and reaches the maximum when v ice 0 06 m s after that the foundation dynamic response decreases when the ice velocity further increases also one can find that the response frequency of the tower base is different from that of the tower top when the ice velocity increases to 0 07 m s in which the response frequency is much higher than that of the tower top detailed discussions are presented in the following frequency domain analysis results fig 14 and fig 15 illustrate the displacement responses of the tower top and base when the ice thickness is 32 cm and β is 0 only 5 typical ice velocities are shown the history responses of other cases are similar to v ice 0 05 m s and are not shown in this paper as shown in figs 14 a and fig 15 a similar observations can be made as in figs 12 a and fig 13 a where the ice thickness is 7 cm in fig 14 a when the ice velocity is 0 02 m s the structural response is minimal when the ice velocity gradually increases from 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s the structural response increases significantly and exhibits steady state characteristics when the ice velocity increases beyond 0 09 m s the response of the owt decreases dramatically to a low level obviously these changes are due to the mechanism of the svt comparing figs 14 a and fig 15 a one can find that the vibration frequency of the tower base is different from that of the tower top after the ice velocity is higher than 0 03 m s especially when the velocity is 0 10 m s whose vibration frequency is much higher than that of the tower top more details are discussed in the following frequency domain analysis results comparing the case of 32 cm ice thickness with the case of 7 cm one can find that the ice velocities that cause the fli of the owt are different fig 16 presents the fourier spectrum of the displacement time histories of the tower top the base and the corresponding ice loading in the fore aft direction under the two ice thickness scenarios when the ice thickness is 7 cm as shown in fig 16 a one can observe that the frequencies of the ice load distribute in a range of 0 05 hz 1 4 hz when the ice velocity is 0 01 m s and the dominant frequencies are 0 56 hz and 0 75 hz respectively when the ice velocity is larger than 0 01 m s between 0 02 m s and 0 06 m s the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacements is 0 28 hz also the fourier spectra of the ice loads in these cases show that large energy is cumulated at 0 28 hz signaling that the fli vibration occurs and the ice loads are locked at the first mode frequency of the wind turbine for instance when the ice velocity is 0 03 m s the dominant frequency of the ice load is 0 28 hz and the other peak frequencies are multiples of 0 28 hz when the ice velocity increases to 0 07 m s one can observe that the dominant frequency of tower top displacement response becomes 0 2 hz which is the dominant frequency of the wind load as shown in fig 4 in this case the main frequency of the ice load becomes 1 47 hz which is off from any mode natural frequencies as a result the ice load caused by this ice velocity of 0 07 m s has weak effect on the structural response of the tower top which is also demonstrated in fig 12 a when the wind turbine is subjected to extreme ice condition with an ice thickness of 32 cm similar frequency domain characteristics of tower top and base displacement and ice loading can also be found in fig 16 b one can find that the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacement response is 0 2 hz when the ice velocity is smaller than 0 02 m s which matches the 1 p rotational frequency of the wind turbine when the ice velocity is between 0 03 m s and 0 09 m s the dominant frequency of the tower top and base displacements is 0 28 hz also the fourier spectra of the ice loads in these cases illustrate that large energy is cumulated at 0 28 hz as a result fli vibration occurs and the ice loads are locked at the first mode frequency of the wind turbine in addition it can be observed in fig 16 b that the tower base displacement response fourier spectra have other dominant frequency components besides 0 28 hz which is also shown in fig 15 and mentioned in previous discussions when the ice velocity increases to 0 1 m s the dominant frequency of tower top displacement response becomes 0 2 hz which is similar to the conclusion in fig 16 a when v ice is 0 07 m s to comprehensively show the wind ice loads induced tower top response and the fli phenomenon the amplitude of the tower top displacement time history under selected wind ice misalignment angles are shown in fig 17 where the domain enclosed by solid black lines denotes the cases that the fli vibration occurs through comparing fig 17 a with fig 17 b one can find that the range of ice velocity causing fli is wider under the extreme ice thickness of 32 cm than that under the normal ice thickness of 7 cm it also can be observed that when the ice thickness is smaller the misaligned angle has a remarkable effect on the domain where the fli happens for example the ice velocity range causing the fli is 0 02 0 06 m s when β is 0 in comparison the range is reduced to 0 02 0 03 m s when β is 90 the ice velocity range causing fli is slightly changed from 0 03 0 09 m s to 0 04 0 08 m s when β changes to 90 moreover one can find in fig 17 that the response amplitude of the tower top corresponding to the fli scenarios are more significant than that of other cases it should be noted that the maximal response amplitude is 1 425 m when the ice thickness is 7 cm and it is slightly smaller than of the peak value 1 454 m when the ice thickness is 32 cm this indicates that significant structural response occurs and poses a severe threat to the performance and safety of owts even when the ice thickness is not severe therefore effective vibration control measures are necessary for the owts located in the ice infested waters 5 2 response of controlled wind turbine under misaligned wind and ice loading 5 2 1 optimum design of the 3d ptmd to mitigate the significant fli vibration of the owt under wind and ice loading the 3d ptmd is utilized in this paper the process of tuning the 3d ptmd consists of defining values for its stiffness and damping in terms of the mass ratio between the absorber and the main structure the optimal design parameters of the 3d ptmd can be obtained by numerical search methods as it is time consuming to search the optimal design parameters and the fitting expression of the optimal frequency ratio f o and damping ratioζ o of the 3d ptmd with respect to the mass ratio μ has been provided based on the previous research by the author sun and jahangiri 2018 therefore the design parameters are directly determined by utilizing the fitting expression in ref sun et al 2018 which is given as 13 f o 7 6 μ 2 2 5 μ 1 ξ o 2 7 μ 2 μ 0 062 where μ is the mass ratio which is defined as the ratio of the 3d ptmd mass to the total mass of the owt furthermore the optimum length and damping coefficient of the pendulum can be determined by 14 l p g 2 π f p 2 c p x c p y 4 π f p m p ς o where g is the acceleration of gravity l p is the length of the pendulum f p is the frequency of the 3d ptmd m p is the mass of the 3d ptmd and c px c px is the damping coefficient of the damper in x and y direction respectively the 3d ptmd frequency is tuned based on the fundamental frequency of the structure considering the ssi which is 0 289 hz considering the limited space of the tower top sun et al 2018 μ is set to 2 in this paper and the calculated pendulum mass m p is 13 9 t using eq 13 one can obtain that f o is 0 95 andζ o is 0 081 then the frequency of the pendulum f p is 0 274 hz with these parameters selected the performance of the 3d ptmd will be evaluated when the owt is subjected to wind and ice loading 5 2 2 response comparison of the owt with and without the 3d ptmd fig 18 illustrates the displacement response histories of the wind turbine with and without the 3d ptmd when fli happens taking the case of v ice 0 08 m s h ice 32 cm and β 0 as an example one can clearly observe in fig 18 that both the vibration of the tower top nacelle and base foundation are dramatically reduced when the 3d ptmd is used to further exam the bi directional mitigation performance of the 3d ptmd the motion trajectory of the tower top nacelle with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misaligned wind and ice loading are presented in fig 19 the ice thickness is 32 cm and ice velocity is 0 08 m s it is found in fig 19 a that the side side displacement is minimal when wind and ice loading are aligned in comparison the trajectory of the tower top nacelle becomes more complex as the wind ice misaligned angle increased as shown in fig 19 b d respectively through comparison one can clearly find in fig 19 that the 3d ptmd can dramatically mitigate the motion of the tower top nacelle both in the fore aft and the side side directions the tower base bi directional response with and without the 3d ptmd under different wind ice misalignment angles are presented in fig 20 a d respectively it can be observed that the 3d ptmd can significantly reduce the vibration of the tower base in all the four different misalignment angles 5 2 3 response reduction evaluation of the 3d ptmd to further quantitatively evaluate the mitigation effect of 3d ptmd the peak and root mean square rms reduction ratio of the tower top and base displacement are calculated as following 15 r p e a k d w o p e a k d w p e a k d w o 100 r r m s d w o r m s d w r m s d w o r m s 100 where the r prek and r rms represent the peak and root mean square rms response reduction ratio of the owt respectively d w p e a k d w o p e a k are the displacement peak of the owt and d w r m s d w o r m s are the rms of the owt with and without the 3d ptmd respectively the results of r prek and r rms of the tower top and base displacement are calculated for all the simulated scenarios and shown in fig 21 to fig 24 in fig 21 a one can find that the 3d ptmd can reduce the tower top nacelle fore aft peak response when the ice thickness is 7 cm and the maximal reduction ratio is 51 8 the rms responses in the fore aft direction can be dramatically mitigated in almost all the cases especially for the fli cases in which the maximal reduction ratio is 93 7 as shown in fig 21 c as shown in fig 21 b and d the peak and rms responses in the side side direction can be attenuated by up to 62 8 and 87 7 respectively one can also find that in some cases the 3d ptmd has slight adverse impacts on the wind turbine in the side side direction however it should be noted that these cases are the non frequency lock in cases which means the wind turbine is at low vibration levels therefore the negative influence caused by 3d ptmd is not obvious fig 22 a d illustrates the reduction effect of the 3d ptmd on the tower base under the normal ice thickness one can clearly find that the 3d ptmd can also have positive impacts on mitigating the tower base vibration especially for the fli cases the peak and rms of the tower base displacement can be reduced maximally by 41 3 and 77 9 in the fore aft direction and by 58 5 and 77 8 in the side side direction respectively similar mitigating effects can be found both on the tower top nacelle and tower base foundation response under the extreme ice condition h ice 32 cm as shown in fig 23 and fig 24 compared with fig 21 it can be found that the 3d ptmd exerts better performance in the tower top nacelle fluctuation control when the ice thickness is 32 cm it can reduce the tower top nacelle fore aft peak response maximally by 52 5 and by 77 9 in the side side direction and the rms can be reduced by 94 7 and 95 5 in the fore aft and side side directions respectively as illustrated in fig 24 a d both the peak and rms response of the tower base foundation in bi direction are mitigated the maximum reduction ratio of the tower base fore aft peak and rms side side peak and rms are 42 2 86 8 66 8 and 91 5 respectively the adverse impacts both on the tower top and base response are also observed in figs 23 and 24 as explained before the negative effect is minimal 6 conclusions the present paper characterizes iiv of a 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine and finds the critical ice conditions ice thickness and the corresponding velocities causing the fli phenomenon a 3d ptmd is used to mitigate the significant structural response of the owt under wind and ice loading when fli happens a couple program based on the määttänen blenkarn model is developed to simulate the interaction between the substructure and the floating ice based on the presented results and discussion the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the ice frequency is locked at the first mode of the owt both under one year and fifty year return period ice conditions in the bohai sea the range of ice velocity causing the fli vibration is from 0 01 m s to 0 06 m s when the ice thickness is 7 cm and changes to 0 03 m s to 0 09 m s when the ice thickness is 32 cm the developed method and the obtained results can be used for analysis and design of monopile owts to be constructed in ice prone marine area 2 although misaligned angles β influences the distribution and range of ice velocities causing fli vibration the fli phenomenon is observed in all the four misaligned angles between wind and ice loadings therefore bi directional vibration control measures should be taken for the owts in ice infested water 3 when fli happens the 3d ptmd can dramatically mitigate the bi directional response of the owt under misaligned wind and ice loading the rms and peak responses of the nacelle tower top and tower base can be significantly mitigated especially for the fli scenarios the rms and peak response of the tower top can be reduced by up to 95 5 and 77 9 and by 91 5 and 66 8 for the tower base in summary if conditions are met fli will happen to monopile owt subjected to ice loading regardless of normal or extreme ice conditions a well designed 3d ptmd can effectively mitigate the iiv of the owts in the icing sea area without installing ice breaking cones it is noted that as a passive control strategy the 3d ptmd might lose part of its effectiveness when the locked frequency is off the target frequency therefore an adaptive control strategy which can accommodate ice loading variations and uncertainties will be studied in
