9565,the modernization process in irrigation has generated a higher energy demand due to this problem the ongoing increase in energy tariffs and the reduction in manufacturing costs of photovoltaic pv panels there has been an increased use of renewable energies such as pv energy to power the pumping equipment involved in pressurized irrigation on direct pumping the available solar power can be lower than that required by the pumping units this fact can result in stoppages that can produce unwanted transient effects or even the emptying of the network to avoid these phenomena and reduce the use of conventional energy a methodology is proposed in this work whereby meteorological predictions corrected with a kalman filter are used to calculate the available pv power irrigation needs and maintaining soil moisture above desirable levels for the crop by minimizing deep percolation this methodology is then compared to the traditional scheduling method that uses historical data and replaces the crop s evapotranspiration that occurs in a given time period the methodology was applied to a real case study during an irrigation campaign which was simulated using a weekly operative period it was found that the use of meteorological predictions allowed pv energy consumption estimates to be improved from 68 7 to 79 3 while the use of available photovoltaic energy in the case study

increasing temperature turral et al 2011 are thought to be reducing water resources between 30 and 50 milano et al 2013 to alleviate the compound effects of climate change an increasing world population un desa 2019 and increasing water consumption different plans are being developed around the world to modernize irrigation systems spain being a clear example of this mapama 2002 marm 2010 modernization has led to an improvement in water efficiency but with considerable energy cost increases espinosa tasón et al 2020 especially in those facilities where the reservoirs supplying the irrigation water do not have sufficient altitude to feed the networks by gravity alone and so require additional energy inputs in addition to the increasing energy requirements the price of this energy has also increased generating problems of economic viability for many agricultural farms the situation in spain being a case in point garcía morillo et al 2018 furthermore in regions such as the valencian community where pressurized irrigation is used on 68 of its irrigable land mainly on citrus fruit cultivations making up 53 and other fruit trees 15 the use of renewable energies has been incorporated as a central pivot in the proposed plans of the regional government valencian strategy on irrigation generalitat valenciana 2020 photovoltaic energy is more sustainable than conventional energy sources such as diesel giz 2016 or other conventional supplies and with the fall in photovoltaic panel prices traditional energies have been increasingly replaced by this renewable energy in irrigation pumping the power required to supply the irrigation network is reduced by improving the irrigation programming díaz et al 2012 fernández garcía et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 jiménez bello et al 2010 moreno et al 2007 other authors have studied hybrids between renewable and traditional energies or between different renewable energies where the feasibility of alternating them in order to satisfy certain energy requirements has been tested adamsab et al 2020 caldera and breyer 2019 el houari et al 2020 elkadeem et al 2019 li et al 2017 lian et al 2019 powell et al 2019a 2019b studies have also been carried out that involve the installation of photovoltaic panels that provide the energy to pump and store water in reservoirs at altitudes higher than that of the plantations bakelli et al 2011 hamidat et al 2003 meah et al 2008 however this latter option has the problem of the economic and environmental costs involved in the reservoir s construction as well as in finding the necessary space which might entail building the reservoir at some distance from the land requiring the irrigation for this reason direct solar powered irrigation systems are being implemented where solar radiation is used to directly pump with energy accumulation in batteries pardo et al 2019 or without accumulating in batteries mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 provided that the crops are resistant to water stress as indicated by mérida garcía et al 2018 direct irrigation that is carried out only when there is sufficient photovoltaic energy is called photovoltaic opportunity irrigation pvoi it presents users with the problem of uncertainty in irrigation time it since it depends on the available solar irradiation lópez luque et al 2015 in irrigation networks that supply many hydrants each possibly serving several outlets it is advisable to program the opening and closing of the solenoid valves that control these in advance pvoi systems that solely depend on photovoltaic energy are exposed to an increase in unwanted transient phenomena associated with the inappropriate start up and stoppage of pumps or the inopportune opening and closing of outlets at times when the radiation is not sufficiently intense therefore this paper presents a proposal where the uncertainty of the pvoi is reduced through the use of weather predictions which allow the estimation of the hours of irradiance and the evapotranspiration reference eto li et al 2018 santra et al 2021 within a weekly time frame thus the intention is to know in advance both the available energy times and the required irrigation needs to suitably schedule irrigation time in addition a soil plant water model has been incorporated which allows an evaluation of the state of the soil s moisture so as to establish the irrigation schedule within humidity thresholds that do not harm the crops and trying to reduce deep percolation the objective of this study is to evaluate a pvoi programming methodology that uses climate predictions instead of historical data in this way it seeks to maximize the use of the irradiance available to the pumping units and to adjust the irrigation doses to the levels that are strictly necessary this methodology is applied to direct injection systems with multiple hydrants where it is essential to know in advance the system s operational programming 2 materials and methodology 2 1 case study the case study focused on the camí albalat irrigation network managed by the massalet water use association it is located in the municipality of carlet valencia 39 13 27 45 n 0 30 8 83 w in eastern spain adult citrus fruit trees are cropped and irrigated by the waters flowing from the júcar turia canal nowadays surface irrigation using channels to distribute the water is being replaced by a drip irrigation system the proposed design of the new pressurized installation establishes a network of pressurized pipes which feed the plot hydrants the minimum pressure necessary in each hydrant is 28 m so pumps powered by a photovoltaic pv system have been set up in addition for those periods when the pv energy supply is less than that required they could also be run on conventional electricity the soil is sandy loam with a saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 800 mm day 1 for the calculation of drainage capacity as shown in fig 1 the hydraulic network is fed from a 50 000 m3 reservoir situated at 65 7 m above sea level m a s l the water is collected and conducted via gravity to the pumping station cami albalat situated at 42 6 m a s l with an irrigated area of 681 ha it has a total of 147 hydrants with base demand 198 pipes with a total length of 41 528 5 m and nominal diameters ranging between 90 mm and 710 mm and a pumping system consisting of 3 identical parallel pumps supplying 4 irrigation sectors each hectare has been installed with 4200 emitters of 4 l h 1 which is equivalent to 1 68 lh 1m 2 irrigation has been organized into operational sectors each sector consisting of hydrants that irrigate at the same time the maximum and minimum heights m a s l of the hydrants respectively are for sector 0 39 5 31 sector 1 38 5 27 0 sector 2 42 5 28 0 and sector 3 37 5 28 0 the criteria used to create each sector has been empirically determined trying to ensure that the flows and pressures required at the heads are homogeneous once the layout of the network the diameters of the pipes the demand hydrants and their corresponding flow rates together with the characteristic curves of the pumping units were established the hydraulic network model was constructed using the epanet hydraulic simulator the flow rate in each sector was directly obtained from the pipework downstream of the pumps and the minimum pumping head hm required for each hydrant in order to have the minimum service pressure of 28 m was determined following the process explained by díaz et al 2012 fernández garcía et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 jiménez bello et al 2010 the pumping equipment is arranged so that the sectors are irrigated by means of the 3 pumps positioned in parallel generating different minimum power requirements pmin i w in order to put the pumps into operation this calculation was attained using the following equation 1 p min i 1 η i γ q i hm i where the characteristic equations of head flow and flow performance of each pumping unit are with q measured in m3 h 1 2 hm 28 25 0 095 q 0 0002 q 2 3 η q 0 361 q 0 0004 q 2 where ηi is the efficiency of the pumps for each sector γ is the specific weight of the water nm 3 q i is the flow rate required for each irrigation sector m3s 1 and hm i is the head required by each sector m for the pumps to operate 100 under pv power it is necessary that the energy supplied by the pv system is greater than the minimum energy required by the pumping system for each sector the heads m flow rates m3s 1 and minimum power requirements kw are calculated the pv system consists of 912 panels each made up of 72 pv 6 in cells of polycrystalline material which together produce 325 w the panels occupy an area of 1773 m2 with the capacity to generate 296 4 kw in addition the pv system is formed by 3 variable frequency inverters the pv installation designed by the technicians of the water use association is arranged in such a way that the hours and energy produced by the pv panels are greater than the hours and energy required by the pumps for most of the time the ratio between the rated energy capacity of the pv generator and the power needs of the sector with the highest pmin i is 2 23 despite this design ratio there may be weather conditions where the pv system does not receive sufficient irradiance when the irrigation needs cannot be supplied by pv energy the pumping station is supplied by conventional energy in order to complete the irrigation hours the annual irrigation time using conventional energy for each sector ait i was calculated using the following equation 4 a it i 1 i it i itpv i where it i are the hours of irrigation necessary to provide for the needs of the crops during a year as per irrigation sector and itpv i are the hours of irrigation provided by renewable energy during a year per irrigation sector 2 2 description of the methodology this methodology tries to reduce the consumption of conventional electrical energy adjust the consumption of water and reduce deep percolation losses this is carried out by establishing in advance the operation of the outlets and pumping equipment to ensure the correct functioning of the pvoi system for these purposes weather forecasts were used to estimate the irrigation needs and hourly irradiance as shown in fig 2 the estimated irrigation needs temperature and irradiance were initially calculated using the standard methodology described in section 2 3 subsequently the calculations of the predicted irrigation needs temperature and irradiance were determined using the methodology based on weather predictions corrected with the kalman filter to account for micro scale biases between the gross scale predictions from meteorological data and the actual sensor readings at the fields as described in section 2 3 2 the kalman filter is applied in line with the study by carricondo anton et al 2019 applying the kalman filter the weekly mean relative error for the year 2019 was reduced from 21 8 to 8 3 for eto in addition the error for irradiance was reduced from 6 8 to 6 1 having estimated the irradiance and temperature the energy that would be generated by the pv system using was determined finally once the capacity of energy generation within a week the cumulative irrigation time needed for that week and the energy required by the water pumps are known the scheduling of the irrigation sectors was set up such programming is determined in such a way that conventional energy use is minimized via scheduling the highest power demand sectors during the highest pv net hourly power at the same time is having into account that the moisture in the soil did not produce crop stress while avoiding drainage to do this the representative field capacity of each sector fc i is obtained and the soil moisture was calculated for each day of the week and sector w i d for this purpose a simulation with 2019 data was carried out to validate the methodologies before scheduling the irrigation the fci was determined this term can also be replaced by the target moisture to be maintained in the soil martínez gimeno et al 2018 or the soil moisture for each day of the week w i d this moisture must not be less than the critical value that may cause excessive stress to the crop wcrit i as described in the section 2 4 in the same way a minimum irrigation time period itmin was determined during which the pumps must be activated to avoid irrigations lasting only short durations ensuring in this way that where the system does manage to reach the steady state this methodology was applied to sectored irrigation as described in section 2 1 sectors can operate with a constant setting pressure for all of them determined by the most unfavourable sector or a variable setting pressure is established for each sector to simplify the number of hypothesis it is assumed that it is possible to establish a variable setting pressure for each sector the determination of the weekly irrigation schedule is carried out as follows 1 the weekly irrigation time is calculated for each of the sectors in this case it was the same irrigation time for each of the sectors it std o itpred week see section 2 3 1 2 for each sector each day the accumulated irrigation time itacu i is calculated which at the end of the week has to be equal to itstd o itpred week this irrigation time is carried out either with pv energy or with conventional energy 3 the net hourly power pnet d h is determined for each of the hours and days of the week see section 2 5 4 the irrigation sectors are ordered according to the pmin i from highest to lowest 5 pnet is assigned to sectors when pnet pmin i 6 starting from the sector with the greatest pmin i a loop is formed running down the hours of each day of the week 7 the maximum daily irrigation time itmax i is determined for each sector as long as pnet pmini until it reaches fc i itmax i itstd itpred week if itmax i is positive or if w i d wcrit i irrigation is carried out 8 for the sectors where irrigation is carried out whether pnet i pmin i is checked in the cases that it is affirmative that hour is assigned until itacu i itmax i the consumed hours are ruled out for the following sectors in the cases where pnet i pmin i and w i d wcrit i conventional energy is used 9 sector i does not irrigate again until itmax i is positive and higher than itmin 10 the loop is repeated itself for each day of the week and for each sector at the end of the weekly programming itacu i itmax i it should be noted that itacu i may be less than itmax i when the soil is in fc i or when itmax i itmin 2 2 1 evaluation of the methodology to evaluate the proposed methodology pmin i was compared with the actual net hourly power that occurred during that hour and that day preal d h if preal d h pnet d h the system is assumed to be powered by pv and counted as itpv in cases where preal d h pnet d h it is assumed that the system is working with conventional energy and the irrigation hours are counted as itc i this process was repeated for the entire 2019 irrigation campaign with a weekly frequency taking monday as the day of reference this paper conducted a comparative analysis of the irrigation results obtained under different scenarios dependant on the irradiance and eto computation methods chosen in order to find out which methods were better to maximize the use of pv energy reduce deep percolation and water consumption with regard to the computation of irradiance a first and third scenarios based the ensuing week s irradiance on predictions arising from meteorological data irradpredicted instead sce1 and sce3 whereas a second and fourth scenario consider irradiance in the forthcoming week to be equal to that week s average radiation over the last 10 years irrad10 years sce2 and sce4 in relation to eto estimations two options are also considered one considers eto to be equal to the value that is attained the previous week by this indicator sce3 and sce4 and the other uses a predicted eto value sce1 and sce2 in summary there are four possible scenarios if all the options are considered as depicted in fig 3 see section 2 3 for more details once the four scenarios were defined a simulation of the evolution of soil moisture is carried out using an agrohydrological model which allows determining the irrigation dose volume of water supplied and the drainage for each scenario in addition the photovoltaic and conventional energy consumption by the ensuing irrigation schedule is estimated for each of the scenarios for later comparison the results obtained are evaluated using pre recorded data observed in meteorological stations in 2019 year see fig 4 2 3 calculation of irrigation needs in to determine the irrigation needs penman monteith s methodology allen et al 1998 is used to calculate the eto once the eto is known the evapotranspiration needs of the crop etc can be determined using for this purpose crop coefficients based on the percentages of vegetation cover corrected by a monthly correction factor fc month castel 2000 it was assumed that all the plots had a vegetation cover greater than 70 once the etc is calculated this is offset by the effective precipitation pe hence irrigation needs are the difference between the crops needs due to evapotranspiration and the effective precipitation value 3 etc eto kc fc month 4 in etc pe the eto is calculated using two methods i the first method calculates the irrigation needs for the next week using the eto of the previous week based on the meteorological data obtained from the agroclimatic weather stations belonging to the agroclimatic information system for irrigation siar in spanish initials http eportal mapa gob es websiar inicio aspx in the case study considered here this corresponded to the carlet agroclimatic station located 3786 m far from the cami albalat irrigation pumping station this is the method used in the area for the rational scheduling of drip irrigation and on which the case study design has been developed ii the second method calculates the eto using the weather predictions for the forthcoming week i e 7 days in relation to the following respective variables the average temperature c the relative humidity the wind speed at the height of 2 m ms 1 and the observed descending shortwave solar radiation wm 2 which is equivalent to the irradiance 2 3 1 determination of the irradiance and irrigation time using traditional methods in this section the irradiance of the week is calculated with the average radiation observed during the same week of the last 10 years which was measured in the horizontal plane using a pyranometer model cmp3 kipp zonen bv delft the netherlands and save the measured data in the siar network to program the irrigation of the next week the standard irrigation time itstd is traditionally determined by accepting the eto of the previous week li et al 2018 however in the actual study so that both methodologies could be comparable it was decided to compensate the error in the eto of the previous week present in the irrigation time taking place the next week by means of the following equation 5 itstd etc week 1 etc week 1 etc mweek 1 pe week 1 q 1 where etc week 1 is the etc estimation for the next week etc week 1 is the etc estimation for the previous week etc mweek 1 is the etc calculated using weather station measurements from the previous week pe week 1 the effective precipitation during the previous week and q is the specific flow per square meter and hour lh 1m 2 that can be provided as irrigation flow if itstd was less than 0 or if itstd was less than itmin no irrigation occurred 2 3 2 predictions of meteorological data and irrigation time using the kalman filter the in of the crops was obtained using the weather forecasts carricondo anton et al 2019 li et al 2018 lorite et al 2015 emitted by the meteorological service global forecast system gfs of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep belonging to the usa government this service provides real time weather forecasts four times a day which allowed future eto to be predicted and thus determine the irrigation scheduling this service is offered freely and permits the automatic daily download of predictions https www noaa gov however the problem with the predictions is the uncertainty of the estimates dorado and ruíz 2018 evensen 2003 which do not adapt themselves to the particular casuistry found in each farm microclimate orientation etc indeed apart from obvious uncertainty of the weather forecast itself the horizontal resolution of the grid used in the meteorological simulations is of 28 km this makes on the one hand the accuracy of the simulations decrease and on the other hand it means that local phenomena that affect broadly speaking areas smaller than 50 km in diameter cannot be simulated in order to reduce the uncertainty between the predictive model and the measurements taken in weather stations the study in this paper employed a kalman filter kalman 1960 kalman filtering is used in literature in say meteorology at the surface level han et al 2014 hunt et al 2007 and to determine the eto carricondo anton et al 2019 li et al 2018 in a generic setup kalman filter makes state and output predictions with a state space model x k a x k 1 b u k w k 1 from which the measures z k h k x k r k are obtained x being the state variables to be estimated u the value of possible deterministic inputs known to the model and w k and r k are process and measurement noise respectively of a known variance covariance matrix which will be denoted by q and r in the particular case of this work our model tried to explain the discrepancy i e the difference between an observed weather measurement say zk and its gfs weather prediction denoted as say pk where sub index k indicates a given week in the case study dataset the actual meteorological variables zk to which kalman filter was applied were temperature humidity wind at 2 m and irradiance van mourik et al 2019 so four of these filters were running in parallel in our discrepancy estimators the underlying model that tried to explain the discrepancies was set to a linear transformation of the prediction of slope θ1 and offset θ2 that is z p k θ 1 θ 2 p k 1 x so h k p k 1 in the above generic state space model and x θ 1 θ 2 t will be the state variables considering the transformation coefficients as states allows us to assume that these coefficients can vary over time and our filter pursues obtaining an estimation of them x ˆ k θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k t their value was adjusted by using kalman s equations above when predictions p and actual measurements z were contrasted note that the b u k component did not need to be part of the state equation since there were no additional exogenous u components leaving the state equation in a streamlined form x k a x k 1 w k 1 the matrix a was the discrete integrator model the identity matrix because we assumed that θ1 and θ2 were constant so the state equation amounted to assuming a parameter variation in time governed by θ 1 k θ 1 k 1 w 1 k 1 θ 2 k θ 2 k 1 w 2 k 1 i e strictly speaking we assumed they follow a random movement brownian motion excited by w k the variance of w k a given matrix q parameterized the uncertainty in the aforementioned brownian motion thus allowing the a priori rate of adjustable parameter variation in time to be encoded in our model the equations of a kalman filter have two stages albertos and sala 2004 dorado and ruíz 2018 usually named corrector and predictor to be detailed next 1 when an actual field measure of a meteorological variable zk was available the corrector step was undertaken by evaluating the following equations 6 k k p k h k t h k p k h k t r 1 x ˆ k x ˆ k k k z k h k x ˆ k p k i k t h k p k where p k is the state covariance matrix or the estimation error hk is the measurement matrix kk is the kalman gain zk is the actual observation at instant k x is the estimated initial state and r is the variance matrix of the measurement noise note that the corrector step has as inputs the a priori state estimate x ˆ k and the a priori covariance matrix p k understanding a priori as before incorporating measurement information kalman filter needs to be initialised with given p 0 x ˆ 0 given the meaning of the state variables the obvious initialisation is x ˆ 0 10 t indicating that we believe the predictions at start but considering some uncertainty for said one and zero being initial parameter variance indicated by the diagonal elements of p 0 given by the user nevertheless as actual measurements become available the kalman filter is trained with the discrepancies and estimates a different value of x ˆ 0 as data are gathered 2 once the corrected state estimate vector x ˆ k 1 and associate variance p k 1 were obtained for the measures from the data and the past model the predictor stage consists in computing the prediction in mean at variance of the parameters using the simulation equations albertos and sala 2004 dorado and ruíz 2018 7 x ˆ k a x ˆ k 1 p k a p k 1 a t q where outputs p k and x ˆ k are the state variance matrix and the mean estimate needed for the next corrector step if one wished to simulate several steps ahead in the future without intermediate observations this is established in the predictor 7 p k p k without carrying out the corrector eq 6 entering the data into the four kalman filters the two parameters of the correction were recursively obtained for each of the variables of temperature humidity wind at 2 m and irradiance as previously discussed with the obtained model parameters to correct predictions incorporating prior history of predictions and actual observations via kalman filter up to week k i e x ˆ k θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k t they were used to predict the meteorological variables for the next week i e z ˆ k 1 p k 1 θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k note that the one week rain prediction was not used because the error that was produced in estimating the amount was unacceptable and without any type of correlation with these adjustments we obtained the correction of the previous parameters the latter also being used to predict the irradiance that would occur the week after by means of the 4 parameters the eto was calculated using the penman monteith methodology described in allen et al 1998 once the in was known the predicted irrigation time itpred week was determined and corrected each week with the error of the previous week using the following equation 8 itpred week etc kweek 1 etc kweek 1 etc mweek 1 pe week 1 q 1 where etc kweek 1 is the etc prediction for the next week etc kweek 1 is the etc prediction for the previous week etc mweek 1 is the etc calculated using weather station measurements from the previous week pe week 1 is the effective precipitation from the previous week and q is the specific flow per square meter and hour lh 1m 2 that can be provided as irrigation flow if itstd is less than 0 or if itstd is less than itmin no irrigation occurs 2 4 moisture in the soil in this methodology it is important to know the moisture in the soil since the investigation expects to improve water use as well as energy efficiency by having pv panels the consumption of electricity based on conventional energies can be reduced however irrigation time must also be adjusted to take into account soil moisture and so avoid making these times excessive up to the point of losing water through drainage the determination of soil moisture for each sector w i d is established daily using the equation 9 w i d w i d 1 etc m i pe dd where w i d 1 is the soil moisture from the previous day mm etc m is the etc calculated by means of measures taken at weather stations mm i is the irrigation mm pe is the effective precipitation mm and dd is the deep drainage mm this model was simplified by not taking into account surface runoff as it was a drip irrigation system it was assumed that etc m and p e were the same for each sector the calculation of dd is performed when the soil moisture is between saturation sat and field capacity fc the drainage being calculated using the following equation raes 1982 raes et al 2006 1988 10 dd 0 0866 ksat 0 35 sat fc following the guidelines of allen et al 1998 the fraction of the fc of the soil water ps is used so that citrus crops with a coverage greater than 70 do not suffer stress this fraction limits the minimum amount of water mm that the soil should contain so that citrus crops do not suffer stress this is done according to the equation 11 wcrit i 0 5 0 04 5 p s etc 2 5 photovoltaic system the efficiency of the pv cells that make up a pv panel is affected by the temperature they can reach when subjected to irradiance to calculate the temperature of the cell tcel ⁰c the following formula is employed markvart and castaner 2003 12 tcel t tonc 20 si 800 where t is temperature in ⁰c tonc is the nominal operating temperature of the pv cell in this case 45 ⁰c and si is solar irradiance wm 2 the calculation of the available net hourly pv power for each day of the week is determined by the equation 13 p d h p p si 1000 1 α p 100 tcel 25 where pp is the peak power of the pv plate si is the mean hourly irradiance wm 2 αp is the coefficient of variation of pp with temperature ⁰c and tcel is the temperature of the pv cell finally it should be taken into account that the net available power to the pumps for each hour and day of the week pnet d h is affected by the efficiencies of the inverter and the motor of the equipment 14 pnet d h p d h i η fc η m where η fc is the estimated efficiency of the inverter which is 0 9 and η m is the estimated efficiency of the motor which is 0 8 during those weeks where the irrigation hours and energy required were greater than the hours and energy supplied by the pv installation irrigation occurred by means of conventional electricity mérida garcía et al 2019 3 results and discussion the results from the different scenarios are described in two sections the first section analyses the favourability of the predictions with regards to water needs irradiance temperature and pnet while the second section analyses the network s irrigation programming using the meteorological predictions the purpose is to assess whether the use of predictions and the errors committed with them leads to an enhancement of the irrigation programming and in turn to an improvement in the use of water and pv energy while reducing conventional energy consumption 3 1 evaluation of predictions 3 1 1 assessment of irrigation needs firstly to determine the flow rates and pmin i of each of the four sectors making up the network each with different hm i and qi a hydraulic analysis is performed the results are shown in table 1 the irrigation needs have been obtained etc predicted and etc week 1 and compared against etc2019 actual etc in 2019 resulting in 720 9 mm year 1 sce 1 sce 2 and 728 7 mm year 1 sce 3 sce 4 and 715 5 mm year 1 respectively fig 5 shows the weekly irrigation time for the etc predicted sce1 sce2 the etc week 1 sce3 sce4 and etc 2019 having determined the volume of water required the irrigation time were calculated firstly by means of the weather predictions resulting in 429 1 h sector 1year 1 of irrigation and secondly using the etc of the previous week methodology traditionally used obtaining 433 8 h sector 1year 1 of irrigation this represents a saving in it and water volume of 1 1 per year the etc was determined on a weekly basis each monday for every week in 2019 both for the etc predicted sce1 sce2 and the etc week 1 sce3 sce4 as can be seen in table 2 we analyse the average weekly error of the etc predicted and etc week 1 for the period of maximum in from april 1st to september 30th moreover it is analysed for the periods of minimum in from january 1st to march 31st and from october 1st to december 31st and the entire year 2019 as well as the maximum and minimum relative errors and the percentage of standard deviation that occurred the relative error for uncompensated etc predicted was 9 9 while for the uncompensated etc week 1 historical data it increased to 24 8 once etc predicted and etc week 1 had been compensated as indicated in section 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 the relative error for compensated etc predicted analysed amounted to 12 4 while for the historical data the compensated etc week 1 increased to 24 1 table 2 shows the relative errors for etc predicted and etc week 1 the etc compensated with the previous week s error is greater than the error of the etc because compensating from the previous week can generate a greater difference relative to the etc of the week to be predicted however the convenience of using the compensated etc is due to the fact that throughout the year the same amount of mm is irrigated as the etc of that year from here it can be determined that the relative errors are lower for etc predicted than for etc week 1 so it is advisable to use the former to determine the in 3 1 2 evaluation of sectors according to soil moisture content this section presents the soil moisture results achieved for the 4 scenarios as table 1 indicates the sector that required the most energy is sector 3 and the sector that required the least energy is sector 2 the effective precipitation and minimum soil moisture required so that plants would not suffer stress have also been represented in none of the 4 scenarios did the plants suffer stress because there was a lower limit of humidity beyond which irrigation always took place fixed at 25 of the fc i which in this case was 82 5 mm if this percentage is decreased the number of hours irrigated by pv energy is increased but the crop approaches the threshold of water stress it can be observed in fig 6 that the humidity in the sector of maximum power requirements for pumping avoids the minimum humidity established 75 of fci this is because it is the sector that first takes advantage of the hours of available energy in contrast the sector with the minimum power requirement for pumping does reach the minimum humidity established because it is the last sector to be irrigated throughout the week and therefore this sector is the one that required more electrical energy due to the low humidity of the soil 3 1 3 evaluation of irradiance temperature and net power for photovoltaic pumping the highest monthly irradiance coincided with the highest irrigation needs mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 as can be seen in fig 7 upon calculating the average monthly irradiance in kwhm 2day 1 we observe that when comparing the irradpredicted and the irradiance measured in 2019 irrad2019 there is an average relative error every month of 3 68 and when comparing the irrad10 years with respect to that measured in 2019 there is an average relative error every month of 6 7 this justifies the relevance of our proposal of incorporating meteorological predictions in irrigation scheduling to reduce uncertainty the irradiance and temperature and with it the pnet d h were established every monday of 2019 both for the parameters predicted by weather predictions sce1 sce3 as for the predictions made using the average data from the last 10 years sce2 sce4 as can be seen in table 3 the daily relative errors of irradiance temperature and pnet are analysed for the period of maximum in from april 1st to september 30th for the periods of minimum in from january 1st to march 31st and from october 1st to december 31st and for the entire year 2019 as well as the maximum and minimum relative error and the percentage standard deviation produced fig 8 shows a comparison between the different net available power pnet computations throughout the whole year 2019 based on a the average irradiance data from the last 10 years sce 2 sce 4 green line b weather prediction data sce 1 sce 3 blue line c actual measured irradiance which of course cannot be used for scheduling red line the observed annual square error in table 3 is improved to 24 when using our proposed methodology with the predicted values as opposed to 46 when using the historical data fig 8 shows the pnet predicted using weather forecasts after applying the kalman filter the pnet based on historical data and the pnet calculated with data measured in 2019 to demonstrate the importance of the configuration of the irrigation sectors the 23rd june 2019 a day without clouds has been chosen fig 9 shows the irradpredicted irrad10 years and irrad2019 for that day as well as the minimum irradiance required to make the network operate on pv power for each of the sectors that make up the network it is observed that the sectors were only operational between the irradiances 265 and 330 wm 2 therefore methodologies should be established in order to take advantage of all the pv energy throughout the day such as that proposed by mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 where the simultaneous operation of several irrigation sectors reduces the cost of the pv system making it advantageous in terms of energy use efficiency another option is to study the possibility of programming by dynamically changing the sectors with different pmin i that better adjust to the irradiance available there by optimizing the use of pv energy 3 2 evaluation of the programming of the operation of the irrigation network this section studies how irrigation programming based on predictions affects the differential use of pv and conventional energy the evaluation of the irrigation schedule for each sector is carried out by analysing the following factors the irrigation and drainage doses the irrigation hours carried out respectively by conventional energy and pv energy and the soil moisture for the 4 sectors itmin was set to 0 5 h to avoid excessive system start ups and shutdowns the target humidity was set at the fc i 110 mm and the point of minimum humidity was established as 25 lower than the fc i that is 82 5 mm drainage occurs when there was precipitation since the possibility that soil moisture exceeded the field capacity only existed when there was rain as described in eqs 9 and 10 to avoid the problem of drainage due to rainfall in future works rainfall predictions should be improved and implemented an vo et al 2019 especially using a wider temporal framework 3 2 1 evaluation of irrigation dose and drainage each sector is irrigated depending on its proximity to the target humidity i e fc i or wcrit i of the etc determined for that week the rainfall and the hours of available pv energy as for itacu i this could be less than itstd or itpred week of the one already established because it would be lower if there are irrigations lower than it min or if the cc i was exceeded on the contrary a particular week s irrigation dose would increase if soil moisture fell below the minimum set threshold which was 25 of the fc i fig 10 a shows the annual irrigation dose for each sector depending on each of the scenarios the annual consumptions for the 4 sectors were 2853 6 mm 2869 mm 2877 2 mm and 2897 mm for scenarios sce1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the least amount of irrigated water was achieved when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 however the differences between scenarios were not highly significant however if they would be compared with farmer practices of the study area highly savings should be achieved until 24 5 li et al 2018 drainage in the case study does not occur due to irrigation since the latter is halted once the target humidity fc i is reached however in the periods when precipitation occurred drainage is dependent on the proximity of the target moisture to the soil moisture in periods of precipitation when the target moisture is reached the drainage is equal to the precipitation while the closer the soil moisture is to the minimum moisture permitted the more capacity the soil had to retain precipitated water fig 10 b shows the annual drainage for the 4 sectors depending on each of the scenarios annual drainage was 700 6 mm 716 mm 721 3 mm and 719 2 mm for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively the lower annual amount of drainage water is obtained when combining etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 3 2 2 evaluation of sectors 3 2 2 1 evaluation of sectors for the use of photovoltaic energy the total annual operating hours employed irrigating the 4 sectors were 1698 5 1707 7 1712 6 and 1710 2 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the least need for operating hours occurred when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 fig 11 shows the irrigation hours powered by pv energy and conventional energy respectively in separate diagrams the sum of the two is the total hours of irrigation that had to be employed over the course of a year to cover the irrigation needs that had been established the sector that required the fewest hours of conventional energy was the one with the highest pmin i and so on successively until reaching the sector with the lowest pmin i reciprocally the sector which received the most hours of pv energy was also the one with the highest pmin i the other sectors following consecutively from highest to lowest pmin i the annual pv hours supplying irrigation to the 4 sectors were 1322 6 1236 1257 1 and 1144 6 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the highest use of pv energy irrigation hours was when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 alternatively the annual hours using conventional energy to supply irrigation to the 4 sectors were 375 9 471 8 455 6 and 565 7 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the lowest use of conventional energy irrigation hours happened when combining etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 conventional energy was connected on those occasions when the irradiance was not sufficient to perform the irrigation already programmed by means of the predictions of both irradpredicted and irrad10 years furthermore conventional energy was also connected at those times when the soil moisture was less than 25 of the target humidity fc i and there was no pv energy available to supply the system as indicated in fig 12 here we can observe that the hours of irrigation when conventional energy was used in the sce1 and sce2 scenarios was due to the fact that the soil moisture had dropped below 25 of the fc i however for the sce3 and sce4 scenarios the use of conventional energy was mainly due to errors in weather forecasting an analysis of the absolute error made using the predictions of irrad10 years and irradpredicted compared to the irrad2019 respectively was carried out as shown in fig 13 this was achieved by analysing the differences between the average values of measured and predicted irradiance for each hour of the day during the year of 2019 in this way taking into account the times when the greatest absolute positive error occurred between the measured and predicted irradiance the conventional electricity consumption could be estimated since these hours coincided on average with when the predicted irradiances were less than the irrad2019 ones however the pmin i would have to be guaranteed at least for the hours when the equipment operated on pv energy in the case of irradiance variation when irrigation took place in the event that the humidity dropped below 25 of the fc i these irrigations could be carried out in the off peak hours of lowest cost the percentages between the hours of irrigation performed using pv energy and the hours of available energy are 13 37 12 52 12 74 and 11 64 for scenarios sce1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively from this it can be observed that the greatest uses of pv energy occurred in scenarios sce1 and sce3 where irradpredicted was used researchers in zavala et al 2020 managed to go from 15 4 to 18 4 through a process of combining the sectors the aforementioned scenarios used 79 and 75 of pv energy respectively compared to scenarios sce2 and sc4 which used 74 and 68 pv energy respectively in table 4 the total number of irrigation hours for each scenario and for each sector are described in addition the percentages of the total irrigation time conducted with renewable energies for each of the sectors and scenarios are also indicated the difference between the total hours of irrigation and the hours irrigated by renewable energies allows us to obtain the percentages of hours of irrigation supplied by conventional energy for each of the sectors and scenarios table 4 shows the percentage of hours irrigated with conventional energy for these two situations as sector 3 was the first to be assigned pnet d h it obtained a higher percentage of pv energy and it was not necessary to use conventional energy to maintain this sector s soil moisture level above wcrit i only prediction errors forced the use of conventional energy on the other hand sector 2 the sector with the lowest pmin i was the one that made the greatest use of conventional energy and the largest percentage of it was due to the fact that wcrit i was not reached once the causes of the pv power failure have been determined the next step would be to study which is the appropriate alternative energy to cover this gap researchers pardo et al 2019 studied the effect of incorporating batteries for storing energy to protect the system against emergencies and the results showed that there is no universal solution this is due to the fact that there are a large number of alternatives available when buying the equipment and hence in future savings mérida garcía et al 2019 demonstrated from an environmental point of view that pv energy was the lowest cost option both when connected to the grid as when not compared to using generator sets moreover the possibility of exporting excess energy to the electricity grid resulted in six times less environmental impact compared to an installation that was not connected 4 conclusions the use of short term meteorological predictions using a week s timeframe allows the estimation of the irradiance and the irrigation needs of the crops with greater precision than other commonly used methods average of historical data or extrapolation of last week s data permitting irrigation operations to be programmed in advance however every prediction is subject to some uncertainty and if the prediction is not met an additional energy source is needed in the cases where not irrigation ponds are available for storing and supply water in this case study the relative error in the estimation of net power incurred during the period of greatest irrigation needs was 26 3 for weather forecasts as opposed to 50 using historical data the application of weather forecasts in the calculation of irradiance and irrigation needs sce1 as opposed to the use of historical data and the calculation of evapotranspiration based on what happened in the past sce4 led to an improved use of renewable energy from 68 7 to 79 3 and to an increase in the use of available photovoltaic energy from 11 64 to 13 37 to improve this last indicator we must act on the irrigation programming by dynamically changing the sectors configuration and number of hydrants to adapt them to the net available pv power improving the predictions accompanied by a reduction in the prediction timeframe will improve the percentage of renewable energy used and increase the hours of available energy use while keeping the moisture levels within crop requirements declaration of competing interest the authors

9565,the modernization process in irrigation has generated a higher energy demand due to this problem the ongoing increase in energy tariffs and the reduction in manufacturing costs of photovoltaic pv panels there has been an increased use of renewable energies such as pv energy to power the pumping equipment involved in pressurized irrigation on direct pumping the available solar power can be lower than that required by the pumping units this fact can result in stoppages that can produce unwanted transient effects or even the emptying of the network to avoid these phenomena and reduce the use of conventional energy a methodology is proposed in this work whereby meteorological predictions corrected with a kalman filter are used to calculate the available pv power irrigation needs and maintaining soil moisture above desirable levels for the crop by minimizing deep percolation this methodology is then compared to the traditional scheduling method that uses historical data and replaces the crop s evapotranspiration that occurs in a given time period the methodology was applied to a real case study during an irrigation campaign which was simulated using a weekly operative period it was found that the use of meteorological predictions allowed pv energy consumption estimates to be improved from 68 7 to 79 3 while the use of available photovoltaic energy in the case study

increasing temperature turral et al 2011 are thought to be reducing water resources between 30 and 50 milano et al 2013 to alleviate the compound effects of climate change an increasing world population un desa 2019 and increasing water consumption different plans are being developed around the world to modernize irrigation systems spain being a clear example of this mapama 2002 marm 2010 modernization has led to an improvement in water efficiency but with considerable energy cost increases espinosa tasón et al 2020 especially in those facilities where the reservoirs supplying the irrigation water do not have sufficient altitude to feed the networks by gravity alone and so require additional energy inputs in addition to the increasing energy requirements the price of this energy has also increased generating problems of economic viability for many agricultural farms the situation in spain being a case in point garcía morillo et al 2018 furthermore in regions such as the valencian community where pressurized irrigation is used on 68 of its irrigable land mainly on citrus fruit cultivations making up 53 and other fruit trees 15 the use of renewable energies has been incorporated as a central pivot in the proposed plans of the regional government valencian strategy on irrigation generalitat valenciana 2020 photovoltaic energy is more sustainable than conventional energy sources such as diesel giz 2016 or other conventional supplies and with the fall in photovoltaic panel prices traditional energies have been increasingly replaced by this renewable energy in irrigation pumping the power required to supply the irrigation network is reduced by improving the irrigation programming díaz et al 2012 fernández garcía et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 jiménez bello et al 2010 moreno et al 2007 other authors have studied hybrids between renewable and traditional energies or between different renewable energies where the feasibility of alternating them in order to satisfy certain energy requirements has been tested adamsab et al 2020 caldera and breyer 2019 el houari et al 2020 elkadeem et al 2019 li et al 2017 lian et al 2019 powell et al 2019a 2019b studies have also been carried out that involve the installation of photovoltaic panels that provide the energy to pump and store water in reservoirs at altitudes higher than that of the plantations bakelli et al 2011 hamidat et al 2003 meah et al 2008 however this latter option has the problem of the economic and environmental costs involved in the reservoir s construction as well as in finding the necessary space which might entail building the reservoir at some distance from the land requiring the irrigation for this reason direct solar powered irrigation systems are being implemented where solar radiation is used to directly pump with energy accumulation in batteries pardo et al 2019 or without accumulating in batteries mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 provided that the crops are resistant to water stress as indicated by mérida garcía et al 2018 direct irrigation that is carried out only when there is sufficient photovoltaic energy is called photovoltaic opportunity irrigation pvoi it presents users with the problem of uncertainty in irrigation time it since it depends on the available solar irradiation lópez luque et al 2015 in irrigation networks that supply many hydrants each possibly serving several outlets it is advisable to program the opening and closing of the solenoid valves that control these in advance pvoi systems that solely depend on photovoltaic energy are exposed to an increase in unwanted transient phenomena associated with the inappropriate start up and stoppage of pumps or the inopportune opening and closing of outlets at times when the radiation is not sufficiently intense therefore this paper presents a proposal where the uncertainty of the pvoi is reduced through the use of weather predictions which allow the estimation of the hours of irradiance and the evapotranspiration reference eto li et al 2018 santra et al 2021 within a weekly time frame thus the intention is to know in advance both the available energy times and the required irrigation needs to suitably schedule irrigation time in addition a soil plant water model has been incorporated which allows an evaluation of the state of the soil s moisture so as to establish the irrigation schedule within humidity thresholds that do not harm the crops and trying to reduce deep percolation the objective of this study is to evaluate a pvoi programming methodology that uses climate predictions instead of historical data in this way it seeks to maximize the use of the irradiance available to the pumping units and to adjust the irrigation doses to the levels that are strictly necessary this methodology is applied to direct injection systems with multiple hydrants where it is essential to know in advance the system s operational programming 2 materials and methodology 2 1 case study the case study focused on the camí albalat irrigation network managed by the massalet water use association it is located in the municipality of carlet valencia 39 13 27 45 n 0 30 8 83 w in eastern spain adult citrus fruit trees are cropped and irrigated by the waters flowing from the júcar turia canal nowadays surface irrigation using channels to distribute the water is being replaced by a drip irrigation system the proposed design of the new pressurized installation establishes a network of pressurized pipes which feed the plot hydrants the minimum pressure necessary in each hydrant is 28 m so pumps powered by a photovoltaic pv system have been set up in addition for those periods when the pv energy supply is less than that required they could also be run on conventional electricity the soil is sandy loam with a saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 800 mm day 1 for the calculation of drainage capacity as shown in fig 1 the hydraulic network is fed from a 50 000 m3 reservoir situated at 65 7 m above sea level m a s l the water is collected and conducted via gravity to the pumping station cami albalat situated at 42 6 m a s l with an irrigated area of 681 ha it has a total of 147 hydrants with base demand 198 pipes with a total length of 41 528 5 m and nominal diameters ranging between 90 mm and 710 mm and a pumping system consisting of 3 identical parallel pumps supplying 4 irrigation sectors each hectare has been installed with 4200 emitters of 4 l h 1 which is equivalent to 1 68 lh 1m 2 irrigation has been organized into operational sectors each sector consisting of hydrants that irrigate at the same time the maximum and minimum heights m a s l of the hydrants respectively are for sector 0 39 5 31 sector 1 38 5 27 0 sector 2 42 5 28 0 and sector 3 37 5 28 0 the criteria used to create each sector has been empirically determined trying to ensure that the flows and pressures required at the heads are homogeneous once the layout of the network the diameters of the pipes the demand hydrants and their corresponding flow rates together with the characteristic curves of the pumping units were established the hydraulic network model was constructed using the epanet hydraulic simulator the flow rate in each sector was directly obtained from the pipework downstream of the pumps and the minimum pumping head hm required for each hydrant in order to have the minimum service pressure of 28 m was determined following the process explained by díaz et al 2012 fernández garcía et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 jiménez bello et al 2010 the pumping equipment is arranged so that the sectors are irrigated by means of the 3 pumps positioned in parallel generating different minimum power requirements pmin i w in order to put the pumps into operation this calculation was attained using the following equation 1 p min i 1 η i γ q i hm i where the characteristic equations of head flow and flow performance of each pumping unit are with q measured in m3 h 1 2 hm 28 25 0 095 q 0 0002 q 2 3 η q 0 361 q 0 0004 q 2 where ηi is the efficiency of the pumps for each sector γ is the specific weight of the water nm 3 q i is the flow rate required for each irrigation sector m3s 1 and hm i is the head required by each sector m for the pumps to operate 100 under pv power it is necessary that the energy supplied by the pv system is greater than the minimum energy required by the pumping system for each sector the heads m flow rates m3s 1 and minimum power requirements kw are calculated the pv system consists of 912 panels each made up of 72 pv 6 in cells of polycrystalline material which together produce 325 w the panels occupy an area of 1773 m2 with the capacity to generate 296 4 kw in addition the pv system is formed by 3 variable frequency inverters the pv installation designed by the technicians of the water use association is arranged in such a way that the hours and energy produced by the pv panels are greater than the hours and energy required by the pumps for most of the time the ratio between the rated energy capacity of the pv generator and the power needs of the sector with the highest pmin i is 2 23 despite this design ratio there may be weather conditions where the pv system does not receive sufficient irradiance when the irrigation needs cannot be supplied by pv energy the pumping station is supplied by conventional energy in order to complete the irrigation hours the annual irrigation time using conventional energy for each sector ait i was calculated using the following equation 4 a it i 1 i it i itpv i where it i are the hours of irrigation necessary to provide for the needs of the crops during a year as per irrigation sector and itpv i are the hours of irrigation provided by renewable energy during a year per irrigation sector 2 2 description of the methodology this methodology tries to reduce the consumption of conventional electrical energy adjust the consumption of water and reduce deep percolation losses this is carried out by establishing in advance the operation of the outlets and pumping equipment to ensure the correct functioning of the pvoi system for these purposes weather forecasts were used to estimate the irrigation needs and hourly irradiance as shown in fig 2 the estimated irrigation needs temperature and irradiance were initially calculated using the standard methodology described in section 2 3 subsequently the calculations of the predicted irrigation needs temperature and irradiance were determined using the methodology based on weather predictions corrected with the kalman filter to account for micro scale biases between the gross scale predictions from meteorological data and the actual sensor readings at the fields as described in section 2 3 2 the kalman filter is applied in line with the study by carricondo anton et al 2019 applying the kalman filter the weekly mean relative error for the year 2019 was reduced from 21 8 to 8 3 for eto in addition the error for irradiance was reduced from 6 8 to 6 1 having estimated the irradiance and temperature the energy that would be generated by the pv system using was determined finally once the capacity of energy generation within a week the cumulative irrigation time needed for that week and the energy required by the water pumps are known the scheduling of the irrigation sectors was set up such programming is determined in such a way that conventional energy use is minimized via scheduling the highest power demand sectors during the highest pv net hourly power at the same time is having into account that the moisture in the soil did not produce crop stress while avoiding drainage to do this the representative field capacity of each sector fc i is obtained and the soil moisture was calculated for each day of the week and sector w i d for this purpose a simulation with 2019 data was carried out to validate the methodologies before scheduling the irrigation the fci was determined this term can also be replaced by the target moisture to be maintained in the soil martínez gimeno et al 2018 or the soil moisture for each day of the week w i d this moisture must not be less than the critical value that may cause excessive stress to the crop wcrit i as described in the section 2 4 in the same way a minimum irrigation time period itmin was determined during which the pumps must be activated to avoid irrigations lasting only short durations ensuring in this way that where the system does manage to reach the steady state this methodology was applied to sectored irrigation as described in section 2 1 sectors can operate with a constant setting pressure for all of them determined by the most unfavourable sector or a variable setting pressure is established for each sector to simplify the number of hypothesis it is assumed that it is possible to establish a variable setting pressure for each sector the determination of the weekly irrigation schedule is carried out as follows 1 the weekly irrigation time is calculated for each of the sectors in this case it was the same irrigation time for each of the sectors it std o itpred week see section 2 3 1 2 for each sector each day the accumulated irrigation time itacu i is calculated which at the end of the week has to be equal to itstd o itpred week this irrigation time is carried out either with pv energy or with conventional energy 3 the net hourly power pnet d h is determined for each of the hours and days of the week see section 2 5 4 the irrigation sectors are ordered according to the pmin i from highest to lowest 5 pnet is assigned to sectors when pnet pmin i 6 starting from the sector with the greatest pmin i a loop is formed running down the hours of each day of the week 7 the maximum daily irrigation time itmax i is determined for each sector as long as pnet pmini until it reaches fc i itmax i itstd itpred week if itmax i is positive or if w i d wcrit i irrigation is carried out 8 for the sectors where irrigation is carried out whether pnet i pmin i is checked in the cases that it is affirmative that hour is assigned until itacu i itmax i the consumed hours are ruled out for the following sectors in the cases where pnet i pmin i and w i d wcrit i conventional energy is used 9 sector i does not irrigate again until itmax i is positive and higher than itmin 10 the loop is repeated itself for each day of the week and for each sector at the end of the weekly programming itacu i itmax i it should be noted that itacu i may be less than itmax i when the soil is in fc i or when itmax i itmin 2 2 1 evaluation of the methodology to evaluate the proposed methodology pmin i was compared with the actual net hourly power that occurred during that hour and that day preal d h if preal d h pnet d h the system is assumed to be powered by pv and counted as itpv in cases where preal d h pnet d h it is assumed that the system is working with conventional energy and the irrigation hours are counted as itc i this process was repeated for the entire 2019 irrigation campaign with a weekly frequency taking monday as the day of reference this paper conducted a comparative analysis of the irrigation results obtained under different scenarios dependant on the irradiance and eto computation methods chosen in order to find out which methods were better to maximize the use of pv energy reduce deep percolation and water consumption with regard to the computation of irradiance a first and third scenarios based the ensuing week s irradiance on predictions arising from meteorological data irradpredicted instead sce1 and sce3 whereas a second and fourth scenario consider irradiance in the forthcoming week to be equal to that week s average radiation over the last 10 years irrad10 years sce2 and sce4 in relation to eto estimations two options are also considered one considers eto to be equal to the value that is attained the previous week by this indicator sce3 and sce4 and the other uses a predicted eto value sce1 and sce2 in summary there are four possible scenarios if all the options are considered as depicted in fig 3 see section 2 3 for more details once the four scenarios were defined a simulation of the evolution of soil moisture is carried out using an agrohydrological model which allows determining the irrigation dose volume of water supplied and the drainage for each scenario in addition the photovoltaic and conventional energy consumption by the ensuing irrigation schedule is estimated for each of the scenarios for later comparison the results obtained are evaluated using pre recorded data observed in meteorological stations in 2019 year see fig 4 2 3 calculation of irrigation needs in to determine the irrigation needs penman monteith s methodology allen et al 1998 is used to calculate the eto once the eto is known the evapotranspiration needs of the crop etc can be determined using for this purpose crop coefficients based on the percentages of vegetation cover corrected by a monthly correction factor fc month castel 2000 it was assumed that all the plots had a vegetation cover greater than 70 once the etc is calculated this is offset by the effective precipitation pe hence irrigation needs are the difference between the crops needs due to evapotranspiration and the effective precipitation value 3 etc eto kc fc month 4 in etc pe the eto is calculated using two methods i the first method calculates the irrigation needs for the next week using the eto of the previous week based on the meteorological data obtained from the agroclimatic weather stations belonging to the agroclimatic information system for irrigation siar in spanish initials http eportal mapa gob es websiar inicio aspx in the case study considered here this corresponded to the carlet agroclimatic station located 3786 m far from the cami albalat irrigation pumping station this is the method used in the area for the rational scheduling of drip irrigation and on which the case study design has been developed ii the second method calculates the eto using the weather predictions for the forthcoming week i e 7 days in relation to the following respective variables the average temperature c the relative humidity the wind speed at the height of 2 m ms 1 and the observed descending shortwave solar radiation wm 2 which is equivalent to the irradiance 2 3 1 determination of the irradiance and irrigation time using traditional methods in this section the irradiance of the week is calculated with the average radiation observed during the same week of the last 10 years which was measured in the horizontal plane using a pyranometer model cmp3 kipp zonen bv delft the netherlands and save the measured data in the siar network to program the irrigation of the next week the standard irrigation time itstd is traditionally determined by accepting the eto of the previous week li et al 2018 however in the actual study so that both methodologies could be comparable it was decided to compensate the error in the eto of the previous week present in the irrigation time taking place the next week by means of the following equation 5 itstd etc week 1 etc week 1 etc mweek 1 pe week 1 q 1 where etc week 1 is the etc estimation for the next week etc week 1 is the etc estimation for the previous week etc mweek 1 is the etc calculated using weather station measurements from the previous week pe week 1 the effective precipitation during the previous week and q is the specific flow per square meter and hour lh 1m 2 that can be provided as irrigation flow if itstd was less than 0 or if itstd was less than itmin no irrigation occurred 2 3 2 predictions of meteorological data and irrigation time using the kalman filter the in of the crops was obtained using the weather forecasts carricondo anton et al 2019 li et al 2018 lorite et al 2015 emitted by the meteorological service global forecast system gfs of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep belonging to the usa government this service provides real time weather forecasts four times a day which allowed future eto to be predicted and thus determine the irrigation scheduling this service is offered freely and permits the automatic daily download of predictions https www noaa gov however the problem with the predictions is the uncertainty of the estimates dorado and ruíz 2018 evensen 2003 which do not adapt themselves to the particular casuistry found in each farm microclimate orientation etc indeed apart from obvious uncertainty of the weather forecast itself the horizontal resolution of the grid used in the meteorological simulations is of 28 km this makes on the one hand the accuracy of the simulations decrease and on the other hand it means that local phenomena that affect broadly speaking areas smaller than 50 km in diameter cannot be simulated in order to reduce the uncertainty between the predictive model and the measurements taken in weather stations the study in this paper employed a kalman filter kalman 1960 kalman filtering is used in literature in say meteorology at the surface level han et al 2014 hunt et al 2007 and to determine the eto carricondo anton et al 2019 li et al 2018 in a generic setup kalman filter makes state and output predictions with a state space model x k a x k 1 b u k w k 1 from which the measures z k h k x k r k are obtained x being the state variables to be estimated u the value of possible deterministic inputs known to the model and w k and r k are process and measurement noise respectively of a known variance covariance matrix which will be denoted by q and r in the particular case of this work our model tried to explain the discrepancy i e the difference between an observed weather measurement say zk and its gfs weather prediction denoted as say pk where sub index k indicates a given week in the case study dataset the actual meteorological variables zk to which kalman filter was applied were temperature humidity wind at 2 m and irradiance van mourik et al 2019 so four of these filters were running in parallel in our discrepancy estimators the underlying model that tried to explain the discrepancies was set to a linear transformation of the prediction of slope θ1 and offset θ2 that is z p k θ 1 θ 2 p k 1 x so h k p k 1 in the above generic state space model and x θ 1 θ 2 t will be the state variables considering the transformation coefficients as states allows us to assume that these coefficients can vary over time and our filter pursues obtaining an estimation of them x ˆ k θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k t their value was adjusted by using kalman s equations above when predictions p and actual measurements z were contrasted note that the b u k component did not need to be part of the state equation since there were no additional exogenous u components leaving the state equation in a streamlined form x k a x k 1 w k 1 the matrix a was the discrete integrator model the identity matrix because we assumed that θ1 and θ2 were constant so the state equation amounted to assuming a parameter variation in time governed by θ 1 k θ 1 k 1 w 1 k 1 θ 2 k θ 2 k 1 w 2 k 1 i e strictly speaking we assumed they follow a random movement brownian motion excited by w k the variance of w k a given matrix q parameterized the uncertainty in the aforementioned brownian motion thus allowing the a priori rate of adjustable parameter variation in time to be encoded in our model the equations of a kalman filter have two stages albertos and sala 2004 dorado and ruíz 2018 usually named corrector and predictor to be detailed next 1 when an actual field measure of a meteorological variable zk was available the corrector step was undertaken by evaluating the following equations 6 k k p k h k t h k p k h k t r 1 x ˆ k x ˆ k k k z k h k x ˆ k p k i k t h k p k where p k is the state covariance matrix or the estimation error hk is the measurement matrix kk is the kalman gain zk is the actual observation at instant k x is the estimated initial state and r is the variance matrix of the measurement noise note that the corrector step has as inputs the a priori state estimate x ˆ k and the a priori covariance matrix p k understanding a priori as before incorporating measurement information kalman filter needs to be initialised with given p 0 x ˆ 0 given the meaning of the state variables the obvious initialisation is x ˆ 0 10 t indicating that we believe the predictions at start but considering some uncertainty for said one and zero being initial parameter variance indicated by the diagonal elements of p 0 given by the user nevertheless as actual measurements become available the kalman filter is trained with the discrepancies and estimates a different value of x ˆ 0 as data are gathered 2 once the corrected state estimate vector x ˆ k 1 and associate variance p k 1 were obtained for the measures from the data and the past model the predictor stage consists in computing the prediction in mean at variance of the parameters using the simulation equations albertos and sala 2004 dorado and ruíz 2018 7 x ˆ k a x ˆ k 1 p k a p k 1 a t q where outputs p k and x ˆ k are the state variance matrix and the mean estimate needed for the next corrector step if one wished to simulate several steps ahead in the future without intermediate observations this is established in the predictor 7 p k p k without carrying out the corrector eq 6 entering the data into the four kalman filters the two parameters of the correction were recursively obtained for each of the variables of temperature humidity wind at 2 m and irradiance as previously discussed with the obtained model parameters to correct predictions incorporating prior history of predictions and actual observations via kalman filter up to week k i e x ˆ k θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k t they were used to predict the meteorological variables for the next week i e z ˆ k 1 p k 1 θ ˆ 1 k θ ˆ 2 k note that the one week rain prediction was not used because the error that was produced in estimating the amount was unacceptable and without any type of correlation with these adjustments we obtained the correction of the previous parameters the latter also being used to predict the irradiance that would occur the week after by means of the 4 parameters the eto was calculated using the penman monteith methodology described in allen et al 1998 once the in was known the predicted irrigation time itpred week was determined and corrected each week with the error of the previous week using the following equation 8 itpred week etc kweek 1 etc kweek 1 etc mweek 1 pe week 1 q 1 where etc kweek 1 is the etc prediction for the next week etc kweek 1 is the etc prediction for the previous week etc mweek 1 is the etc calculated using weather station measurements from the previous week pe week 1 is the effective precipitation from the previous week and q is the specific flow per square meter and hour lh 1m 2 that can be provided as irrigation flow if itstd is less than 0 or if itstd is less than itmin no irrigation occurs 2 4 moisture in the soil in this methodology it is important to know the moisture in the soil since the investigation expects to improve water use as well as energy efficiency by having pv panels the consumption of electricity based on conventional energies can be reduced however irrigation time must also be adjusted to take into account soil moisture and so avoid making these times excessive up to the point of losing water through drainage the determination of soil moisture for each sector w i d is established daily using the equation 9 w i d w i d 1 etc m i pe dd where w i d 1 is the soil moisture from the previous day mm etc m is the etc calculated by means of measures taken at weather stations mm i is the irrigation mm pe is the effective precipitation mm and dd is the deep drainage mm this model was simplified by not taking into account surface runoff as it was a drip irrigation system it was assumed that etc m and p e were the same for each sector the calculation of dd is performed when the soil moisture is between saturation sat and field capacity fc the drainage being calculated using the following equation raes 1982 raes et al 2006 1988 10 dd 0 0866 ksat 0 35 sat fc following the guidelines of allen et al 1998 the fraction of the fc of the soil water ps is used so that citrus crops with a coverage greater than 70 do not suffer stress this fraction limits the minimum amount of water mm that the soil should contain so that citrus crops do not suffer stress this is done according to the equation 11 wcrit i 0 5 0 04 5 p s etc 2 5 photovoltaic system the efficiency of the pv cells that make up a pv panel is affected by the temperature they can reach when subjected to irradiance to calculate the temperature of the cell tcel ⁰c the following formula is employed markvart and castaner 2003 12 tcel t tonc 20 si 800 where t is temperature in ⁰c tonc is the nominal operating temperature of the pv cell in this case 45 ⁰c and si is solar irradiance wm 2 the calculation of the available net hourly pv power for each day of the week is determined by the equation 13 p d h p p si 1000 1 α p 100 tcel 25 where pp is the peak power of the pv plate si is the mean hourly irradiance wm 2 αp is the coefficient of variation of pp with temperature ⁰c and tcel is the temperature of the pv cell finally it should be taken into account that the net available power to the pumps for each hour and day of the week pnet d h is affected by the efficiencies of the inverter and the motor of the equipment 14 pnet d h p d h i η fc η m where η fc is the estimated efficiency of the inverter which is 0 9 and η m is the estimated efficiency of the motor which is 0 8 during those weeks where the irrigation hours and energy required were greater than the hours and energy supplied by the pv installation irrigation occurred by means of conventional electricity mérida garcía et al 2019 3 results and discussion the results from the different scenarios are described in two sections the first section analyses the favourability of the predictions with regards to water needs irradiance temperature and pnet while the second section analyses the network s irrigation programming using the meteorological predictions the purpose is to assess whether the use of predictions and the errors committed with them leads to an enhancement of the irrigation programming and in turn to an improvement in the use of water and pv energy while reducing conventional energy consumption 3 1 evaluation of predictions 3 1 1 assessment of irrigation needs firstly to determine the flow rates and pmin i of each of the four sectors making up the network each with different hm i and qi a hydraulic analysis is performed the results are shown in table 1 the irrigation needs have been obtained etc predicted and etc week 1 and compared against etc2019 actual etc in 2019 resulting in 720 9 mm year 1 sce 1 sce 2 and 728 7 mm year 1 sce 3 sce 4 and 715 5 mm year 1 respectively fig 5 shows the weekly irrigation time for the etc predicted sce1 sce2 the etc week 1 sce3 sce4 and etc 2019 having determined the volume of water required the irrigation time were calculated firstly by means of the weather predictions resulting in 429 1 h sector 1year 1 of irrigation and secondly using the etc of the previous week methodology traditionally used obtaining 433 8 h sector 1year 1 of irrigation this represents a saving in it and water volume of 1 1 per year the etc was determined on a weekly basis each monday for every week in 2019 both for the etc predicted sce1 sce2 and the etc week 1 sce3 sce4 as can be seen in table 2 we analyse the average weekly error of the etc predicted and etc week 1 for the period of maximum in from april 1st to september 30th moreover it is analysed for the periods of minimum in from january 1st to march 31st and from october 1st to december 31st and the entire year 2019 as well as the maximum and minimum relative errors and the percentage of standard deviation that occurred the relative error for uncompensated etc predicted was 9 9 while for the uncompensated etc week 1 historical data it increased to 24 8 once etc predicted and etc week 1 had been compensated as indicated in section 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 the relative error for compensated etc predicted analysed amounted to 12 4 while for the historical data the compensated etc week 1 increased to 24 1 table 2 shows the relative errors for etc predicted and etc week 1 the etc compensated with the previous week s error is greater than the error of the etc because compensating from the previous week can generate a greater difference relative to the etc of the week to be predicted however the convenience of using the compensated etc is due to the fact that throughout the year the same amount of mm is irrigated as the etc of that year from here it can be determined that the relative errors are lower for etc predicted than for etc week 1 so it is advisable to use the former to determine the in 3 1 2 evaluation of sectors according to soil moisture content this section presents the soil moisture results achieved for the 4 scenarios as table 1 indicates the sector that required the most energy is sector 3 and the sector that required the least energy is sector 2 the effective precipitation and minimum soil moisture required so that plants would not suffer stress have also been represented in none of the 4 scenarios did the plants suffer stress because there was a lower limit of humidity beyond which irrigation always took place fixed at 25 of the fc i which in this case was 82 5 mm if this percentage is decreased the number of hours irrigated by pv energy is increased but the crop approaches the threshold of water stress it can be observed in fig 6 that the humidity in the sector of maximum power requirements for pumping avoids the minimum humidity established 75 of fci this is because it is the sector that first takes advantage of the hours of available energy in contrast the sector with the minimum power requirement for pumping does reach the minimum humidity established because it is the last sector to be irrigated throughout the week and therefore this sector is the one that required more electrical energy due to the low humidity of the soil 3 1 3 evaluation of irradiance temperature and net power for photovoltaic pumping the highest monthly irradiance coincided with the highest irrigation needs mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 as can be seen in fig 7 upon calculating the average monthly irradiance in kwhm 2day 1 we observe that when comparing the irradpredicted and the irradiance measured in 2019 irrad2019 there is an average relative error every month of 3 68 and when comparing the irrad10 years with respect to that measured in 2019 there is an average relative error every month of 6 7 this justifies the relevance of our proposal of incorporating meteorological predictions in irrigation scheduling to reduce uncertainty the irradiance and temperature and with it the pnet d h were established every monday of 2019 both for the parameters predicted by weather predictions sce1 sce3 as for the predictions made using the average data from the last 10 years sce2 sce4 as can be seen in table 3 the daily relative errors of irradiance temperature and pnet are analysed for the period of maximum in from april 1st to september 30th for the periods of minimum in from january 1st to march 31st and from october 1st to december 31st and for the entire year 2019 as well as the maximum and minimum relative error and the percentage standard deviation produced fig 8 shows a comparison between the different net available power pnet computations throughout the whole year 2019 based on a the average irradiance data from the last 10 years sce 2 sce 4 green line b weather prediction data sce 1 sce 3 blue line c actual measured irradiance which of course cannot be used for scheduling red line the observed annual square error in table 3 is improved to 24 when using our proposed methodology with the predicted values as opposed to 46 when using the historical data fig 8 shows the pnet predicted using weather forecasts after applying the kalman filter the pnet based on historical data and the pnet calculated with data measured in 2019 to demonstrate the importance of the configuration of the irrigation sectors the 23rd june 2019 a day without clouds has been chosen fig 9 shows the irradpredicted irrad10 years and irrad2019 for that day as well as the minimum irradiance required to make the network operate on pv power for each of the sectors that make up the network it is observed that the sectors were only operational between the irradiances 265 and 330 wm 2 therefore methodologies should be established in order to take advantage of all the pv energy throughout the day such as that proposed by mérida garcía et al 2018 zavala et al 2020 where the simultaneous operation of several irrigation sectors reduces the cost of the pv system making it advantageous in terms of energy use efficiency another option is to study the possibility of programming by dynamically changing the sectors with different pmin i that better adjust to the irradiance available there by optimizing the use of pv energy 3 2 evaluation of the programming of the operation of the irrigation network this section studies how irrigation programming based on predictions affects the differential use of pv and conventional energy the evaluation of the irrigation schedule for each sector is carried out by analysing the following factors the irrigation and drainage doses the irrigation hours carried out respectively by conventional energy and pv energy and the soil moisture for the 4 sectors itmin was set to 0 5 h to avoid excessive system start ups and shutdowns the target humidity was set at the fc i 110 mm and the point of minimum humidity was established as 25 lower than the fc i that is 82 5 mm drainage occurs when there was precipitation since the possibility that soil moisture exceeded the field capacity only existed when there was rain as described in eqs 9 and 10 to avoid the problem of drainage due to rainfall in future works rainfall predictions should be improved and implemented an vo et al 2019 especially using a wider temporal framework 3 2 1 evaluation of irrigation dose and drainage each sector is irrigated depending on its proximity to the target humidity i e fc i or wcrit i of the etc determined for that week the rainfall and the hours of available pv energy as for itacu i this could be less than itstd or itpred week of the one already established because it would be lower if there are irrigations lower than it min or if the cc i was exceeded on the contrary a particular week s irrigation dose would increase if soil moisture fell below the minimum set threshold which was 25 of the fc i fig 10 a shows the annual irrigation dose for each sector depending on each of the scenarios the annual consumptions for the 4 sectors were 2853 6 mm 2869 mm 2877 2 mm and 2897 mm for scenarios sce1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the least amount of irrigated water was achieved when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 however the differences between scenarios were not highly significant however if they would be compared with farmer practices of the study area highly savings should be achieved until 24 5 li et al 2018 drainage in the case study does not occur due to irrigation since the latter is halted once the target humidity fc i is reached however in the periods when precipitation occurred drainage is dependent on the proximity of the target moisture to the soil moisture in periods of precipitation when the target moisture is reached the drainage is equal to the precipitation while the closer the soil moisture is to the minimum moisture permitted the more capacity the soil had to retain precipitated water fig 10 b shows the annual drainage for the 4 sectors depending on each of the scenarios annual drainage was 700 6 mm 716 mm 721 3 mm and 719 2 mm for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively the lower annual amount of drainage water is obtained when combining etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 3 2 2 evaluation of sectors 3 2 2 1 evaluation of sectors for the use of photovoltaic energy the total annual operating hours employed irrigating the 4 sectors were 1698 5 1707 7 1712 6 and 1710 2 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the least need for operating hours occurred when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 fig 11 shows the irrigation hours powered by pv energy and conventional energy respectively in separate diagrams the sum of the two is the total hours of irrigation that had to be employed over the course of a year to cover the irrigation needs that had been established the sector that required the fewest hours of conventional energy was the one with the highest pmin i and so on successively until reaching the sector with the lowest pmin i reciprocally the sector which received the most hours of pv energy was also the one with the highest pmin i the other sectors following consecutively from highest to lowest pmin i the annual pv hours supplying irrigation to the 4 sectors were 1322 6 1236 1257 1 and 1144 6 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the highest use of pv energy irrigation hours was when using the combination of etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 alternatively the annual hours using conventional energy to supply irrigation to the 4 sectors were 375 9 471 8 455 6 and 565 7 for scenarios sce 1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively showing that the lowest use of conventional energy irrigation hours happened when combining etc predicted and irradpredicted sce1 conventional energy was connected on those occasions when the irradiance was not sufficient to perform the irrigation already programmed by means of the predictions of both irradpredicted and irrad10 years furthermore conventional energy was also connected at those times when the soil moisture was less than 25 of the target humidity fc i and there was no pv energy available to supply the system as indicated in fig 12 here we can observe that the hours of irrigation when conventional energy was used in the sce1 and sce2 scenarios was due to the fact that the soil moisture had dropped below 25 of the fc i however for the sce3 and sce4 scenarios the use of conventional energy was mainly due to errors in weather forecasting an analysis of the absolute error made using the predictions of irrad10 years and irradpredicted compared to the irrad2019 respectively was carried out as shown in fig 13 this was achieved by analysing the differences between the average values of measured and predicted irradiance for each hour of the day during the year of 2019 in this way taking into account the times when the greatest absolute positive error occurred between the measured and predicted irradiance the conventional electricity consumption could be estimated since these hours coincided on average with when the predicted irradiances were less than the irrad2019 ones however the pmin i would have to be guaranteed at least for the hours when the equipment operated on pv energy in the case of irradiance variation when irrigation took place in the event that the humidity dropped below 25 of the fc i these irrigations could be carried out in the off peak hours of lowest cost the percentages between the hours of irrigation performed using pv energy and the hours of available energy are 13 37 12 52 12 74 and 11 64 for scenarios sce1 sce2 sce3 and sce4 respectively from this it can be observed that the greatest uses of pv energy occurred in scenarios sce1 and sce3 where irradpredicted was used researchers in zavala et al 2020 managed to go from 15 4 to 18 4 through a process of combining the sectors the aforementioned scenarios used 79 and 75 of pv energy respectively compared to scenarios sce2 and sc4 which used 74 and 68 pv energy respectively in table 4 the total number of irrigation hours for each scenario and for each sector are described in addition the percentages of the total irrigation time conducted with renewable energies for each of the sectors and scenarios are also indicated the difference between the total hours of irrigation and the hours irrigated by renewable energies allows us to obtain the percentages of hours of irrigation supplied by conventional energy for each of the sectors and scenarios table 4 shows the percentage of hours irrigated with conventional energy for these two situations as sector 3 was the first to be assigned pnet d h it obtained a higher percentage of pv energy and it was not necessary to use conventional energy to maintain this sector s soil moisture level above wcrit i only prediction errors forced the use of conventional energy on the other hand sector 2 the sector with the lowest pmin i was the one that made the greatest use of conventional energy and the largest percentage of it was due to the fact that wcrit i was not reached once the causes of the pv power failure have been determined the next step would be to study which is the appropriate alternative energy to cover this gap researchers pardo et al 2019 studied the effect of incorporating batteries for storing energy to protect the system against emergencies and the results showed that there is no universal solution this is due to the fact that there are a large number of alternatives available when buying the equipment and hence in future savings mérida garcía et al 2019 demonstrated from an environmental point of view that pv energy was the lowest cost option both when connected to the grid as when not compared to using generator sets moreover the possibility of exporting excess energy to the electricity grid resulted in six times less environmental impact compared to an installation that was not connected 4 conclusions the use of short term meteorological predictions using a week s timeframe allows the estimation of the irradiance and the irrigation needs of the crops with greater precision than other commonly used methods average of historical data or extrapolation of last week s data permitting irrigation operations to be programmed in advance however every prediction is subject to some uncertainty and if the prediction is not met an additional energy source is needed in the cases where not irrigation ponds are available for storing and supply water in this case study the relative error in the estimation of net power incurred during the period of greatest irrigation needs was 26 3 for weather forecasts as opposed to 50 using historical data the application of weather forecasts in the calculation of irradiance and irrigation needs sce1 as opposed to the use of historical data and the calculation of evapotranspiration based on what happened in the past sce4 led to an improved use of renewable energy from 68 7 to 79 3 and to an increase in the use of available photovoltaic energy from 11 64 to 13 37 to improve this last indicator we must act on the irrigation programming by dynamically changing the sectors configuration and number of hydrants to adapt them to the net available pv power improving the predictions accompanied by a reduction in the prediction timeframe will improve the percentage of renewable energy used and increase the hours of available energy use while keeping the moisture levels within crop requirements declaration of competing interest the authors

of land used for orchards has increased from 1 66 million ha in 1978 12 27 million ha in 2019 accounting for 7 32 of the total land area in china china statistical yearbook 1978 2020 within this land use the land area devoted to grape vineyards has increased rapidly since 1980 reaching 0 73 million ha in 2019 china statistical yearbook 2020 hebei province in north china is a major grape producing area that accounts for 9 14 and 6 23 of the chinese grape yield and cultivation area respectively china statistical yearbook 2020 however there has been poor development of rational fertilizer management strategies in this area because large amounts of n fertilizers including inorganic and organic fertilizer are commonly applied to ensure high yields indeed the nitrogen application rate chemical fertilizer and animal manure is as high as 1140 5250 kg ha 1 yin 2013 in addition multiple topdressings combined with flood irrigation are usually adopted during the grape growth period barlow et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 these excessive water and n applications will inevitably induce soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n accumulation as well as stimulate high levels of n2o emission and nh3 volatilization which results in lost revenue and poses a major risk to the environment and human health therefore rational management strategies are urgently needed to reduce these gaseous losses from vineyard soils in china water and n are the two most critical production resources that farmers can manage to ensure high yields and low environmental impacts during crop cultivation most studies conducted to date have shown that the application of n fertilizers can stimulate n2o production from agricultural soils khalil et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 rowlings et al 2013 shcherbak et al 2014 qu et al 2014 maris et al 2015 qin et al 2021 fertilizer application is also considered a major source of nh3 volatilization from soils akiyama et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 pang et al 2021 in addition surface broadcast applications of fertilizer n resulted in a highly volatile source of n especially in the high air temperature fenn and kissel 1974 huijsmans et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 2020 however it is well known that soil moisture conditions drive n2o production webster and hopkins 1996 this is because high soil moisture content restricts oxygen diffusion into the soil and no3 n is easily denitrified thereby increasing n2o emissions inubushi et al 1999 ridolfi 2003 zhu 2013 wu et al 2017 studies have showed that nh3 loss from soils generally decreases with increasing soil water content fenn and escarzaga 1976 liu et al 2007 however schlesinger and peterjohn 1991 reported that higher levels of water addition were found to increase the nh3 volatilization when the same amount of n was applied which could be due to the water evaporation increases the nh3 gas emission from the soil thus optimizing water and n management might be one of the most effective ways to reduce both n2o emissions or nh3 volatilization from agricultural soils fertigation integrated management of water and fertilizer is the application of soluble fertilizers through micro irrigation systems to enhance water and fertilizer use efficiency in farmland shirgure and nagpur 2013 zheng et al 2016 currently fertigation is applied in nearly 30 provinces in china and it is used for wheat corn potato apple grape and other crops gao et al 2012 most studies of fertigation technology conducted to date have focused on water and fertilizer use efficiencies and crop yields but there is a lack of knowledge about its effects on gaseous losses from agricultural soils therefore it is not clear if the high mobility of fertilizers is a disadvantage in reducing gaseous n losses from agricultural soils the use of nitrification inhibitors nis together with n fertilizer has been reported as a proposed strategy to reduce n losses from agricultural soils and increase n use efficiency by retarding the oxidation of nh4 to no3 n via nitrification thereby reducing n2o emissions hatch et al 2005 ruser et al 2015 one of the most popular nis is 3 4 dimethylpyrazol phosphate dmpp which has been widely applied worldwide during the last decade dmpp can be effective at very low rates 0 5 1 0 kg dmpp ha 1 and has no toxicological or eco toxicological side effects zerulla 2001 moreover many studies have shown that dmpp can significantly reduce n2o emissions from various cropping systems or grazed pasture systems di and cameron 2012 liu et al 2013 pfab et al 2012 scheer et al 2015 rose et al 2017 tedeschi et al 2021 although the long term persistence of excessive nh4 in soil could increase the risk of nh3 volatilization some studies have demonstrated that dmpp had no significant effects on nh3 volatilization li et al 2009 khariri et al 2016 menéndez et al 2006 nevertheless there is currently very little quantitative information regarding how the application of dmpp affects n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from orchard soils therefore we conducted a one year field study to measure n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization in typical table grape plantations in north china using different water and n management strategies the objectives of the present study were to 1 assess the effects of different water and n management strategies on n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization 2 identify the key factors affecting n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization and 3 identify a more reasonable method for management of water and n to achieve a win win situation for both the economy and the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the experiment was conducted in changli county 39 45 n 119 05 e qinhuangdao hebei province china this region has a semi humid continental climate with a typical mean temperature of 11 c and an annual precipitation of 638 mm table grapes and wine grapes are the main crops grown in the region the field investigated was continuously cultivated with table grapes vitis vinifera l using traditional management methods for 12 years before the experiment the soil was classified as sandy loam according to the usda soil classification table 1 typical chemical and physical properties of surface soil 0 30 cm sampled before the field experiment in april 2017 are shown in table 1 the experiment included

completely randomized block design with three replicates three experimental plots each experimental plot 5 m 2 2 m consisted of six plants and the adjacent plots were separated by a 0 2 m wide ridge to prevent contamination of water and fertilizer treatments the fertilizer n was applied as urea 46 n in the twn treatment the amounts of urea n and irrigation preferred by local grape cultivators were used dmpp was applied in the own dmpp treatment at a rate of 4 6 kg ha 1 1 of the applied urea n in addition to the urea n application calcium superphosphate potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulphate were applied in all treatments at 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 535 kg k2o ha 1 respectively details regarding the application rates and dates of fertilizer inputs in all treatments throughout the grape growth season are given in table 2 for the mwf treatment all inorganic fertilizers were dissolved with the proper amount of irrigation water and then injected into a 20 cm radius circle centered around the vine trunks with a liquid jet gun fig s1 and then flood irrigation was adopted for the other treatments inorganic fertilizers and dmpp were applied using the furrowing method each furrow had a depth of 15 cm and was located approximately 20 cm away from the vine rows after fertilizer and dmpp applications the furrows were covered with soil and the plants were also flood irrigated the tds 100 ultrasonic flow meter was used to ensure the irrigation volumes in different treatments by controlling the flow rate and time 2 2 n2o and nh3 sampling and analysis gas samples were collected using a closed static chamber method the enclosure chamber was constructed from opaque pvc 13 8 cm in diameter and 15 5 cm in height and was fitted inside a base 15 cm in diameter and height inserted into the soil zhang et al 2021 during n2o sample collection the space between the enclosure chamber and the base was sealed with water to prevent gas leakage normally the n2o was sampled at day 1 3 5 7 and 10 after each fertilization and irrigation event and then at a 10 day interval until the next fertilization and irrigation event additionally gas samples were collected once a day for three consecutive days after irrigation or heavy precipitation 20 mm gas samples were collected from the chambers through a three way valve using a 50 ml plastic syringe at 0 15 and 30 min after closure between 9 00 am and 11 00 am the sample gasses 30 ml were then transferred to 20 ml vacuum glass vials that were sealed with rubber stoppers the concentration of n2o was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 7890 a gc system agilent technologies usa the n2o flux was calculated using the following equation zhu et al 2015 f ρ h dc dt 273 273 t 60 where f is the n2o flux μg n m 2 h 1 ρ is the density of n2o g cm 3 at standard atmospheric pressure h is the height cm of the sampling chamber dc dt is the average rate of n2o concentration increase in the sampling chamber ppbv min 1 and t is the air temperature c in the chamber nh3 volatilization was measured daily using a simple semi quantitative closed chamber method wang et al 2002 immediately after each topdressing application a closed pvc chamber 19 cm in diameter and 26 cm in height was inserted into the soil in each plot to a depth of about 5 cm an evaporating dish with 20 ml 2 boric acid h3bo3 solution was placed on a iron tripod and then placed inside the closed chamber the h3bo3 solution in the evaporating dish was replaced with fresh solution every 24 h and taken to the laboratory for analysis measurements were made from three replicates of each treatment and continued until the volatilization losses decreased to background levels nh3 flux kg n ha 1 day 1 was calculated using the following equation nh3 m a d 10 2 where m is the nh3 concentration in the acid trap nh3 mg a is the total cross sectional area m2 of soil cores in the chamber and d is the duration day of each sampling the air temperature inside the chamber and the soil temperature at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm were also recorded at the time of sampling using a digital thermometer and geothermometer respectively the cumulative n2o emissions were estimated by successive linear interpolations of average emissions measurements to estimate n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from the entire vineyard these gases were collected from the ridges non fertilized zone nf and furrows fertilized zone after which the weighted average of the n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from the two sampling zones were calculated to represent the gas loss of the entire vineyard 2 3 soil and crop sampling soil samples were taken from triplicate plots at a depth of 0 10 cm on days 1 3 5 7 and 10 after fertilization and irrigation to analyze soil ph wfps nh4 n and no3 n contents soil ph was measured with a soil to water ratio of 2 5 using a mettler toledo ph meter the soil humidity evaluated as water filled pore space wfps which was calculated using the following equation zhu et al 2015 wfps volumetric water content total soil porosity 100 at the harvest time the grape weight of each plot was measured manually and then converted to total grape yield per hectare 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical data analyses were performed using spss 22 0 and all figures were drawn using sigmaplot 13 0 statistically significant differences were tested use analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 level correlation analyses were conducted using pearson s correlation test 3 results 3 1 precipitation and soil temperature during the grape growing season fig 1 presents the precipitation and soil temperature 0 5 cm and 0 10 cm in the vineyard during the grape growing season may to november in 2017 in general the soil temperature rose continuously from may to july then continuously declined until november the soil temperature at 0 5 cm ranged from 5 c to 38 c with a mean of 26 c while the soil temperature at 0 10 cm ranged from 5 c to 34 c with a mean of 23 c during the grape growing season the heavy precipitation events in this study site mainly occurred in the rainy season from june and august and the total precipitation was 515 mm 3 2 soil moisture wfps during the grape growing season the soil moisture levels observed in the four treatments were similar and showed obvious variation with time the wfps levels were below 50 and ranged from 11 to 44 during the grape growing season fig 2 different amounts of irrigation water were applied to the twn mwf and own own dmpp treatments and the mean soil moisture in the twn was significantly higher 28 90 p 0 05 than that for the mwf 25 17 own 26 11 and own dmpp 25 26 treatments however there were no significant differences between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 3 soil nh4 n and no 3 n contents the soil nh4 n and no3 n production from the four fertilized treatments during the four fertilization and irrigation periods is presented in fig 3 the nh4 n contents in the twn treatment varied from 13 82 to 67 44 mg kg with an average of 31 91 mg kg during the experimental period the nh4 n contents in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments ranged from 11 23 to 45 79 mg kg 10 99 46 83 mg kg and 12 18 58 61 mg kg with averages of 26 83 22 99 and 27 75 mg kg respectively during the first application of fertilizer and irrigation the nh4 n content for the twn treatment was higher than those in the other treatments however after the third application of fertilizer and irrigation the nh4 n content for the own dmpp treatment was higher than that of the twn mwf and own treatments which indicated that the addition of dmpp resulted in most of the n being in the form of nh4 n nevertheless there was no significant difference in nh4 n content among fertilized treatments throughout the grape growing period the soil no3 n contents in all of the fertilized treatments showed similar changes the soil no3 n content in the twn treatment increased dramatically after every application of n fertilizer overall the no3 n content in the twn treatment ranged from 11 38 to 72 13 mg kg with an average of 38 05 mg kg during the experimental period however the no3 n contents in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments were relatively low ranging from 9 21 to 36 61 mg kg 7 29 34 50 mg kg and 6 26 26 89 mg kg with average reductions of 44 87 52 32 and 59 42 respectively p 0 05 in addition there were no significant differences among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments 3 4 soil n2o emission flux as shown in fig 4 there were marked temporal variations in n2o emission fluxes in all of the treatments high emissions were continuously detected from may to october during which time the majority of the annual emissions were contributed while low fluxes were mainly observed in november peak fluxes of n2o were detected immediately after each fertilization and irrigation event over the entire experimental period the n2o emission fluxes of the twn mwf own and own dmpp treatments ranged from 0 007 0 001 0 383 0 039 0 003 0 001 0 0 239 0 066 0 007 0 001 0 128 0 065 and 0 003 0 001 0 044 0 041 kg ha 1d 1 respectively the calculated mean n2o fluxes were greatest for the twn treatment 0 142 kg ha 1d 1 and these were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the mwf 0 037 kg ha 1d 1 own 0 037 kg ha 1d 1 and own dmpp 0 017 kg ha 1d 1 treatments however one way anova demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 5 soil nh3 volatilization rate the temporal patterns of nh3 volatilization rates were similar across treatments fig 5 the nh3 volatilization rate increased after each application of fertilizer and irrigation and showed several flux peaks which generally appeared 1 3 days after n fertilizer application and irrigation most of the volatilization loss occurred within 2 weeks of n application and decreased thereafter until the next n fertilizer application during this period the mean nh3 volatilization rates from the mwf own and own dmpp treatments were 0 051 0 040 and 0 045 kg ha 1d 1 respectively while it was 0 069 kg ha 1d 1 from the twn the three reduced n and irrigation treatments mwf own and own dmpp significantly reduced nh3 volatilization however there was no significant difference in nh3 volatilization between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 6 gaseous n loss as n2o and nh3 the cumulative n2o emissions were 3 90 0 02 2 76 0 09 2 83 2 83 and 2 65 0 06 kg ha 1 for the twn mwf own and own dmpp groups respectively table 3 the cumulative n2o emissions for the twn treatment were significantly higher than those of the mwf own and own dmpp p 0 05 groups but there were no significant differences among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments table 3 when compared with the twn treatment there were 29 23 27 44 and 32 05 reductions in n2o emissions in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments respectively the fertilizer induced n2o emission factor ef was 0 59 in the twn treatment while it was 0 58 0 67 in the three reduced n and irrigation treatments table 4 the cumulative nh3 volatilization from all treatments was relatively low over the entire experimental period ranging from 1 13 0 01 1 21 0 08 kg ha 1 the nh3 loss from the soil was significantly higher in the twn treatment than the mwf own and own dmpp treatments p 0 05 however the proportion of applied n emitted as nh3 in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments increased to 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively relative to the twn group 0 18 table 3 overall there were still 4 13 mwf 6 61 own and 4 96 own dmpp reductions in total nh3 volatilization and these were mainly caused by the low n application rates and optimum managed irrigation in these treatments 3 7 grape yield yield scaled n2o emissions and yield scaled nh3 volatilization the yields of grapes for all treatments followed the order own dmpp mwf own twn fig 6a relative to twn 12816 68 3707 12 kg ha 1 the yields from the three reduced n and irrigation treatments mwf own and own dmpp increased 8 81 19 35 but no significant differences were observed among fertilized treatments the grape yield scaled n2o emissions from the twn plot 0 322 0 065 g kg 1 yield were significantly higher than those from the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 fig 6b when compared with twn the mwf own and own dmpp treatments significantly decreased grape yield scaled n2o emissions by 42 74 34 66 and 43 71 respectively p 0 05 however there were no obvious differences in yield scaled n2o emissions among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments although the yield scaled nh3 volatilization decreased when limiting the n and water applied to the vineyard the lowest yield scaled nh3 volatilization was achieved for the mwf treatment nevertheless there were no significant differences among treatments fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 grape yield irrigation and fertilization are key practices for improving the quality and yield of fruit hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and n fertilizers such as urea and nh4 2so4 are commonly applied to increase grape yields however while excessive n inputs and irrigation doses can significantly improve fruit yields they may also cause serious environmental problems in the current study although the urea n application rate in the twn treatment was as high as 641 kg ha 1 this group had the lowest yield 12 816 68 kg ha 1 when compared with the twn plot the grape yields increased by 8 81 19 35 for the three reduced n and irrigation treatments fig 5a moreover the irrigation amounts in the mwf and own own dmpp treatments were 2184 m3 and 2548 m3 which was 40 and 50 less water than was used in the twn treatment respectively we also found higher grape yield in plants receiving the urea fertilization supplemented with dmpp when compared with those fertilized with urea alone which is in agreement with the results of other studies conducted in citrus apple and peach production systems martínez alcántara et al 2013 wang et al 2022 vilarrasa nogué et al 2020 overall these findings imply that optimized n and irrigation management could provide agronomic benefits by decreasing n and water inputs while maintaining grape yields 4 2 correlations between n2o flux or nh3 volatilization rate and soil environmental factors n2o emitted from soils is mainly produced by the microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification bateman et al 2005 park et al 2012 butterbachbahl et al 2013 and factors such as soil moisture temperature and mineral n can greatly influence the temporal patterns of n2o emissions meng et al 2005 he et al 2009 rowlings et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in this study we observed that n2o fluxes were significantly related to soil temperature wfps and mineral n contents table 3 which is consistent with the results of previous studies pang et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 alsina et al 2013 mei et al 2011 moreover n2o flux increased within a few days of each water and n treatment being applied in all of the fertilized plots then decreased obviously after reaching the peak value fig 3 a positive linear relationship between n2o flux and nh4 n content was also found in all of the fertilized plots and the soil wfps was below 50 during the experimental period fig 2 indicating that n2o was mainly produced by the action of nitrification in soil bremner et al 1978 bateman et al 2005 previous studies have shown that relatively high temperature could also stimulate n2o emissions from soil which is in line with the finding that n2o fluxes showed significant seasonal variation and there was high n2o emission from may to september followed by decreases with decreasing temperature yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 fig 3 studies have also shown that nitrification is the main process when the soil water content is less than 60 while denitrification is the main process when the soil water content is more than 60 the n2o emission in the own dmpp treatment was less affected by soil water content while that in the other treatments increased with increasing soil water content which may indicate that dmpp influences n2o emissions more than soil water content the nh3 volatilization rate is significantly correlated with the concentration of nh4 n zhang et al 2014 and is also affected by climate conditions soil physical and chemical properties and management measures previous studies have shown that atmospheric and soil temperature are the main meteorological factors affecting nh3 volatilization zhang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 warming can reduce the solubility of nh3 and increase the ratio of nh3 nh4 n in water thereby promoting the diffusion of nh3 in soil to the atmosphere sharpe and harper 1995 moreover increasing temperature can enhance the soil urease and microbial activity which is conducive to the hydrolysis of urea and increases the volatilization of nh3 our results also revealed a significant positive correlation between 10 cm soil temperature and soil nh3 volatilization rate which is consistent with the results of other studies sanz cobena et al 2008 pfluke et al 2011 however unlike other studies there was no significant correlation observed between nh3 volatilization and soil wfps or inorganic n contents which may have been because there was less nh3 volatilization in this study since the measurements of nh3 volatilization rate were conducted only one year of grape yield and the nh3 volatilization rate measured by using the closed chamber method in this study is also relatively large uncertainties compared with other monitoring methods the relationship between soil nh3 volatilization and soil environmental factors needs to be further studied 4 3 n2o emission and nh3 volatilization from vineyard excessive n fertilizer and irrigation water is usually applied to orchard production systems resulting in severe losses of n gases through n2o emission and nh3 volatilization in this study we observed that annual n2o emissions from the fertilized treatments ranged from 2 65 to 3 90 kg n ha 1 table 2 these values are within the range reported by gu et al 2019 who found that the cumulative n2o emissions from fruit cropping systems ranged from 0 116 26 kg ha 1 year 1 or growing season worldwide however the efs 0 58 0 67 were slightly lower than the ipcc default ef value of 1 for upland soils ipcc 2006 the n2o emissions observed in our study might have been lower because urea n fertilizer was applied at a depth of 15 20 cm and immediately followed by irrigation in vineyard plantations which is known to reduce loss of n2o via emissions maris et al 2015 previous studies demonstrated that nh3 volatilization loss accounted for 14 24 of the total n input in agricultural systems worldwide gong et al 2013 wan et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however lower nh3 volatilization losses of the annual applied n fertilizer amounts were observed in orchards abascal et al 2019 reported nh3 volatilization accounted for 2 59 3 50 of the total n applied in olive orchards while ge et al 2010 2017 showed that nh3 volatilization accounted for 2 29 6 12 of the n in an apple orchard and wang et al 2019 observed that the net loss by nh3 volatilization was 2 72 4 48 in a pear orchard however few studies have reported nh3 volatilization from vineyards to date our data showed that annual nh3 volatilization was only 1 13 1 21 kg n ha 1 table 2 which accounted for 0 18 0 28 of the total amount of chemical n applied and was much lower than that of other orchards large nh3 volatilization losses may not have occurred because 1 the inorganic fertilizers were mainly applied into open furrows that were 15 20 cm deep and then covered with a thick layer about 10 cm of soil for irrigation which is known to be capable of effectively reducing nh3 volatilization loss chuong et al 2020 2 the soil at the experimental site was a sandy loam with a ph of 4 39 soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 which is not conducive to the production of nh3 indeed it is generally believed that an acidic ph will shift the soil ammonia ammonium equilibrium towards non volatile ammonium zhang et al 2014 cai et al 1998 asman et al 1998 bowden 1986 hafner et al 2012 3 although the closed chamber method is very practical in monitoring the nh3 volatilization rate it has some defects for example the result of nh3 determination is lower than that of ventilation method due to the micro meteorological environment conditions in the chamber were changed wang et al 2002 4 4 n2o emission and nh3 volatilization mitigation based on the above discussions the total gaseous loss n2o emission and nh3 volatilization rate of 0 77 0 95 table 2 low n use efficiency nue of approximately 16 25 unpublished data after grape harvest and the sandy loam soil conditions at the experimental site indicate that large amounts of urea n can be lost through accumulation and leaching in the soil profile or into the atmosphere in the form of no and n2 some studies have reported n2o emissions loss in vineyards ranged from 0 07 to 11 20 marques et al 2018 wolff et al 2018 garland et al 2014 steenwerth et al 2010 verhoeven et al 2014 fentabil et al 2016 these differences among the vineyards might be caused by variations in the rate of n application measurement frequencies and the local climate soil physicochemical properties until now there was few studies have reported nh3 emissions in vineyards xing et al 2021 reported that the nh3 volatilization loss in orchard has reached 36 52 115 9 kg ha 1 and the loss rate reached up to 12 in our study although the n2o emission and nh3 volatilization were relatively minor components of the n cycle and not the major pathways for n loss moreover the defects and uncertainties associated with the closed chamber method of soil gas flux measurements the air pollution caused by these factors cannot be ignored thus there is an urgent need to develop effective mitigation measures to improve crop yield and n use efficiency while reducing negative environmental impacts the results of the present study clearly demonstrated that reduced n and water application mwf own and own dmpp can significantly reduce loss of n as n2o and nh3 compared with traditional n fertilization and irrigation twn moreover the mwf treatment was found to effectively reduce n2o emission and ammonia volatilization because of the reduced n fertilizer application and irrigation using this method dissolved fertilizer is directly injected into the crop roots which effectively improves the availability and use of nutrients mandal and thakur 2010 application of urea n fertilizer with a nitrification inhibitor in the own dmpp treatment was shown to reduce n2o emissions 6 79 over urea n alone at a rate of 460 kg hm2 table 2 but the reduction rate was lower than the rate in the previous report 49 vilarrasa nogué et al 2020 which may have been related to the lower fertilization area different physiochemical properties of soil and crop types moreover the application of dmpp delays the transformation of soil nh4 n to no3 n resulting in the accumulation of nh4 n in the soil which may lead to increased nh3 volatilization castellano hinojosa et al 2020 zaman and nguyen 2012 the results of this study also showed that treatment with own dmpp increased nh3 volatilization by 1 77 compared with the own treatment however this change was not significant which is consistent with the results of a previous study menéndez et al 2009 scaling emissions to yields can be useful when evaluating whether mitigation regulations will be acceptable to farmers thus yield scaled emissions were used in this study to address concerns about future food supply and climate change grassini and cassman 2012 huang et al 2016 our results showed that the three n reduction and water control management strategies led to a significant reduction in yield scaled n2o emissions 34 66 43 71 while increasing grape yields 8 81 19 35 however the yield scaled nh3 volatilization was significantly influenced by different n and water management strategies which may have been related to the reduced ammonia volatilization observed in this study among these treatments the mobile water and fertilizer treatment mwf showed a better reduction of gas emissions during grape cultivation given that there was no difference in grape yield when n was applied at 413 664 kg ha 1 and the irrigation amount was 2184 2548 m3 ha 1 we suggest that reducing n and irrigation water by 30 40 relative to traditional water and n management changing fertilization methods and applying nitrification inhibitors can effectively reduce gaseous losses of n2o and nh3 however it should be noted that while we analyzed the gaseous losses of n under different water and n management systems the effects of these management strategies on soil n leaching need to be further verified 5 conclusion the results of this study indicate that excessive input of water and n in a table grape vineyard led to the gaseous loss of n2o and nh3 but the proportion lost was relatively small accounting for only 0 77 0 95 of the total n input these findings suggest that n2o emission and nh3 volatilization were relatively minor components of the n cycle and not the major pathways for n loss nevertheless the air pollution caused by these factors cannot be ignored fertilized table grape plantations are an important source of n2o emissions in orchard soils in china rational regulation of water and n can effectively reduce n2o emission and nh3 volatilization as well as yield scaled gaseous losses while increasing yield in vineyard plantations based on these findings the mwf treatment is recommended for higher fruit yield and lower gaseous losses in table grape vineyard cultivation systems in north china in addition this study revealed that application of a reduced amount of urea combined with the nitrification inhibitor dmpp greatly reduced n2o emissions while increasing yield moreover it is also necessary to conduct c print analyses in future which could provide theoretical basics for greenhouse gas emission reduction in vineyards due to some objective reasons the field experiment was conducted only one year in table grape vineyard in this study therefore it is noteworthy that the effects of different water and n managements on n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization in other climate plantations needs to be investigated which is mainly due to the regulation mechanism and efficiency depended not only on the amounts of water and n application but also on climatic conditions in addition relatively immature monitoring methods and low gases sampling frequencies at 10 day intervals in this study may increase the uncertainty of gaseous n losses in vineyard fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

9566,agricultural soils are a major source of anthropogenic n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization because of the large input of nitrogen n via fertilizers chinese vineyards commonly receive excessive water and n applications but the response of gaseous losses to these management practices are not well documented in this study a field experiment was conducted to measure n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from a typical table grape vitis vinifera l vineyard in north china three water and n regulation management strategies were applied and compared with the local farmer s traditional water and n management twn traditional flooding irrigation and traditional n application rate flood irrigation was carried out after the fertilizers furrowing applied as a control mobile water and fertilization mwf 62 tradition n application rate and 60 traditional irrigation amount flood irrigation was carried out after the dissolved fertilizers injected into rhizosphere 20 cm deep with a liquid jet gun optimum water and n own 69 tradition n application rate and 70 traditional irrigation amount the fertilization and irrigation method were the same as those in the twn treatment and optimum water and n combined with the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate dmpp own dmpp 1 dmpp was applied on the basis of the own treatment the mwf own and own dmpp treatments significantly p 0 05 reduced the mean n2o fluxes with little effect on the nh3 volatilization rate however over the whole grape growing season the cumulative n2o total and yield scaled n2o emissions in the three treatment groups were significantly reduced by 27 44 29 23 and 34 66 43 71 respectively in addition the cumulative nh3 and yield scaled nh3 volatilization were reduced by 4 13 6 61 and 21 81 26 15 respectively notably n2o emissions were significantly positively correlated with soil temperature wfps and nh4 n nitrogen contents suggesting that these are the most important factors controlling n2o emissions in table grape plantations additionally nh3 volatilization was closely related with soil temperature comprehensive evaluation showed that based on the traditional water and n application rate 38 n reduction combined with mobile water and fertilizer mwf effectively reduced the risk of n gaseous losses to the environment and saves irrigation water while maintaining grape

table grape vineyard 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o and ammonia nh3 are important atmospheric trace gases that have large effects on regional and global environments n2o is a major long lived potent greenhouse gas ghg with a global warming effect 298 times that of co2 on a mass basis over a 100 year period ipcc 2013 furthermore n2o emissions are currently the most important ozone depleting emissions and this is expected to continue throughout the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 nh3 which is the most abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere enhances aerosol formation behera et al 2013 moreover nh3 volatilization indirectly contributes to n2o emissions through nitrification and denitrification martikainen 1985 mosier et al 1998 accumulating evidence has shown that agricultural soils are a major source of anthropogenic n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization because of their large input of n in fertilizers kroeze et al 1999 mosier 2001 akiyama et al 2004 li 2013 paustian et al 2016 indeed it is estimated that agricultural soils contribute 25 39 of the global total n2o emissions and approximately 60 70 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions zhu et al 2015 gerber 2016 current global atmospheric nh3 volatilization from agricultural soils is estimated to range from 9 to 12 6 tg n yr 1 schlesinger and hartley 1992 bouwman et al 1997 yan et al 2003 and the crop and livestock production are responsible for up to 90 of total nh3 volatilized from the land to the atmosphere beusen et al 2008 paulot et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 zhan et al 2021 moreover global agricultural nh3 emissions from the use of synthetic n fertilizer and manure were estimated to be 12 32 and 3 79 tg n year 1 and the nh3 emission factor ef represents the percentage of applied n fertilizer that volatilizes as nh3 averaged 12 56 and 14 12 respectively ma et al 2021 thus it is important to study these n gas losses from various agricultural soils in different regions the amount of land used for orchards has increased from 1 66 million ha in 1978 12 27 million ha in 2019 accounting for 7 32 of the total land area in china china statistical yearbook 1978 2020 within this land use the land area devoted to grape vineyards has increased rapidly since 1980 reaching 0 73 million ha in 2019 china statistical yearbook 2020 hebei province in north china is a major grape producing area that accounts for 9 14 and 6 23 of the chinese grape yield and cultivation area respectively china statistical yearbook 2020 however there has been poor development of rational fertilizer management strategies in this area because large amounts of n fertilizers including inorganic and organic fertilizer are commonly applied to ensure high yields indeed the nitrogen application rate chemical fertilizer and animal manure is as high as 1140 5250 kg ha 1 yin 2013 in addition multiple topdressings combined with flood irrigation are usually adopted during the grape growth period barlow et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 these excessive water and n applications will inevitably induce soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n accumulation as well as stimulate high levels of n2o emission and nh3 volatilization which results in lost revenue and poses a major risk to the environment and human health therefore rational management strategies are urgently needed to reduce these gaseous losses from vineyard soils in china water and n are the two most critical production resources that farmers can manage to ensure high yields and low environmental impacts during crop cultivation most studies conducted to date have shown that the application of n fertilizers can stimulate n2o production from agricultural soils khalil et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 rowlings et al 2013 shcherbak et al 2014 qu et al 2014 maris et al 2015 qin et al 2021 fertilizer application is also considered a major source of nh3 volatilization from soils akiyama et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 pang et al 2021 in addition surface broadcast applications of fertilizer n resulted in a highly volatile source of n especially in the high air temperature fenn and kissel 1974 huijsmans et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 2020 however it is well known that soil moisture conditions drive n2o production webster and hopkins 1996 this is because high soil moisture content restricts oxygen diffusion into the soil and no3 n is easily denitrified thereby increasing n2o emissions inubushi et al 1999 ridolfi 2003 zhu 2013 wu et al 2017 studies have showed that nh3 loss from soils generally decreases with increasing soil water content fenn and escarzaga 1976 liu et al 2007 however schlesinger and peterjohn 1991 reported that higher levels of water addition were found to increase the nh3 volatilization when the same amount of n was applied which could be due to the water evaporation increases the nh3 gas emission from the soil thus optimizing water and n management might be one of the most effective ways to reduce both n2o emissions or nh3 volatilization from agricultural soils fertigation integrated management of water and fertilizer is the application of soluble fertilizers through micro irrigation systems to enhance water and fertilizer use efficiency in farmland shirgure and nagpur 2013 zheng et al 2016 currently fertigation is applied in nearly 30 provinces in china and it is used for wheat corn potato apple grape and other crops gao et al 2012 most studies of fertigation technology conducted to date have focused on water and fertilizer use efficiencies and crop yields but there is a lack of knowledge about its effects on gaseous losses from agricultural soils therefore it is not clear if the high mobility of fertilizers is a disadvantage in reducing gaseous n losses from agricultural soils the use of nitrification inhibitors nis together with n fertilizer has been reported as a proposed strategy to reduce n losses from agricultural soils and increase n use efficiency by retarding the oxidation of nh4 to no3 n via nitrification thereby reducing n2o emissions hatch et al 2005 ruser et al 2015 one of the most popular nis is 3 4 dimethylpyrazol phosphate dmpp which has been widely applied worldwide during the last decade dmpp can be effective at very low rates 0 5 1 0 kg dmpp ha 1 and has no toxicological or eco toxicological side effects zerulla 2001 moreover many studies have shown that dmpp can significantly reduce n2o emissions from various cropping systems or grazed pasture systems di and cameron 2012 liu et al 2013 pfab et al 2012 scheer et al 2015 rose et al 2017 tedeschi et al 2021 although the long term persistence of excessive nh4 in soil could increase the risk of nh3 volatilization some studies have demonstrated that dmpp had no significant effects on nh3 volatilization li et al 2009 khariri et al 2016 menéndez et al 2006 nevertheless there is currently very little quantitative information regarding how the application of dmpp affects n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from orchard soils therefore we conducted a one year field study to measure n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization in typical table grape plantations in north china using different water and n management strategies the objectives of the present study were to 1 assess the effects of different water and n management strategies on n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization 2 identify the key factors affecting n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization and 3 identify a more reasonable method for management of water and n to achieve a win win situation for both the economy and the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the experiment was conducted in changli county 39 45 n 119 05 e qinhuangdao hebei province china this region has a semi humid continental climate with a typical mean temperature of 11 c and an annual precipitation of 638 mm table grapes and wine grapes are the main crops grown in the region the field investigated was continuously cultivated with table grapes vitis vinifera l using traditional management methods for 12 years before the experiment the soil was classified as sandy loam according to the usda soil classification table 1 typical chemical and physical properties of surface soil 0 30 cm sampled before the field experiment in april 2017 are shown in table 1 the experiment included

completely randomized block design with three replicates three experimental plots each experimental plot 5 m 2 2 m consisted of six plants and the adjacent plots were separated by a 0 2 m wide ridge to prevent contamination of water and fertilizer treatments the fertilizer n was applied as urea 46 n in the twn treatment the amounts of urea n and irrigation preferred by local grape cultivators were used dmpp was applied in the own dmpp treatment at a rate of 4 6 kg ha 1 1 of the applied urea n in addition to the urea n application calcium superphosphate potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulphate were applied in all treatments at 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 535 kg k2o ha 1 respectively details regarding the application rates and dates of fertilizer inputs in all treatments throughout the grape growth season are given in table 2 for the mwf treatment all inorganic fertilizers were dissolved with the proper amount of irrigation water and then injected into a 20 cm radius circle centered around the vine trunks with a liquid jet gun fig s1 and then flood irrigation was adopted for the other treatments inorganic fertilizers and dmpp were applied using the furrowing method each furrow had a depth of 15 cm and was located approximately 20 cm away from the vine rows after fertilizer and dmpp applications the furrows were covered with soil and the plants were also flood irrigated the tds 100 ultrasonic flow meter was used to ensure the irrigation volumes in different treatments by controlling the flow rate and time 2 2 n2o and nh3 sampling and analysis gas samples were collected using a closed static chamber method the enclosure chamber was constructed from opaque pvc 13 8 cm in diameter and 15 5 cm in height and was fitted inside a base 15 cm in diameter and height inserted into the soil zhang et al 2021 during n2o sample collection the space between the enclosure chamber and the base was sealed with water to prevent gas leakage normally the n2o was sampled at day 1 3 5 7 and 10 after each fertilization and irrigation event and then at a 10 day interval until the next fertilization and irrigation event additionally gas samples were collected once a day for three consecutive days after irrigation or heavy precipitation 20 mm gas samples were collected from the chambers through a three way valve using a 50 ml plastic syringe at 0 15 and 30 min after closure between 9 00 am and 11 00 am the sample gasses 30 ml were then transferred to 20 ml vacuum glass vials that were sealed with rubber stoppers the concentration of n2o was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 7890 a gc system agilent technologies usa the n2o flux was calculated using the following equation zhu et al 2015 f ρ h dc dt 273 273 t 60 where f is the n2o flux μg n m 2 h 1 ρ is the density of n2o g cm 3 at standard atmospheric pressure h is the height cm of the sampling chamber dc dt is the average rate of n2o concentration increase in the sampling chamber ppbv min 1 and t is the air temperature c in the chamber nh3 volatilization was measured daily using a simple semi quantitative closed chamber method wang et al 2002 immediately after each topdressing application a closed pvc chamber 19 cm in diameter and 26 cm in height was inserted into the soil in each plot to a depth of about 5 cm an evaporating dish with 20 ml 2 boric acid h3bo3 solution was placed on a iron tripod and then placed inside the closed chamber the h3bo3 solution in the evaporating dish was replaced with fresh solution every 24 h and taken to the laboratory for analysis measurements were made from three replicates of each treatment and continued until the volatilization losses decreased to background levels nh3 flux kg n ha 1 day 1 was calculated using the following equation nh3 m a d 10 2 where m is the nh3 concentration in the acid trap nh3 mg a is the total cross sectional area m2 of soil cores in the chamber and d is the duration day of each sampling the air temperature inside the chamber and the soil temperature at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm were also recorded at the time of sampling using a digital thermometer and geothermometer respectively the cumulative n2o emissions were estimated by successive linear interpolations of average emissions measurements to estimate n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from the entire vineyard these gases were collected from the ridges non fertilized zone nf and furrows fertilized zone after which the weighted average of the n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization from the two sampling zones were calculated to represent the gas loss of the entire vineyard 2 3 soil and crop sampling soil samples were taken from triplicate plots at a depth of 0 10 cm on days 1 3 5 7 and 10 after fertilization and irrigation to analyze soil ph wfps nh4 n and no3 n contents soil ph was measured with a soil to water ratio of 2 5 using a mettler toledo ph meter the soil humidity evaluated as water filled pore space wfps which was calculated using the following equation zhu et al 2015 wfps volumetric water content total soil porosity 100 at the harvest time the grape weight of each plot was measured manually and then converted to total grape yield per hectare 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical data analyses were performed using spss 22 0 and all figures were drawn using sigmaplot 13 0 statistically significant differences were tested use analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 level correlation analyses were conducted using pearson s correlation test 3 results 3 1 precipitation and soil temperature during the grape growing season fig 1 presents the precipitation and soil temperature 0 5 cm and 0 10 cm in the vineyard during the grape growing season may to november in 2017 in general the soil temperature rose continuously from may to july then continuously declined until november the soil temperature at 0 5 cm ranged from 5 c to 38 c with a mean of 26 c while the soil temperature at 0 10 cm ranged from 5 c to 34 c with a mean of 23 c during the grape growing season the heavy precipitation events in this study site mainly occurred in the rainy season from june and august and the total precipitation was 515 mm 3 2 soil moisture wfps during the grape growing season the soil moisture levels observed in the four treatments were similar and showed obvious variation with time the wfps levels were below 50 and ranged from 11 to 44 during the grape growing season fig 2 different amounts of irrigation water were applied to the twn mwf and own own dmpp treatments and the mean soil moisture in the twn was significantly higher 28 90 p 0 05 than that for the mwf 25 17 own 26 11 and own dmpp 25 26 treatments however there were no significant differences between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 3 soil nh4 n and no 3 n contents the soil nh4 n and no3 n production from the four fertilized treatments during the four fertilization and irrigation periods is presented in fig 3 the nh4 n contents in the twn treatment varied from 13 82 to 67 44 mg kg with an average of 31 91 mg kg during the experimental period the nh4 n contents in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments ranged from 11 23 to 45 79 mg kg 10 99 46 83 mg kg and 12 18 58 61 mg kg with averages of 26 83 22 99 and 27 75 mg kg respectively during the first application of fertilizer and irrigation the nh4 n content for the twn treatment was higher than those in the other treatments however after the third application of fertilizer and irrigation the nh4 n content for the own dmpp treatment was higher than that of the twn mwf and own treatments which indicated that the addition of dmpp resulted in most of the n being in the form of nh4 n nevertheless there was no significant difference in nh4 n content among fertilized treatments throughout the grape growing period the soil no3 n contents in all of the fertilized treatments showed similar changes the soil no3 n content in the twn treatment increased dramatically after every application of n fertilizer overall the no3 n content in the twn treatment ranged from 11 38 to 72 13 mg kg with an average of 38 05 mg kg during the experimental period however the no3 n contents in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments were relatively low ranging from 9 21 to 36 61 mg kg 7 29 34 50 mg kg and 6 26 26 89 mg kg with average reductions of 44 87 52 32 and 59 42 respectively p 0 05 in addition there were no significant differences among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments 3 4 soil n2o emission flux as shown in fig 4 there were marked temporal variations in n2o emission fluxes in all of the treatments high emissions were continuously detected from may to october during which time the majority of the annual emissions were contributed while low fluxes were mainly observed in november peak fluxes of n2o were detected immediately after each fertilization and irrigation event over the entire experimental period the n2o emission fluxes of the twn mwf own and own dmpp treatments ranged from 0 007 0 001 0 383 0 039 0 003 0 001 0 0 239 0 066 0 007 0 001 0 128 0 065 and 0 003 0 001 0 044 0 041 kg ha 1d 1 respectively the calculated mean n2o fluxes were greatest for the twn treatment 0 142 kg ha 1d 1 and these were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the mwf 0 037 kg ha 1d 1 own 0 037 kg ha 1d 1 and own dmpp 0 017 kg ha 1d 1 treatments however one way anova demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 5 soil nh3 volatilization rate the temporal patterns of nh3 volatilization rates were similar across treatments fig 5 the nh3 volatilization rate increased after each application of fertilizer and irrigation and showed several flux peaks which generally appeared 1 3 days after n fertilizer application and irrigation most of the volatilization loss occurred within 2 weeks of n application and decreased thereafter until the next n fertilizer application during this period the mean nh3 volatilization rates from the mwf own and own dmpp treatments were 0 051 0 040 and 0 045 kg ha 1d 1 respectively while it was 0 069 kg ha 1d 1 from the twn the three reduced n and irrigation treatments mwf own and own dmpp significantly reduced nh3 volatilization however there was no significant difference in nh3 volatilization between the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 3 6 gaseous n loss as n2o and nh3 the cumulative n2o emissions were 3 90 0 02 2 76 0 09 2 83 2 83 and 2 65 0 06 kg ha 1 for the twn mwf own and own dmpp groups respectively table 3 the cumulative n2o emissions for the twn treatment were significantly higher than those of the mwf own and own dmpp p 0 05 groups but there were no significant differences among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments table 3 when compared with the twn treatment there were 29 23 27 44 and 32 05 reductions in n2o emissions in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments respectively the fertilizer induced n2o emission factor ef was 0 59 in the twn treatment while it was 0 58 0 67 in the three reduced n and irrigation treatments table 4 the cumulative nh3 volatilization from all treatments was relatively low over the entire experimental period ranging from 1 13 0 01 1 21 0 08 kg ha 1 the nh3 loss from the soil was significantly higher in the twn treatment than the mwf own and own dmpp treatments p 0 05 however the proportion of applied n emitted as nh3 in the mwf own and own dmpp treatments increased to 0 28 0 25 and 0 25 respectively relative to the twn group 0 18 table 3 overall there were still 4 13 mwf 6 61 own and 4 96 own dmpp reductions in total nh3 volatilization and these were mainly caused by the low n application rates and optimum managed irrigation in these treatments 3 7 grape yield yield scaled n2o emissions and yield scaled nh3 volatilization the yields of grapes for all treatments followed the order own dmpp mwf own twn fig 6a relative to twn 12816 68 3707 12 kg ha 1 the yields from the three reduced n and irrigation treatments mwf own and own dmpp increased 8 81 19 35 but no significant differences were observed among fertilized treatments the grape yield scaled n2o emissions from the twn plot 0 322 0 065 g kg 1 yield were significantly higher than those from the three reduced n and irrigation treatments p 0 05 fig 6b when compared with twn the mwf own and own dmpp treatments significantly decreased grape yield scaled n2o emissions by 42 74 34 66 and 43 71 respectively p 0 05 however there were no obvious differences in yield scaled n2o emissions among the three reduced n and irrigation treatments although the yield scaled nh3 volatilization decreased when limiting the n and water applied to the vineyard the lowest yield scaled nh3 volatilization was achieved for the mwf treatment nevertheless there were no significant differences among treatments fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 grape yield irrigation and fertilization are key practices for improving the quality and yield of fruit hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and n fertilizers such as urea and nh4 2so4 are commonly applied to increase grape yields however while excessive n inputs and irrigation doses can significantly improve fruit yields they may also cause serious environmental problems in the current study although the urea n application rate in the twn treatment was as high as 641 kg ha 1 this group had the lowest yield 12 816 68 kg ha 1 when compared with the twn plot the grape yields increased by 8 81 19 35 for the three reduced n and irrigation treatments fig 5a moreover the irrigation amounts in the mwf and own own dmpp treatments were 2184 m3 and 2548 m3 which was 40 and 50 less water than was used in the twn treatment respectively we also found higher grape yield in plants receiving the urea fertilization supplemented with dmpp when compared with those fertilized with urea alone which is in agreement with the results of other studies conducted in citrus apple and peach production systems martínez alcántara et al 2013 wang et al 2022 vilarrasa nogué et al 2020 overall these findings imply that optimized n and irrigation management could provide agronomic benefits by decreasing n and water inputs while maintaining grape yields 4 2 correlations between n2o flux or nh3 volatilization rate and soil environmental factors n2o emitted from soils is mainly produced by the microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification bateman et al 2005 park et al 2012 butterbachbahl et al 2013 and factors such as soil moisture temperature and mineral n can greatly influence the temporal patterns of n2o emissions meng et al 2005 he et al 2009 rowlings et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in this study we observed that n2o fluxes were significantly related to soil temperature wfps and mineral n contents table 3 which is consistent with the results of previous studies pang et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 alsina et al 2013 mei et al 2011 moreover n2o flux increased within a few days of each water and n treatment being applied in all of the fertilized plots then decreased obviously after reaching the peak value fig 3 a positive linear relationship between n2o flux and nh4 n content was also found in all of the fertilized plots and the soil wfps was below 50 during the experimental period fig 2 indicating that n2o was mainly produced by the action of nitrification in soil bremner et al 1978 bateman et al 2005 previous studies have shown that relatively high temperature could also stimulate n2o emissions from soil which is in line with the finding that n2o fluxes showed significant seasonal variation and there was high n2o emission from may to september followed by decreases with decreasing temperature yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 fig 3 studies have also shown that nitrification is the main process when the soil water content is less than 60 while denitrification is the main process when the soil water content is more than 60 the n2o emission in the own dmpp treatment was less affected by soil water content while that in the other treatments increased with increasing soil water content which may indicate that dmpp influences n2o emissions more than soil water content the nh3 volatilization rate is significantly correlated with the concentration of nh4 n zhang et al 2014 and is also affected by climate conditions soil physical and chemical properties and management measures previous studies have shown that atmospheric and soil temperature are the main meteorological factors affecting nh3 volatilization zhang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 warming can reduce the solubility of nh3 and increase the ratio of nh3 nh4 n in water thereby promoting the diffusion of nh3 in soil to the atmosphere sharpe and harper 1995 moreover increasing temperature can enhance the soil urease and microbial activity which is conducive to the hydrolysis of urea and increases the volatilization of nh3 our results also revealed a significant positive correlation between 10 cm soil temperature and soil nh3 volatilization rate which is consistent with the results of other studies sanz cobena et al 2008 pfluke et al 2011 however unlike other studies there was no significant correlation observed between nh3 volatilization and soil wfps or inorganic n contents which may have been because there was less nh3 volatilization in this study since the measurements of nh3 volatilization rate were conducted only one year of grape yield and the nh3 volatilization rate measured by using the closed chamber method in this study is also relatively large uncertainties compared with other monitoring methods the relationship between soil nh3 volatilization and soil environmental factors needs to be further studied 4 3 n2o emission and nh3 volatilization from vineyard excessive n fertilizer and irrigation water is usually applied to orchard production systems resulting in severe losses of n gases through n2o emission and nh3 volatilization in this study we observed that annual n2o emissions from the fertilized treatments ranged from 2 65 to 3 90 kg n ha 1 table 2 these values are within the range reported by gu et al 2019 who found that the cumulative n2o emissions from fruit cropping systems ranged from 0 116 26 kg ha 1 year 1 or growing season worldwide however the efs 0 58 0 67 were slightly lower than the ipcc default ef value of 1 for upland soils ipcc 2006 the n2o emissions observed in our study might have been lower because urea n fertilizer was applied at a depth of 15 20 cm and immediately followed by irrigation in vineyard plantations which is known to reduce loss of n2o via emissions maris et al 2015 previous studies demonstrated that nh3 volatilization loss accounted for 14 24 of the total n input in agricultural systems worldwide gong et al 2013 wan et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however lower nh3 volatilization losses of the annual applied n fertilizer amounts were observed in orchards abascal et al 2019 reported nh3 volatilization accounted for 2 59 3 50 of the total n applied in olive orchards while ge et al 2010 2017 showed that nh3 volatilization accounted for 2 29 6 12 of the n in an apple orchard and wang et al 2019 observed that the net loss by nh3 volatilization was 2 72 4 48 in a pear orchard however few studies have reported nh3 volatilization from vineyards to date our data showed that annual nh3 volatilization was only 1 13 1 21 kg n ha 1 table 2 which accounted for 0 18 0 28 of the total amount of chemical n applied and was much lower than that of other orchards large nh3 volatilization losses may not have occurred because 1 the inorganic fertilizers were mainly applied into open furrows that were 15 20 cm deep and then covered with a thick layer about 10 cm of soil for irrigation which is known to be capable of effectively reducing nh3 volatilization loss chuong et al 2020 2 the soil at the experimental site was a sandy loam with a ph of 4 39 soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 which is not conducive to the production of nh3 indeed it is generally believed that an acidic ph will shift the soil ammonia ammonium equilibrium towards non volatile ammonium zhang et al 2014 cai et al 1998 asman et al 1998 bowden 1986 hafner et al 2012 3 although the closed chamber method is very practical in monitoring the nh3 volatilization rate it has some defects for example the result of nh3 determination is lower than that of ventilation method due to the micro meteorological environment conditions in the chamber were changed wang et al 2002 4 4 n2o emission and nh3 volatilization mitigation based on the above discussions the total gaseous loss n2o emission and nh3 volatilization rate of 0 77 0 95 table 2 low n use efficiency nue of approximately 16 25 unpublished data after grape harvest and the sandy loam soil conditions at the experimental site indicate that large amounts of urea n can be lost through accumulation and leaching in the soil profile or into the atmosphere in the form of no and n2 some studies have reported n2o emissions loss in vineyards ranged from 0 07 to 11 20 marques et al 2018 wolff et al 2018 garland et al 2014 steenwerth et al 2010 verhoeven et al 2014 fentabil et al 2016 these differences among the vineyards might be caused by variations in the rate of n application measurement frequencies and the local climate soil physicochemical properties until now there was few studies have reported nh3 emissions in vineyards xing et al 2021 reported that the nh3 volatilization loss in orchard has reached 36 52 115 9 kg ha 1 and the loss rate reached up to 12 in our study although the n2o emission and nh3 volatilization were relatively minor components of the n cycle and not the major pathways for n loss moreover the defects and uncertainties associated with the closed chamber method of soil gas flux measurements the air pollution caused by these factors cannot be ignored thus there is an urgent need to develop effective mitigation measures to improve crop yield and n use efficiency while reducing negative environmental impacts the results of the present study clearly demonstrated that reduced n and water application mwf own and own dmpp can significantly reduce loss of n as n2o and nh3 compared with traditional n fertilization and irrigation twn moreover the mwf treatment was found to effectively reduce n2o emission and ammonia volatilization because of the reduced n fertilizer application and irrigation using this method dissolved fertilizer is directly injected into the crop roots which effectively improves the availability and use of nutrients mandal and thakur 2010 application of urea n fertilizer with a nitrification inhibitor in the own dmpp treatment was shown to reduce n2o emissions 6 79 over urea n alone at a rate of 460 kg hm2 table 2 but the reduction rate was lower than the rate in the previous report 49 vilarrasa nogué et al 2020 which may have been related to the lower fertilization area different physiochemical properties of soil and crop types moreover the application of dmpp delays the transformation of soil nh4 n to no3 n resulting in the accumulation of nh4 n in the soil which may lead to increased nh3 volatilization castellano hinojosa et al 2020 zaman and nguyen 2012 the results of this study also showed that treatment with own dmpp increased nh3 volatilization by 1 77 compared with the own treatment however this change was not significant which is consistent with the results of a previous study menéndez et al 2009 scaling emissions to yields can be useful when evaluating whether mitigation regulations will be acceptable to farmers thus yield scaled emissions were used in this study to address concerns about future food supply and climate change grassini and cassman 2012 huang et al 2016 our results showed that the three n reduction and water control management strategies led to a significant reduction in yield scaled n2o emissions 34 66 43 71 while increasing grape yields 8 81 19 35 however the yield scaled nh3 volatilization was significantly influenced by different n and water management strategies which may have been related to the reduced ammonia volatilization observed in this study among these treatments the mobile water and fertilizer treatment mwf showed a better reduction of gas emissions during grape cultivation given that there was no difference in grape yield when n was applied at 413 664 kg ha 1 and the irrigation amount was 2184 2548 m3 ha 1 we suggest that reducing n and irrigation water by 30 40 relative to traditional water and n management changing fertilization methods and applying nitrification inhibitors can effectively reduce gaseous losses of n2o and nh3 however it should be noted that while we analyzed the gaseous losses of n under different water and n management systems the effects of these management strategies on soil n leaching need to be further verified 5 conclusion the results of this study indicate that excessive input of water and n in a table grape vineyard led to the gaseous loss of n2o and nh3 but the proportion lost was relatively small accounting for only 0 77 0 95 of the total n input these findings suggest that n2o emission and nh3 volatilization were relatively minor components of the n cycle and not the major pathways for n loss nevertheless the air pollution caused by these factors cannot be ignored fertilized table grape plantations are an important source of n2o emissions in orchard soils in china rational regulation of water and n can effectively reduce n2o emission and nh3 volatilization as well as yield scaled gaseous losses while increasing yield in vineyard plantations based on these findings the mwf treatment is recommended for higher fruit yield and lower gaseous losses in table grape vineyard cultivation systems in north china in addition this study revealed that application of a reduced amount of urea combined with the nitrification inhibitor dmpp greatly reduced n2o emissions while increasing yield moreover it is also necessary to conduct c print analyses in future which could provide theoretical basics for greenhouse gas emission reduction in vineyards due to some objective reasons the field experiment was conducted only one year in table grape vineyard in this study therefore it is noteworthy that the effects of different water and n managements on n2o emissions and nh3 volatilization in other climate plantations needs to be investigated which is mainly due to the regulation mechanism and efficiency depended not only on the amounts of water and n application but also on climatic conditions in addition relatively immature monitoring methods and low gases sampling frequencies at 10 day intervals in this study may increase the uncertainty of gaseous n losses in vineyard fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

9567,shallow groundwater affects crop growth and yield by altering the root zone water and salt budgets with the process being more complicated in layered soils to gain insights into the role of shallow groundwater in layered soils lawstac a physically based agro hydrological model was employed to simulate soil water salt and groundwater fluxes and crop yield in three soil profiles loam l loam with a sand interlayer lsl and loam with a clay interlayer lcl the model was verified using data collected in 2007 and 2008 from a spring wheat field with shallow groundwater tables the model predictions matched well with the measured soil water content salt concentration groundwater table depth gwd leaf area index biomass and crop yield further simulations were conducted for the l lsl and lcl profiles with varying gwds in the crop growth seasons and initial values specified at 130 150 170 190 210 230 and 250 cm the groundwater table showed greater fluctuations in lcl with smaller fluctuations in lsl in comparison to l when starting with smaller initial gwds of 130 150 170 and 190 cm the coarse textured soil under the root zone facilitated water and salt fluxes at the bottom of the root zone resulting in larger averages for root zone water storage and more salt content during the crop growth seasons and lower crop yield due to salt stress meanwhile in cases with an initial gwd larger than 210 cm the coarse textured soil inhibited the fluxes and improved crop yield due to the reduced salt stress fine textured soil under the root zone inhibited water and salt fluxes reducing root zone salt content and favoring crop yield however the effect decreased with larger initial gwds thus the groundwater table should be lowered to a level where coarse textured soil acts as a capillary barrier for salt control and crop growth in soil profiles similar to lsl keeping a high groundwater table to sustain water for crop growth is acceptable in soil profiles similar to lcl while keeping a lower groundwater table could be an effective practice to control salt and improve crop production in salinized croplands keywords shallow groundwater layered soil soil water and salt crop growth water management 1 introduction shallow groundwater tables are easily formed in arid and semiarid regions due to excessive long term irrigation in croplands with poor drainage conditions on the one hand the capillary rise from shallow groundwater can supply water for crop growth but on the other hand it also brings salt into the root zone a shallow groundwater table favors capillary rise thus leading to root zone salinity buildup and adversely affecting crop yield karimov et al 2014 understanding the interactions between groundwater soil water and salt is important for crop growth in salinized croplands many studies have assessed water use soil salinity and crop yield under different groundwater table depths gwds and investigated the gwd best suited for crop production jorenush et al 2003 xu et al 2013 however layered soils can significantly affect soil water flow and salt transport zettl et al 2011 which in turn affects groundwater table dynamics and changes the most suitable gwd for a given area therefore it is crucial to better comprehend how layered soils influence groundwater flux root zone water and salt accumulation and finally crop yield many laboratory and simulation studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of layered soils on water and solute transport khire et al 2000 for coarse textured soil overlying fine textured soil mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 found that the infiltration rate marginally increases due to the greater sorptivity of the underlying fine textured soil when water reaches the interface meanwhile si et al 2011 concluded that infiltration water flux is reduced in the fine textured soil layer due to its lower hydraulic conductivity in comparison to that of the upper coarse textured soil layer stormont and anderson 1999 reversed the soil layer sequence and reported that water storage in the upper fine textured soil could be increased during infiltration based on the capillary break caused by the lower water entry suction from the underlying coarse textured soil however several studies found that the capillary barrier effect could vanish and that the coarse textured soil interlayer with higher levels of water content could even facilitate water and salt transport aubertin et al 2009 chen et al 2021 these behaviors of soil water and solute in layered soils are closely related to the soil s physical status e g its unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content and such conditions are influenced by gwd moreover the depth of the groundwater table is affected by layered soils since they cause significant variations in water flux rooney et al 1998 however few studies have focused on the dynamics of gwd water flow and solute transport in layered soils and analyzed their interplay in addition to impacting soil water and salt transport layered and homogeneous soils play a critical role in crop growth and yield wehr et al 2005 ren and huang 2016 ityel et al 2011 2012 embedded a coarse gravel layer at the bottom of a root zone and found that the gravel layer acts as a capillary barrier and improves crop yield by increasing the root zone water content chen et al 2021 found that coarse textured soil under the root zone having lower water content could increase root zone water storage during crop growth seasons whereas a layer with higher water content reduces water storage and favors salt leaching these results imply that layered soil water and salt contents under different shallow gwds can influence crop growth and yield many studies have been conducted on the suitable gwds for crop growth based on root zone water and salt conditions xu et al 2013 karimov et al 2014 han et al 2015 however it is still unclear how the layered soils affect the suitable gwds so this topic requires further investigation model simulation is one of the widely used methods for studying soil water flow salt transport and crop growth in the complex soil crop system jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 huang et al 2013b hydrus 1d 2d 3d is a robust model that simulates soil water and salt transport and has been employed in several studies to explore multilayered soil systems simunek et al 2008 ityel et al 2011 used hydrus 2d 3d to study how the root zone water condition was affected by an embedded gravel layer under the root zone wang et al 2014 used hydrus 1d to simulate water infiltration in fine textured soil with a coarse sand interlayer and proved the richards equation based model s capabilities in describing the infiltration rate and soil water condition in distinctly layered soils further some physically based agro hydrological models including swap van dam et al 1997 rzwqm hanson et al 1998 waves zhang and dawes 1998 and hydrus wofost zhou et al 2012 have been developed to depict soil water flow salt transport and crop growth conditions many studies have used the agro hydrological models to assess the effects of gwd on water use soil salinity and crop yield in fields however few of them have compared the dynamics of shallow groundwater tables in distinctly layered soils with a coarse or fine textured soil interlayer and analyzed the differences in soil water and salt fluxes and crop yield in layered soils with shallow gwds therefore the main objectives of this study are to investigate how shallow gwds respond to different types of layered soils and how a shallow gwd affects root zone water and salt dynamics and crop yield to achieve these objectives a physically based agro hydrological model lawstac is calibrated using the following field measurements soil water content salt concentration gwd leaf area index biomass and crop yield the model is further applied to soil profiles with a coarse or fine textured soil interlayer below the root zone and varying gwds the results will provide a guideline for salt alleviation and crop production in croplands with different soil textures and shallow groundwater tables 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description lawstac layered soil water solute transport and crop growth is a one dimensional 1d agro hydrological model that includes the following modules evapotranspiration soil water and salt transport and crop growth chen et al 2019 the integration processes of the modules are shown in fig 1 in order to reflect soil water and salt stresses on crop water consumption the reference evapotranspiration et0 is first calculated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 et0 is used to estimate the potential crop evapotranspiration etc based on the crop coefficient then etc is partitioned into the potential soil evaporation e p and transpiration t p using the extinction coefficient and leaf area index lai childs and hanks 1975 finally the actual transpiration t a is obtained from t p with the multiplicative water α w and salt stresses α s calculated from the feddes model feddes et al 1978 and maas hoffman model maas and hoffman 1977 respectively 1 α w 0 h h 0 h h 3 h h 0 h 1 h 0 h 1 h h 0 1 h 2 h h 1 h h 3 h 2 h 3 h 3 h h 2 2 α s 1 ec sat ec max 1 ec sat ec max ec slop 100 ec sat ec max where h is the soil matric

salinity below which there is no salt stress on transpiration ds m 1 and ecslop is the declining rate of root water uptake under salinity stress m ds 1 the actual evaporation e a is estimated from e p considering the three stages of the evaporation process based on surface soil water content θ sur as follows allen et al 2005 3 e a e p 0 θ sur θ 1 θ sur θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 θ 1 θ sur θ 2 1 θ sur θ 2 where θ

changes in crop height root depth and lai are estimated based on the daily heat unit that is the difference between the daily average air temperature and the base temperature the vertical root distribution along with the soil profile within the root depth is described by a piecewise linear function hoffman and van genuchten 1983 biomass is computed using the solar radiation intercepted by the crop canopy based on beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 crop yield is obtained from the aboveground biomass by multiplying by a harvest index williams et al 1989 for layered soil lawstac considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of the richards equation for soil water flow the arithmetic mean geometric mean and triadic mean have been shown to perform better than the other methods in terms of simulation precision and stability chen et al 2019 therefore the hydraulic conductivity in the middle of two adjacent discretization nodes in this study is calculated using the arithmetic mean for layered soil water simulations 2 2 field measurement field experiments were conducted by xu et al 2013 at the huinong experimental site 36 04 n 106 39 e 1092 m located in qingtongxia irrigation district qid northwest china qid has an arid continental climate with a mean annual pan evaporation φ20 cm and precipitation of 1500 2100 mm and 180 200 mm respectively sunshine durations range from 2870 h to 3080 h with an annual average temperature of 8 5 c the gwd in qid varies from 0 5 m to 2 5 m during the year spring wheat was cultivated at the experimental site in 2007 and 2008 with a sowing date of march 16 and a harvesting date of july 11 the initial soil water content within 1 m depth was 0 35 cm3 cm 3 for the two crop growth seasons while the initial soil salt concentrations were 8 4 and 9 3 g l 1 respectively the field plots 3 replications 3 10 m2 each were irrigated with water delivered from the yellow river and had an average total dissolved solid concentration of 0 5 g l 1 basin irrigation was applied three times in the two crop growth seasons with the respective amounts of 135 90 and 90 mm being administered on the corresponding dates of may 3 may 24 and july 6 2007 and may 3 may 24 and june 29 2008 the vertical soil profile at the experimental site has textural variance with sandy loam and silt loam at different depths table 1 soil water and salt content were measured in soil samples collected from the top layer 0 10 cm and subsoil layer 10 90 cm with a 20 cm increment gwd was monitored in the nearby observation wells and groundwater samples were also collected to measure the electrical conductivity the daily meteorological data of sunshine hour air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were acquired from the nearby huinong weather station lai was measured every 6 12 days using a leaf area meter li 3000 li cor aboveground dry biomass was measured every 5 12 days by oven drying at 75 and wheat yield was weighed after the harvest for a 9 m2 area in each plot agricultural practices including fertilizer and pesticide applications were adopted according to the local practices xu et al 2013 2 3 model setup calibration and validation methods a soil profile with 300 cm depth was specified when simulating the soil water flow and solute transport it is worth mentioning that the lower boundary of the soil profile was under the groundwater table that is in the saturated zone due to the shallow gwd generally within 250 cm depth due to the flat topography of the qid it was assumed that the lateral groundwater flow was small so the vertical water flow was the main focus the vertical simulation domain was divided into five horizontal layers according to the field measurements table 1 and further discretized into 301 grids with 1 cm spacing the atmospheric boundary condition under the influence of irrigation precipitation and evaporation fluxes was specified for the upper boundary in simulating soil water flow the salt flux condition with zero flux for evaporation and precipitation and 0 5 g l 1 for irrigation was used as the upper boundary condition for salt transport the concentration of total dissolved solids measured in groundwater was considered as the lower boundary condition when simulating salt transport because the lower boundary was beneath the groundwater table the lower boundary condition for soil water flow simulation was defined as zero flux by neglecting lateral groundwater flow the initial conditions for soil water flow and salt transport simulations were the measured soil water content and salt concentration in the soil profile on the sowing day for the spring wheat the parameters of soil hydraulic property solute transport crop growth root water uptake and evaporation stress were initially set according to chen et al 2019 tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary file who calibrated and validated the parameters using data collected from the same field and considered the measured gwd as a model input to calculate the pressure head on the lower boundary in this study the simulated pressure head h using the zero flux lower boundary condition was used to calculate the gwd that is 300 h cm and the measured crop biomass data were added to the crop dataset for model calibration 2007 and validation 2008 the sensitive parameters including the soil hydraulic parameters θ s α n and k s salt transport parameter d l and crop parameters were selected based on xu et al 2016 and were adjusted during the model calibration the calibration process based on the trial and error method was performed for soil water salt and crop growth in sequence until good simulation results were achieved the model s performance during the calibration and validation periods was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 the equations for the abovementioned statistical indexes are given as follows 8 rmse 1 n x i y i 2 9 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 10 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the total number of measured data x i is the ith measured data y i is the ith simulated value and x and y are the average measured and simulated values respectively the optimal values depicting the best model performance are close to zero for rmse and close to 1 for nse and r 2 legates and mccabe 1999 2 4 simulation scenarios of different layered soils and groundwater table depths the lawstac model has been used in several column and field cases with layered soils and has demonstrated good performance in describing soil water and salt dynamics and crop growth chen et al 2019 2021 therefore by embedding a coarse or fine textured soil layer under the crop root zone of the experimental site the calibrated lawstac model was further used to investigate the impact of distinctly layered soils on soil water and salinity gwd and crop yield in this area with shallow groundwater tables a sandy soil found in the study area 87 sand 10 silt and 3 clay was used as the typical coarse textured soil layer with the measured soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 2 gao et al 2017 the fine textured soil was a silty clay soil 57 5 silt and 42 5 clay with the soil hydraulic parameters predicted by the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 miao et al 2016 the salt transport parameters for the two soil types were determined based on jury and horton 2004 a homogeneous soil profile consisting of four layers of sandy loam sampled at the experimental site was treated as the control group profile l in fig 2 the layered lsl and lcl soil profiles were defined by placing the sand and silty clay soil layers respectively under the crop root zone and the embedded soil layers had a buried depth from the ground surface to the upper surface of the layer of 100 cm and a thickness of 40 cm fig 2 to account for the uncertainty in the hydraulic parameters of the embedded sand and silty clay variations in soil water flux at the bottom of the root zone in lsl and lcl profiles were analyzed by changing 10 5 5 and 10 of each soil hydraulic parameter in table 2 to investigate the dynamics of the shallow groundwater table in the layered soils seven gwds 130 150 170 190 210 230 and 250 cm were initially specified for the three soil profiles the gwd can be varied under the influence of irrigation precipitation and evapotranspiration during the crop growth seasons a total of 21 scenarios 3 7 were set to assess the effects of layered soils and gwds on root zone water and salt dynamics and crop yield in the scenario analysis a stable state of soil water was set for each initial soil profile and the initial matric potential at each node was in hydrostatic equilibrium with the initial gwd 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the simulated soil water contents in different soil layers match well with the corresponding measured values during the model calibration and validation fig 3 the rmse values were no higher than 0 02 cm3 cm 3 while the r 2 and nse values were greater than 0 8 for the calibration and validation the simulation results show that soil water content can increase sharply with the application of water in cropland while it gradually decreased due to evapotranspiration and percolation the consistency between the simulated results using lawstac and the measured values in the field demonstrates a good description of soil water flow in the layered soil the simulated soil salt concentrations at different soil depths and the corresponding measured values for the calibration and validation are shown in fig 4 the results show that the variations in the measured salt concentration are well captured by the model with rmse 1 64 g l 1 r 2 0 54 and nse 0 51 during calibration and rmse 1 84 g l 1 r 2 0 70 and nse 0 70 during validation salt concentration in the upper soil 50 cm can be diluted by irrigation and precipitation while the concentration increased with evaporation and transpiration fig 4 salt concentration in the deeper soil 50 90 cm gradually increased during the simulation period this is because the salt concentration in the deeper soil layer was less affected by irrigation and the upward water flux constantly carried salt from the deep soil into this layer overall the simulated salt dynamics and statistical indicators suggest a satisfactory simulation of salt transport in the layered soil based on the zero flux as the lower boundary condition for the soil water flow simulation the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters and salt transport parameters are listed in table 3 the simulation results for soil water and salt in this study are similar to those in chen et al 2019 which used the same soil hydraulic and salt transport parameters but a variable pressure head as the lower boundary condition the rmse values for soil water and salt were 0 02 0 06 cm3 cm 3 and 1 64 3 56 g l 1 respectively during calibration validation in chen et al 2019 and the water flux at the lower boundary approached zero with daily average values of 6 1 10 2 and 6 9 10 2 cm d 1 in the two years the results indicate that the application of zero flux as a lower boundary condition is feasible for soil water flow simulation in the study area while the calibrated soil parameters can be used to quantify the physical processes of soil water and salt transport the simulated lai and aboveground biomass agb match well with the measured values from the 2007 and 2008 crop growth seasons fig 5 the r 2 values associated with lai and agb were greater than 0 9 during both the calibration and validation while the nse values for lai and agb were greater than 0 9 and 0 8 respectively during calibration and validation the simulated yield of spring wheat in 2007 was 4614 kg ha 1 which is 0 3 higher than the measured value 4600 kg ha 1 and the yield of spring wheat in 2008 was 4805 kg ha 1 which is 0 7 higher than the measured yield 4771 kg ha 1 these statistical results confirm an acceptably good simulation of crop growth by lawstac and the rationality of the selected crop growth parameters table 4 most of the calibrated parameters were found to be in the range of the ones that xu et al 2013 used for spring wheat in the same study area except for the maximum root depth rdmax which was extended from 90 cm in xu et al 2013 to 100 cm in this study the rdmax range in this study was more consistent with the experimental results conducted by miao et al 2016 in this study area furthermore the water stress parameters from the feddes model h 2h and h 2l the soil matric potential below which water uptake reduction starts at high or low atmospheric demand respectively and h 3 were also adjusted in this study for better simulation results table 4 gwd was calculated by simulating the pressure head at the lower boundary during a crop growth season and the calculated results are shown in fig 6 the measured gwds are generally well captured by the lawstac model the gwds rapidly decreased during the irrigation periods and gradually increased due to the capillary rise into the upper unsaturated zone the deviations of some of the measured values might be affected by the fluctuation in the groundwater table at a regional scale overall the model performed well in simulating gwds during the crop growth seasons 3 2 soil water and salt dynamics and crop yield in layered soils 3 2 1 uncertainty analysis of the hydraulic parameters of the sand and silty clay interlayers as shown in fig 7 the 10 changes in the sandy soil hydraulic parameters had relatively negligible effects on the magnitude of water moving downward at the bottom of the root zone in the lsl profile during a crop growth season the parameters of silty clay including θ r θ s α and k s also depicted an insignificant impact on the magnitude of water moving downward whereas the parameter n had a relatively larger effect however according to skaggs et al 2004 the rosetta pedotransfer function for estimating hydraulic parameters θ r α and n is substantially accurate while the accuracy of θ s and k s is more dependent on instrument measurements therefore the uncertain impacts of the hydraulic parameters of the sand and silty clay interlayers were less evident in the simulations for the lsl and lcl profiles 3 2 2 root zone water and salt dynamics as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of water moving upward and downward at the bottom of the root zone both become smaller in the lsl profile as the initial gwd increases from 130 up to 250 cm where the magnitudes of water are higher at first and then become smaller than these in profile l with critical initial gwd near 210 cm the effect of inhibiting water moving upward is more evident after the initial gwd exceeds the critical value as shown in fig 9 the hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer in lsl depicts the largest decline rate with an increase of gwd this might be associated with the larger pore size of the sand interlayer which is characterized by a lower air entry pressure and capillary force the increase in gwd leads to fast gravity drainage causing water discontinuity in soil pores nachshon et al 2011 as a result the soil hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer in lsl is higher than that of the sandy loam layer located at the same depth in the l profile when the initial gwd is less than 210 cm which favors water flow in the soil profile on the other hand the soil hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer becomes smaller for larger initial gwds and this layer then begins to have higher resistance to water flow compared to the l profile previous studies have shown that coarse textured soil under fine textured soil inhibits water flow due to the capillary break stormont et al 1999 while chen et al 2021 and shi et al 2005 found that the coarse textured soil interlayer favors water flow under shallow gwds however the differences in the abovementioned findings can be explained by the results concerning the water condition and hydraulic conductivity of the coarse textured soil interlayer in the current study the magnitudes of water moving upward and downward at the bottom of the root zone in lcl increase or slowly decrease as initial gwd increases from 130 up to 170 cm and then drop rapidly for the larger initial gwds when the initial gwd is less than 170 cm the hydraulic conductivity of the silty clay is relatively high and the fine textured soil layer can carry a considerable amount of water from the groundwater into the root zone or out of the root zone the increased magnitude of water moving upward with the increased gwd is caused by the reduced water content and increased soil water suction in the root zone the hydraulic conductivity of the silty clay decreases significantly when the initial gwd is greater than 170 cm this is because the silty clay begins to have more resistance to upward and downward water flow compared with the l profile water fluxes at the bottom of the root zone in lcl are always lower under different initial gwds due to the smaller hydraulic conductivity of the fine textured soil interlayer the amount of salt transport under different initial gwds at the bottom of the root zone in the l lsl and lcl soil profiles during the crop growth seasons are shown in fig 10 similar to the variations in water flow amount at the bottom of the root zone fig 8 the amount of salt transport between the crop root zone and the subsoil decreases with the increase of initial gwd in lsl the amounts of salt transport upward and downward are larger at the bottom of the root zone in lsl compared to the l profile for the smaller initial gwds of 130 150 170 and 190 cm that favor water flow however the amount of salt transport becomes smaller for larger initial gwds 210 cm chen et al 2021 found that coarse textured soil covered by fine textured soil favors salt transport into or out of the upper soil layer under shallow gwd conditions whereas wang et al 2017 found that the coarse textured soil interlayer in a soil profile reduces the amount of salt leaching during water infiltration these contrasting results are associated with different levels of soil water content in the coarse textured soil layer and its corresponding hydraulic conductivity which either favors or inhibits soil water and salt fluxes the silty clay layer inhibits water flux at the bottom of the root zone due to its lower hydraulic conductivity also it decreases the magnitude of salt transport compared with the l soil profile under different initial gwds li and hu 2004 however the amount of salt transport increases or slowly decreases at first and then drops rapidly along with the change in the amount of soil water when gwds are increasing 3 2 3 crop yield the simulated yields of spring wheat in the l lsl and lcl profiles under different initial gwds in 2007 and 2008 are shown in fig 11 the figure highlights that crop yield is closely linked with the initial gwd that is the crop yields in the l lsl and lcl profiles increase with a decreasing marginal benefit as the initial gwd increases from 130 to 250 cm the increase in crop yield is mainly associated with the decrease of salt content in the root zone fig 12 although soil water storage in the root zone also declines with increasing gwds the reduced salt content in the root zone has a dominant role in crop yield for cases with high soil water content chen et al 2020 the lcl profile with a silty clay layer under the root zone produces higher crop yields under different initial gwds compared to the l profile this is because the silty clay interlayer has low hydraulic conductivity that inhibits upward salt transport into the root zone and reduces root zone salt content fig 12 crop yield in the lsl profile with a sand layer under the root zone is lower than that of the l profile when the initial gwd is smaller 210 cm however the crop yield ends up being close to or even larger than that of the l profile when the initial gwd is greater than 210 cm the sand interlayer in lsl favors upward salt transport into the root zone under smaller gwds which increases the root zone salt content and reduces crop yield the sand interlayer behaves as a capillary barrier under larger gwds and thus inhibits salt transport upward into the root zone ityel et al 2012 embedded a coarse gravel layer as a capillary barrier under the crop root zone and found that the capillary barrier could increase water content and crop yield however considering soil salinity and shallow gwd in this study the coarse textured soil could only act as a capillary barrier when gwd is deep enough further it is observed that the capillary barrier decreases the root zone water and salt content in comparison to the homogeneous soil which benefits crop yield due to the reduced salt stress thus for a soil profile with coarse textured soil under the crop root zone the water management strategies for salt control and crop production should be different in areas that have shallow or deep groundwater tables 3 3 response of groundwater table depth to different layered soils during crop growth season as shown in fig 13 the fluctuations in the groundwater table during a crop growth season are mainly caused by irrigation and heavy precipitation for the smaller initial gwd of 150 cm however the fluctuations in the groundwater table are mainly influenced by a large amount of irrigation when the initial gwd is deep at 250 cm due to the lower water holding capacity of the sand layer in the lsl profile mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the crop root zone gets more water supply from the sand layer fig 14a and b and thus extracts less water from shallow groundwater during the non infiltration period fig 14c and d which results in a smaller gwd this phenomenon is more apparent for an initial gwd of 150 cm when the hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer is large fig 13a and b for lcl which has a silty clay layer under the root zone the fine textured soil has higher water holding capacity and does not easily release water during this period therefore the upward water flux into the root zone mainly comes from the groundwater fig 14c and d which causes a larger gwd in the lcl profile huang et al 2013a conducted an evaporation experiment and performed a simulation with two layered unsaturated soil profiles sand overlying silt and silt overlying sand and they found that evaporated water mainly comes from the coarse textured soil sand layer in both soil profiles their results are in good agreement with the current study s findings concerning the dynamics of upward water flux in layered soils with shallow gwds the groundwater table in the l lsl and lcl soil profiles rises due to deep percolation into the groundwater fig 13 the rising amplitude of the groundwater table is higher in lcl and more moderate in lsl compared to the l profile because the sand layer has lower water content through the non infiltration period and tends to store more infiltrated water thus having less water to spare for the groundwater fig 14 on the other hand the silty clay layer has higher water content and consumes less infiltrated water therefore more water is left for the groundwater fig 14 the sand layer acts as a capillary barrier and restrains the downward water flux in the scenario with initial gwd up to 250 cm which further results in a slower rising of the groundwater table in lsl at this stage 3 4 shallow groundwater table regulation for crop production in layered soils a soil profile with a coarse textured soil layer under the root zone in areas characterized with shallow groundwater tables can result in a larger amount of salt migration specifically from deep soil into the root zone with increased upward water flux and lower crop yield compared with homogeneous soil fig 11 leaching salt through a large amount of irrigation water can create a low salt soil environment for crop growth in the short term but this practice could result in a higher rise in the groundwater table and aggravate soil salinization in return by lowering the groundwater table to a level where the coarse textured soil inhibits salt transport its movement in an upward direction into the root zone is significantly reduced fig 10 therefore keeping the groundwater table lower to a level such that the coarse textured soil layer acts as a capillary barrier is important to control salt level and improve crop production in salinized cropland with a soil profile similar to lsl for a soil profile similar to lcl the migration of salt from deep soil to the root zone with water moving upward can be inhibited by a fine textured soil under different initial gwds the process decreases salt content in the root zone during the crop growth season compared with homogeneous soil fig 12 and increases crop yield in salinized cropland fig 11 therefore keeping a high groundwater table in areas without sufficient irrigation water for crop growth is a practical measure that supplies water to the root zone and abates salt accumulation thus producing much higher crop yield compared with homogeneous soil for an area with relatively more water for irrigation leaching salt out of the root zone and keeping a low groundwater table could be an effective practice to alleviate root zone salt and increase crop yield for this type of layered soil furthermore the salt leached out of the root zone could be effectively isolated in the deep soil by the fine textured soil 4 conclusions the lawstac model was used to investigate how shallow groundwater influences soil water flow salt transport and crop yield under different layered soil systems this agro hydrological model was calibrated and validated with data collected from a spring wheat field in northwest china the results show that the model is reliable in simulating the soil water content and salt concentration at different soil depths groundwater table dynamics in layered soil lai biomass and crop yield a total of 21 scenarios with different initial gwds and layered soils were simulated using the lawstac model the results demonstrate that a sand layer coarse textured soil under the crop root zone could result in higher water and salt content in the root zone and lower crop yield when gwd is smaller than a critical level the root zone water and salt content become lower and crop yield is close to or higher than that of homogeneous soil for a gwd larger than the critical level on the other hand a silty clay layer fine textured soil under the crop root zone could lead to lower root zone water and salt content and higher crop yield compared with homogeneous soil for various initial gwds in the areas with a shallow groundwater table and soil salinization the groundwater table should be lowered until the coarse textured soil can turn into a capillary barrier for salt control and crop growth in soil profiles that have a coarse textured soil layer under the root zone the groundwater table can be kept high to sustain water for crop growth without causing more salt accumulation in soil profiles that have a fine textured soil under the root zone while leaching salt out of the root zone and keeping a low groundwater table can be used as effective practices for salt control and crop production in soil profiles with a fine textured soil interlayer in areas that have relatively more water resource note that the general conclusions drawn in this work are based on typical layered soils in an area of northwest china therefore further studies should consider investigating suitable shallow gwds in salinized cropland for specific types of layered soil

9567,shallow groundwater affects crop growth and yield by altering the root zone water and salt budgets with the process being more complicated in layered soils to gain insights into the role of shallow groundwater in layered soils lawstac a physically based agro hydrological model was employed to simulate soil water salt and groundwater fluxes and crop yield in three soil profiles loam l loam with a sand interlayer lsl and loam with a clay interlayer lcl the model was verified using data collected in 2007 and 2008 from a spring wheat field with shallow groundwater tables the model predictions matched well with the measured soil water content salt concentration groundwater table depth gwd leaf area index biomass and crop yield further simulations were conducted for the l lsl and lcl profiles with varying gwds in the crop growth seasons and initial values specified at 130 150 170 190 210 230 and 250 cm the groundwater table showed greater fluctuations in lcl with smaller fluctuations in lsl in comparison to l when starting with smaller initial gwds of 130 150 170 and 190 cm the coarse textured soil under the root zone facilitated water and salt fluxes at the bottom of the root zone resulting in larger averages for root zone water storage and more salt content during the crop growth seasons and lower crop yield due to salt stress meanwhile in cases with an initial gwd larger than 210 cm the coarse textured soil inhibited the fluxes and improved crop yield due to the reduced salt stress fine textured soil under the root zone inhibited water and salt fluxes reducing root zone salt content and favoring crop yield however the effect decreased with larger initial gwds thus the groundwater table should be lowered to a level where coarse textured soil acts as a capillary barrier for salt control and crop growth in soil profiles similar to lsl keeping a high groundwater table to sustain water for crop growth is acceptable in soil profiles similar to lcl while keeping a lower groundwater table could be an effective practice to control salt and improve crop production in salinized croplands keywords shallow groundwater layered soil soil water and salt crop growth water management 1 introduction shallow groundwater tables are easily formed in arid and semiarid regions due to excessive long term irrigation in croplands with poor drainage conditions on the one hand the capillary rise from shallow groundwater can supply water for crop growth but on the other hand it also brings salt into the root zone a shallow groundwater table favors capillary rise thus leading to root zone salinity buildup and adversely affecting crop yield karimov et al 2014 understanding the interactions between groundwater soil water and salt is important for crop growth in salinized croplands many studies have assessed water use soil salinity and crop yield under different groundwater table depths gwds and investigated the gwd best suited for crop production jorenush et al 2003 xu et al 2013 however layered soils can significantly affect soil water flow and salt transport zettl et al 2011 which in turn affects groundwater table dynamics and changes the most suitable gwd for a given area therefore it is crucial to better comprehend how layered soils influence groundwater flux root zone water and salt accumulation and finally crop yield many laboratory and simulation studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of layered soils on water and solute transport khire et al 2000 for coarse textured soil overlying fine textured soil mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 found that the infiltration rate marginally increases due to the greater sorptivity of the underlying fine textured soil when water reaches the interface meanwhile si et al 2011 concluded that infiltration water flux is reduced in the fine textured soil layer due to its lower hydraulic conductivity in comparison to that of the upper coarse textured soil layer stormont and anderson 1999 reversed the soil layer sequence and reported that water storage in the upper fine textured soil could be increased during infiltration based on the capillary break caused by the lower water entry suction from the underlying coarse textured soil however several studies found that the capillary barrier effect could vanish and that the coarse textured soil interlayer with higher levels of water content could even facilitate water and salt transport aubertin et al 2009 chen et al 2021 these behaviors of soil water and solute in layered soils are closely related to the soil s physical status e g its unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content and such conditions are influenced by gwd moreover the depth of the groundwater table is affected by layered soils since they cause significant variations in water flux rooney et al 1998 however few studies have focused on the dynamics of gwd water flow and solute transport in layered soils and analyzed their interplay in addition to impacting soil water and salt transport layered and homogeneous soils play a critical role in crop growth and yield wehr et al 2005 ren and huang 2016 ityel et al 2011 2012 embedded a coarse gravel layer at the bottom of a root zone and found that the gravel layer acts as a capillary barrier and improves crop yield by increasing the root zone water content chen et al 2021 found that coarse textured soil under the root zone having lower water content could increase root zone water storage during crop growth seasons whereas a layer with higher water content reduces water storage and favors salt leaching these results imply that layered soil water and salt contents under different shallow gwds can influence crop growth and yield many studies have been conducted on the suitable gwds for crop growth based on root zone water and salt conditions xu et al 2013 karimov et al 2014 han et al 2015 however it is still unclear how the layered soils affect the suitable gwds so this topic requires further investigation model simulation is one of the widely used methods for studying soil water flow salt transport and crop growth in the complex soil crop system jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 huang et al 2013b hydrus 1d 2d 3d is a robust model that simulates soil water and salt transport and has been employed in several studies to explore multilayered soil systems simunek et al 2008 ityel et al 2011 used hydrus 2d 3d to study how the root zone water condition was affected by an embedded gravel layer under the root zone wang et al 2014 used hydrus 1d to simulate water infiltration in fine textured soil with a coarse sand interlayer and proved the richards equation based model s capabilities in describing the infiltration rate and soil water condition in distinctly layered soils further some physically based agro hydrological models including swap van dam et al 1997 rzwqm hanson et al 1998 waves zhang and dawes 1998 and hydrus wofost zhou et al 2012 have been developed to depict soil water flow salt transport and crop growth conditions many studies have used the agro hydrological models to assess the effects of gwd on water use soil salinity and crop yield in fields however few of them have compared the dynamics of shallow groundwater tables in distinctly layered soils with a coarse or fine textured soil interlayer and analyzed the differences in soil water and salt fluxes and crop yield in layered soils with shallow gwds therefore the main objectives of this study are to investigate how shallow gwds respond to different types of layered soils and how a shallow gwd affects root zone water and salt dynamics and crop yield to achieve these objectives a physically based agro hydrological model lawstac is calibrated using the following field measurements soil water content salt concentration gwd leaf area index biomass and crop yield the model is further applied to soil profiles with a coarse or fine textured soil interlayer below the root zone and varying gwds the results will provide a guideline for salt alleviation and crop production in croplands with different soil textures and shallow groundwater tables 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description lawstac layered soil water solute transport and crop growth is a one dimensional 1d agro hydrological model that includes the following modules evapotranspiration soil water and salt transport and crop growth chen et al 2019 the integration processes of the modules are shown in fig 1 in order to reflect soil water and salt stresses on crop water consumption the reference evapotranspiration et0 is first calculated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 et0 is used to estimate the potential crop evapotranspiration etc based on the crop coefficient then etc is partitioned into the potential soil evaporation e p and transpiration t p using the extinction coefficient and leaf area index lai childs and hanks 1975 finally the actual transpiration t a is obtained from t p with the multiplicative water α w and salt stresses α s calculated from the feddes model feddes et al 1978 and maas hoffman model maas and

distribution along with the soil profile within the root depth is described by a piecewise linear function hoffman and van genuchten 1983 biomass is computed using the solar radiation intercepted by the crop canopy based on beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 crop yield is obtained from the aboveground biomass by multiplying by a harvest index williams et al 1989 for layered soil lawstac considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of the richards equation for soil water flow the arithmetic mean geometric mean and triadic mean have been shown to perform better than the other methods in terms of simulation precision and stability chen et al 2019 therefore the hydraulic conductivity in the middle of two adjacent discretization nodes in this study is calculated using the arithmetic mean for layered soil water simulations 2 2 field measurement field experiments were conducted by xu et al 2013 at the huinong experimental site 36 04 n 106 39 e 1092 m located in qingtongxia irrigation district qid northwest china qid has an arid continental climate with a mean annual pan evaporation φ20 cm and precipitation of 1500 2100 mm and 180 200 mm respectively sunshine durations range from 2870 h to 3080 h with an annual average temperature of 8 5 c the gwd in qid varies from 0 5 m to 2 5 m during the year spring wheat was cultivated at the experimental site in 2007 and 2008 with a sowing date of march 16 and a harvesting date of july 11 the initial soil water content within 1 m depth was 0 35 cm3 cm 3 for the two crop growth seasons while the initial soil salt concentrations were 8 4 and 9 3 g l 1 respectively the field plots 3 replications 3 10 m2 each were irrigated with water delivered from the yellow river and had an average total dissolved solid concentration of 0 5 g l 1 basin irrigation was applied three times in the two crop growth seasons with the respective amounts of 135 90 and 90 mm being administered on the corresponding dates of may 3 may 24 and july 6 2007 and may 3 may 24 and june 29 2008 the vertical soil profile at the experimental site has textural variance with sandy loam and silt loam at different depths table 1 soil water and salt content were measured in soil samples collected from the top layer 0 10 cm and subsoil layer 10 90 cm with a 20 cm increment gwd was monitored in the nearby observation wells and groundwater samples were also collected to measure the electrical conductivity the daily meteorological data of sunshine hour air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were acquired from the nearby huinong weather station lai was measured every 6 12 days using a leaf area meter li 3000 li cor aboveground dry biomass was measured every 5 12 days by oven drying at 75 and wheat yield was weighed after the harvest for a 9 m2 area in each plot agricultural practices including fertilizer and pesticide applications were adopted according to the local practices xu et al 2013 2 3 model setup calibration and validation methods a soil profile with 300 cm depth was specified when simulating the soil water flow and solute transport it is worth mentioning that the lower boundary of the soil profile was under the groundwater table that is in the saturated zone due to the shallow gwd generally within 250 cm depth due to the flat topography of the qid it was assumed that the lateral groundwater flow was small so the vertical water flow was the main focus the vertical simulation domain was divided into five horizontal layers according to the field measurements table 1 and further discretized into 301 grids with 1 cm spacing the atmospheric boundary condition under the influence of irrigation precipitation and evaporation fluxes was specified for the upper boundary in simulating soil water flow the salt flux condition with zero flux for evaporation and precipitation and 0 5 g l 1 for irrigation was used as the upper boundary condition for salt transport the concentration of total dissolved solids measured in groundwater was considered as the lower boundary condition when simulating salt transport because the lower boundary was beneath the groundwater table the lower boundary condition for soil water flow simulation was defined as zero flux by neglecting lateral groundwater flow the initial conditions for soil water flow and salt transport simulations were the measured soil water content and salt concentration in the soil profile on the sowing day for the spring wheat the parameters of soil hydraulic property solute transport crop growth root water uptake and evaporation stress were initially set according to chen et al 2019 tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary file who calibrated and validated the parameters using data collected from the same field and considered the measured gwd as a model input to calculate the pressure head on the lower boundary in this study the simulated pressure head h using the zero flux lower boundary condition was used to calculate the gwd that is 300 h cm and the measured crop biomass data were added to the crop dataset for model calibration 2007 and validation 2008 the sensitive parameters including the soil hydraulic parameters θ s α n and k s salt transport parameter d l and crop parameters were selected based on xu et al 2016 and were adjusted during the model calibration the calibration process based on the trial and error method was performed for soil water salt and crop growth in sequence until good simulation results were achieved the model s performance during the calibration and validation periods was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 the equations for the abovementioned statistical indexes are given as follows 8 rmse 1 n x i y i 2 9 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 10 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the total number of measured data x i is the ith measured data y i is the ith simulated value and x and y are the average measured and simulated values respectively the optimal values depicting the best model performance are close to zero for rmse and close to 1 for nse and r 2 legates and mccabe 1999 2 4 simulation scenarios of different layered soils and groundwater table depths the lawstac model has been used in several column and field cases with layered soils and has demonstrated good performance in describing soil water and salt dynamics and crop growth chen et al 2019 2021 therefore by embedding a coarse or fine textured soil layer under the crop root zone of the experimental site the calibrated lawstac model was further used to investigate the impact of distinctly layered soils on soil water and salinity gwd and crop yield in this area with shallow groundwater tables a sandy soil found in the study area 87 sand 10 silt and 3 clay was used as the typical coarse textured soil layer with the measured soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 2 gao et al 2017 the fine textured soil was a silty clay soil 57 5 silt and 42 5 clay with the soil hydraulic parameters predicted by the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 miao et al 2016 the salt transport parameters for the two soil types were determined based on jury and horton 2004 a homogeneous soil profile consisting of four layers of sandy loam sampled at the experimental site was treated as the control group profile l in fig 2 the layered lsl and lcl soil profiles were defined by placing the sand and silty clay soil layers respectively under the crop root zone and the embedded soil layers had a buried depth from the ground surface to the upper surface of the layer of 100 cm and a thickness of 40 cm fig 2 to account for the uncertainty in the hydraulic parameters of the embedded sand and silty clay variations in soil water flux at the bottom of the root zone in lsl and lcl profiles were analyzed by changing 10 5 5 and 10 of each soil hydraulic parameter in table 2 to investigate the dynamics of the shallow groundwater table in the layered soils seven gwds 130 150 170 190 210 230 and 250 cm were initially specified for the three soil profiles the gwd can be varied under the influence of irrigation precipitation and evapotranspiration during the crop growth seasons a total of 21 scenarios 3 7 were set to assess the effects of layered soils and gwds on root zone water and salt dynamics and crop yield in the scenario analysis a stable state of soil water was set for each initial soil profile and the initial matric potential at each node was in hydrostatic equilibrium with the initial gwd 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the simulated soil water contents in different soil layers match well with the corresponding measured values during the model calibration and validation fig 3 the rmse values were no higher than 0 02 cm3 cm 3 while the r 2 and nse values were greater than 0 8 for the calibration and validation the simulation results show that soil water content can increase sharply with the application of water in cropland while it gradually decreased due to evapotranspiration and percolation the consistency between the simulated results using lawstac and the measured values in the field demonstrates a good description of soil water flow in the layered soil the simulated soil salt concentrations at different soil depths and the corresponding measured values for the calibration and validation are shown in fig 4 the results show that the variations in the measured salt concentration are well captured by the model with rmse 1 64 g l 1 r 2 0 54 and nse 0 51 during calibration and rmse 1 84 g l 1 r 2 0 70 and nse 0 70 during validation salt concentration in the upper soil 50 cm can be diluted by irrigation and precipitation while the concentration increased with evaporation and transpiration fig 4 salt concentration in the deeper soil 50 90 cm gradually increased during the simulation period this is because the salt concentration in the deeper soil layer was less affected by irrigation and the upward water flux constantly carried salt from the deep soil into this layer overall the simulated salt dynamics and statistical indicators suggest a satisfactory simulation of salt transport in the layered soil based on the zero flux as the lower boundary condition for the soil water flow simulation the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters and salt transport parameters are listed in table 3 the simulation results for soil water and salt in this study are similar to those in chen et al 2019 which used the same soil hydraulic and salt transport parameters but a variable pressure head as the lower boundary condition the rmse values for soil water and salt were 0 02 0 06 cm3 cm 3 and 1 64 3 56 g l 1 respectively during calibration validation in chen et al 2019 and the water flux at the lower boundary approached zero with daily average values of 6 1 10 2 and 6 9 10 2 cm d 1 in the two years the results indicate that the application of zero flux as a lower boundary condition is feasible for soil water flow simulation in the study area while the calibrated soil parameters can be used to quantify the physical processes of soil water and salt transport the simulated lai and aboveground biomass agb match well with the measured values from the 2007 and 2008 crop growth seasons fig 5 the r 2 values associated with lai and agb were greater than 0 9 during both the calibration and validation while the nse values for lai and agb were greater than 0 9 and 0 8 respectively during calibration and validation the simulated yield of spring wheat in 2007 was 4614 kg ha 1 which is 0 3 higher than the measured value 4600 kg ha 1 and the yield of spring wheat in 2008 was 4805 kg ha 1 which is 0 7 higher than the measured yield 4771 kg ha 1 these statistical results confirm an acceptably good simulation of crop growth by lawstac and the rationality of the selected crop growth parameters table 4 most of the calibrated parameters were found to be in the range of the ones that xu et al 2013 used for spring wheat in the same study area except for the maximum root depth rdmax which was extended from 90 cm in xu et al 2013 to 100 cm in this study the rdmax range in this study was more consistent with the experimental results conducted by miao et al 2016 in this study area furthermore the water stress parameters from the feddes model h 2h and h 2l the soil matric potential below which water uptake reduction starts at high or low atmospheric demand respectively and h 3 were also adjusted in this study for better simulation results table 4 gwd was calculated by simulating the pressure head at the lower boundary during a crop growth season and the calculated results are shown in fig 6 the measured gwds are generally well captured by the lawstac model the gwds rapidly decreased during the irrigation periods and gradually increased due to the capillary rise into the upper unsaturated zone the deviations of some of the measured values might be affected by the fluctuation in the groundwater table at a regional scale overall the model performed well in simulating gwds during the crop growth seasons 3 2 soil water and salt dynamics and crop yield in layered soils 3 2 1 uncertainty analysis of the hydraulic parameters of the sand and silty clay interlayers as shown in fig 7 the 10 changes in the sandy soil hydraulic parameters had relatively negligible effects on the magnitude of water moving downward at the bottom of the root zone in the lsl profile during a crop growth season the parameters of silty clay including θ r θ s α and k s also depicted an insignificant impact on the magnitude of water moving downward whereas the parameter n had a relatively larger effect however according to skaggs et al 2004 the rosetta pedotransfer function for estimating hydraulic parameters θ r α and n is substantially accurate while the accuracy of θ s and k s is more dependent on instrument measurements therefore the uncertain impacts of the hydraulic parameters of the sand and silty clay interlayers were less evident in the simulations for the lsl and lcl profiles 3 2 2 root zone water and salt dynamics as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of water moving upward and downward at the bottom of the root zone both become smaller in the lsl profile as the initial gwd increases from 130 up to 250 cm where the magnitudes of water are higher at first and then become smaller than these in profile l with critical initial gwd near 210 cm the effect of inhibiting water moving upward is more evident after the initial gwd exceeds the critical value as shown in fig 9 the hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer in lsl depicts the largest decline rate with an increase of gwd this might be associated with the larger pore size of the sand interlayer which is characterized by a lower air entry pressure and capillary force the increase in gwd leads to fast gravity drainage causing water discontinuity in soil pores nachshon et al 2011 as a result the soil hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer in lsl is higher than that of the sandy loam layer located at the same depth in the l profile when the initial gwd is less than 210 cm which favors water flow in the soil profile on the other hand the soil hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer becomes smaller for larger initial gwds and this layer then begins to have higher resistance to water flow compared to the l profile previous studies have shown that coarse textured soil under fine textured soil inhibits water flow due to the capillary break stormont et al 1999 while chen et al 2021 and shi et al 2005 found that the coarse textured soil interlayer favors water flow under shallow gwds however the differences in the abovementioned findings can be explained by the results concerning the water condition and hydraulic conductivity of the coarse textured soil interlayer in the current study the magnitudes of water moving upward and downward at the bottom of the root zone in lcl increase or slowly decrease as initial gwd increases from 130 up to 170 cm and then drop rapidly for the larger initial gwds when the initial gwd is less than 170 cm the hydraulic conductivity of the silty clay is relatively high and the fine textured soil layer can carry a considerable amount of water from the groundwater into the root zone or out of the root zone the increased magnitude of water moving upward with the increased gwd is caused by the reduced water content and increased soil water suction in the root zone the hydraulic conductivity of the silty clay decreases significantly when the initial gwd is greater than 170 cm this is because the silty clay begins to have more resistance to upward and downward water flow compared with the l profile water fluxes at the bottom of the root zone in lcl are always lower under different initial gwds due to the smaller hydraulic conductivity of the fine textured soil interlayer the amount of salt transport under different initial gwds at the bottom of the root zone in the l lsl and lcl soil profiles during the crop growth seasons are shown in fig 10 similar to the variations in water flow amount at the bottom of the root zone fig 8 the amount of salt transport between the crop root zone and the subsoil decreases with the increase of initial gwd in lsl the amounts of salt transport upward and downward are larger at the bottom of the root zone in lsl compared to the l profile for the smaller initial gwds of 130 150 170 and 190 cm that favor water flow however the amount of salt transport becomes smaller for larger initial gwds 210 cm chen et al 2021 found that coarse textured soil covered by fine textured soil favors salt transport into or out of the upper soil layer under shallow gwd conditions whereas wang et al 2017 found that the coarse textured soil interlayer in a soil profile reduces the amount of salt leaching during water infiltration these contrasting results are associated with different levels of soil water content in the coarse textured soil layer and its corresponding hydraulic conductivity which either favors or inhibits soil water and salt fluxes the silty clay layer inhibits water flux at the bottom of the root zone due to its lower hydraulic conductivity also it decreases the magnitude of salt transport compared with the l soil profile under different initial gwds li and hu 2004 however the amount of salt transport increases or slowly decreases at first and then drops rapidly along with the change in the amount of soil water when gwds are increasing 3 2 3 crop yield the simulated yields of spring wheat in the l lsl and lcl profiles under different initial gwds in 2007 and 2008 are shown in fig 11 the figure highlights that crop yield is closely linked with the initial gwd that is the crop yields in the l lsl and lcl profiles increase with a decreasing marginal benefit as the initial gwd increases from 130 to 250 cm the increase in crop yield is mainly associated with the decrease of salt content in the root zone fig 12 although soil water storage in the root zone also declines with increasing gwds the reduced salt content in the root zone has a dominant role in crop yield for cases with high soil water content chen et al 2020 the lcl profile with a silty clay layer under the root zone produces higher crop yields under different initial gwds compared to the l profile this is because the silty clay interlayer has low hydraulic conductivity that inhibits upward salt transport into the root zone and reduces root zone salt content fig 12 crop yield in the lsl profile with a sand layer under the root zone is lower than that of the l profile when the initial gwd is smaller 210 cm however the crop yield ends up being close to or even larger than that of the l profile when the initial gwd is greater than 210 cm the sand interlayer in lsl favors upward salt transport into the root zone under smaller gwds which increases the root zone salt content and reduces crop yield the sand interlayer behaves as a capillary barrier under larger gwds and thus inhibits salt transport upward into the root zone ityel et al 2012 embedded a coarse gravel layer as a capillary barrier under the crop root zone and found that the capillary barrier could increase water content and crop yield however considering soil salinity and shallow gwd in this study the coarse textured soil could only act as a capillary barrier when gwd is deep enough further it is observed that the capillary barrier decreases the root zone water and salt content in comparison to the homogeneous soil which benefits crop yield due to the reduced salt stress thus for a soil profile with coarse textured soil under the crop root zone the water management strategies for salt control and crop production should be different in areas that have shallow or deep groundwater tables 3 3 response of groundwater table depth to different layered soils during crop growth season as shown in fig 13 the fluctuations in the groundwater table during a crop growth season are mainly caused by irrigation and heavy precipitation for the smaller initial gwd of 150 cm however the fluctuations in the groundwater table are mainly influenced by a large amount of irrigation when the initial gwd is deep at 250 cm due to the lower water holding capacity of the sand layer in the lsl profile mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the crop root zone gets more water supply from the sand layer fig 14a and b and thus extracts less water from shallow groundwater during the non infiltration period fig 14c and d which results in a smaller gwd this phenomenon is more apparent for an initial gwd of 150 cm when the hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer is large fig 13a and b for lcl which has a silty clay layer under the root zone the fine textured soil has higher water holding capacity and does not easily release water during this period therefore the upward water flux into the root zone mainly comes from the groundwater fig 14c and d which causes a larger gwd in the lcl profile huang et al 2013a conducted an evaporation experiment and performed a simulation with two layered unsaturated soil profiles sand overlying silt and silt overlying sand and they found that evaporated water mainly comes from the coarse textured soil sand layer in both soil profiles their results are in good agreement with the current study s findings concerning the dynamics of upward water flux in layered soils with shallow gwds the groundwater table in the l lsl and lcl soil profiles rises due to deep percolation into the groundwater fig 13 the rising amplitude of the groundwater table is higher in lcl and more moderate in lsl compared to the l profile because the sand layer has lower water content through the non infiltration period and tends to store more infiltrated water thus having less water to spare for the groundwater fig 14 on the other hand the silty clay layer has higher water content and consumes less infiltrated water therefore more water is left for the groundwater fig 14 the sand layer acts as a capillary barrier and restrains the downward water flux in the scenario with initial gwd up to 250 cm which further results in a slower rising of the groundwater table in lsl at this stage 3 4 shallow groundwater table regulation for crop production in layered soils a soil profile with a coarse textured soil layer under the root zone in areas characterized with shallow groundwater tables can result in a larger amount of salt migration specifically from deep soil into the root zone with increased upward water flux and lower crop yield compared with homogeneous soil fig 11 leaching salt through a large amount of irrigation water can create a low salt soil environment for crop growth in the short term but this practice could result in a higher rise in the groundwater table and aggravate soil salinization in return by lowering the groundwater table to a level where the coarse textured soil inhibits salt transport its movement in an upward direction into the root zone is significantly reduced fig 10 therefore keeping the groundwater table lower to a level such that the coarse textured soil layer acts as a capillary barrier is important to control salt level and improve crop production in salinized cropland with a soil profile similar to lsl for a soil profile similar to lcl the migration of salt from deep soil to the root zone with water moving upward can be inhibited by a fine textured soil under different initial gwds the process decreases salt content in the root zone during the crop growth season compared with homogeneous soil fig 12 and increases crop yield in salinized cropland fig 11 therefore keeping a high groundwater table in areas without sufficient irrigation water for crop growth is a practical measure that supplies water to the root zone and abates salt accumulation thus producing much higher crop yield compared with homogeneous soil for an area with relatively more water for irrigation leaching salt out of the root zone and keeping a low groundwater table could be an effective practice to alleviate root zone salt and increase crop yield for this type of layered soil furthermore the salt leached out of the root zone could be effectively isolated in the deep soil by the fine textured soil 4 conclusions the lawstac model was used to investigate how shallow groundwater influences soil water flow salt transport and crop yield under different layered soil systems this agro hydrological model was calibrated and validated with data collected from a spring wheat field in northwest china the results show that the model is reliable in simulating the soil water content and salt concentration at different soil depths groundwater table dynamics in layered soil lai biomass and crop yield a total of 21 scenarios with different initial gwds and layered soils were simulated using the lawstac model the results demonstrate that a sand layer coarse textured soil under the crop root zone could result in higher water and salt content in the root zone and lower crop yield when gwd is smaller than a critical level the root zone water and salt content become lower and crop yield is close to or higher than that of homogeneous soil for a gwd larger than the critical level on the other hand a silty clay layer fine textured soil under the crop root zone could lead to lower root zone water and salt content and higher crop yield compared with homogeneous soil for various initial gwds in the areas with a shallow groundwater table and soil salinization the groundwater table should be lowered until the coarse textured soil can turn into a capillary barrier for salt control and crop growth in soil profiles that have a coarse textured soil layer under the root zone the groundwater table can be kept high to sustain water for crop growth without causing more salt accumulation in soil profiles that have a fine textured soil under the root zone while leaching salt out of the root zone and keeping a low groundwater table can be used as effective practices for salt control and crop production in soil profiles with a fine textured soil interlayer in areas that have relatively more water resource note that the general conclusions drawn in this work are based on typical layered soils in an area of northwest china therefore further studies should consider investigating suitable shallow gwds in salinized cropland for specific types of layered soil

9568,water and fertilizer management strategy profoundly influences crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiency in this study a framework for joint simulation optimization of irrigation and fertilizer schedules jsoifs was established by coupling the improved aquacrop model w n jensen model and multi objective programming firstly the aquacrop model was modified to simulate evapotranspiration et under nitrogen stress through introducing the concept of shoot actual critical and minimal nitrogen concentration the accuracy and applicability of the improved aquacrop model to simulate et were verified taking seed maize of shiyanghe river basin as a case on the basis an optimization model with the objective of maximum yield calculated by w n jensen model and water use efficiency was developed under the scenarios of different levels of available water and nitrogen and initial soil mineral nitrogen content results showed that the improved model can simulate canopy cover cc and et well with and without water stress meanwhile the precision for cc biomass et and yield of seed maize can be guaranteed when water and nitrogen stress coexist it indicated that the improved model can be used for irrigation and fertilizer management the optimal irrigation and fertilizer schedules pointed out that the irrigation and nitrogen application and initial soil mineral nitrogen all have significant effects on yield in low fertility soils irrigation should be concentrated during tasseling stage and fertilization is as critical as irrigation conversely in high fertility soils irrigation should be dispersed throughout the growth period water and nitrogen use efficiency have been promoted compared with the status quo the recommended water and nitrogen application for seed maize are 150 200 mm and 100 150 kg n ha respectively in study area with the mean soil mineral nitrogen of 182 kg n ha the improvement of et simulation performance of aquacrop model under simultaneous stress of water and nitrogen provides convenience for achieving precise crop management meanwhile the jsoifs framework realizes the efficient irrigation and fertilizer schedules in arid areas improves the resources use rate and is equally applicable to other regions with the same goals graphical abstract ga1 keywords optimization irrigation and fertilizer management aquacrop multi objective programming 1 introduction water shortage is one of the key factors that afflict agricultural production in arid areas due to the heavy dependence on irrigation kang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 meanwhile fertilizer is a critical input to ensure yield wang et al 2018 orebo et al 2021 ordóñez et al 2021 thus many farmers believe that the crops have to be supplied with enough water and fertilizer to achieve high yield wang et al 2019 however excessive irrigation and fertilization will lead to the decline of crop yield and quality resource waste and environmental pollution so that it will impact the profitability of the farmer behera et al 2013 albornoz 2016 guo et al 2021 with population growth and climate change food security and sustainable development are becoming the focus of people s attention hence reducing the use of resources and improving crop yield have turned into vital tasks at present geerts and raes 2009 scientific and rational management of farmland water and fertilizer is an effective means to solve this problem recognizing and quantifying the response of crop growth and yield on soil water and nutrition content is the basis and a key part in water and fertilizer management the water fertilizer production functions e g modified jensen model and the quadratic form function are commonly used to directly describe the relationship of irrigation and fertilizer application to yield estimation because of the high accuracy shan et al 2019 chen et al 2020b however the simplicity of these equations means that they can hardly describe the physical processes of crop growth and the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen limiting their application in practical production nguyen et al 2017 in addition to better represent the two processes and manage irrigation and fertilization a series of crop models based on different mechanisms were developed and have been adopted around the world including wofost daisy dndc dssat aquacrop csm ixim whcns models and so on vries 1989 hansen et al 1990 li et al 1992 jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 lizaso et al 2011 liang et al 2016 however they do not always give accurate estimates of crop yields when water or nitrogen stress occur due to the incomplete physical processes and the amplification of uncertainty in the nested calculation wang et al 2020a 2020b coupling the mechanism of process based model with the high accuracy of experienced model the regional applicability and accuracy of the model can be further improved wang et al 2021b therefore combining the water fertilizer production function and crop models is a promising alternative for better precisely yield estimation in the process actual crop evapotranspiration is very necessary to accurately estimate because it is closely related to crop irrigation management and is an important parameter for yield estimation in some models like jensen model and aquacrop there are many methods to simulate it such as shuttleworth wallace and tseb models these models have the common problems about complexity of structure the need to input a large number of parameters and different parameter standards vanuytrecht et al 2014 adeboye et al 2019 the aquacrop model is a water driven model developed by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 and the approach to calculate et that this model uses is two step crop coefficient reference et k c et 0 based on canopy cover cc which can balance simplicity with accuracy therefore the superiority of the aquacrop model make it more prominent in the promotion application meanwhile the feasibility of this model has been verified in a variety of crops and regions stricevic et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 linker et al 2016 but there is one thing to be aware of the aquacrop model adopts in the semi quantitative method to evaluate the fertilizer stress in detail the effect of soil nutrient on crop growth is expressed as the percentage of relevant parameters based on full irrigation and fertilization van gaelen et al 2015 akumaga et al 2017 that is it cannot directly simulate the response of crop to fertilizer in the light of plant fertilizer demand and soil nutrition content to sum up the fertilizer stress in this model maybe experiential and inaccurate some studies have shown that the model had better performance under the condition of no fertilizer stress compared to when fertilizer stress appears adeboye et al 2021 rahimikhoob et al 2021 failure to accurately quantify response of crop growth and et to fertilization may result in improper resources management schemes and consequently lead to unforeseeable loss to government departments or farmland managers who use this model to close these gaps this study attempts to improve the aquacrop model for directly simulating nitrogen stress factor meanwhile the soil nitrogen dynamic module is developed and coupled into the improved aquacrop model in order to fully simulate the effects of soil nitrogen content on crop growth and et understanding above physical processes of crop growth and soil water and fertilizer dynamic offers an opportunity to identify appropriate irrigation and fertilizer schedules bennett et al 1989 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a c there are two typical and effective methods setting up a series of irrigation and fertilization treatments for experiments and simulating with crop models yan et al 2021 lu et al 2021 however the limitations of the two approaches are also obvious that it is impossible to test in all irrigation and fertilization schedules rötter et al 2012 mabhaudhi et al 2014 and both the approaches encounter the difficulty on balancing conflicting objectives in agricultural considerations the multi objective programming mop is a useful tool for finding combinations of decision variables to achieve optimal objectives and draw up the proper schedules wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 there are some studies that have got water and fertilizer application during the whole growth period by mop liu et al 2019 and some studies that have adopted the simulation optimization framework to obtain only irrigation schedules containing amount and timing mandal et al 2020 liu and yang 2021 the results can provide references for crop irrigation and fertilization but cannot meet the requirements of precision agriculture due to incomplete farmland management therefore the integration of mop and crop models with nitrogen module is desired to obtain more accurate irrigation and fertilizer schedules in summary the aim of this study is to develop a framework for joint simulation optimization of irrigation and fertilizer schedules jsoifs by the improving aquacrop model and w n jensen model coupling with an optimization model firstly in order to accurately simulate et and yield under water and nitrogen stress we modified the calculation approach of nitrogen stress factor in aquacrop model combining with w n jensen model which is used to get the yield secondly with the objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency and limited water and nitrogen resources as constraints an optimization model nesting with the improved model and w n jensen model was established to get the scientific field water and fertilizer management

ideal solution topsis to obtain the optimal irrigation and fertilizer strategies 2 1 field experimental and data collection the measured data were collected from ran et al 2018 and wang 2021 both experiments were conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province 37 52 n 102 50 e elevation 1581 m northwest china the region has a typical temperate continental arid climate with average annual rainfall 164 mm average annual evaporation 2000 mm the underground water is buried at a depth of more

shown as a table in the study of wang 2021 ring knife of 100 cm3 was used to obtain θ fc k and ρ d before planting and after harvest to collect more detail and accurate soil water holding characteristics information measurement depth of 1 m was divided into five layers of 20 cm and 3 samples were taken from each layer in addition θ wp was the soil water content corresponding to soil water potential of 15 bar that measured from soil moisture characteristic curve obtained by centrifugal method richards and weaver 1943 the first two year consecutive experiment was done by ran et al 2018 from 2013 to 2014 to illustrate how deficit irrigation can affect the growth and yield of seed maize in 2013 there were 3 treatments including w1 w2 and w3 which referred to that irrigation happened if soil water content dropped to 65 70 55 60 45 50 of field capacity respectively in 2014 there were 4 treatments including ck iv3 iv2 ir2 which were full irrigation irrigation three times at the vegetative stage irrigation two times at the vegetative stage and irrigation two times at the reproductive stage respectively border irrigation was adopted as the irrigation method the irrigation time was consistent with local the experiment was repeated three times and all the plots having an area of 86 8 m2 12 4 m 7 0 m were randomly distributed the plots were separated by ridges with the height of 0 3 m and the width of 0 5 m as buffer zones and the plants in the plots were 1 m away from each ridge for protection the details of this experiment was displayed at ran et al 2018 the measured data involved canopy cover cc and average soil water content swc in 1 m soil layer because of the maximum rooting depth of 1 m ran et al 2018 cc was calculated by empirical formula of cc 1

by time domain reflectometer trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany calibrated by oven drying method at the depth of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm every seven day the data of cc and swc were shown as figures in the study of ran et al 2018 and we have got the data by the getdata software evapotranspiration et this study used was calculated by soil water balance when swc and precipitation were obtained ignoring the groundwater recharge due to the deep groundwater depth deep percolation and surface runoff were negligible because the upper limit of irrigation was θ fc at the experiment the second experiment by wang 2021 aimed to investigate the coupling effect of water and nitrogen on yield of seed maize there were 22 treatments during 2017 with different levels of irrigation and nitrogen application ck the amount of irrigation is i was the full irrigation treatment s1 and s3 refer to that when the seed maize is at the seedling stage and tasseling stage respectively the deficit irrigation is triggered and the amount of water for deficit irrigation is determined as 75 i w1 and 50 i w2 irrigation occurred every 10 days with drip irrigation as the irrigation method and i was determined by the crop water requirement k c et 0 where k c refers to crop coefficient and the values were 0 33 0 9 1 11 and 1 02 of seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages respectively according wang 2021 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 and n7 refer to the nitrogen application of 0 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 kg n ha during the whole growth period the treatment containing w1 is only s1w1n4 40 of the total nitrogen application is applied before sowing and 60 is added proportionally at each growth stage seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages are 0 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 2 respectively this experiment was repeated three times and all the plots with the area of 4 8 46 m2 were randomly distributed besides a protection zone of 1 6 46 m2 was set up between each plot the details of this experiment was displayed at wang 2021 lai dry above ground biomass grain yield soil water content and soil mineral nitrogen at the beginning and end of growth period were measured swc were collected by portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 usa calibrated by oven drying method at the depth of 0 100 cm with the interval of 10 cm the calculation method of cc and et was the same as that of the previous experiment deep percolation and surface runoff were ignored because the sum of irrigation and precipitation was less than field water capacity at 1 m soil layer the dry biomass was measured by drying fresh at 80 until the weight is constant soil mineral nitorgen including soil nitrate and anomia were measured by flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 usa at the depth of 0 100 cm with the interval of 10 cm the data of grain yield et and soil mineral nitrogen were presented in the form of table in the study of wang 2021 additionally the data of cc and biomass were shown as figures and we have got the data by the same software 2 2 the description of aquacrop aquacrop as a water driven crop model was created by fao which combines simplicity with effectiveness raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 in this model evapotranspiration is separated into soil evaporation e and crop transpiration tr tr is a critical parameter for the reason that it determines the simulation accuracy of biomass and yield this crop model obtained tr by canopy cover growth which can be divided into three stages canopy development maximum canopy cover and canopy decline when the green canopy appears and grows quantification formulas in aquacrop are displayed as follows 1 c c c c 0 e t c g c a d j w h e n c c c c x 2 c c x 0 25 c c x 2 c c 0 e t c g c a d j w h e n c c c c x 2 where cc 0 is initial cc and refers to the cc when emergence reaches 90 cc x is the maximum canopy cover t is the number of days or growing degree days since seedling emergence d or d cgc adj is canopy growth coefficient adjusted by water and fertilizer stress d 1 or d 1 and can be calculated by eq 2 2 c g c a d j k s exp c g c where cgc is the canopy growth coefficient under optimal situation ks exp is the stress coefficient for canopy expansion and is related to water and fertilizer stress when canopy cover reaches the maximum value it will maintain cc x until canopy begins to wither the last stage

quantitative formula is eq 4 at the canopy growth while it is eq 5 if aging triggers 4 t r k s k r t r x c c e t 0 5 t r k s k r t r x c c c c c c x a e t 0 where ks is the stress coefficient for crop transpiration kr trx is the transpiration coefficient when there is no water stress and cc 100 and the value is close to the basal crop coefficient at mid season cc is adjusted canopy cover due to

evaporation in this model was calculated by the function as follows 7 e 1 c c 1 f m f p m u l c h k e x k r e t 0 where f m is the adjustment factor affected by the types of mulch and it is close to 1 when the mulch is made by plastic f p mulch is the percentage of the total area covered by mulch ke x stands for maximum soil evaporation coefficient when the soil is full wet and there is no shelter of soil surface kr refers to the evaporation reduction coefficient dry above ground biomass bio mg ha can be obtained by eq 8 8 b i o k s w p w p t r e t 0 where wp refers to normalized crop biomass water productivity mg ha ks wp is the fertilizer coefficient stress for water productivity finally yield is set in proportion to bio eq 9 9 y f h i h i 0 b i o where y is the simulated grain yield mg ha hi 0 is reference harvest index f hi is the adjustment coefficient of hi 0 in this model for the calculation process of fertilizer stress the aquacrop model simulates it through a semi quantitative method to be specific this model does not have the nutrient dynamics module instead it provides the option for users to set how much the fertilizer affects the crop growth finally this option determines the fertilizer stress coefficients in the different subprocesses including canopy growth crop transpiration and biomass formation 2 3 improvement of fertilizer module for et in aquacrop model 2 3 1 quantification of nitrogen stress and nitrogen uptake of plants previous studies proposed that the nitrogen stress on crops could be reflected through shoot nitrogen concentration jones 1983 rahimikhoob et al 2021 thus actual critical and minimum shoot nitrogen concentration n act n c and n cmin were introduced into aquacrop model to describe the nitrogen stress ks f plant shoot nitrogen concentration is defined as the quotient of shoot nitrogen content and bio when n act is greater than n c crops are not subjected to nitrogen stress ks f 1 crops do not grow if n act is less than n cmin ks f 0 therefore instead of a constant that is defined in aquacrop model ks f will be varied during the whole growth stage due to the input of nitrogen and soil nitrogen dynamics and can

ratios of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the soil are the same there is no mineral nitrogen that can be taken up by plants when soil mineral nitrogen is less than 16 kg n ha because of soil

jones 1983 2 3 2 the soil nitrogen dynamic to describe the soil nitrogen dynamic the soil nitrogen balance need to be taken into account including nitrogen application ammonia volatilization denitrification mineralization plants absorption and leaching in dry farmland of arid areas ammonia volatilization and denitrification are so weak that they can be ignored thus the soil nitrogen content can be described as follows 17 n s j 1 n s j n min j n f j n u p j n d p j where j is the time step and refers to day in this study n s j is soil mineral nitrogen content kg n ha n min j n f j

dp is deep percolation mm swc is soil water content mm z is root layer depth cm mineralization is related to soil organic carbon soc and nitrogen son content soil water and temperature conditions and

determined by temperature liang et al 2016 2 4 using w n jensen model to simulate the grain yield jensen model is a common method to estimate crop yield due to its simplicity and accuracy w n jensen model was developed by wang et al 2021c to overcome the defect that jensen model cannot quantify the response of yield to nitrogen application and background soil mineral nitrogen in detail the modified jensen model takes the impact of nitrogen on water stress sensitivity in different growth stages into account therefore the application of jensen model can be promoted in irrigation and fertilizer management its expression is as follows 21 y n y a y m b 0 b 1 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 b 2 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 2 i 1 n e t a i e t m i n t c n 0 n m i c n 0 λ w i where i is the ith growth

that can be used by crops 2 5 calibration and verification we used ran s results ran et al 2018 to obtain the water related parameters then nitrogen related parameters were calibrated and water related parameters were further verified by cc bio et and y n by wang s experiments data wang 2021 in order to be representative we chose et of the experiments in the study of ran et al 2018 in 2013 to calibrate crop growth parameters phenological parameters and water related parameters and the data of the experiments in 2014 were used to test the performance of the improved aquacrop model in simulating full and deficit irrigation at different growth stages meanwhile cc bio and et of ckn1 ckn4 s1w2n1 and s3w2n4 treatments in the study of wang 2021 were obtained to get the parameters related to nitrogen and the remaining data were used to verify the validity of improved aquacrop under the condition of nitrogen stress also all the data in 2017 were used to verify the validity of the previously obtained water related parameters the performances of cc bio et at different periods and the whole growth season simulated by aquacrop and the improved aquacrop under water and nitrogen stress and the grain yield by aquacrop model and w n jensen model were measured by the following statistic indicators coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean

ef are close to 1 and rmse and nrmse are close to 0 the simulation results are more accurate and acceptable 2 6 optimization model development 2 6 1 objectives and constrictions to obtain the properest irrigation and fertilizer schedules of seed maize an optimization model was established with two objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency wue based on the improved aquacrop model therein the yield of seed maize was calculated by w n jensen model sixty scenarios were set with total available water iwt from 50 to 300 mm at intervals of 50 mm total available nitrogen nt 0 50 100 200 and 300 kg n ha initial soil mineral nitrogen n 0 50 and 200 kg n ha meanwhile the initial soil water content was set as 90 θ fc to simulate the farmers in study area irrigating their crops before sowing to ensure emergence the irrigation interval is set to 10 days meteorological data from 2017 as a typical year normal year was used in the model fig a1 23a max f 1 y a y m b 0 b 1 n t c n 0 n m

and n s1 are the initial soil water and mineral nitrogen content respectively swc and n 0 are the value of swc 1 and n s1 respectively which were changed in different scenarios iw it and n fit are the amount of irrigation mm and nitrogen kg n ha application each time respectively i max and n max are the available amount of irrigation mm and nitrogen kg n ha respectively σ i refers to the ratio of nitrogen application to nt at each growth stage and the values of seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages are 0 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 2 respectively consistent with the second experimental settings the optimization model assumes that all the fertilizer is applied in the first period at the ith growth stage so iw it and nt are decision variables in this study 2 6 2 solution of the optimization model the optimization model was solved by nsga ⅱ which is useful for multi objective optimization model deb and goel 2001 therein the numbers of individuals are set as 100 the maximum generation maxgen takes 500 the steps are as follows fig 4 1 initialize population and set the number of chromosomes based on decision variables 2 input the individual population into the optimization model to obtain the values of objectives 3 grade parent individuals by a non dominated sorting method and generate children individuals by crossover and mutation 4 create a new population by combining and using fast non dominated sorting the parent and children individuals 5 judge whether convergence criteria are met if not repeat steps 2 4 otherwise stop calculation and output the values of the objectives and decision variables these decision variables are pareto optimal solution sets and their corresponding objective values constitute the pareto frontier through the solution mentioned above the pareto frontier which contains 100 schemes due to 100 individuals at nsga ⅱ was obtained under each scenario but only one can be chosen in the whole growth stage therefore topsis approach for multi criteria decision making was used in this study to determine the proper one to meet the decision makers expectation zavadskas et al 2016 3 results 3 1 parameterization and performance of the improved aquacrop model parameter values of the improved aquacrop model are presented in table 1 firstly the simulated values of cc and et under different irrigation treatments are depicted in fig 5 which does not show the simulation of the improved model due to principle and consistent parameters it indicates that the trend of cc simulated by the model was consistent with that of the actual crop growth the indicators used to evaluate the simulation effectiveness of the model included r 2 rmse nrmse ef for cc their values were 0 945 6 61 9 2 and 0 936 respectively table 2 meanwhile the model estimated et acceptable for all irrigation treatments with r 2 rmse nrmse ef of 0 855 17 9 mm 25 7 and 0 845 the results show that the improved model has acceptable accuracy for all irrigation treatments therein regardless of et or cc the simulation accuracy in 2014 is better than that in 2013 it can be explained by the fact that more rain alleviates the effects of water stress on crop phenology so that the simulated data are closer to the measured ones secondly based on water and nitrogen treatments in 2017 nitrogen related parameters were determined and then the performance of the improved model under scenarios of simultaneous changes in water and nitrogen was tested by estimating cc bio et at different periods and the whole growth season and yield however it should be noted the simulation accuracy under high nitrogen stress cannot be guaranteed due to lack of description of crop responses to high nitrogen stress therefore we analyzed all the simulation results and those excluding crops subjected to high nitrogen stress 6 treatments including n6 and n7 respectively for cc fig 6 taking n1 n4 and n7 treatments as examples there is a high coincidence between simulated and actual trend with the value of r 2 rmse nrmse and ef are 0 973 and 0 964 5 42 and 6 99 16 9 and 21 8 0 970 and 0 951 for the original model and the improved model respectively the improved model performs better than the original model if ignoring the data of high nitrogen treatments for bio fig 7 r 2 rmse nrmse and ef are 0 934 and 0 925 1 92 mg ha and 2 04 mg ha 18 08 and 19 20 0 931 and 0 922 for the original model and the improved model respectively meanwhile the performance between the original model and the improved model does not have significant difference when the plants suffer nitrogen deficiency stress or are in a suitable nitrogen environment for et at different time periods fig 8 the simulation results show that compared with the original model the value of r 2 and ef of all treatments with the improved model have increased by 9 6 and 10 9 while rmse and nrmse have reduced by 10 7 and 11 3 respectively when we removed the results of high nitrogen treatments and analyzed the rest of the data the simulation accuracy has been significantly improved with the further increase of r 2 and ef by 10 1 and 14 0 and another 16 2 and 17 3 drop in rmse and nrmse the results provide the evidence that the improved method is effective and practicable especially when nitrogen is deficient furthermore for et during the whole growth season the improved aquacrop has 12 7 and 3 treatments with errors within 5 between 5 and 10 and between 10 and 15 respectively while the original model 11 8 and 3 treatments table 3 similarly we eliminated et under high nitrogen stress and the number of treatments with the errors within the range above became 10 4 and 2 as table 4 and fig 9 show with the increase of r 2 and ef from 0 244 to 0 742 and from 0 238 to 0 995 respectively for high nitrogen stress the semi quantitative approach is still the more appropriate in a word the improved model can simulate et accurately when nitrogen stress is not present and crops suffer from nitrogen deficit stress for yield we used the w n jensen model instead of the product of hi and biomass because of the low r 2 of 0 004 as shown in table 4 there are 7 7 4 and 4 treatments with errors within 5 between 5 and 10 between 10 and 15 greater than 15 respectively table 3 on one hand hi does not change in aquacrop model when crops are subjected to different levels of nitrogen stress but the w n jensen model does on the other hand the w n jensen model has been proved to be suitable for the yield simulation of seed maize in the study area and the parameters are available from wang et al 2021c we can see that there are 11 8 0 and 3 treatments with errors within the range above respectively and r 2 was improved to 0 641 with w n jensen model fig 9 compared with the results of aquacrop model simulation accuracy of yield has been improved notably and can be acceptable the final mineral nitrogen residue was used to determine whether the improved model could be applied to simulating nitrogen dynamics in soil crop systems fig 10 shows that it can be predicted well under all nitrogen treatments with r 2 rmse nrmse and ef of 0 891 29 62 kg n ha 11 22 and 0 990 which suggests that nitrogen taken up by the plants can be largely predicted accurately in summary the improved approach combining with w n jensen model can obtain the more accurate crop growth process et and yield and can be used to work out irrigation and fertilizer schedules for its accuracy and feasibility 3 2 optimization results 3 2 1 yield water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue fig 11 and fig 12 show the yield and wue of all scenarios we can see that the yield is getting better when available water and nitrogen increased until they reach 200 mm and 150 kg n ha respectively however wue will become lower with the increase of available water and the change of available nitrogen from 0 to 50 kg n ha while it remains in a relatively stable value when available nitrogen varies above 50 kg n ha it should be noted that when there is no nitrogen that can be used during the whole growth period the yield and wue will maintain constant no matter how the water availability changes at an extreme nitrogen deficient environment the yield of seed maize cannot be improved significantly even if the available water increases therefore the topsis chooses the irrigation schedule of the smallest irrigation water to get higher wue yield grows rapidly as available nitrogen increases from 0 to 50 kg n ha leading to more water consumption to tradeoff the compromise between yield and wue the schedules of more yield and less wue are selected by topsis for nue fig 13 the greater available water results in larger nue because of the positive response of yield to water application meanwhile nue changes when available nitrogen is set to 50 and 100 kg n ha while it stays the same all the time regardless of the continuous increase of available nitrogen with high available water nue is reduced with the increase of available nitrogen but the opposite is true if there was less available water this phenomena can be explained by the following reason the higher nitrogen application will improve the rate of the increase in yield under low available water however when the plants get enough water the rise of yield may not be apparent in case of larger available nitrogen initial soil mineral nitrogen influences yield wue and nue the greater initial soil mineral nitrogen leads to greater yield wue and nue however this phenomenon becomes unobvious with the increase of available water and nitrogen therefore the analysis concentrates on the comparatively small available water and nitrogen the scenarios of 100 mm of available water and 50 or 100 kg n ha of available nitrogen are worthy of particular attention yield and nue are improved greatly under 200 kg n ha of initial soil mineral nitrogen compared with 50 kg n ha that is because the greater fertilizer nitrogen demand of the plants can be met partly by the mineral nitrogen in soil the higher initial soil mineral nitrogen provides an environment conducive to plants growth especially when water and nitrogen supplies are insufficient however no matter what the initial soil mineral nitrogen is it s impossible for the plants to grow normally if water or nitrogen are extremely scarce more available water and nitrogen can make up for this deficiency 3 2 2 the optimal irrigation and fertilization schedules the variation trend of water and nitrogen application is depicted in fig 14 the amount of water and nitrogen application will increase correspondingly with the increase of available water and nitrogen to get more wue except the scenarios of 0 kg n ha of available nitrogen when the available water is less than 150 mm the water application is equal to the available water to meet the plants demand only the scenario 100 mm and 50 kg n ha of available water and nitrogen is a special case the water will not completely exhaust because the insufficient nitrogen leads to slow growth of yield with the increase of water application and wue reduced instead if there is too much irrigation however if the available water is so much that yield will raise to a great degree the water consumption will increase sharply even exceeding that of the high available nitrogen scenarios as the results of the scenarios of 150 300 mm available water shows such a result implies that high water application can ensure yield and wue in the case of mild nitrogen deficiency that is also the reason why 1 when the initial soil mineral nitrogen is 50 kg n ha the water consumption of 100 kg n ha available nitrogen scenarios is larger than that of 50 kg n ha with high available water 200 300 mm while the opposite is the case when the initial soil mineral nitrogen is 200 kg n ha 2 the water application of these scenarios is more than that of the scenarios with high available nitrogen in addition it is a remarkable fact that when the available water and initial soil mineral nitrogen are 150 mm and 200 kg n ha respectively the nitrogen application reaches the highest value compared with other scenarios when there is sufficient available nitrogen more usage of nitrogen can improve yield and wue if mild water stress happens for the irrigation schedules fig 15 we analyzed the scenarios of 50 100 and 200 kg n ha of available nitrogen and 50 100 150 and 200 mm of available water respectively the water is allocated into the tasseling stage even though the jointing stage needed more water that is because the tasseling stage is the critical stage for the seed maize to form yield and water stress in this stage produces more severe reduction of yield than in other stages however there are still some differences in water allocation among varied available and initial soil mineral nitrogen when the available nitrogen is small more water will be allocated to tasseling stage with the increase of available water as there is more available nitrogen the water allocation is more dispersed that is it is allocated at each growth stage the reason is that more nitrogen makes the yield more sensitive to water stress at each growth stage in sum the water and nitrogen application of all scenarios do not exceed 200 mm and 150 kg n ha respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness and limitations of the model improvement the simulation results show that the improvement is effective though simulation accuracy of cc and bio do not improve significantly the accuracy of the et simulation by shoot nitrogen concentration is higher than that of the semi quantitative simulation furthermore the method proposed in this study can avoid the users subjectivity and experience to a certain extent by directly considering the soil nitrogen background and nitrogen application so it has better applicability some studies have shown that the aquacrop model can simulate et and yield with small errors under different nitrogen treatments adeboye et al 2021 it is inconsistent with the results of this study due to the different crops and initial soil nitrogen contents however this study has shown that the aquacrop overestimated et under nitrogen deficit stress the main source of errors is that the aquacrop model defaults that the effect of nitrogen stress on the whole growth period is the same in fact the fertilization interval also greatly affects et jooyban and moosavi 2012 which can be reflected in the improved model the w n jensen model was used to simulate yield large errors of yield simulated by aquacrop happens when the nitrogen stress appears because the hi should change in this situation instead of not responding to nitrogen instead w n jensen model not only quantifies the overall effects of different nitrogen application on yield but also reflects the changes of water sensitivity at different growth stages with the amount of nitrogen however et is overestimated by the improved model under high nitrogen stress on the one hand over application of nitrogen will increase the concentration of soil solution lead to the rise of soil osmotic potential and prevent the root system from absorbing water thus the crop growth yield and wue are cut down kang et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 on the other hand if nitrogen is applied too much the growth period will be prolonged and the cell walls will become thinner resulting in susceptibility to mechanical damage and diseases long et al 2000 wu et al 2019 li and li 2021 this also has an adverse effect on yield however these two aspects are really complicated to express especially in a model like the aquacrop that requires both simplicity and effectiveness in addition there is a limitation that we only used the 2017 experimental data for the calibration and validation of the parameters of the nitrogen module the applicability of the model cannot be verified under different climatic conditions 2017 was a normal year that is the climate like this year often occurs in the study area therefore we infer that our improvement can be used in actual production in most cases future study should be devoted to verifying the generalizability of the model under extreme conditions n c is a critical parameter in nitrogen module and calculated according to phenology in this study there is another method to obtain it some studies suggest that n c is related to dry matter mass or leaf area index and can be quantified by critical nitrogen dilution curve justes et al 1994 plenet and lemaire 1999 lemaire et al 2007 meanwhile nitrogen nutrition index nni describes the ratio of n act to n c of the plant so that it can judge the nutritional status of plants however the parameters of critical nitrogen dilution curve should be calibrated but we do not have enough data moreover stockdale et al 1997 worried that the relationship may be broken down under stresses other than nitrogen stress soil mineral nitrogen at the end of the growth period can be simulated precisely the nitrogen dynamic of soil is described by a simple function of nitrogen balance ignoring the process of convection and diffusion to minimize the increase in model complexity denitrification is neglected in the process for the reason that the phenomena does not dominate in the drylands of arid areas chen et al 2020a moreover nitrogen mineralization in the model is expressed by empirical formula which can simply describe the influence of soil mineral nitrogen background value and nitrogen application the calculation method was only a compromise mineralization rate is related to soil organic carbon content and soil organic nitrogen content soil water and temperature conditions and soil mineral nitrogen content liang et al 2016 a detailed description of soil nitrogen dynamics is necessary if more mechanistic and accurate results are required although the improved model is not good for simulating the effect of over application of nitrogen on et it is still suitable for irrigation and fertilizer management in arid areas there are two reasons 1 the yield is calculated by w n jensen model which reflects the yield reduction caused by excessive fertilization 2 maximizing the seed maize yield as an objective of the optimization model can avoid choosing the scheme which contains too much fertilizer it should be noted that the semi quantitative approach is still the better choice under high nitrogen stress for the reason that it has better simulation performance for cc bio and et 4 2 implications for irrigation and fertilizer schedules proper irrigation and fertilization schedules are important to ensure crop yield some studies have reported that the increase of nitrogen will improve water use efficiency with mild or no water stress while water stress is severe the opposite is true that is it will lead to further decrease of water use efficiency di paolo and rinaldi 2008 tang et al 2017 thus the coupling effect of water and fertilizer needs to be taken into account when drawing up irrigation and fertilization schedules gheysari et al 2009 their conclusions can support the results of this study in keeping with the actual situation the initial soil water content was set to 90 of field capacity in reality initial soil water content is an important factor affecting yield and water use efficiency to take pre sowing irrigation into account some studies set the initial soil water content to 50 of field capacity the results show that when the amount of irrigation is more than 300 mm the yield and wue maintain constant and are consistent with the results of this study if the irrigation amount before sowing is 100 mm wang et al 2020b the initial soil mineral nitrogen also influences the yield of seed maize in low fertility soils irrigation should be concentrated during critical growth periods meanwhile fertilization is as critical as irrigation because nitrogen application effectively guarantee yield and wue conversely in high fertility soils irrigation should be dispersed throughout the growth period compared with the local irrigation and fertilizer schedule wue and nue have been improved through the optimization model li et al 2013 such results reveal that the excess water and nitrogen have been put into the actual seed maize production which not only causes the waste of resources but also has a negative effect on environment however there may be some irrationality if the results of this optimization model are incorporated into larger temporal and spatial scales for well irrigation districts the irrigation schedule can be realized nevertheless for the irrigation districts using surface water such an irrigation schedule may need further adjustments in reality because the model does not consider the time and quantity of water transported by the canal system this is also a point of further study moreover border irrigation and furrow irrigation under mulch which consume more water and are prone to nitrogen leaching are still the main irrigation methods in study area it will take time for water saving irrigation techniques to implement because of the cost including financial and manpower resources and the technical problems that might arise in the process 5 conclusion in this study jsoifs was proposed with the consideration of conflicting objectives and water nitrogen dynamic simulation in soil plant system under the scenarios of varied available water and nitrogen application and initial soil mineral nitrogen in the aquacrop model the soil nitrogen dynamic module was coupled and the nitrogen stress factor was modified by the introduction of the shoot actual critical and minimum nitrogen concentration besides w n jensen model with the thought of the nitrogen effect on yield and water sensitivity was adopted to estimate yield an optimization model was established by integrating the improved aquacrop model w n jensen model and multi objective programming with the objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency the nsga ⅱ was used to solve the model and the satisfying schedule under each scenario was selected by topsis the advantage of this framework is that it can provide effective and reasonable water and fertilizer schedules under different external conditions on the basis of ensuring yield and resource utilization efficiency the verification results of the improved aquacrop model for seed maize show that canopy cover and et can be simulated precisely whether or not water stress occurs under the condition of nitrogen deficient stress the simulation accuracy of the et has been improved greatly and the simulation performace of yield using the w n jensen model is better than that of aquacrop yet the simulation error is large when high nitrogen stress is triggered the semi quantitative approach to simulate et is still the better choice under high nitrogen stress sixty scenarios were set up to seek the optimal irrigation and fertilizer schedules the results of optimization model indicate that all the available water and nitrogen and initial soil mineral nitrogen influence yield wue and nue the coupling effect of water and nitrogen should also be noted reinforcing water supply can ensure yield and wue under circumstance of slight nitrogen deficient stress simultaneously increasing nitrogen application can improve yield and wue if mild water stress happens the high initial soil mineral nitrogen provides an environment conducive to the growth of plants especially when water and nitrogen supplies are insufficient low soil nutrients require water distribution at critical stage while water should be allocated to the whole growth period in high soil fertilizer when water and nitrogen application are 150 200 mm and 100 150 kg n ha respectively yield wue and nue can be maintained at a high level however more complex soil nitrogen dynamics crop growth under high nitrogen stress and the combination of irrigation scheduling with canal system management need to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement

9568,water and fertilizer management strategy profoundly influences crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiency in this study a framework for joint simulation optimization of irrigation and fertilizer schedules jsoifs was established by coupling the improved aquacrop model w n jensen model and multi objective programming firstly the aquacrop model was modified to simulate evapotranspiration et under nitrogen stress through introducing the concept of shoot actual critical and minimal nitrogen concentration the accuracy and applicability of the improved aquacrop model to simulate et were verified taking seed maize of shiyanghe river basin as a case on the basis an optimization model with the objective of maximum yield calculated by w n jensen model and water use efficiency was developed under the scenarios of different levels of available water and nitrogen and initial soil mineral nitrogen content results showed that the improved model can simulate canopy cover cc and et well with and without water stress meanwhile the precision for cc biomass et and yield of seed maize can be guaranteed when water and nitrogen stress coexist it indicated that the improved model can be used for irrigation and fertilizer management the optimal irrigation and fertilizer schedules pointed out that the irrigation and nitrogen application and initial soil mineral nitrogen all have significant effects on yield in low fertility soils irrigation should be concentrated during tasseling stage and fertilization is as critical as irrigation conversely in high fertility soils irrigation should be dispersed throughout the growth period water and nitrogen use efficiency have been promoted compared with the status quo the recommended water and nitrogen application for seed maize are 150 200 mm and 100 150 kg n ha respectively in study area with the mean soil mineral nitrogen of 182 kg n ha the improvement of et simulation performance of aquacrop model under simultaneous stress of water and nitrogen provides convenience for achieving precise crop management meanwhile the jsoifs framework realizes the efficient irrigation and fertilizer schedules in arid areas improves the resources use rate and is equally applicable to other regions with the same goals graphical abstract ga1 keywords optimization irrigation and fertilizer management aquacrop multi objective programming 1 introduction water shortage is one of the key factors that afflict agricultural production in arid areas due to the heavy dependence on irrigation kang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 meanwhile fertilizer is a critical input to ensure yield wang et al 2018 orebo et al 2021 ordóñez et al 2021 thus many farmers believe that the crops have to be supplied with enough water and fertilizer to achieve high yield wang et al 2019 however excessive irrigation and fertilization will lead to the decline of crop yield and quality resource waste and environmental pollution so that it will impact the profitability of the farmer behera et al 2013 albornoz 2016 guo et al 2021 with population growth and climate change food security and sustainable development are becoming the focus of people s attention hence reducing the use of resources and improving crop yield have turned into vital tasks at present geerts and raes 2009 scientific and rational management of farmland water and fertilizer is an effective means to solve this problem recognizing and quantifying the response of crop growth and yield on soil water and nutrition content is the basis and a key part in water and fertilizer management the water fertilizer production functions e g modified jensen model and the quadratic form function are commonly used to directly describe the relationship of irrigation and fertilizer application to yield estimation because of the high accuracy shan et al 2019 chen et al 2020b however the simplicity of these equations means that they can hardly describe the physical processes of crop growth and the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen limiting their application in practical production nguyen et al 2017 in addition to better represent the two processes and manage irrigation and fertilization a series of crop models based on different mechanisms were developed and have been adopted around the world including wofost daisy dndc dssat aquacrop csm ixim whcns models and so on vries 1989 hansen et al 1990 li et al 1992 jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 lizaso et al 2011 liang et al 2016 however they do not always give accurate estimates of crop yields when water or nitrogen stress occur due to the incomplete physical processes and the amplification of uncertainty in the nested calculation wang et al 2020a 2020b coupling the mechanism of process based model with the high accuracy of experienced model the regional applicability and accuracy of the model can be further improved wang et al 2021b therefore combining the water fertilizer production function and crop models is a promising alternative for better precisely yield estimation in the process actual crop evapotranspiration is very necessary to accurately estimate because it is closely related to crop irrigation management and is an important parameter for yield estimation in some models like jensen model and aquacrop there are many methods to simulate it such as shuttleworth wallace and tseb models these models have the common problems about complexity of structure the need to input a large number of parameters and different parameter standards vanuytrecht et al 2014 adeboye et al 2019 the aquacrop model is a water driven model developed by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 and the approach to calculate et that this model uses is two step crop coefficient reference et k c et 0 based on canopy cover cc which can balance simplicity with accuracy therefore the superiority of the aquacrop model make it more prominent in the promotion application meanwhile the feasibility of this model has been verified in a variety of crops and regions stricevic et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 linker et al 2016 but there is one thing to be aware of the aquacrop model adopts in the semi quantitative method to evaluate the fertilizer stress in detail the effect of soil nutrient on crop growth is expressed as the percentage of relevant parameters based on full irrigation and fertilization van gaelen et al 2015 akumaga et al 2017 that is it cannot directly simulate the response of crop to fertilizer in the light of plant fertilizer demand and soil nutrition content to sum up the fertilizer stress in this model maybe experiential and inaccurate some studies have shown that the model had better performance under the condition of no fertilizer stress compared to when fertilizer stress appears adeboye et al 2021 rahimikhoob et al 2021 failure to accurately quantify response of crop growth and et to fertilization may result in improper resources management schemes and consequently lead to unforeseeable loss to government departments or farmland managers who use this model to close these gaps this study attempts to improve the aquacrop model for directly simulating nitrogen stress factor meanwhile the soil nitrogen dynamic module is developed and coupled into the improved aquacrop model in order to fully simulate the effects of soil nitrogen content on crop growth and et understanding above physical processes of crop growth and soil water and fertilizer dynamic offers an opportunity to identify appropriate irrigation and fertilizer schedules bennett et al 1989 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021a c there are two typical and effective methods setting up a series of irrigation and fertilization treatments for experiments and simulating with crop models yan et al 2021 lu et al 2021 however the limitations of the two approaches are also obvious that it is impossible to test in all irrigation and fertilization schedules rötter et al 2012 mabhaudhi et al 2014 and both the approaches encounter the difficulty on balancing conflicting objectives in agricultural considerations the multi objective programming mop is a useful tool for finding combinations of decision variables to achieve optimal objectives and draw up the proper schedules wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 there are some studies that have got water and fertilizer application during the whole growth period by mop liu et al 2019 and some studies that have adopted the simulation optimization framework to obtain only irrigation schedules containing amount and timing mandal et al 2020 liu and yang 2021 the results can provide references for crop irrigation and fertilization but cannot meet the requirements of precision agriculture due to incomplete farmland management therefore the integration of mop and crop models with nitrogen module is desired to obtain more accurate irrigation and fertilizer schedules in summary the aim of this study is to develop a framework for joint simulation optimization of irrigation and fertilizer schedules jsoifs by the improving aquacrop model and w n jensen model coupling with an optimization model firstly in order to accurately simulate et and yield under water and nitrogen stress we modified the calculation approach of nitrogen stress factor in aquacrop model combining with w n jensen model which is used to get the yield secondly with the objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency and limited water and nitrogen resources as constraints an optimization model nesting with the improved model and w n jensen model was established to get the scientific field water and fertilizer management strategies 2 methodology the jsoifs framework has four parts fig 1 1 collecting the field experiments data this study needed 2 improving aquacrop through nitrogen stress factor that expressed by actual critical and minimum nitrogen concentration of plant and calibrate and validate the improved model by the experiment data 3 proposing the optimization model to manage irrigation and fertilizer of seed maize 4 solving the optimization model by non dominated sorting genetic algorithms nsga ⅱ under different scenarios and selecting the results by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis to obtain the optimal irrigation and fertilizer strategies 2 1 field experimental and data collection the measured data were collected from ran et al 2018 and wang 2021 both experiments were conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province 37 52 n 102 50 e elevation 1581 m northwest china the region has a typical temperate continental arid climate with average annual rainfall 164 mm average annual evaporation 2000 mm the underground water is buried at a depth of more than 25 m meteorological data which were used to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 by penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 were obtained by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp usa for both experiments fig 2 the mean field capacity θ fc wilting point θ wp saturated soil water content θ sat saturated hydraulic conductivity k and soil dry bulk density ρ d were 0 30 cm3 cm3 0 10 cm3 cm3 0 45 cm3 cm3 26 97 cm d and 1 51 g cm3 according to the two field experiments for the 0 100 cm soil layer with the soil texture of sandy loam the detail soil data was shown as a table in the study of wang 2021 ring knife of 100 cm3 was used to obtain θ fc k and ρ d before planting and after harvest to collect more detail and accurate soil water holding characteristics information measurement depth of 1 m was divided into five layers of 20 cm and 3 samples were taken from each layer in addition θ wp was the soil water content corresponding to soil water potential of 15 bar that measured from soil moisture characteristic curve obtained by centrifugal method richards and weaver 1943 the first two year consecutive experiment was done by ran et al 2018 from 2013 to 2014 to illustrate how deficit irrigation can affect the growth and yield of seed maize in 2013 there were 3 treatments including w1 w2 and w3 which referred to that irrigation happened if soil water content dropped to 65 70 55 60 45 50 of field capacity respectively in 2014 there were 4 treatments including ck iv3 iv2 ir2 which were full irrigation irrigation three times at the vegetative stage irrigation two times at the vegetative stage and irrigation two times at the reproductive stage respectively border irrigation was adopted as the irrigation method the irrigation time was consistent with local the experiment was repeated three times and all the plots having an area of 86 8 m2 12 4 m 7 0 m were randomly distributed the plots were separated by ridges with the height of 0 3 m and the width of 0 5 m as buffer zones and the plants in the plots were 1 m away from each ridge for protection the details of this experiment was displayed at ran et al 2018 the measured data involved canopy cover cc and average soil water content swc in 1 m soil layer because of the maximum rooting depth of 1 m ran et al 2018 cc was calculated by empirical formula of cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6lai 1 2 therein leaf area index lai was leaf area per unit of area leaf area was the sum of the products of the length maximum width and shape factor 0 7 of each leaf swc were collected by time domain reflectometer trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany calibrated by oven drying method at the depth of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 100 cm every seven day the data of cc and swc were shown as figures in the study of ran et al 2018 and we have got the data by the getdata software evapotranspiration et this study used was calculated by soil water balance when swc and precipitation were obtained ignoring the groundwater recharge due to the deep groundwater depth deep percolation and surface runoff were negligible because the upper limit of irrigation was θ fc at the experiment the second experiment by wang 2021 aimed to investigate the coupling effect of water and nitrogen on yield of seed maize there were 22 treatments during 2017 with different levels of irrigation and nitrogen application ck the amount of irrigation is i was the full irrigation treatment s1 and s3 refer to that when the seed maize is at the seedling stage and tasseling stage respectively the deficit irrigation is triggered and the amount of water for deficit irrigation is determined as 75 i w1 and 50 i w2 irrigation occurred every 10 days with drip irrigation as the irrigation method and i was determined by the crop water requirement k c et 0 where k c refers to crop coefficient and the values were 0 33 0 9 1 11 and 1 02 of seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages respectively according wang 2021 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 and n7 refer to the nitrogen application of 0 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 kg n ha during the whole growth period the treatment containing w1 is only s1w1n4 40 of the total nitrogen application is applied before sowing and 60 is added proportionally at each growth stage seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages are 0 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 2 respectively this experiment was repeated three times and all the plots with the area of 4 8 46 m2 were randomly distributed besides a protection zone of 1 6 46 m2 was set up between each plot the details of this experiment was displayed at wang 2021 lai dry above ground biomass grain yield soil water content and soil mineral nitrogen at the beginning and end of growth period were measured swc were collected by portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 usa calibrated by oven drying method at the depth of 0 100 cm with the interval of 10 cm the calculation method of cc and et was the same as that of the previous experiment deep percolation and surface runoff were ignored because the sum of irrigation and precipitation was less than field water capacity at 1 m soil layer the dry biomass was measured by drying fresh at 80 until the weight is constant soil mineral nitorgen including soil nitrate and anomia were measured by flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 usa at the depth of 0 100 cm with the interval of 10 cm the data of grain yield et and soil mineral nitrogen were presented in the form of table in the study of wang 2021 additionally the data of cc and biomass were shown as figures and we have got the data by the same software 2 2 the description of aquacrop aquacrop as a water driven crop model was created by fao which combines simplicity with effectiveness raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 in this model evapotranspiration is separated into soil evaporation e and crop transpiration tr tr is a critical parameter for the reason that it determines the simulation accuracy of biomass and yield this crop model obtained tr by canopy cover growth which can be divided into three stages canopy development maximum canopy cover and canopy decline when the green canopy appears and grows quantification formulas in aquacrop are displayed as follows 1 c c c c 0 e t c g c a d j w h e n c c c c x 2 c c x 0 25 c c x 2 c c 0 e t c g c a d j w h e n c c c c x 2 where cc 0 is initial cc and refers to the cc when emergence reaches 90 cc x is the maximum canopy cover t is the number of days or growing degree days since seedling emergence d or d cgc adj is canopy growth coefficient adjusted by water and fertilizer stress d 1 or d 1 and can be calculated by eq 2 2 c g c a d j k s exp c g c where cgc is the canopy growth coefficient under optimal situation ks exp is the stress coefficient for canopy expansion and is related to water and fertilizer stress when canopy cover reaches the maximum value it will maintain cc x until canopy begins to wither the last stage of canopy development is descripted by eq 3 in this crop model 3 c c c c x 1 0 05 e 3 33 c d c c c x 2 29 t 1 where cdc is canopy decline coefficient d 1 or d 1 t is the number of days or growing degree days after the canopy senescence d or d tr contains two sections according to the development stages of cc and can be obtained based on the climate conditions and crop growth stage the quantitative formula is eq 4 at the canopy growth while it is eq 5 if aging triggers 4 t r k s k r t r x c c e t 0 5 t r k s k r t r x c c c c c c x a e t 0 where ks is the stress coefficient for crop transpiration kr trx is the transpiration coefficient when there is no water stress and cc 100 and the value is close to the basal crop coefficient at mid season cc is adjusted canopy cover due to micro advective influence and the calculation formula is presented as eq 6 a is a parameter which can adjust the transpiration affected by canopy decline 6 c c 1 72 c c c c 2 0 3 c c 3 soil evaporation in this model was calculated by the function as follows 7 e 1 c c 1 f m f p m u l c h k e x k r e t 0 where f m is the adjustment factor affected by the types of mulch and it is close to 1 when the mulch is made by plastic f p mulch is the percentage of the total area covered by mulch ke x stands for maximum soil evaporation coefficient when the soil is full wet and there is no shelter of soil surface kr refers to the evaporation reduction coefficient dry above ground biomass bio mg ha can be obtained by eq 8 8 b i o k s w p w p t r e t 0 where wp refers to normalized crop biomass water productivity mg ha ks wp is the fertilizer coefficient stress for water productivity finally yield is set in proportion to bio eq 9 9 y f h i h i 0 b i o where y is the simulated grain yield mg ha hi 0 is reference harvest index f hi is the adjustment coefficient of hi 0 in this model for the calculation process of fertilizer stress the aquacrop model simulates it through a semi quantitative method to be specific this model does not have the nutrient dynamics module instead it provides the option for users to set how much the fertilizer affects the crop growth finally this option determines the fertilizer stress coefficients in the different subprocesses including canopy growth crop transpiration and biomass formation 2 3 improvement of fertilizer module for et in aquacrop model 2 3 1 quantification of nitrogen stress and nitrogen uptake of plants previous studies proposed that the nitrogen stress on crops could be reflected through shoot nitrogen concentration jones 1983 rahimikhoob et al 2021 thus actual critical and minimum shoot nitrogen concentration n act n c and n cmin were introduced into aquacrop model to describe the nitrogen stress ks f plant shoot nitrogen concentration is defined as the quotient of shoot nitrogen content and bio when n act is greater than n c crops are not subjected to nitrogen stress ks f 1 crops do not grow if n act is less than n cmin ks f 0 therefore instead of a constant that is defined in aquacrop model ks f will be varied during the whole growth stage due to the input of nitrogen and soil nitrogen dynamics and can refer to the expression form of stress factors in aquacrop model as follows 10 k s f 1 e s r e l n f s h a p e 1 e f s h a p e 1 where s rel n refers to the relative nitrogen stress and f shape is the shape factor 11 s r e l n 0 n a c t n c 1 n a c t n c min n c n c min n c min n a c t n c 1 n a c t n c min plant shoot nitrogen concentration depends on the nitrogen actually absorbed by the crop n up kg n ha d which is related to soil mineral nitrogen content and plant demand in other words the nitrogen actually absorbed by the crop is the smaller one of these two values assuming that the ratios of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the soil are the same there is no mineral nitrogen that can be taken up by plants when soil mineral nitrogen is less than 16 kg n ha because of soil adsorption of mineral nitrogen jones and kiniry 1986 12 n u p min n s p l n c c n s 16 kgn ha 0 n s 16 kgn ha where n s is soil mineral nitrogen content kg n ha n spl is the amount of mineral nitrogen that the soil can provide for crops kg n ha d and it rests with roots growth the amount of soil mineral nitrogen and water stress eq 13 jones and kiniry 1986 n cc is crop nitrogen demand kg n ha d whose calculation method refers to the research of jones and kiniry 1986 and can be obtained from eq 14 the nitrogen demand of potential daily biomass growth is calculated from the potential biomass increase and n c this allows n act to exceed n c when actual biomass increase is less than potential biomass increase when n act is greater than n c the plant will take no nitrogen up 13 n s p l 80 r l v k s w 2 1 e 0 03 n s 10 ρ d 14 n c c 10 b i o b n c n a c t 10 δ b p n c where rlv is root length density cm cm3 and it assumed that the daily rlv was variable with crop growth but not adjusted for water and nitrogen stress ks w is water stress ρ d is dry bulk density of soil g cm3 bio b is the cumulative bio of the previous day mg ha δbp is potential bio increase per day mg ha d in addition the n c and n cmin were reported to be related to the crop growth stages that can be expressed in terms of phenology jones 1983 15 n c e 1 52 0 2 p h e n t 16 n c min 1 25 0 2 p h e n t p h e n t 4 0 45 p h e n t 4 where phen is a parameter that depends on crop growth stages and is calculated by growing degree days with the range from 1 to 9 the detail process of its calculation was stated by jones 1983 2 3 2 the soil nitrogen dynamic to describe the soil nitrogen dynamic the soil nitrogen balance need to be taken into account including nitrogen application ammonia volatilization denitrification mineralization plants absorption and leaching in dry farmland of arid areas ammonia volatilization and denitrification are so weak that they can be ignored thus the soil nitrogen content can be described as follows 17 n s j 1 n s j n min j n f j n u p j n d p j where j is the time step and refers to day in this study n s j is soil mineral nitrogen content kg n ha n min j n f j and n dp j are the daily amount of mineralization nitrogen application and leaching respectively kg n ha d therein n dp can be computed by burns equation burns 1980 18 n d p n s d p d p s w c z where dp is deep percolation mm swc is soil water content mm z is root layer depth cm mineralization is related to soil organic carbon soc and nitrogen son content soil water and temperature conditions and soil mineral nitrogen content however this process is so complicated which requires so many parameters thus we simplified it and used empirical formulas to obtain this value in this study for the daily mineralization rate temperature is the major influence factor 19 n min t o t p 1 ln n 0 n f p 2 20 n min α n min t o t where n min tot is total amount of mineralization during growth stage kg n ha n 0 is background soil mineral nitrogen content kg n ha p 1 and p 2 are the coefficients of the fitting curve respectively and p 1 60 54 and p 2 402 7 in this study fig 3 α is the coefficient determined by temperature liang et al 2016 2 4 using w n jensen model to simulate the grain yield jensen model is a common method to estimate crop yield due to its simplicity and accuracy w n jensen model was developed by wang et al 2021c to overcome the defect that jensen model cannot quantify the response of yield to nitrogen application and background soil mineral nitrogen in detail the modified jensen model takes the impact of nitrogen on water stress sensitivity in different growth stages into account therefore the application of jensen model can be promoted in irrigation and fertilizer management its expression is as follows 21 y n y a y m b 0 b 1 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 b 2 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 2 i 1 n e t a i e t m i n t c n 0 n m i c n 0 λ w i where i is the ith growth stage which refers to seeding jointing tasseling filling stages y n is normalized grain yield y a and y m are actual and potential maximum grain yield t ha respectively et ai and et mi are actual and potential maximum evapotranspiration mm respectively nt n m and n 0 are nitrogen application during the whole crop growth period the optimal nitrogen application under full irrigation treatments and initial soil mineral nitrogen i e background soil mineral nitrogen respectively kg n ha n mi is the nitrogen application when the highest yield is obtained under deficit irrigation at ith growth stage 50 ck at experiment two λ wi is water stress sensitivity index of ith growth stage b 0 b 1 and b 2 are the coefficients of quadratic function c is the proportion of background soil mineral nitrogen that can be used by crops 2 5 calibration and verification we used ran s results ran et al 2018 to obtain the water related parameters then nitrogen related parameters were calibrated and water related parameters were further verified by cc bio et and y n by wang s experiments data wang 2021 in order to be representative we chose et of the experiments in the study of ran et al 2018 in 2013 to calibrate crop growth parameters phenological parameters and water related parameters and the data of the experiments in 2014 were used to test the performance of the improved aquacrop model in simulating full and deficit irrigation at different growth stages meanwhile cc bio and et of ckn1 ckn4 s1w2n1 and s3w2n4 treatments in the study of wang 2021 were obtained to get the parameters related to nitrogen and the remaining data were used to verify the validity of improved aquacrop under the condition of nitrogen stress also all the data in 2017 were used to verify the validity of the previously obtained water related parameters the performances of cc bio et at different periods and the whole growth season simulated by aquacrop and the improved aquacrop under water and nitrogen stress and the grain yield by aquacrop model and w n jensen model were measured by the following statistic indicators coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef 22a r 2 k 1 k m k m s k s k 1 k m k m 2 k 1 k s k s 2 2 22b r m s e k 1 k m k s k 2 k 22c n r m s e 100 m k 1 k m k s k 2 k 22d e f 1 k 1 k s k m k 2 k 1 k m k m 2 where k is the sample size m k and s k are measured and simulated values respectively m and s are the mean of measured and simulated values respectively when r 2 and ef are close to 1 and rmse and nrmse are close to 0 the simulation results are more accurate and acceptable 2 6 optimization model development 2 6 1 objectives and constrictions to obtain the properest irrigation and fertilizer schedules of seed maize an optimization model was established with two objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency wue based on the improved aquacrop model therein the yield of seed maize was calculated by w n jensen model sixty scenarios were set with total available water iwt from 50 to 300 mm at intervals of 50 mm total available nitrogen nt 0 50 100 200 and 300 kg n ha initial soil mineral nitrogen n 0 50 and 200 kg n ha meanwhile the initial soil water content was set as 90 θ fc to simulate the farmers in study area irrigating their crops before sowing to ensure emergence the irrigation interval is set to 10 days meteorological data from 2017 as a typical year normal year was used in the model fig a1 23a max f 1 y a y m b 0 b 1 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 b 2 n t c n 0 n m c n 0 2 i 1 n t 1 t i e t a i t t 1 t i e t m i t n t c n 0 n m i c n 0 λ w i 23b max f 2 w u e y a i w t s t 1 boundary condition constraints 23c s w c 1 s w c 23d n s 1 n 0 2

23h n f i t 0 i 1 4 non negative constraints 23i i w i t 0 23j n f i t 0 where i and t are the ith growth stage and the tth period respectively t i is the total periods at the ith growth stage swc 1 and n s1 are the initial soil water and mineral nitrogen content respectively swc and n 0 are the value of swc 1 and n s1 respectively which were changed in different scenarios iw it and n fit are the amount of irrigation mm and nitrogen kg n ha application each time respectively i max and n max are the available amount of irrigation mm and nitrogen kg n ha respectively σ i refers to the ratio of nitrogen application to nt at each growth stage and the values of seeding jointing tasseling and filling stages are 0 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 2 respectively consistent with the second experimental settings the optimization model assumes that all the fertilizer is applied in the first period at the ith growth stage so iw it and nt are decision variables in this study 2 6 2 solution of the optimization model the optimization model was solved by nsga ⅱ which is useful for multi objective optimization model deb and goel 2001 therein the numbers of individuals are set as 100 the maximum generation maxgen takes 500 the steps are as follows fig 4 1 initialize population and set the number of chromosomes based on decision variables 2 input the individual population into the optimization model to obtain the values of objectives 3 grade parent individuals by a non dominated sorting method and generate children individuals by crossover and mutation 4 create a new population by combining and using fast non dominated sorting the parent and children individuals 5 judge whether convergence criteria are met if not repeat steps 2 4 otherwise stop calculation and output the values of the objectives and decision variables these decision variables are pareto optimal solution sets and their corresponding objective values constitute the pareto frontier through the solution mentioned above the pareto frontier which contains 100 schemes due to 100 individuals at nsga ⅱ was obtained under each scenario but only one can be chosen in the whole growth stage therefore topsis approach for multi criteria decision making was used in this study to determine the proper one to meet the decision makers expectation zavadskas et al 2016 3 results 3 1 parameterization and performance of the improved aquacrop model parameter values of the improved aquacrop model are presented in table 1 firstly the simulated values of cc and et under different irrigation treatments are depicted in fig 5 which does not show the simulation of the improved model due to principle and consistent parameters it indicates that the trend of cc simulated by the model was consistent with that of the actual crop growth the indicators used to evaluate the simulation effectiveness of the model included r 2 rmse nrmse ef for cc their values were 0 945 6 61 9 2 and 0 936 respectively table 2 meanwhile the model estimated et acceptable for all irrigation treatments with r 2 rmse nrmse ef of 0 855 17 9 mm 25 7 and 0 845 the results show that the improved model has acceptable accuracy for all irrigation treatments therein regardless of et or cc the simulation accuracy in 2014 is better than that in 2013 it can be explained by the fact that more rain alleviates the effects of water stress on crop phenology so that the simulated data are closer to the measured ones secondly based on water and nitrogen treatments in 2017 nitrogen related parameters were determined and then the performance of the improved model under scenarios of simultaneous changes in water and nitrogen was tested by estimating cc bio et at different periods and the whole growth season and yield however it should be noted the simulation accuracy under high nitrogen stress cannot be guaranteed due to lack of description of crop responses to high nitrogen stress therefore we analyzed all the simulation results and those excluding crops subjected to high nitrogen stress 6 treatments including n6 and n7 respectively for cc fig 6 taking n1 n4 and n7 treatments as examples there is a high coincidence between simulated and actual trend with the value of r 2 rmse nrmse and ef are 0 973 and 0 964 5 42 and 6 99 16 9 and 21 8 0 970 and 0 951 for the original model and the improved model respectively the improved model performs better than the original model if ignoring the data of high nitrogen treatments for bio fig 7 r 2 rmse nrmse and ef are 0 934 and 0 925 1 92 mg ha and 2 04 mg ha 18 08 and 19 20 0 931 and 0 922 for the original model and the improved model respectively meanwhile the performance between the original model and the improved model does not have significant difference when the plants suffer nitrogen deficiency stress or are in a suitable nitrogen environment for et at different time periods fig 8 the simulation results show that compared with the original model the value of r 2 and ef of all treatments with the improved model have increased by 9 6 and 10 9 while rmse and nrmse have reduced by 10 7 and 11 3 respectively when we removed the results of high nitrogen treatments and analyzed the rest of the data the simulation accuracy has been significantly improved with the further increase of r 2 and ef by 10 1 and 14 0 and another 16 2 and 17 3 drop in rmse and nrmse the results provide the evidence that the improved method is effective and practicable especially when nitrogen is deficient furthermore for et during the whole growth season the improved aquacrop has 12 7 and 3 treatments with errors within 5 between 5 and 10 and between 10 and 15 respectively while the original model 11 8 and 3 treatments table 3 similarly we eliminated et under high nitrogen stress and the number of treatments with the errors within the range above became 10 4 and 2 as table 4 and fig 9 show with the increase of r 2 and ef from 0 244 to 0 742 and from 0 238 to 0 995 respectively for high nitrogen stress the semi quantitative approach is still the more appropriate in a word the improved model can simulate et accurately when nitrogen stress is not present and crops suffer from nitrogen deficit stress for yield we used the w n jensen model instead of the product of hi and biomass because of the low r 2 of 0 004 as shown in table 4 there are 7 7 4 and 4 treatments with errors within 5 between 5 and 10 between 10 and 15 greater than 15 respectively table 3 on one hand hi does not change in aquacrop model when crops are subjected to different levels of nitrogen stress but the w n jensen model does on the other hand the w n jensen model has been proved to be suitable for the yield simulation of seed maize in the study area and the parameters are available from wang et al 2021c we can see that there are 11 8 0 and 3 treatments with errors within the range above respectively and r 2 was improved to 0 641 with w n jensen model fig 9 compared with the results of aquacrop model simulation accuracy of yield has been improved notably and can be acceptable the final mineral nitrogen residue was used to determine whether the improved model could be applied to simulating nitrogen dynamics in soil crop systems fig 10 shows that it can be predicted well under all nitrogen treatments with r 2 rmse nrmse and ef of 0 891 29 62 kg n ha 11 22 and 0 990 which suggests that nitrogen taken up by the plants can be largely predicted accurately in summary the improved approach combining with w n jensen model can obtain the more accurate crop growth process et and yield and can be used to work out irrigation and fertilizer schedules for its accuracy and feasibility 3 2 optimization results 3 2 1 yield water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue fig 11 and fig 12 show the yield and wue of all scenarios we can see that the yield is getting better when available water and nitrogen increased until they reach 200 mm and 150 kg n ha respectively however wue will become lower with the increase of available water and the change of available nitrogen from 0 to 50 kg n ha while it remains in a relatively stable value when available nitrogen varies above 50 kg n ha it should be noted that when there is no nitrogen that can be used during the whole growth period the yield and wue will maintain constant no matter how the water availability changes at an extreme nitrogen deficient environment the yield of seed maize cannot be improved significantly even if the available water increases therefore the topsis chooses the irrigation schedule of the smallest irrigation water to get higher wue yield grows rapidly as available nitrogen increases from 0 to 50 kg n ha leading to more water consumption to tradeoff the compromise between yield and wue the schedules of more yield and less wue are selected by topsis for nue fig 13 the greater available water results in larger nue because of the positive response of yield to water application meanwhile nue changes when available nitrogen is set to 50 and 100 kg n ha while it stays the same all the time regardless of the continuous increase of available nitrogen with high available water nue is reduced with the increase of available nitrogen but the opposite is true if there was less available water this phenomena can be explained by the following reason the higher nitrogen application will improve the rate of the increase in yield under low available water however when the plants get enough water the rise of yield may not be apparent in case of larger available nitrogen initial soil mineral nitrogen influences yield wue and nue the greater initial soil mineral nitrogen leads to greater yield wue and nue however this phenomenon becomes unobvious with the increase of available water and nitrogen therefore the analysis concentrates on the comparatively small available water and nitrogen the scenarios of 100 mm of available water and 50 or 100 kg n ha of available nitrogen are worthy of particular attention yield and nue are improved greatly under 200 kg n ha of initial soil mineral nitrogen compared with 50 kg n ha that is because the greater fertilizer nitrogen demand of the plants can be met partly by the mineral nitrogen in soil the higher initial soil mineral nitrogen provides an environment conducive to plants growth especially when water and nitrogen supplies are insufficient however no matter what the initial soil mineral nitrogen is it s impossible for the plants to grow normally if water or nitrogen are extremely scarce more available water and nitrogen can make up for this deficiency 3 2 2 the optimal irrigation and fertilization schedules the variation trend of water and nitrogen application is depicted in fig 14 the amount of water and nitrogen application will increase correspondingly with the increase of available water and nitrogen to get more wue except the scenarios of 0 kg n ha of available nitrogen when the available water is less than 150 mm the water application is equal to the available water to meet the plants demand only the scenario 100 mm and 50 kg n ha of available water and nitrogen is a special case the water will not completely exhaust because the insufficient nitrogen leads to slow growth of yield with the increase of water application and wue reduced instead if there is too much irrigation however if the available water is so much that yield will raise to a great degree the water consumption will increase sharply even exceeding that of the high available nitrogen scenarios as the results of the scenarios of 150 300 mm available water shows such a result implies that high water application can ensure yield and wue in the case of mild nitrogen deficiency that is also the reason why 1 when the initial soil mineral nitrogen is 50 kg n ha the water consumption of 100 kg n ha available nitrogen scenarios is larger than that of 50 kg n ha with high available water 200 300 mm while the opposite is the case when the initial soil mineral nitrogen is 200 kg n ha 2 the water application of these scenarios is more than that of the scenarios with high available nitrogen in addition it is a remarkable fact that when the available water and initial soil mineral nitrogen are 150 mm and 200 kg n ha respectively the nitrogen application reaches the highest value compared with other scenarios when there is sufficient available nitrogen more usage of nitrogen can improve yield and wue if mild water stress happens for the irrigation schedules fig 15 we analyzed the scenarios of 50 100 and 200 kg n ha of available nitrogen and 50 100 150 and 200 mm of available water respectively the water is allocated into the tasseling stage even though the jointing stage needed more water that is because the tasseling stage is the critical stage for the seed maize to form yield and water stress in this stage produces more severe reduction of yield than in other stages however there are still some differences in water allocation among varied available and initial soil mineral nitrogen when the available nitrogen is small more water will be allocated to tasseling stage with the increase of available water as there is more available nitrogen the water allocation is more dispersed that is it is allocated at each growth stage the reason is that more nitrogen makes the yield more sensitive to water stress at each growth stage in sum the water and nitrogen application of all scenarios do not exceed 200 mm and 150 kg n ha respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness and limitations of the model improvement the simulation results show that the improvement is effective though simulation accuracy of cc and bio do not improve significantly the accuracy of the et simulation by shoot nitrogen concentration is higher than that of the semi quantitative simulation furthermore the method proposed in this study can avoid the users subjectivity and experience to a certain extent by directly considering the soil nitrogen background and nitrogen application so it has better applicability some studies have shown that the aquacrop model can simulate et and yield with small errors under different nitrogen treatments adeboye et al 2021 it is inconsistent with the results of this study due to the different crops and initial soil nitrogen contents however this study has shown that the aquacrop overestimated et under nitrogen deficit stress the main source of errors is that the aquacrop model defaults that the effect of nitrogen stress on the whole growth period is the same in fact the fertilization interval also greatly affects et jooyban and moosavi 2012 which can be reflected in the improved model the w n jensen model was used to simulate yield large errors of yield simulated by aquacrop happens when the nitrogen stress appears because the hi should change in this situation instead of not responding to nitrogen instead w n jensen model not only quantifies the overall effects of different nitrogen application on yield but also reflects the changes of water sensitivity at different growth stages with the amount of nitrogen however et is overestimated by the improved model under high nitrogen stress on the one hand over application of nitrogen will increase the concentration of soil solution lead to the rise of soil osmotic potential and prevent the root system from absorbing water thus the crop growth yield and wue are cut down kang et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 on the other hand if nitrogen is applied too much the growth period will be prolonged and the cell walls will become thinner resulting in susceptibility to mechanical damage and diseases long et al 2000 wu et al 2019 li and li 2021 this also has an adverse effect on yield however these two aspects are really complicated to express especially in a model like the aquacrop that requires both simplicity and effectiveness in addition there is a limitation that we only used the 2017 experimental data for the calibration and validation of the parameters of the nitrogen module the applicability of the model cannot be verified under different climatic conditions 2017 was a normal year that is the climate like this year often occurs in the study area therefore we infer that our improvement can be used in actual production in most cases future study should be devoted to verifying the generalizability of the model under extreme conditions n c is a critical parameter in nitrogen module and calculated according to phenology in this study there is another method to obtain it some studies suggest that n c is related to dry matter mass or leaf area index and can be quantified by critical nitrogen dilution curve justes et al 1994 plenet and lemaire 1999 lemaire et al 2007 meanwhile nitrogen nutrition index nni describes the ratio of n act to n c of the plant so that it can judge the nutritional status of plants however the parameters of critical nitrogen dilution curve should be calibrated but we do not have enough data moreover stockdale et al 1997 worried that the relationship may be broken down under stresses other than nitrogen stress soil mineral nitrogen at the end of the growth period can be simulated precisely the nitrogen dynamic of soil is described by a simple function of nitrogen balance ignoring the process of convection and diffusion to minimize the increase in model complexity denitrification is neglected in the process for the reason that the phenomena does not dominate in the drylands of arid areas chen et al 2020a moreover nitrogen mineralization in the model is expressed by empirical formula which can simply describe the influence of soil mineral nitrogen background value and nitrogen application the calculation method was only a compromise mineralization rate is related to soil organic carbon content and soil organic nitrogen content soil water and temperature conditions and soil mineral nitrogen content liang et al 2016 a detailed description of soil nitrogen dynamics is necessary if more mechanistic and accurate results are required although the improved model is not good for simulating the effect of over application of nitrogen on et it is still suitable for irrigation and fertilizer management in arid areas there are two reasons 1 the yield is calculated by w n jensen model which reflects the yield reduction caused by excessive fertilization 2 maximizing the seed maize yield as an objective of the optimization model can avoid choosing the scheme which contains too much fertilizer it should be noted that the semi quantitative approach is still the better choice under high nitrogen stress for the reason that it has better simulation performance for cc bio and et 4 2 implications for irrigation and fertilizer schedules proper irrigation and fertilization schedules are important to ensure crop yield some studies have reported that the increase of nitrogen will improve water use efficiency with mild or no water stress while water stress is severe the opposite is true that is it will lead to further decrease of water use efficiency di paolo and rinaldi 2008 tang et al 2017 thus the coupling effect of water and fertilizer needs to be taken into account when drawing up irrigation and fertilization schedules gheysari et al 2009 their conclusions can support the results of this study in keeping with the actual situation the initial soil water content was set to 90 of field capacity in reality initial soil water content is an important factor affecting yield and water use efficiency to take pre sowing irrigation into account some studies set the initial soil water content to 50 of field capacity the results show that when the amount of irrigation is more than 300 mm the yield and wue maintain constant and are consistent with the results of this study if the irrigation amount before sowing is 100 mm wang et al 2020b the initial soil mineral nitrogen also influences the yield of seed maize in low fertility soils irrigation should be concentrated during critical growth periods meanwhile fertilization is as critical as irrigation because nitrogen application effectively guarantee yield and wue conversely in high fertility soils irrigation should be dispersed throughout the growth period compared with the local irrigation and fertilizer schedule wue and nue have been improved through the optimization model li et al 2013 such results reveal that the excess water and nitrogen have been put into the actual seed maize production which not only causes the waste of resources but also has a negative effect on environment however there may be some irrationality if the results of this optimization model are incorporated into larger temporal and spatial scales for well irrigation districts the irrigation schedule can be realized nevertheless for the irrigation districts using surface water such an irrigation schedule may need further adjustments in reality because the model does not consider the time and quantity of water transported by the canal system this is also a point of further study moreover border irrigation and furrow irrigation under mulch which consume more water and are prone to nitrogen leaching are still the main irrigation methods in study area it will take time for water saving irrigation techniques to implement because of the cost including financial and manpower resources and the technical problems that might arise in the process 5 conclusion in this study jsoifs was proposed with the consideration of conflicting objectives and water nitrogen dynamic simulation in soil plant system under the scenarios of varied available water and nitrogen application and initial soil mineral nitrogen in the aquacrop model the soil nitrogen dynamic module was coupled and the nitrogen stress factor was modified by the introduction of the shoot actual critical and minimum nitrogen concentration besides w n jensen model with the thought of the nitrogen effect on yield and water sensitivity was adopted to estimate yield an optimization model was established by integrating the improved aquacrop model w n jensen model and multi objective programming with the objectives of maximum yield and water use efficiency the nsga ⅱ was used to solve the model and the satisfying schedule under each scenario was selected by topsis the advantage of this framework is that it can provide effective and reasonable water and fertilizer schedules under different external conditions on the basis of ensuring yield and resource utilization efficiency the verification results of the improved aquacrop model for seed maize show that canopy cover and et can be simulated precisely whether or not water stress occurs under the condition of nitrogen deficient stress the simulation accuracy of the et has been improved greatly and the simulation performace of yield using the w n jensen model is better than that of aquacrop yet the simulation error is large when high nitrogen stress is triggered the semi quantitative approach to simulate et is still the better choice under high nitrogen stress sixty scenarios were set up to seek the optimal irrigation and fertilizer schedules the results of optimization model indicate that all the available water and nitrogen and initial soil mineral nitrogen influence yield wue and nue the coupling effect of water and nitrogen should also be noted reinforcing water supply can ensure yield and wue under circumstance of slight nitrogen deficient stress simultaneously increasing nitrogen application can improve yield and wue if mild water stress happens the high initial soil mineral nitrogen provides an environment conducive to the growth of plants especially when water and nitrogen supplies are insufficient low soil nutrients require water distribution at critical stage while water should be allocated to the whole growth period in high soil fertilizer when water and nitrogen application are 150 200 mm and 100 150 kg n ha respectively yield wue and nue can be maintained at a high level however more complex soil nitrogen dynamics crop growth under high nitrogen stress and the combination of irrigation scheduling with canal system management need to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement

9569,to explore management practices that increase irrigation water productivity iwp in u s southern high plains shp cotton production the cropgro cotton crop simulation model was used to evaluate the yield iwp and profit effects of irrigation amount and timing using 2005 2019 weather input data from 21 shp weather stations lint yields were simulated for each of the 315 station years under unirrigated dryland conditions and 18 increasing total irrigation tirr levels as tirr was increased to 55 9 cm median lint yields asymptotically approached a maximum however irrigation above 35 6 cm increased the incidence of total irrigation plus growing season rainfall exceeding 100 of potential crop et leading to decreasing marginal yield effects and decreasing iwp the highest median iwp 0 321 kg m 3 was found with both 33 0 and 35 6 cm of total irrigation with 30 5 cm providing slightly lower iwp 0 320 kg m 3 in analyses of irrigated profitability under varying lint price and pumping cost conditions 30 5 cm 12 0 in of irrigation increases profits relative to dryland conditions under all but low lint price and high pumping cost conditions but as tirr is reduced the probability of these positive profit effects become similar to an evenly weighted coin flip at about 17 8 cm 7 0 in simulations that varied the timing of 30 5 cm of irrigation increased median iwp up to 0 434 kg m 3 by limiting irrigation to cotton s reproductive and maturation periods with no irrigation during the initial vegetative period as a result these simulations show that applying 30 5 35 6 cm 12 0 14 0 in of irrigation during cotton s reproductive and maturation phases with little or no vegetative irrigation maximizes iwp in shp cotton production under current climate conditions keywords crop yield simulation profit analysis dssat cropgro cotton 1 introduction the southern high plains shp of west texas is the most concentrated u s growing area of upland cotton although planted area in the region s two national agricultural statistics service nass production districts is roughly evenly divided between irrigated and dryland production in the semi arid shp climate irrigated land accounts for a disproportionate amount of yield during 2000 2018 irrigated planted area of upland cotton accounted for 47 1 of combined total planted area in nass districts 11 and 12 fig 1a on average but 74 7 of the two district s combined yield usda 2021 given the high value of irrigated cotton relative to other crops grown on the shp smidt et al 2016 there is a strong economic incentive to irrigate if possible irrigated shp cotton production is supported by pumping from the ogallala aquifer which is the largest source of u s groundwater withdrawal reilly et al 2008 and a major water resource for u s agriculture extending over parts of 8 great plains states the aquifer has modest recharge rates in its northernmost areas in nebraska but discharge exceeds recharge in the central and southern ogallala steward et al 2013 scanlon et al 2010 whittemore et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 estimate that in areas of kansas and texas with the greatest decreases in groundwater storage during pre development to 2007 groundwater depletion exceeds recharge by a factor of 10 mcguire s 2017 state by state comparison of ogallala groundwater depletion during pre development to 2015 shows that the largest decreases in recoverable water in storage 19 44 million ha m and area weighted average water level 12 62 m occurred under the texas panhandle and shp based on a linear extrapolation of 1997 2007 saturated thickness trends scanlon et al 2012 estimate that within 30 years saturated thickness in 35 of the southern ogallala will decline to levels incapable of supporting irrigation and conclude that it is essentially a finite fossil ground water resource where agriculture depends on limited ground water irrigation water productivity iwp is an important metric in determining whether irrigation practices maximize yield production per unit of applied water although there are varying definitions of crop water use efficiency nair et al 2013 heydari 2014 and agricultural water productivity fernández et al 2020 the iwp definition used here follows that of bordovsky et al 2015 which is the increase in irrigated yields yi relative to dryland yields y0 0 divided by total applied irrigation tirr 1 iwp y i y 0 0 tirr y i tirr in principle maximizing the yield productivity of non renewable ground water requires applying irrigation at or near maximum iwp but although increased agricultural water productivity has been considered a key condition for achieving global water sustainability and food security brauman et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 individual producer s irrigation practices in the ogallala region are primarily guided by profits smidt et al 2016 field experiments have been conducted to estimate the irrigation response and productivity of shp irrigated cotton wanjura et al 2002 hereafter w02 conducted 12 years 1988 1999 of drip irrigated field experiments to test irrigation scheduling methods based on canopy temperature in estimating the yield response to irrigation amounts ranging from deficit to excessive they fit a quadratic response function to their yield outcomes that estimated maximum lint yield at 58 0 cm of tirr this suggests maximum iwp below that level as a decreasing non linear yield response would produce decreasing irrigated yield effects and iwp as tirr approached 58 0 cm bordovsky et al 2015 hereafter b15 four year 2010 2013 experiment conducted field trials in which three increasing levels of irrigation were applied within three periods associated with cotton s vegetative reproductive and maturation stages mitchell mccallister et al 2020 subsequent analysis of the b15 treatment s profitability found that those with higher irrigation levels during maturation resulted in the highest yield gross margin and return on applied water the w02 and b15 experiments were resource intensive multiple year field studies that provided important data about how shp cotton production responds to irrigation but between them knowledge gaps exist the w02 experiments did not estimate irrigation water productivity and the b15 trials did not resolve the separate effects of irrigation amount and timing to fill those gaps the cropgro cotton crop model calibrated based on the results of multiple year irrigated field experiments adhikari et al 2016 was used to simulate the effects of variable total irrigation amounts via and variable irrigation timing vit in shp cotton production given the δyi yield effects estimated from these simulations the associated effects on iwp and profitability was estimated in estimating the effects of irrigation amount and timing in shp cotton production a modelling approach offers two advantages first crop simulations can be quickly and economically conducted under controlled conditions and repeated under arbitrary levels and timing of irrigation this includes the ability to simulate the eq 1 dryland and irrigated yields under identical management and weather conditions second where sufficient weather data is available crop models can be used estimate irrigation yield response under a wider range of seasonal growing conditions than that experienced in most field experiments although irrigated field studies are usually conducted under a limited sampling of seasonal weather conditions deficit irrigated cotton yields in a semi arid environment are sensitive to rainfall and growing degree day outcomes in regions with dense weather networks like the shp s west texas mesonet wtm weather data from multiple weather stations can be used to drive crop models under a more representative range of growing season weather conditions here simulations were conducted with weather data from 21 wtm stations over 15 years resulting in 315 station years of simulations for each irrigation treatment the resulting yield distributions can be used to make more representative estimates of each treatment s yield variability and the probability of associated profit outcomes under current shp climate conditions in section 2 methods are described including the wtm weather data the cropgro cotton model and its calibration and the calculation of production costs pumping costs and

effects when a total irrigation level with high median iwp is applied with variable timing following the approach of the b15 field trials additional discussion and concluding comments are provided in section 4 2 methods 2 1 weather data weather data provided by wtm network stations schroeder et al 2005 was used to generate cropgro cotton s daily weather inputs fig 1a using each station s 5 minute weather data records daily records of minimum and maximum temperatures average wind run and dew point temperature and total daily precipitation and solar radiation were formed in addition to quality control qc procedures conducted on the 5 minute data schroeder et al 2005 qc and missing data infill procedures were also conducted on the derived daily data mauget et al 2017 the resulting records provided continuous daily weather inputs to the cropgro cotton crop model pathak et al 2007 2012 thorp et al 2014 during january 1 2005 to december 31 2019 for each station and were also used to calculate growing season potential crop evapotranspiration pet 2 2 the cropgro cotton model simulated cotton yields were generated using cropgro cotton which is the cotton growth module of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the dssat csm ver 4 6 1 0 is a collection of standardized software subroutines that includes weather soil soil plant atmosphere and management modules common to the modelling of a variety of crops and separate modules that simulate the development of individual crops although crop photosynthesis can be calculated hourly the dssat csm modules run over daily time steps in addition to daily weather data and management parameter inputs the model requires cultivar soil and soil profile characteristics to reproduce the b15 trial s center pivot irrigated production conditions the cropgro cotton simulations were conducted under conditions that paralleled those trials the soil profile used in the simulations was a pullman silty clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll similar to the pullman clay loam at the halfway texas experiment station where the b15 trials were conducted cropgro cotton s cultivar and ecotype parameters were those estimated by adhikari et al 2016 based on the results of the b15 field trial s irrigation treatments during 2010 2013 this calibration and validation procedure is summarized in mauget et al 2020 and its full description can be found in adhikari et al 2016 because the adhikari et al 2016 parameters were calculated to minimize the difference between the observed and simulated effects of total irrigation in the b15 experiments they provide optimal simulated estimates of the effects of variable irrigation amount on yield as the b15 trials were planted between may 9 and may 13 of 2010 2013 each station year s simulation began on may 2 with planting on may 11 in the b15 field trials pre plant irrigation was applied to raise initial soil moisture to near field capacity here each via and vit simulation began with soil moisture at field capacity and a plant density equal to that of the b15 trials 13 3 plants m 2 in the via simulations an upper limit for total irrigation was defined based on estimates of growing season pet during 2005 2019 using allen et al 1998 fao 56 single crop coefficient method may september cotton pet was calculated from the daily wtm weather data for each of the 315 station years the resulting pet distribution fig 1b has a 77 1 cm median which is comparable to the w02 estimate of the amount of total water required to maximize lint yields 74 0 cm and the lysimeter measured amounts of cotton pet 77 5 cm 73 9 cm found in the 2000 2001 field experiments of howell et al 2004 to calculate the irrigation level required to meet each station year s pet demand each station year s may september rainfall total fig 1c was subtracted from the station year s calculated pet the median of the resulting irrigation demand distribution fig 1d is 48 2 cm 18 9 in with a 37 5 cm 14 8 in 25th percentile and a 57 1 cm 22 5 in 75th percentile based on the fig 1d distribution the via simulations were repeated with 18 tirr levels ranging from 12 7 cm 5 0 in to 55 9 cm 22 0 in in increments of 2 54 cm 1 0 in unirrigated simulations were also conducted to generate y0 0 dryland control yields for each station year in both the via and vit simulations irrigation was applied every three days an interval that maximized cotton iwp in previous shp field studies bordovsky et al 1992 as in the b15 field trials the durations of each station year s irrigation season in both sets of simulations were defined by three growth periods defined by accumulated growing degrees calculated with a 15 6 c threshold gdd15 6 the p1 vegetative period began 20 days after emergence and continued to the first day that accumulated gdd15 6 exceeded 525 c the p2 reproductive period extended between the end of the vegetative period and first day that gdd15 6 exceeded 750 c the p3 maturation period began at the end of the reproductive period and ended on an irrigation termination day that occurred between sept 1 and sept 15 for each station year s simulation the gdd15 6 threshold dates were calculated based on the wtm daily temperature data for that station year in the via model runs that applied irrigation uniformly during the growing season daily irrigation event amounts were calculated to sum to the simulation s tirr level over the entire p1 p2 p3 irrigation period because of rounding errors associated with dssat input requirements these via tirr sums sometimes exceeded each tirr level but never by more than 2 4 of the defined tirr value in the vit simulations the amounts of irrigation applied during the three growth periods were varied according to a scheme described in section 3 2 2 3 profit calculation profit distributions for each

plotted in fig 2a the median dryland lint yield is 364 8 kg ha 1 and as tirr is increased from 12 7 cm to 55 9 cm median yields increase non linearly from 683 9 kg ha 1 to 1883 8 kg ha 1 the quadratic yield response curve fit to the results of the w02 drip irrigated field experiments is plotted in gray and shows similar decreasing yield effects as total irrigation is increased to 55 9 cm however the w02 field experimental yield fit curve is above the simulated yield medians at tirr levels below 25 4 cm 10 0 in and below the simulated median yields above 25 4 cm fig 2b shows the distributions of the marginal lint yield effects of the last 2 54 cm 1 0 in of irrigation at each irrigation level for example the 15 2 cm δy2 54 distribution shows the yield effect for each of the 315 station

the same station year s tirr irrigated yield divided by the station year s tirr eq 1 in contrast to previous field dağdelen et al 2009 delaune et al 2012 and simulation modala et al 2015 studies that describe decreasing cotton iwp response as irrigation is increased the cropgro cotton response shows increasing maximum and decreasing iwp as tirr is increased median iwp iwp50 values increase from a minimum 0 254 kg m 3 at 12 7 cm of tirr to a maximum 0 321 kg m 3 at both 33 0 and 35 6 cm 13 0 and 14 0 in with 30 5 cm 12 0 in producing slightly lower iwp 0 320 kg m 3 with tirr levels above 35 6 cm iwp50 gradually decreases to 0 261 kg m 3 with 55 9 cm of total irrigation decreasing iwp as total irrigation is increased above 35 6 cm can be traced to irrigation levels that when combined with total may september precipitation tpcp results in an increased incidence of total applied water greater than 100 of potential crop et fig 2d shows the distributions of each station year s total crop

station years result in total water inputs greater than the station year s pet as irrigation is linearly increased to 55 9 cm that percentage increases to 73 3 by contrast as irrigation is increased from 12 7 to 33 0 cm the incidence of total crop water exceeding may september pet increases from 0 6 to 16 8 thus under current shp summer climate conditions increasing tirr above 35 6 cm results in increasing amounts of irrigation applied in excess of potential crop demand and decreasing yield and water productivity effects in the cropgro cotton simulations increasing tirr above 35 6 cm reduces irrigation efficiency but also increases median yields but current shp well capacity conditions may prevent producers from applying water at those levels irrigating a ¼ section center pivot area 51 01 104 m2 over a 90 day irrigation period with 33 0 cm of water requires a well flow rate of 1299 4 l min 1 343 3 gal min 1 however in 2020 the average flow rate over a 15 county shp region surveyed by the high plains water district hpwd was 366 0 l min 1 or 96 7 gal min 1 hpwd 2021 average irrigation applied to cotton over the 15 counties during 2014 2020 varied between 16 8 and 31 2 cm hpwd 2021 thus under the shp region s limited well capacity conditions cotton producers are likely applying irrigation at levels below those that maximize irrigated water productivity in these simulations 3 1 1

cropgro cotton simulations lint yields were most sensitive to increased irrigation during maturation while increasing vegetative irrigation produced weaker yield effects fig a1a in both the

runs variation in the duration of the three periods in each station year occasionally led to some missed third day irrigation events and seasonal irrigation totals that varied by as much as 14 5 below

lowest medians result from the 606 1197 6 kg ha 1 309 1208 6 kg ha 1 and 903 1244 6 kg ha 1 treatments fig 5b plots the corresponding iwp distributions for the irrigated treatments as tirr is roughly equal in the 12 vit and 444 treatments these distributions follow those of the fig 5a yield distributions in table 2 the three treatments that withhold vegetative period irrigation result in the three highest iwp50 outcomes the 066 treatment produces a peak median iwp of 0 434 kg m 3 which exceeds the highest 4 year average value found in the b15 experiment 0 350 kg m 3 and is a 35 6 increase over the 0 320 kg m 3 median iwp found in the uniformly irrigated 444 treatment the 066 treatment that divided 30 5 cm of irrigation between reproductive and maturation periods produced the highest median iwp in the vit fig 5b and via fig 2c simulations this is consistent with the results of the b15 field experiment where the highest iwp levels were found in their lhh and lmm treatments that withheld irrigation during vegetative periods while applying roughly equal amounts of water between reproduction and maturation as reduced irrigation during reproduction and boll formation has been found to reduce fiber strength length and uniformity in upland cotton ulloa et al 2020 witt et al 2020 directing irrigation into these periods may also have important positive effects on fiber quality but like the b15 field trials these simulations began with full soil moisture profiles which is not accounted for in the total irrigation amounts even so the consistency of the irrigation timing effects in the field trials and simulations indicate that with sufficient initial soil moisture the most water use efficient shp irrigation management divides most irrigation between reproductive and maturation periods with no or minimal irrigation during vegetative development this is inconsistent with the general cotton irrigation practice described in steduto et al 2012 which proposes that irrigation should meet crop demand during the vegetative phase to speed up canopy development following fig 3 fig 6 compares 066 yields and profits with those resulting from dryland production fig 6a plots the y066 and y000 lint distributions with the resulting δyi y066 y000 distribution in fig 6b the increased 066 yields relative to those of the 444 treatment produce a larger positive median δyi effect

444 irrigation is less than 15 6 while in fig 6f the probabilities with 066 irrigation are less than 7 6 4 discussion maximizing yield per unit of water input is an important part of the overall effort to increasing agricultural water productivity howell 2001 giordano et al 2021 irrigating at peak water productivity maximizes the yields and with commodity prices and production costs held constant the yield revenues and profits per unit of applied irrigation as a result extracting the most value from the southern ogallala aquifer s declining groundwater resource requires that producers manage irrigation at or near maximum irrigation water productivity iwp the simulations conducted here indicate that under current southern high plains climate conditions applying 30 5 35 6 cm 12 0 14 0 in of total irrigation during cotton s reproductive and maturation phases maximizes iwp in the region s cotton production although restricted well capacities might prevent these levels from being applied over an entire ¼ section center pivot during a crop s mid and final development phases lower capacity wells might provide those levels when applied over fractional pivot areas this suggests a simple management guideline for such wells irrigate at maximum iwp over areas that well capacity can support with the remainder of the pivot under dryland production with lower production costs if well capacity allows irrigation over an entire pivot to be applied at levels above maximum iwp yields may be marginally increased but at the expense of decreased water productivity in fig 2b the median yield effect of increasing irrigation from 48 3 to 50 8 cm 14 9 kg ha 1 is about one seventh that of increasing irrigation the same amount from 25 4 to 27 9 cm 107 9 kg ha 1 increasing total irrigation from 35 6 to 55 9 cm in fig 2a increases median yield by less than a third as much as that resulting from an equal increase from 12 7 to 33 0 cm thus irrigating at maximum iwp may reduce lint yields relative to applying higher irrigation levels but also conserves water that has greater yield and profit potential if applied more productively in subsequent years managing nonrenewable groundwater for irrigation is a global issue wada et al 2012 as global demand increases providing the most food and fiber from these limited resources requires identifying practices that maximize irrigation water productivity on a region by region and crop by crop basis irrigating at maximum efficiency requires iwp response data which in turn requires knowing the crop s irrigation response to varying irrigation levels and timing although field studies might estimate irrigation yield response they usually cannot be conducted over long enough periods to resolve it accurately over variable growing season climate conditions statistical methods based on panel data sets might relate irrigation practices to actual yield outcomes blanc and schlenker 2017 but those data sets may not provide enough data to describe the effects of the amount and timing of irrigation crop models by contrast can simulate arbitrary irrigation practices under controlled conditions and under weather conditions limited only by the availability of weather data as a result combined field study and crop simulation research protocols similar to that followed here i e multiple year field studies bordovsky et al 2015 with a crop model calibration component adhikari et al 2016 followed by model simulations under more representative weather conditions may be an important part of identifying efficient irrigation

9569,to explore management practices that increase irrigation water productivity iwp in u s southern high plains shp cotton production the cropgro cotton crop simulation model was used to evaluate the yield iwp and profit effects of irrigation amount and timing using 2005 2019 weather input data from 21 shp weather stations lint yields were simulated for each of the 315 station years under unirrigated dryland conditions and 18 increasing total irrigation tirr levels as tirr was increased to 55 9 cm median lint yields asymptotically approached a maximum however irrigation above 35 6 cm increased the incidence of total irrigation plus growing season rainfall exceeding 100 of potential crop et leading to decreasing marginal yield effects and decreasing iwp the highest median iwp 0 321 kg m 3 was found with both 33 0 and 35 6 cm of total irrigation with 30 5 cm providing slightly lower iwp 0 320 kg m 3 in analyses of irrigated profitability under varying lint price and pumping cost conditions 30 5 cm 12 0 in of irrigation increases profits relative to dryland conditions under all but low lint price and high pumping cost conditions but as tirr is reduced the probability of these positive profit effects become similar to an evenly weighted coin flip at about 17 8 cm 7 0 in simulations that varied the timing of 30 5 cm of irrigation increased median iwp up to 0 434 kg m 3 by limiting irrigation to cotton s reproductive and maturation periods with no irrigation during the initial vegetative period as a result these simulations show that applying 30 5 35 6 cm 12 0 14 0 in of irrigation during cotton s reproductive and maturation phases with little or no vegetative irrigation maximizes iwp in shp cotton production under current climate conditions keywords crop yield simulation profit analysis dssat cropgro cotton 1 introduction the southern high plains shp of west texas is the most concentrated u s growing area of upland cotton although planted area in the region s two national agricultural statistics service nass production districts is roughly evenly divided between irrigated and dryland production in the semi arid shp climate irrigated land accounts for a disproportionate amount of yield during 2000 2018 irrigated planted area of upland cotton accounted for 47 1 of combined total planted area in nass districts 11 and 12 fig 1a on average but 74 7 of the two district s combined yield usda 2021 given the high value of irrigated cotton relative to other crops grown on the shp smidt et al 2016 there is a strong economic incentive to irrigate if possible irrigated shp cotton production is supported by pumping from the ogallala aquifer which is the largest source of u s groundwater withdrawal reilly et al 2008 and a major water resource for u s agriculture extending over parts of 8 great plains states the aquifer has modest recharge rates in its northernmost areas in nebraska but discharge exceeds recharge in the central and southern ogallala steward et al 2013 scanlon et al 2010 whittemore et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 estimate that in areas of kansas and texas with the greatest decreases in groundwater storage during pre development to 2007 groundwater depletion exceeds recharge by a factor of 10 mcguire s 2017 state by state comparison of ogallala groundwater depletion during pre development to 2015 shows that the largest decreases in recoverable water in storage 19 44 million ha m and area weighted average water level 12 62 m occurred under the texas panhandle and shp based on a linear extrapolation of 1997 2007 saturated thickness trends scanlon et al 2012 estimate that within 30 years saturated thickness in 35 of the southern ogallala will decline to levels incapable of supporting irrigation and conclude that it is essentially a finite fossil ground water resource where agriculture depends on limited ground water irrigation water productivity iwp is an important metric in determining whether irrigation practices maximize yield production per unit of applied water although there are varying definitions of crop water use efficiency nair et al 2013 heydari 2014 and agricultural water productivity fernández et al 2020 the iwp definition used here follows that of bordovsky et al 2015 which is the increase in irrigated yields yi relative to dryland yields y0 0 divided by total applied irrigation tirr 1 iwp y i y 0 0 tirr y i tirr in principle maximizing the yield productivity of non renewable ground water requires applying irrigation at or near maximum iwp but although increased agricultural water productivity has been considered a key condition for achieving global water sustainability and food security brauman et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 individual producer s irrigation practices in the ogallala region are primarily guided by profits smidt et al 2016 field experiments have been conducted to estimate the irrigation response and productivity of shp irrigated cotton wanjura et al 2002 hereafter w02 conducted 12 years 1988 1999 of drip irrigated field experiments to test irrigation scheduling methods based on canopy temperature in estimating the yield response to irrigation amounts ranging from deficit to excessive they fit a quadratic response function to their yield outcomes that estimated maximum lint yield at 58 0 cm of tirr this suggests maximum iwp below that level as a decreasing non linear yield response would produce decreasing irrigated yield effects and iwp as tirr approached 58 0 cm bordovsky et al 2015 hereafter b15 four year 2010 2013 experiment conducted field trials in which three increasing levels of irrigation were applied within three periods associated with cotton s vegetative reproductive and maturation stages mitchell mccallister et al 2020 subsequent analysis of the b15 treatment s profitability found that those with higher irrigation levels during maturation resulted in the highest yield gross margin and return on applied water the w02 and b15 experiments were resource intensive multiple year field studies that provided important data about how shp cotton production responds to irrigation but between them knowledge gaps exist the w02 experiments did not estimate irrigation water productivity and the b15 trials did not resolve the separate effects of irrigation amount and timing to fill those gaps the cropgro cotton crop model calibrated based on the results of multiple year irrigated field experiments adhikari et al 2016 was used to simulate the effects of variable total irrigation amounts via and variable irrigation timing vit in shp cotton production given the δyi yield effects estimated from these simulations the associated effects on iwp and profitability was estimated in estimating the effects of irrigation amount and timing in shp cotton production a modelling approach offers two advantages first crop simulations can be quickly and economically conducted under controlled conditions and repeated under arbitrary levels and timing of irrigation this includes the ability to simulate the eq 1 dryland and irrigated yields under identical management and weather conditions second where sufficient weather data is available crop models can be used estimate irrigation yield response under a wider range of seasonal growing conditions than that experienced in most field experiments although irrigated field studies are usually conducted under a limited sampling of seasonal weather conditions deficit irrigated cotton yields in a semi arid environment are sensitive to rainfall and growing degree day outcomes in regions with dense weather networks like the shp s west texas mesonet wtm weather data from multiple weather stations can be used to drive crop models under a more representative range of growing season weather conditions here simulations were conducted with weather data from 21 wtm stations over 15 years resulting in 315 station years of simulations for each irrigation treatment the resulting yield distributions can be used to make more representative estimates of each treatment s yield variability and the probability of associated profit outcomes under current shp climate conditions in section 2 methods are described including the wtm weather data the cropgro cotton model and its calibration and the calculation of production costs pumping costs and profits section 3 describes and discusses results beginning with the via effects of total irrigation levels on yields iwp and profits section 3 concludes with a vit analysis of yield iwp and profit effects when a total irrigation level with high median iwp is applied with variable timing following the approach of the b15 field trials additional discussion and concluding comments are provided in section 4 2 methods 2 1 weather data weather data provided by wtm network stations schroeder et al 2005 was used to generate cropgro cotton s daily weather inputs fig 1a using each station s 5 minute weather data records daily records of minimum and maximum temperatures average wind run and dew point temperature and total daily precipitation and solar radiation were formed in addition to quality control qc procedures conducted on the 5 minute data schroeder et al 2005 qc and missing data infill procedures were also conducted on the derived daily data mauget et al 2017 the resulting records provided continuous daily weather inputs to the cropgro cotton crop model pathak et al 2007 2012 thorp et al 2014 during january 1 2005 to december 31 2019 for each station and were also used to calculate growing season potential crop evapotranspiration pet 2 2 the cropgro cotton model simulated cotton yields were generated using cropgro cotton which is the cotton growth module of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the dssat csm ver 4 6 1 0 is a collection of standardized software subroutines that includes weather soil soil plant atmosphere and management modules common to the modelling of a variety of crops and separate modules that simulate the development of individual crops although crop photosynthesis can be calculated hourly the dssat csm modules run over daily time steps in addition to daily weather data and management parameter inputs the model requires cultivar soil and soil profile characteristics to reproduce the b15 trial s center pivot irrigated production conditions the cropgro cotton simulations were conducted under conditions that paralleled those trials the soil profile used in the simulations was a pullman silty clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll similar to the pullman clay loam at the halfway texas experiment station where the b15 trials were conducted cropgro cotton s cultivar and ecotype parameters were those estimated by adhikari et al 2016 based on the results of the b15 field trial s irrigation treatments during 2010 2013 this calibration and validation procedure is summarized in mauget et al 2020 and its full description can be found in adhikari et al 2016 because the adhikari et al 2016 parameters were calculated to minimize the difference between the observed and simulated effects of total irrigation in the b15 experiments they provide optimal simulated estimates of the effects of variable irrigation amount on yield as the b15 trials were planted between may 9 and may 13 of 2010 2013 each station year s simulation began on may 2 with planting on may 11 in the b15 field trials pre plant irrigation was applied to raise initial soil moisture to near field capacity here each via and vit simulation began with soil moisture at field capacity and a plant density equal to that of the b15 trials 13 3 plants m 2 in the via simulations an upper limit for total irrigation was defined based on estimates of growing season pet during 2005 2019 using allen et al 1998 fao 56 single crop coefficient method may september cotton pet was calculated from the daily wtm weather data for each of the 315 station years the resulting pet distribution fig 1b has a 77 1 cm median which is comparable to the w02 estimate of the amount of total water required to maximize lint yields 74 0 cm and the lysimeter measured amounts of cotton pet 77 5 cm 73 9 cm found in the 2000 2001 field experiments of howell et al 2004 to calculate the irrigation level required to meet each station year s pet demand each station year s may september rainfall total fig 1c was subtracted from the station year s calculated pet the median of the resulting irrigation demand distribution fig 1d is 48 2 cm 18 9 in with a 37 5 cm 14 8 in 25th percentile and a 57 1 cm 22 5 in 75th percentile based on the fig 1d distribution the via simulations were repeated with 18 tirr levels ranging from 12 7 cm 5 0 in to 55 9 cm 22 0 in in increments of 2 54 cm 1 0 in unirrigated simulations were also conducted to generate y0 0 dryland control yields for each station year in both the via and vit simulations irrigation was applied every three days an interval that maximized cotton iwp in previous shp field studies bordovsky et al 1992 as in the b15 field trials the durations of each station year s irrigation season in both sets of simulations were defined by three growth periods defined by accumulated growing degrees calculated with a 15 6 c threshold gdd15 6 the p1 vegetative period began 20 days after emergence and continued to the first day that accumulated gdd15 6 exceeded 525 c the p2 reproductive period extended between the end of the vegetative period and first day that gdd15 6 exceeded 750 c the p3 maturation period began at the end of the reproductive period and ended on an irrigation termination day that occurred between sept 1 and sept 15 for each station year s simulation the gdd15 6 threshold dates were calculated based on the wtm daily temperature data for that station year in the via model runs that applied irrigation uniformly during the growing season daily irrigation event amounts were calculated to sum to the simulation s tirr level over the entire p1 p2 p3 irrigation period because of rounding errors associated with dssat input requirements these via tirr sums sometimes exceeded each tirr level but never by more than 2 4 of the defined tirr value

plotted in fig 2a the median dryland lint yield is 364 8 kg ha 1 and as tirr is increased from 12 7 cm to 55 9 cm median yields increase non linearly from 683 9 kg ha 1 to 1883 8 kg ha 1 the quadratic yield response curve fit to the results of the w02 drip irrigated field experiments is plotted in gray and shows similar decreasing yield effects as total irrigation is increased to 55 9 cm however the w02 field experimental yield fit curve is above the simulated yield medians at tirr levels below 25 4 cm 10 0 in and below the simulated median yields above 25 4 cm fig 2b shows the distributions of the marginal lint yield effects of the last 2 54 cm 1 0 in of irrigation at each irrigation level for example the 15 2 cm δy2 54 distribution shows the yield effect for each of the 315 station

the same station year s tirr irrigated yield divided by the station year s tirr eq 1 in contrast to previous field dağdelen et al 2009 delaune et al 2012 and simulation modala et al 2015 studies that describe decreasing cotton iwp response as irrigation is increased the cropgro cotton response shows increasing maximum and decreasing iwp as tirr is increased median iwp iwp50 values increase from a minimum 0 254 kg m 3 at 12 7 cm of tirr to a maximum 0 321 kg m 3 at both 33 0 and 35 6 cm 13 0 and 14 0 in with 30 5 cm 12 0 in producing slightly lower iwp 0 320 kg m 3 with tirr levels above 35 6 cm iwp50 gradually decreases to 0 261 kg m 3 with 55 9 cm of total irrigation decreasing iwp as total irrigation is increased above 35 6 cm can be traced to irrigation levels that when combined with total may september precipitation tpcp results in an increased incidence of total applied water greater than 100 of potential crop et fig 2d shows the distributions of each station year s total crop

station years result in total water inputs greater than the station year s pet as irrigation is linearly increased to 55 9 cm that percentage increases to 73 3 by contrast as irrigation is increased from 12 7 to 33 0 cm the incidence of total crop water exceeding may september pet increases from 0 6 to 16 8 thus under current shp summer climate conditions increasing tirr above 35 6 cm results in increasing amounts of irrigation applied in excess of potential crop demand and decreasing yield and water productivity effects in the cropgro cotton simulations increasing tirr above 35 6 cm reduces irrigation efficiency but also increases median yields but current shp well capacity conditions may prevent producers from applying water at those levels irrigating a ¼ section center pivot area 51 01 104 m2 over a 90 day irrigation period with 33 0 cm of water requires a well flow rate of 1299 4 l min 1 343 3 gal min 1 however in 2020 the average flow rate over a 15 county shp region surveyed by the high plains water district hpwd was 366 0 l min 1 or 96 7 gal min 1 hpwd 2021 average irrigation applied to cotton over the 15 counties during 2014 2020 varied between 16 8 and 31 2 cm hpwd 2021 thus under the shp region s limited well capacity conditions cotton producers are likely applying irrigation at levels below those that maximize irrigated water productivity in these simulations 3 1 1

median profit effects of irrigating at a 30 5 cm level are uniformly positive relative to dryland production when pl is reduced from 1 40 to 1 15 kg 1 and cha cm is increased from 3 50 to 4 75 ha cm 1 the median profit effect is 251 68 ha 1 and the incidence of negative profit effects in fig 3f increases from 2 5 to 14 9 reducing pl to 1 00 kg 1 and increasing cha cm to 8 00 ha cm 1 results in profits effects similar to a coin flip i e δπ50 0 0 ha 1 and an 50 incidence of negative δπ those elevated pumping costs might be consistent with some combination of increased energy costs deeper wells or reduced plant efficiency otherwise under representative shp pumping cost conditions and recent lint price conditions irrigating to achieve maximum iwp results in increased profits relative to

representative lint yield distributions and the difference in irrigated and dryland production costs 17 8 cm 7 0 in serves as an approximate tirr threshold below which shp irrigated profits fall below

assumed here 556 42 ha 1 the tirr threshold would fall below 17 8 cm as a result the 17 8 cm threshold might be reduced and the profitability of marginal wells extended if table 1 s variable and fixed

similar variation in irrigation timing on cropgro cotton yields simulations for the 315 station years were conducted under each of the b15 treatments appendix fig a1a the means of the resulting simulated lint yield distributions closely track the 4 year means of the b15 trials with a correlation of 0 968 and a root mean square error of 134 4 kg ha 1 fig a1b in both the b15 trials and the cropgro cotton simulations lint yields were most sensitive to increased irrigation during maturation while increasing vegetative irrigation produced weaker yield effects fig a1a in both the simulations and the b15 trials the mll and hll treatments produced negative or near zero yi y0 0 average yield effects fig a1c and iwp in the b15 trials the highest 4 year average iwp was found in the lhh 0 340 kg m 3 and lmm 0 350 kg m 3 treatments to simulate the b15 irrigation timing effects under conditions of fixed total irrigation cropgro cotton model runs were conducted in which 30 5 cm 12 0

runs variation in the duration of the three periods in each station year occasionally led to some missed third day irrigation events and seasonal irrigation totals that varied by as much as 14 5 below

vegetative period decrease median yields relative to 444 irrigation e g the 903 and 930 treatments the 066 and 093 treatments produce the highest median yields 1707 1 kg ha 1 1701 6 kg ha 1 while the lowest medians result from the 606 1197 6 kg ha 1 309 1208 6 kg ha 1 and 903 1244 6 kg ha 1 treatments fig 5b plots the corresponding iwp distributions for the irrigated treatments as tirr is roughly equal in the 12 vit and 444 treatments these distributions follow those of the fig 5a yield distributions in table 2 the three treatments that withhold vegetative period irrigation result in the three highest iwp50 outcomes the 066 treatment produces a peak median iwp of 0 434 kg m 3 which exceeds the highest 4 year average value found in the b15 experiment 0 350 kg m 3 and is a 35 6 increase over the 0 320 kg m 3 median iwp found in the uniformly irrigated 444 treatment the 066 treatment that divided 30 5 cm of irrigation between reproductive and maturation periods produced the highest median iwp in the vit fig 5b and via fig 2c simulations this is consistent with the results of the b15 field experiment where the highest iwp levels were found in their lhh and lmm treatments that withheld irrigation during vegetative periods while applying roughly equal amounts of water between reproduction and maturation as reduced irrigation during reproduction and boll formation has been found to reduce fiber strength length and uniformity in upland cotton ulloa et al 2020 witt et al 2020 directing irrigation into these periods may also have important positive effects on fiber quality but like the b15 field trials these simulations began with full soil moisture profiles which is not accounted for in the total irrigation amounts even so the consistency of the irrigation timing effects in the field trials and simulations indicate that with sufficient initial soil moisture the most water use efficient shp irrigation management divides most irrigation between reproductive and maturation periods with no or minimal irrigation during vegetative development this is inconsistent with the general cotton irrigation practice described in steduto et al 2012 which proposes that irrigation should meet crop demand during the vegetative phase to speed up canopy development following fig 3 fig 6 compares 066 yields and profits with those resulting from dryland production fig 6a plots the y066 and y000 lint distributions with the resulting δyi y066 y000 distribution in fig 6b the increased 066 yields relative to those of the 444 treatment produce a larger positive median δyi effect

444 irrigation is less than 15 6 while in fig 6f the probabilities with 066 irrigation are less than 7 6 4 discussion maximizing yield per unit of water input is an important part of the overall effort to increasing agricultural water productivity howell 2001 giordano et al 2021 irrigating at peak water productivity maximizes the yields and with commodity prices and production costs held constant the yield revenues and profits per unit of applied irrigation as a result extracting the most value from the southern ogallala aquifer s declining groundwater resource requires that producers manage irrigation at or near maximum irrigation water productivity iwp the simulations conducted here indicate that under current southern high plains climate conditions applying 30 5 35 6 cm 12 0 14 0 in of total irrigation during cotton s reproductive and maturation phases maximizes iwp in the region s cotton production although restricted well capacities might prevent these levels from being applied over an entire ¼ section center pivot during a crop s mid and final development phases lower capacity wells might provide those levels when applied over fractional pivot areas this suggests a simple management guideline for such wells irrigate at maximum iwp over areas that well capacity can support with the remainder of the pivot under dryland production with lower production costs if well capacity allows irrigation over an entire pivot to be applied at levels above maximum iwp yields may be marginally increased but at the expense of decreased water productivity in fig 2b the median yield effect of increasing irrigation from 48 3 to 50 8 cm 14 9 kg ha 1 is about one seventh that of increasing irrigation the same amount from 25 4 to 27 9 cm 107 9 kg ha 1 increasing total irrigation from 35 6 to 55 9 cm in fig 2a increases median yield by less than a third as much as that resulting from an equal increase from 12 7 to 33 0 cm thus irrigating at maximum iwp may reduce lint yields relative to applying higher irrigation levels but also conserves water that has greater yield and profit potential if applied more productively in subsequent years managing nonrenewable groundwater for irrigation is a global issue wada et al 2012 as global demand increases providing the most food and fiber from these limited resources requires identifying practices that maximize irrigation water productivity on a region by region and crop by crop basis irrigating at maximum efficiency requires iwp response data which in turn requires knowing the crop s irrigation response to varying irrigation levels and timing although field studies might estimate irrigation yield response they usually cannot be conducted over long enough periods to resolve it accurately over variable growing season climate conditions statistical methods based on panel data sets might relate irrigation practices to actual yield outcomes blanc and schlenker 2017 but those data sets may not provide enough data to describe the effects of the amount and timing of irrigation crop models by contrast can simulate arbitrary irrigation practices under controlled conditions and under weather conditions limited only by the availability of weather data as a result combined field study and crop simulation research protocols similar to that followed here i e multiple year field studies bordovsky et al 2015 with a crop model calibration component adhikari et al 2016 followed by model simulations under more representative weather conditions may be an important part of identifying efficient irrigation
