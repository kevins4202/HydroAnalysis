14315,the aim of this work was to investigate the efficiency of adsorption process as a post treatment to the electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr effluent for the removal of zn2 three nanomaterials were tested namely graphene oxide go silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 ph and adsorbent dosage were optimized and the maximum zn2 removal efficiency was reported to be 93 1 2 1 0 027 0 008 mg l 99 1 0 3 0 004 0 001 mg l and 83 2 3 5 0 067 0 001 mg l for go sio2 and sno2 respectively the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity was also reported to be 243 9 1 and 102 mg g for go sio2 and sno2 respectively adsorption isotherms verified a mechanism of monolayer adsorption for the three nanomaterials moreover adsorption kinetic studies revealed that chemisorption is the predominant removal mechanism for the three nanomaterials inner sphere surface complex mechanism was predominant in the case of zn2 adsorption on sno2 however adsorption on go and sio2 was governed by outer sphere surface mechanism at low ph values and inner sphere surface mechanism at high ph values thus the proposed two stage treatment of industrial wastewater was found to be efficient in removing zn2 from wastewater this finding can open the doors to introducing a novel integrated technology for industrial wastewater treatment keywords nanomaterials metal removal electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor adsorption industrial wastewater 1 introduction industries that generate wastewater rich in metals such as cd2 cr2 cu2 ni2 and zn2 are the most hazardous among other chemical intensive industries because of the metals high solubility in aquatic environments which allows them to be adsorbed by living organisms 1 adverse impacts of the presence of heavy metals on humans include skin irritations vomiting stomach nausea cramps and anemia the conventional processes for removing heavy metals from wastewater include many processes such as chemical precipitation flotation adsorption ion exchange electrochemical deposition membrane filtration electrodialysis and photocatalysis 2 one novel technology that has been recently employed for the treatment of steel industry wastewater is the electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr 3 the new technology combines membrane filtration biodegradation and electrochemical processes into one system to reduce membrane fouling and enhance effluent s quality 4 8 incorporation of electrochemical treatment introduces electrochemical mechanisms such as electrocoagulation electroosmosis and electrophoresis that are responsible for enhancing pollutant removal in addition to controlling the mobility of foulants and hence their depositions on the membrane surface the application of electric current releases various metal species in the system as a result of electrodes dissociation so as to contribute to the destabilization and aggregation of suspended solids and colloids through coagulation process 9 moreover electrophoretic motion allows the negatively charged foulants and extracellular polymeric substances to be transported towards the oppositely charged electrodes away from the membrane and thus reduces the formation of biofilms and membrane fouling 10 results obtained from previous studies when embr was employed for steel industry wastewater treatment showed that fe2 and zn2 removal was 98 4 1 1 and 93 8 2 7 respectively 3 in this study different nanomaterials were tested to achieve high efficient removal of zn2 to achieve almost a complete removal of zn2 to meet the standards of near potable water quality that permits wider reuse applications the nanomaterials tested in this work were graphene oxide go silicon dioxide also known as silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 various nanomaterials were tested for the removal of metal cations from wastewater carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnt go and metal oxides such as tio2 and mno2 are all examples of nanomaterials used for water treatment 11 the removal of heavy metals by go has been studied in literature reporting maximum adsorption capacities of 294 345 530 and 1119 mg g at ph 5 for cu2 zn2 cd2 and pb2 respectively 12 furthermore the removal of some metal cations such as cd2 and pb2 by sno2 was explored the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 1275 5 and 1265 8 mg g for cd2 and pb2 respectively 13 as3 was found to have a maximum adsorption capacity of 112 7 mg g on sno2 14 however the amount of literature available on metal cations removal by sio2 is very limited the scope of this paper was dedicated to the post treatment of embr effluent that contained traces of zn2 the main goal was to generate a treated effluent with zn2 levels that do not exceed the maximum allowable threshold according to the regulation supervision bureau rsb in abu dhabi uae 15 and therefore find ways for water reuse related applications the novelty of this research study was defined in terms of 1 embr adsorption integrated system shown in fig 1 was never reported in literature 2 post treatment of embr using go sio2 and sno2 nanomaterials as adsorbents was explored for the first time and 3 mechanism of metal removal in the integrated system was also highlighted by investigating adsorption isotherms and kinetics 2 experimental 2 1 embr lab scale system a continuous embr lab scale system which was previously designed 6 was utilized the embr operated at an optimal and constant current density of 10 a m2 16 hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt of 13 5 h and 10 d were maintained respectively the effective volume of the reactor was 22 5 l kubota corporation supplied the submerged microfiltration mf flat sheet membrane which had a pore size of 0 4 μm the membrane consists of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate and chlorinated polyethylene at a proportion of 1 2 2 2 the anodes were made of aluminum sheets with 25 porosity while the cathodes were thin stainless steel perforated mesh both electrodes were installed at a distance of 5 and 10 cm respectively from the membrane placed at the center of the reactor intermittent current supply of 5 min on 15 min off was ensured through electronic timer the embr was fed with synthetic steel making industry wastewater and the treated effluent of embr was post treated by nanomaterials table 1 illustrates the chemical oxygen demand cod fe2 zn2 po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations of the influent industrial wastewater and treated embr effluent used in this study 2 2 nanomaterials the nanomaterials used for this study were go sio2 and sno2 go was in the form of monolayer sheets dispersed in deionized water di water at a concentration of 4 mg ml obtained from sigma aldrich average sheet diameter 22 μm sno2 nanoparticles were purchased from sigma aldrich with an average particle diameter 100 nm sio2 nanoparticles having an average diameter 15 nm were supplied by eprui nanoparticles microspheres co ltd 2 3 characterization of nanomaterials the nanomaterials were inspected under high vacuum scanning electron microscopy sem using nova nanosem 650 with monopole magnetic immersion final lens and 60 objective lens geometry at electron beam energy of 10 kv chamber vacuum 10 mpa and magnification of 500 nm the chemical composition was also analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds non conductive samples were coated with 10 nm gold palladium coating to eliminate charging effect while using sem eds the raman spectra of the nanomaterials were obtained to get the structure by using witec alpha 300r confocal micro raman imaging spectrometer with led visible laser excitation source observed as a blue light at 532 nm under a backscattering geometry and diffraction limited lateral resolution of 200 300 nm adsorption of zn2 and the formation of new functionalities due to adsorbed species were investigated via fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy by using bruker s vertex 80v ft ir spectrometer with peak spectral resolution ir attenuated total reflectance atr spectra analysis was carried out in the wavelength range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 furthermore surface charges were determined from zeta potential measurements by using the phase analysis light scatting principle in nanobrook zetapals potential analyzer with a scattering angle of 15 to further understand the removal mechanism of zn2 by nanomaterials 2 4 adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were carried out at different dosages of each nanomaterial 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 and 2 wt and at different ph values 2 10 all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 0 2 c and at constant agitation rate of 100 rpm the nanomaterials were added to the embr effluent at a desired concentration and ph since go was suspended in water go was placed in falcon 15 ml polypropylene conical centrifuge tube and dried at 57 c to ensure the stability of the tube since it can withstand up to 60 c in memmert uf55 oven until the mass of tube is constant which indicates the complete evaporation of water ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 m naoh solution prepared from naoh pellets obtained from sigma aldrich and di water and 99 8 pure acetic acid supplied by sigma aldrich then the suspensions were ultra sonicated using branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaner and placed on a shaker at a constant agitation speed of 100 rpm supplied by labtech daihan for 4 h to ensure adsorption equilibrium has been reached at the end of adsorption experiments the suspensions were filtered through a 0 22 μm whatman nylon membrane filter with a diameter of 25 mm the concentrations of zn2 in the filtrate were measured by hach lck360 vials using hach dr 3900 bench top spectrophotometer equipped with radio frequency identification technology similarly fe2 cod and nh4 n concentrations were measured using hach lck 321 lck314 and lck303 vials the amount of zn2 adsorbed on nanomaterials qe mg g was calculated from the difference between the initial concentration c0 mg l in aqueous solution of embr effluent and equilibrium concentration ce mg l determined in solution after filtration according to eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m a d s o r b e n t where v is the volume of the suspension and madsorbent is the mass of the nanomaterial added the removal by adsorption is calculated according to eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 the effect of adsorbents dosage and ph was studied using the embr effluent synthetically prepared in the lab however to understand the adsorption mechanism of zn2 solely on nanomaterials adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetic electrophoretic mobility and ft ir studies were investigated using synthetic zn2 aqueous solution zinc chloride zncl2 was added to di water to synthesize a solution with the targeted concentration ph and adsorbent dosage studies were conducted in duplicates to ensure reliability and reproducibility of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem and raman characterization of go sio2 and sno2 nanomaterials all nanomaterials were characterized to better understand their shape and structure which would enhance the adsorption capacity of zn2 fig 2 a illustrates the sem image of sno2 nanoparticles the image verifies the near spherical feature and good dispersity most of the particles have a diameter of less than 100 nm fig 2b presents the room temperature raman spectra of pure sno2 the peaks at 637 cm 1 and 780 cm 1 correspond to a1g and b2g modes which are related to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of sn o bonds respectively 17 18 the peak at 482 cm 1 represents eg doubly degenerate mode arising from the vibration mode of oxide ions thus tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 is confirmed due to the appearance of these classical modes 18 fig 2c illustrates the sem image of go nanosheet the image verifies the sheet like form of go nanomaterials fig 2d illustrates raman spectrum of go nanosheets the d peak of go located at 1350 cm 1 is associated to the vibration of sp3 carbon atoms of defects and disorders this peak is common to all sp2 carbon lattice and arises from the stretching of cc bonds the g peak located at around 1600 cm 1 is associated to in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a graphitic 2d hexagonal lattice 19 the weak peak at 2700 cm 1 is an another indication of disorder due to out of plane vibrational mode and cooperation of d and g peaks result in an s3 peak 2850 cm 1 20 previous papers illustrated similar results 21 22 it was found that when single layer graphene sheets are transformed to the multilayer state about 2 6 layers the original aforementioned positions shifts to lower and higher wavenumbers from their original positions 23 24 furthermore fig 2e illustrates the sem image of sio2 nanoparticles confirming the nano size diameter of sio2 nanoparticles was measured to be 15 nm fig 2f illustrates raman spectrum of sio2 the peak at 334 cm 1 is due to o si o deformation silicate impurities the peak at 471 cm 1 is associated with o3sioh tetrahedral vibration the peak at 580 cm 1 is due to sio 3 ring breathing and at 674 cm 1 is due to si o si symmetric stretching this spectrum is close to the spectrum associated to amorphous diatomaceous silica with opal a structure 25 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the study of adsorbent dosage is important because the adsorbent surface provides the active sites for metal ions to be adsorbed the effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal of zn2 was investigated by varying the adsorbent wt from 0 1 to 2 wt for sno2 and sio2 and from 0 1 to 1 wt for go all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 0 2 c constant agitation rate of 100 rpm and at optimum ph values as per the results in section 3 3 fig 3 a represents the effect of adsorbent dosage of sno2 on zn2 removal it was found that the removal increased with the increase of sno2 dosage from 53 8 to 83 2 at 0 1 and 2 wt respectively however it was also observed that the rate of increase in the removal of zn2 was found higher at lower adsorbent dosage when compared to the rate of increase at higher dosage of sno2 i e 32 9 vs 5 05 when sno2 dosage was increased from 0 1 to 0 5 wt and from 1 to 2 wt respectively an increase in the adsorbent dosage above a certain limit had a slight effect on the increase in the removal efficiency of zn2 which could be attributed to the formation of aggregates at higher solid liquid interface areas or sedimentation of particles 26 this could also suggest a possible mechanism of a two stage adsorption of zn2 on sno2 fast formation of mono layer followed by slow plateau stage 27 in general the increase in the adsorbent dosage would increase the number of available sites in the same solution volume 28 at lower concentrations of adsorbent high amounts of zn2 ions are readily available to be adsorbed by the few available sites whereas the surface area of adsorbents increases at higher concentrations of adsorbents resulting in higher number of binding sites for the same liquid volume and hence higher rates of zn2 uptake this was reflected by the increase of zn2 removal efficiency when the dosage of sno2 also increased nevertheless the slight increase in the removal of zn2 when the concentration of sno2 increased beyond 1 wt could be explained by the fact that the available zn2 is insufficient to occupy the exchangeable sites on the adsorbent 29 it could also be attributed to the interference effect between the binding sites at higher concentrations of adsorbents which could cause physical blockage of the adsorption sites 30 the maximum removal of zn2 was reported at 83 2 3 5 when sno2 nanomaterials was dosed at 2 wt a similar behavior was observed for both sio2 and go as shown in fig 3b and c respectively sio2 and go maximum removal efficiency was reported to be 99 1 0 3 and 93 1 2 1 at 2 and 1 wt respectively 3 3 effect of ph metal ions in aqueous solutions may be present in various forms at different values of ph 31 as a result ph plays an important role in the adsorption of zn2 on nanomaterials based adsorbents the thermodynamic speciation of zn2 as a function of ph is shown eqs 3 7 3 zn2 h2o zn oh h 4 zn2 2h2o zn oh 2 2h 5 zn2 3h2o zn oh 3 3h 6 zn2 4h2o zn oh 4 2 4h 7 zn oh 2 s zn oh 2 aq fig 4 shows the different species of zinc in aqueous solutions the solution ph significantly affects the ionization degree the metal chemistry and the mineral s surface properties 32 the different metal species dominating in the solution at various ph differ in their charge and ability to adsorb on the mineral the activity of the adsorbent s functional groups is strongly affected by the solution ph the point of zero charge ph i e phpzc is the ph of the solution at which the overall observed charge on the surface of the mineral is zero at ph phpzc i e acidic media the functional groups of the adsorbents would be protonated and hence become positively charged surfaces this would reduce the attraction forces between the metal ions and the adsorbent resulting in low uptake rates in contrary at higher ph values i e alkaline media ph phpzc which means that the functional groups of the adsorbent become highly negative resulting in electrostatic attraction forces and eventually higher rates of metal uptake 33 nonetheless the solubility of metals decreases at high alkaline conditions allowing precipitation which might hinder the sorption process 34 the adsorption of zn2 on sno2 nanoparticles was studied over a ph range of 2 3 9 6 fig 5 a illustrates that the adsorption of zn2 increased from 12 7 to 79 8 in the ph range of 2 3 8 4 through which the predominant zn species would be zn2 as shown in fig 4 36 higher ph values resulted in the development of negative charge on the metal oxide surface which enhances electrostatic attraction forces and thus improves the cation exchange capacity of metal oxide nanoparticles 37 on the other hand the adsorption rates decreased at lower ph values due to the competition between h and zn2 ions in aqueous media 13 the slight decrease in the removal from 79 8 to 77 1 at the ph range of 8 4 9 6 could be explained by the little formation of hydroxide complexes such as zn oh 38 at highly alkaline ph values the predominant specie is zn oh 3 fig 4 which is difficult to be adsorbed due to its negative surface charge 39 thus the optimum ph which is associated with higher zn2 removal was at ph value of 8 4 furthermore similar pattern was observed when go nanomaterials were used the adsorption rate of zn2 increased at the ph range of 2 5 6 2 then slightly decreased when the ph increased from 6 2 to 7 4 as shown in fig 5b this could be also explained by the formation of zn oh which has a lower positive surface charge than zn2 and thus reducing the electrostatic attraction between the negative surface charges and the positive zn2 adsorbed species 39 at higher ph values i e 7 4 10 6 the removal efficiency decreased significantly from 90 8 to 42 5 as a result of metal low solubility at very high alkaline conditions allowing precipitation of zn oh 3 complex to occur 39 and thus complicating the sorption process 34 thus the optimum removal efficiency of zn2 was obtained at ph of 6 2 phpzc value of go was reported in literature to be 3 8 3 9 40 however the results obtained in section 3 7 suggest that zeta potential is always negative at the ph range 2 27 8 70 a medium s ph of a value greater than the phpzc causes the surface charge of go to be negative due to the deprotonation of the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go which provides more ligands to adsorb metals and thus forms electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and go nanosheets go is a promising adsorption based remediation approach due to its extremely high surface area and the presence of oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl on its basal plane 41 and carbonyl and carboxyl groups at the edges of nanosheets 42 the presence of these hydrophilic groups increases go dispersion in water and contributes to making go an excellent adsorbent similar pattern was reported for sio2 as shown in fig 5c removal of zn was studied over a ph range 2 3 10 8 the optimum ph was reported at 8 6 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are the equilibrium relationships between the adsorbed quantity of the adsorbate solid phase on the adsorbent and its concentration in the solution liquid phase the langmuir isotherm eqs 8 and 9 describes monolayer coverage of adsorbate over specific homogeneous sites these homogeneous sites are assumed to be identical energetically equivalent and distant from each other and there are no interactions between molecules adsorbed on neighboring sites 43 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e or in the linear form 9 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where qe and qm mg g are the equilibrium and maximum adsorption amount of metal ion per unit weight of adsorbent respectively kl represents the equilibrium constant of the equilibrium reaction l mg and ce is the concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium freundlich adsorption isotherm eqs 10 and 11 gives an expression encompassing the surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies 44 it is assumed that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupation 45 10 q e k c e 1 n or in the linear form 11 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where ce is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium or the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l and n and kf are freundlich constants of the system indicating the extent of the adsorption and the degree of non linearity between metal solution concentrates and adsorption respectively isotherm parameters were obtained by fitting the adsorption equilibrium data to the isotherm models for sno2 go and sio2 table 2 it can be concluded that the sorption isotherms are fitted better by the langmuir isotherm for the three nanomaterials this suggests that the sorption of metal ions on sno2 go and sio2 is governed by monolayer coverage which means that all the adsorbed molecules are in contact with the surface layer of the adsorbent from table 2 it can be also observed that the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity is in the order of go sno2 sio2 with 243 102 and 9 1 mg g respectively however the maximum zn2 removal efficiency was reported in the order of sio2 go sno2 with 99 1 0 3 93 1 2 1 and 83 2 3 5 respectively table 3 in other words despite the fact that go has the highest capacity amongst the three nanomaterials it did not have the highest removal efficiency of zn2 this could be related to the ionic strength and the presence of other competing ions in the solution especially when embr effluent was used shown before in table 1 the presence of other species would limit the go uptake of zn2 that means when the go surface is in contact with the present metals cations are surrounded by an electric double layer resulted from the electrostatic attraction forces in the case of high ionic strength wastewater containing zn2 fe2 nh4 those interactions with zn2 would decrease due to the compression of the double layer and hence lowering the specific uptake rate table 3 shows the removal efficiency of zn2 fe2 nh4 n and cod using go sno2 and sio2 3 5 kinetic studies the contact time between metal ions and the adsorbent is a crucial issue in the removal of contaminants from environment by adsorption kinetic studies provide important information about the rate at which the adsorbate is being adsorbed onto the adsorbent and can also help to understand the mechanism of the adsorption process the kinetics of an adsorption process was studied using the pseudo first order eqs 12 and 13 pseudo second order eqs 14 and 15 elovich adsorption kinetic models eq 16 and weber morris intraparticle diffusion eq 17 kinetic models 12 q e q t k 1 q e q t or in the linear form 13 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 14 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 q e k 2 t or in the linear form 15 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g are the capacities of zn2 adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min and k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg min 16 q t 1 β l n t 1 β l n α β where α and β are the elovich coefficients α represents the initial sorption rate mg g m and β represents the desorption constant g mg the aforementioned kinetic models were not able to identify the diffusion mechanism thus intraparticle diffusion model was tested 17 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant g mg min1 2 and c is the intercept in the plot of qt vs t1 2 that is related to the thickness of boundary layer and hence the larger the intercept c the greater is the contribution of the surface adsorption in the rate controlling step it was found that for the intraparticle diffusion to be the sole rate limiting step the plot of qt vs t1 2 should pass through the origin 46 the experimental data were well fitted by the pseudo second order rate kinetic model suggesting that chemisorption occurred between zn2 and sno2 nanospheres is the adsorption mechanism chemisorption involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between sno2 and zn2 similarly go and sio2 exhibited the same behavior thus chemisorption is the prevalent adsorption mechanism for the three nanomaterials tested table 4 shows the pseudo second order calculated kinetic parameters for zn2 adsorption on the three nanomaterials tested the kinetic models plots are shown in the supplementary materials the r2 of weber morris intraparticle diffusion model plot did not affirm that the intraparticle diffusion process is the rate limiting step however the linearity of the plots illustrates that intraparticle diffusion plays a role in the uptake of zn2 by sno2 thus both surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion were involved in the rate limiting step 46 the other two nanomaterials showed the same results as well in other words intraparticle diffusion played a role in the uptake of zn2 but it was not the rate limiting step 3 6 eds and ft ir characterization of nanomaterials before and after zn2 adsorption analysis eds analyses revealed peaks associated with zn2 confirming the adsorption by sno2 fig 6 a sio2 fig 6c and go fig 6e also ft ir analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups on the surface of sno2 fig 6b sio2 fig 6d and go fig 6f as shown in fig 6b the ft ir spectrum of pure sno2 shows characteristic peak at around 667 cm 1 this peak can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the o sn o bond formed by oxalation reactions 47 the ft ir spectrum of sno2 nanospheres has strong hydroxyl stretching 3290 cm 1 and bending 1687 cm 1 vibrations of physically adsorbed h2o 48 co stretching modes of adsorbed co2 2359 cm 1 49 50 a peak appeared after zn2 adsorption at around 457 cm 1 which is attributed to zn o stretching 51 as for sio2 shown in fig 6d the peaks at 1080 cm 1 and 450 cm 1 are due to siosi bonds and the peaks at 3424 cm 1 and 1638 cm 1 are due to oh stretching and bending vibrations respectively of physically adsorbed water a peak at 2352 cm 1 can be observed for co stretching mode of adsorbed co2 the peak at 629 cm 1 is attributed to si si bond 52 the peak at 3670 cm 1 stems from sioh stretching mode 53 it can be observed from the intensity of the peaks that the peaks corresponds to si o si slightly shifts to lower wavelengths after zn2 adsorption which might be justified by the formation of si o zn bond which decreases the strength of si o bond this suggests an inner sphere complex formation as for go shown in fig 6f the peak at 3304 cm 1 is corresponding to oh groups 54 while a peak at 1634 cm 1 can be observed due to adsorbed water or carbonyl groups also the small peak at 1351 cm 1 is associated to epoxy group coc due to coo stretching and bending 55 and the peak at 2341 cm 1 is attributed to stretching modes of co 49 50 it can be noticed that the peak at 2341 cm 1 shifts to lower wavelength after zn2 adsorption to 2318 cm 1 which verifies that chemisorption took place as a result of the presence of the functional groups present on the edges which are carbonyl and carboxyl 3 7 electrophoretic mobility study of nanomaterials before and after zn2 adsorption the surface of a solid acquires an electric charge when a solid is in contact with a liquid in the case of metal oxides ionization of surface groups and specific ion adsorption are the predominant mechanisms hydrogen ions transfer to a neighboring oxygen atom directly or through grotthuss process results in a surface of metal hydroxides and bridging oxygens for instance in the case of sno2 the amphoteric nature of metal oxides enables them to accept or denote a proton according to following reactions 18 snoh sno h deprotonation 19 snoh h snoh2 protonation similarly the reactions corresponding to go are 20 soh so h deprotonation 21 soh h soh2 protonation where s represents the surface of go nanosheets and oh represents the oxygen containing functional groups the protonation and deprotonation reactions for sio2 follow the same mechanism the surface oh on sio2 was characterized by weak acidity where the acid dissociation constant of sioh is estimated to be 10 7 the high electron affinity of the si ion causes the free electron pairs on the oxygen atom to be of relatively low activity and this makes the basicity also low 56 which explains the low maximum adsorption capacity of zn2 on sio2 found in section 3 4 when compared to go and sno2 electrical double layer edl is formed because of the electrostatic and chemical interaction at the solid solution interface 57 58 the inner layer is the charge on the mineral surface while the outer layer can be composed of two types of sorbing ions inner sphere complexes and outer sphere complexes fig 7 a shows the zeta potentials of sno2 in both the presence and absence of adsorbed zn2 the phpzc of sno2 was 4 2 where the net surface charge was zero the phpzc was derived by linear interpolarion of the two points above and below the x axis the adsorption of zn2 increased the phpzc to approximately 5 4 the isoelectric point iep of metal oxides is determined by protonation and deprotonation of surface oh groups in the near neutral ph environment sno2 nanospheres were negatively charged as shown in fig 7a which indicates the existence of negative surface oh groups the formation of outer sphere surface complexes cannot shift the phpzc because of the absence of a chemical reaction between the adsorbate and the surface that could change the surface charge hence the shift of phpzc towards a higher ph range in this case shown in fig 7a indicates the formation of cationic positively charged surface complexes this was in agreement with the expected finding because cationic zn2 is the predominant species at ph 8 as shown in fig 4 36 similarly go and sio2 exhibit a similar behavior at low ph values namely at a ph of 4 and 6 1 for sio2 and go respectively as shown in fig 7b and c respectively below the aforementioned ph values the curve of adsorption of zn2 shifts to the left fig 7b and c with respect to the curve of the nanoparticles before adsorption this can be attributed to the possibility of outer sphere complex formation of zn complexes outer sphere surface complexes were reported to have no effect on iep because no chemical reaction occurs between the adsorbate and adsorbent the shift towards the left may be justified by the adsorption of cl ions present due to dissolving zncl2 in di water which may form inner sphere cl anionic surface complexes on sio2 and go nanomaterials thus it could be concluded that inner sphere complexation is predominant mechanism for zn2 adsorption on sno2 moreover zn2 sorption on go nanosheets and sio2 nanoparticles is mainly attributed to outer sphere surface complexation or ion exchange at low ph and inner sphere surface complexation at high ph values this finding is in agreement with previous findings of studies that addressed the removal of other metal cations by go 31 a previous study on the sorption of cd2 and co2 by go has also shown that the delocalized π electron systems of graphene sheets can act as lewis base to form electron through the lewis donor acceptor complexes with zn2 strong surface complexation between go nanosheets and zn2 occurs through the lewis acid base interaction which also contributes to zn2 sorption on go nansheets 31 furthermore zeta potential determines the colloidal stability of particles in a suspension for instance the zeta potential of the charged go surfaces becomes much less negative and leads to colloidal instability at low ph values as can be concluded from fig 7c these findings suggest that the electrostatic repulsions between ionized carboxyl groups at the go sheet edges provide the major barrier preventing the go sheets from aggregating 41 also adsorption of zn2 on go at high ph values i e above 6 1 decreases the colloidal stability and increases aggregation similarly the same findings can be concluded for adsorption of zn2 on sio2 and sno2 thus in general colloidal stability decreases after adsorption for the three nanomaterials tested 3 8 sio2 adsorbent regeneration as shown previously sio2 was found to be the most efficient adsorbent for zn2 removal from embr effluent to test the recycling potential of this adsorbent zn2 loaded adsorbent was separated and gently washed with distilled deionized water to remove any unadsorbed zn2 then the adsorbent was placed in di water and hcl was added until a ph of 2 1 was reached the mixture was agitated for 2 h and the amount of desorbed zn2 was measured to estimate the amount of zn2 still adsorbed and thus desorption percentage one run was conducted and it was found that 64 2 of the adsorbed zn2 was desorbed into the mixture thus showing a potential to recycle the adsorbent and reuse it for zn2 removal more desorption studies can be conducted in the future to find the optimum method to obtain the highest desorption 4 conclusions in this study zn2 in the treated embr effluent was post treated by adsorption using nanomaterials three nanomaterials were tested namely go sio2 and sno2 ph and adsorbent dosage were optimized and the maximum zn removal efficiency was reported to be 93 1 2 1 99 1 0 3 and 83 2 3 5 for go sio2 and sno2 respectively the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity were reported to be 243 9 1 and 102 mg g for go sio2 and sno2 respectively adsorption isotherms verified a mechanism of monolayer adsorption for the three nanomaterials tested moreover adsorption kinetic studies revealed that chemisorption is the predominant removal mechanism for the three nanomaterials adsorption of zn2 on sno2 followed inner sphere surface complex mechanism moreover adsorption of zn2 on sio2 and go followed inner sphere mechanism for higher ph values and outer sphere surface complex at low ph values as a result using a two stage treatment process that involves embr technology and nanomaterials has been found to be promising for industrial wastewater rich in metals treatment future work should address studying the scalability of the integrated system to investigate if the proposed technology can be applied on an industrial scale and conducting a thorough techno economic analysis and comparing the economic

14315,the aim of this work was to investigate the efficiency of adsorption process as a post treatment to the electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr effluent for the removal of zn2 three nanomaterials were tested namely graphene oxide go silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 ph and adsorbent dosage were optimized and the maximum zn2 removal efficiency was reported to be 93 1 2 1 0 027 0 008 mg l 99 1 0 3 0 004 0 001 mg l and 83 2 3 5 0 067 0 001 mg l for go sio2 and sno2 respectively the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity was also reported to be 243 9 1 and 102 mg g for go sio2 and sno2 respectively adsorption isotherms verified a mechanism of monolayer adsorption for the three nanomaterials moreover adsorption kinetic studies revealed that chemisorption is the predominant removal mechanism for the three nanomaterials inner sphere surface complex mechanism was predominant in the case of zn2 adsorption on sno2 however adsorption on go and sio2 was governed by outer sphere surface mechanism at low ph values and inner sphere surface mechanism at high ph values thus the proposed two stage treatment of industrial wastewater was found to be efficient in removing zn2 from wastewater this finding can open the doors to introducing a novel integrated technology for industrial wastewater treatment keywords nanomaterials metal removal electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor adsorption industrial wastewater 1 introduction industries that generate wastewater rich in metals such as cd2 cr2 cu2 ni2 and zn2 are the most hazardous among other chemical intensive industries because of the metals high solubility in aquatic environments which allows them to be adsorbed by living organisms 1 adverse impacts of the presence of heavy metals on humans include skin irritations vomiting stomach nausea cramps and anemia the conventional processes for removing heavy metals from wastewater include many processes such as chemical precipitation flotation adsorption ion exchange electrochemical deposition membrane filtration electrodialysis and photocatalysis 2 one novel technology that has been recently employed for the treatment of steel industry wastewater is the electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor embr 3 the new technology combines membrane filtration biodegradation and electrochemical processes into one system to reduce membrane fouling and enhance effluent s quality 4 8 incorporation of electrochemical treatment introduces electrochemical mechanisms such as electrocoagulation electroosmosis and electrophoresis that are responsible for enhancing pollutant removal in addition to controlling the mobility of foulants and hence their depositions on the membrane surface the application of electric current releases various metal species in the system as a result of electrodes dissociation so as to contribute to the destabilization and aggregation of suspended solids and colloids through coagulation process 9 moreover electrophoretic motion allows the negatively charged foulants and extracellular polymeric substances to be transported towards the oppositely charged electrodes away from the membrane and thus reduces the formation of biofilms and membrane fouling 10 results obtained from previous studies when embr was employed for steel industry wastewater treatment showed that fe2 and zn2 removal was 98 4 1 1 and 93 8 2 7 respectively 3 in this study different nanomaterials were tested to achieve high efficient removal of zn2 to achieve almost a complete removal of zn2 to meet the standards of near potable water quality that permits wider reuse applications the nanomaterials tested in this work were graphene oxide go silicon dioxide also known as silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 various nanomaterials were tested for the removal of metal cations from wastewater carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnt go and metal oxides such as tio2 and mno2 are all examples of nanomaterials used for water treatment 11 the removal of heavy metals by go has been studied in literature reporting maximum adsorption capacities of 294 345 530 and 1119 mg g at ph 5 for cu2 zn2 cd2 and pb2 respectively 12 furthermore the removal of some metal cations such as cd2 and pb2 by sno2 was explored the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 1275 5 and 1265 8 mg g for cd2 and pb2 respectively 13 as3 was found to have a maximum adsorption capacity of 112 7 mg g on sno2 14 however the amount of literature available on metal cations removal by sio2 is very limited the scope of this paper was dedicated to the post treatment of embr effluent that contained traces of zn2 the main goal was to generate a treated effluent with zn2 levels that do not exceed the maximum allowable threshold according to the regulation supervision bureau rsb in abu dhabi uae 15 and therefore find ways for water reuse related applications the novelty of this research study was defined in terms of 1 embr adsorption integrated system shown in fig 1 was never reported in literature 2 post treatment of embr using go sio2 and sno2 nanomaterials as adsorbents was explored for the first time and 3 mechanism of metal removal in the integrated system was also highlighted by investigating adsorption isotherms and kinetics 2 experimental 2 1 embr lab scale system a continuous embr lab scale system which was previously designed 6 was utilized the embr operated at an optimal and constant current density of 10 a m2 16 hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt of 13 5 h and 10 d were maintained respectively the effective volume of the reactor was 22 5 l kubota corporation supplied the submerged microfiltration mf flat sheet membrane which had a pore size of 0 4 μm the membrane consists of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate and chlorinated polyethylene at a proportion of 1 2 2 2 the anodes were made of aluminum sheets with 25 porosity while the cathodes were thin stainless steel perforated mesh both electrodes were installed at a distance of 5 and 10 cm respectively from the membrane placed at the center of the reactor intermittent current supply of 5 min on 15 min off was ensured through electronic timer the embr was fed with synthetic steel making industry wastewater and the treated effluent of embr was post treated by nanomaterials table 1 illustrates the chemical oxygen demand cod fe2 zn2 po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations of the influent industrial wastewater and treated embr effluent used in this study 2 2 nanomaterials the nanomaterials used for this study were go sio2 and sno2 go was in the form of monolayer sheets dispersed in deionized water di water at a concentration of 4 mg ml obtained from sigma aldrich average sheet diameter 22 μm sno2 nanoparticles were purchased from sigma aldrich with an average particle diameter 100 nm sio2 nanoparticles having an average diameter 15 nm were supplied by eprui nanoparticles microspheres co ltd 2 3 characterization of nanomaterials the nanomaterials were inspected under high vacuum scanning electron microscopy sem using nova nanosem 650 with monopole magnetic immersion final lens and 60 objective lens geometry at electron beam energy of 10 kv chamber vacuum 10 mpa and magnification of 500 nm the chemical composition was also analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds non conductive samples were coated with 10 nm gold palladium coating to eliminate charging effect while using sem eds the raman spectra of the nanomaterials were obtained to get the structure by using witec alpha 300r confocal micro raman imaging spectrometer with led visible laser excitation source observed as a blue light at 532 nm under a backscattering geometry and diffraction limited lateral resolution of 200 300 nm adsorption of zn2 and the formation of new functionalities due to adsorbed species were investigated via fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy by using bruker s vertex 80v ft ir spectrometer with peak spectral resolution ir attenuated total reflectance atr spectra analysis was carried out in the wavelength range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 furthermore surface charges were determined from zeta potential measurements by using the phase analysis light scatting principle in nanobrook zetapals potential analyzer with a scattering angle of 15 to further understand the removal mechanism of zn2 by nanomaterials 2 4 adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were carried out at different dosages of each nanomaterial 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 and 2 wt and at different ph values 2 10 all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 0 2 c and at constant agitation rate of 100 rpm the nanomaterials were added to the embr effluent at a desired concentration and ph since go was suspended in water go was placed in falcon 15 ml polypropylene conical centrifuge tube and dried at 57 c to ensure the stability of the tube since it can withstand up to 60 c in memmert uf55 oven until the mass of tube is constant which indicates the complete evaporation of water ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 m naoh solution prepared from naoh pellets obtained from sigma aldrich and di water and 99 8 pure acetic acid supplied by sigma aldrich then the suspensions were ultra sonicated using branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaner and placed on a shaker at a constant agitation speed of 100 rpm supplied by labtech daihan for 4 h to ensure adsorption equilibrium has been reached at the end of adsorption experiments the suspensions were filtered through a 0 22 μm whatman nylon membrane filter with a diameter of 25 mm the concentrations of zn2 in the filtrate were measured by hach lck360 vials using hach dr 3900 bench top spectrophotometer equipped with radio frequency identification technology similarly fe2 cod and nh4 n concentrations were measured using hach lck 321 lck314 and lck303 vials the amount of zn2 adsorbed on nanomaterials qe mg g was calculated from the difference between the initial concentration c0 mg l in aqueous solution of embr effluent and equilibrium concentration ce mg l determined in solution after filtration according to eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m a d s o r b e n t where v is the volume of the suspension and madsorbent is the mass of the nanomaterial added the removal by adsorption is calculated according to eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 the effect of adsorbents dosage and ph was studied using the embr effluent synthetically prepared in the lab however to understand the adsorption mechanism of zn2 solely on nanomaterials adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetic electrophoretic mobility and ft ir studies were investigated using synthetic zn2 aqueous solution zinc chloride zncl2 was added to di water to synthesize a solution with the targeted concentration ph and adsorbent dosage studies were conducted in duplicates to ensure reliability and reproducibility of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem and raman characterization of go sio2 and sno2 nanomaterials all nanomaterials were characterized to better understand their shape and structure which would enhance the adsorption capacity of zn2 fig 2 a illustrates the sem image of sno2 nanoparticles the image verifies the near spherical feature and good dispersity most of the particles have a diameter of less than 100 nm fig 2b presents the room temperature raman spectra of pure sno2 the peaks at 637 cm 1 and 780 cm 1 correspond to a1g and b2g modes which are related to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of sn o bonds respectively 17 18 the peak at 482 cm 1 represents eg doubly degenerate mode arising from the vibration mode of oxide ions thus tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 is confirmed due to the appearance of these classical modes 18 fig 2c illustrates the sem image of go nanosheet the image verifies the sheet like form of go nanomaterials fig 2d illustrates raman spectrum of go nanosheets the d peak of go located at 1350 cm 1 is associated to the vibration of sp3 carbon atoms of defects and disorders this peak is common to all sp2 carbon lattice and arises from the stretching of cc bonds the g peak located at around 1600 cm 1 is associated to in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a graphitic 2d hexagonal lattice 19 the weak peak at 2700 cm 1 is an another indication of disorder due to out of plane vibrational mode and cooperation of d and g peaks result in an s3 peak 2850 cm 1 20 previous papers illustrated similar results 21 22 it was found that when single layer graphene sheets are transformed to the multilayer state about 2 6 layers the original aforementioned positions shifts to lower and higher wavenumbers from their original positions 23 24 furthermore fig 2e illustrates the sem image of sio2 nanoparticles confirming the nano size diameter of sio2 nanoparticles was measured to be 15 nm fig 2f illustrates raman spectrum of sio2 the peak at 334 cm 1 is due to o si o deformation silicate impurities the peak at 471 cm 1 is associated with o3sioh tetrahedral vibration the peak at 580 cm 1 is due to sio 3 ring breathing and at 674 cm 1 is due to si o si symmetric stretching this spectrum is close to the spectrum associated to amorphous diatomaceous silica with opal a structure 25 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the study of adsorbent dosage is important because the adsorbent surface provides the active sites for metal ions to be adsorbed the effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal of zn2 was investigated by varying the adsorbent wt from 0 1 to 2 wt for sno2 and sio2 and from 0 1 to 1 wt for go all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 0 2 c constant agitation rate of 100 rpm and at optimum ph values as per the results in section 3 3 fig 3 a represents the effect of adsorbent dosage of sno2 on zn2 removal it was found that the removal increased with the increase of sno2 dosage from 53 8 to 83 2 at 0 1 and 2 wt respectively however it was also observed that the rate of increase in the removal of zn2 was found higher at lower adsorbent dosage when compared to the rate of increase at higher dosage of sno2 i e 32 9 vs 5 05 when sno2 dosage was increased from 0 1 to 0 5 wt and from 1 to 2 wt respectively an increase in the adsorbent dosage above a certain limit had a slight effect on the increase in the removal efficiency of zn2 which could be attributed to the formation of aggregates at higher solid liquid interface areas or sedimentation of particles 26 this could also suggest a possible mechanism of a two stage adsorption of zn2 on sno2 fast formation of mono layer followed by slow plateau stage 27 in general the increase in the adsorbent dosage would increase the number of available sites in the same solution volume 28 at lower concentrations of adsorbent high amounts of zn2 ions are readily available to be adsorbed by the few available sites whereas the surface area of adsorbents increases at higher concentrations of adsorbents resulting in higher number of binding sites for the same liquid volume and hence higher rates of zn2 uptake this was reflected by the increase of zn2 removal efficiency when the dosage of sno2 also increased nevertheless the slight increase in the removal of zn2 when the concentration of sno2 increased beyond 1 wt could be explained by the fact that the available zn2 is insufficient to occupy the exchangeable sites on the adsorbent 29 it could also be attributed to the interference effect between the binding sites at higher concentrations of adsorbents which could cause physical blockage of the adsorption sites 30 the maximum removal of zn2 was reported at 83 2 3 5 when sno2 nanomaterials was dosed at 2 wt a similar behavior was observed for both sio2 and go as shown in fig 3b and c respectively sio2 and go maximum removal efficiency was reported to be 99 1 0 3 and 93 1 2 1 at 2 and 1 wt respectively 3 3 effect of ph metal ions in aqueous solutions may be present in various forms at different values of ph 31 as a result ph plays an important role in the adsorption of zn2 on nanomaterials based adsorbents the thermodynamic speciation of zn2 as a function of ph is shown eqs 3 7 3 zn2 h2o zn oh h 4 zn2 2h2o zn oh 2 2h 5 zn2 3h2o zn oh 3 3h 6 zn2 4h2o zn oh 4 2 4h 7 zn oh 2 s zn oh 2 aq fig 4 shows the different species of zinc in aqueous solutions the solution ph significantly affects the ionization degree the metal chemistry and the mineral s surface properties 32 the different metal species dominating in the solution at various ph differ in their charge and ability to adsorb on the mineral the activity of the adsorbent s functional groups is strongly affected by the solution ph the point of zero charge ph i e phpzc is the ph of the solution at which the overall observed charge on the surface of the mineral is zero at ph phpzc i e acidic media the functional groups of the adsorbents would be protonated and hence become positively charged surfaces this would reduce the attraction forces between the metal ions and the adsorbent resulting in low uptake rates in contrary at higher ph values i e alkaline media ph phpzc which means that the functional groups of the adsorbent become highly negative resulting in electrostatic attraction forces and eventually higher rates of metal uptake 33 nonetheless the solubility of metals decreases at high alkaline conditions allowing precipitation which might hinder the sorption process 34 the adsorption of zn2 on sno2 nanoparticles was studied over a ph range of 2 3 9 6 fig 5 a illustrates that the adsorption of zn2 increased from 12 7 to 79 8 in the ph range of 2 3 8 4 through which the predominant zn species would be zn2 as shown in fig 4 36 higher ph values resulted in the development of negative charge on the metal oxide surface which enhances electrostatic attraction forces and thus improves the cation exchange capacity of metal oxide nanoparticles 37 on the other hand the adsorption rates decreased at lower ph values due to the competition between h and zn2 ions in aqueous media 13 the slight decrease in the removal from 79 8 to 77 1 at the ph range of 8 4 9 6 could be explained by the little formation of hydroxide complexes such as zn oh 38 at highly alkaline ph values the predominant specie is zn oh 3 fig 4 which is difficult to be adsorbed due to its negative surface charge 39 thus the optimum ph which is associated with higher zn2 removal was at ph value of 8 4 furthermore similar pattern was observed when go nanomaterials were used the adsorption rate of zn2 increased at the ph range of 2 5 6 2 then slightly decreased when the ph increased from 6 2 to 7 4 as shown in fig 5b this could be also explained by the formation of zn oh which has a lower positive surface charge than zn2 and thus reducing the electrostatic attraction between the negative surface charges and the positive zn2 adsorbed species 39 at higher ph values i e 7 4 10 6 the removal efficiency decreased significantly from 90 8 to 42 5 as a result of metal low solubility at very high alkaline conditions allowing precipitation of zn oh 3 complex to occur 39 and thus complicating the sorption process 34 thus the optimum removal efficiency of zn2 was obtained at ph of 6 2 phpzc value of go was reported in literature to be 3 8 3 9 40 however the results obtained in section 3 7 suggest that zeta potential is always negative at the ph range 2 27 8 70 a medium s ph of a value greater than the phpzc causes the surface charge of go to be negative due to the deprotonation of the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go which provides more ligands to adsorb metals and thus forms electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and go nanosheets go is a promising adsorption based remediation approach due to its extremely high surface area and the presence of oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl on its basal plane 41 and carbonyl and carboxyl groups at the edges of nanosheets 42 the presence of these hydrophilic groups increases go dispersion in water and contributes to making go an excellent adsorbent similar pattern was reported for sio2 as shown in fig 5c removal of zn was studied over a ph range 2 3 10 8 the optimum ph was reported at 8 6 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are the equilibrium relationships between the adsorbed quantity of the adsorbate solid phase on the adsorbent and its concentration in the solution liquid phase the langmuir isotherm eqs 8 and 9 describes monolayer coverage of adsorbate over specific homogeneous sites these homogeneous sites are assumed to be identical energetically equivalent and distant from each other and there are no interactions between molecules adsorbed on neighboring sites 43 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e or in the linear form 9 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where qe and qm mg g are the equilibrium and maximum adsorption amount of metal ion per unit weight of adsorbent respectively kl represents the equilibrium constant of the equilibrium reaction l mg and ce is the concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium freundlich adsorption isotherm eqs 10 and 11 gives an expression encompassing the surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies 44 it is assumed that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupation 45 10 q e k c e 1 n or in the linear form 11 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where ce is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium or the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l and n and kf are freundlich constants of the system indicating the extent of the adsorption and the degree of non linearity between metal solution concentrates and adsorption respectively isotherm parameters were obtained by fitting the adsorption equilibrium data to the isotherm models for sno2 go and sio2 table 2 it can be concluded that the sorption isotherms are fitted better by the langmuir isotherm for the three nanomaterials this suggests that the sorption of metal ions on sno2 go and sio2 is governed by monolayer coverage which means that all the adsorbed molecules are in contact with the surface layer of the adsorbent from table 2 it can be also observed that the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity is in the order of go sno2 sio2 with 243 102 and 9 1 mg g respectively however the maximum zn2 removal efficiency was reported in the order of sio2 go sno2 with 99 1 0 3 93 1 2 1 and 83 2 3 5 respectively table 3 in other words despite the fact that go has the highest capacity amongst the three nanomaterials it did not have the highest removal efficiency of zn2 this could be related to the ionic strength and the presence of other competing ions in the solution especially when embr effluent was used shown before in table 1 the presence of other species would limit the go uptake of zn2 that means when the go surface is in contact with the present metals cations are surrounded by an electric double layer resulted from the electrostatic attraction forces in the case of high ionic strength wastewater containing zn2 fe2 nh4 those interactions with zn2 would decrease due to the compression of the double layer and hence lowering the specific uptake rate table 3 shows the removal efficiency of zn2 fe2 nh4 n and cod using go sno2 and sio2 3 5 kinetic studies the contact time between metal ions and the adsorbent is a crucial issue in the removal of contaminants from environment by adsorption kinetic studies provide important information about the rate at which the adsorbate is being adsorbed onto the adsorbent and can also help to understand the mechanism of the adsorption process the kinetics of an adsorption process was studied using the pseudo first order eqs 12 and 13 pseudo second order eqs 14 and 15 elovich adsorption kinetic models eq 16 and weber morris intraparticle diffusion eq 17 kinetic models 12 q e q t k 1 q e q t or in the linear form 13 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 14 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 q e k 2 t or in the linear form 15 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g are the capacities of zn2 adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min and k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg min 16 q t 1 β l n t 1 β l n α β where α and β are the elovich coefficients α represents the initial sorption rate mg g m and β represents the desorption constant g mg the aforementioned kinetic models were not able to identify the diffusion mechanism thus intraparticle diffusion model was tested 17 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant g mg min1 2 and c is the intercept in the plot of qt vs t1 2 that is related to the thickness of boundary layer and hence the larger the intercept c the greater is the contribution of the surface adsorption in the rate controlling step it was found that for the intraparticle diffusion to be the sole rate limiting step the plot of qt vs t1 2 should pass through the origin 46 the experimental data were well fitted by the pseudo second order rate kinetic model suggesting that chemisorption occurred between zn2 and sno2 nanospheres is the adsorption mechanism chemisorption involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between sno2 and zn2 similarly go and sio2 exhibited the same behavior thus chemisorption is the prevalent adsorption mechanism for the three nanomaterials tested table 4 shows the pseudo second order calculated kinetic parameters for zn2 adsorption on the three nanomaterials tested the kinetic models plots are shown in the supplementary materials the r2 of weber morris intraparticle diffusion model plot did not affirm that the intraparticle diffusion process is the rate limiting step however the linearity of the plots illustrates that intraparticle diffusion plays a role in the uptake of zn2 by sno2 thus both surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion were involved in the rate limiting step 46 the other two nanomaterials showed the same results as well in other words intraparticle diffusion played a role in the uptake of zn2 but it was not the rate limiting step 3 6 eds and ft ir characterization of nanomaterials before and after zn2 adsorption analysis eds analyses revealed peaks associated with zn2 confirming the adsorption by sno2 fig 6 a sio2 fig 6c and go fig 6e also ft ir analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups on the surface of sno2 fig 6b sio2 fig 6d and go fig 6f as shown in fig 6b the ft ir spectrum of pure sno2 shows characteristic peak at around 667 cm 1 this peak can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the o sn o bond formed by oxalation reactions 47 the ft ir spectrum of sno2 nanospheres has strong hydroxyl stretching 3290 cm 1 and bending 1687 cm 1 vibrations of physically adsorbed h2o 48 co stretching modes of adsorbed co2 2359 cm 1 49 50 a peak appeared after zn2 adsorption at around 457 cm 1 which is attributed to zn o stretching 51 as for sio2 shown in fig 6d the peaks at 1080 cm 1 and 450 cm 1 are due to siosi bonds and the peaks at 3424 cm 1 and 1638 cm 1 are due to oh stretching and bending vibrations respectively of physically adsorbed water a peak at 2352 cm 1 can be observed for co stretching mode of adsorbed co2 the peak at 629 cm 1 is attributed to si si bond 52 the peak at 3670 cm 1 stems from sioh stretching mode 53 it can be observed from the intensity of the peaks that the peaks corresponds to si o si slightly shifts to lower wavelengths after zn2 adsorption which might be justified by the formation of si o zn bond which decreases the strength of si o bond this suggests an inner sphere complex formation as for go shown in fig 6f the peak at 3304 cm 1 is corresponding to oh groups 54 while a peak at 1634 cm 1 can be observed due to adsorbed water or carbonyl groups also the small peak at 1351 cm 1 is associated to epoxy group coc due to coo stretching and bending 55 and the peak at 2341 cm 1 is attributed to stretching modes of co 49 50 it can be noticed that the peak at 2341 cm 1 shifts to lower wavelength after zn2 adsorption to 2318 cm 1 which verifies that chemisorption took place as a result of the presence of the functional groups present on the edges which are carbonyl and carboxyl 3 7 electrophoretic mobility study of nanomaterials before and after zn2 adsorption the surface of a solid acquires an electric charge when a solid is in contact with a liquid in the case of metal oxides ionization of surface groups and specific ion adsorption are the predominant mechanisms hydrogen ions transfer to a neighboring oxygen atom directly or through grotthuss process results in a surface of metal hydroxides and bridging oxygens for instance in the case of sno2 the amphoteric nature of metal oxides enables them to accept or denote a proton according to following reactions 18 snoh sno h deprotonation 19 snoh h snoh2 protonation similarly the reactions corresponding to go are 20 soh so h deprotonation 21 soh h soh2 protonation where s represents the surface of go nanosheets and oh represents the oxygen containing functional groups the protonation and deprotonation reactions for sio2 follow the same mechanism the surface oh on sio2 was characterized by weak acidity where the acid dissociation constant of sioh is estimated to be 10 7 the high electron affinity of the si ion causes the free electron pairs on the oxygen atom to be of relatively low activity and this makes the basicity also low 56 which explains the low maximum adsorption capacity of zn2 on sio2 found in section 3 4 when compared to go and sno2 electrical double layer edl is formed because of the electrostatic and chemical interaction at the solid solution interface 57 58 the inner layer is the charge on the mineral surface while the outer layer can be composed of two types of sorbing ions inner sphere complexes and outer sphere complexes fig 7 a shows the zeta potentials of sno2 in both the presence and absence of adsorbed zn2 the phpzc of sno2 was 4 2 where the net surface charge was zero the phpzc was derived by linear interpolarion of the two points above and below the x axis the adsorption of zn2 increased the phpzc to approximately 5 4 the isoelectric point iep of metal oxides is determined by protonation and deprotonation of surface oh groups in the near neutral ph environment sno2 nanospheres were negatively charged as shown in fig 7a which indicates the existence of negative surface oh groups the formation of outer sphere surface complexes cannot shift the phpzc because of the absence of a chemical reaction between the adsorbate and the surface that could change the surface charge hence the shift of phpzc towards a higher ph range in this case shown in fig 7a indicates the formation of cationic positively charged surface complexes this was in agreement with the expected finding because cationic zn2 is the predominant species at ph 8 as shown in fig 4 36 similarly go and sio2 exhibit a similar behavior at low ph values namely at a ph of 4 and 6 1 for sio2 and go respectively as shown in fig 7b and c respectively below the aforementioned ph values the curve of adsorption of zn2 shifts to the left fig 7b and c with respect to the curve of the nanoparticles before adsorption this can be attributed to the possibility of outer sphere complex formation of zn complexes outer sphere surface complexes were reported to have no effect on iep because no chemical reaction occurs between the adsorbate and adsorbent the shift towards the left may be justified by the adsorption of cl ions present due to dissolving zncl2 in di water which may form inner sphere cl anionic surface complexes on sio2 and go nanomaterials thus it could be concluded that inner sphere complexation is predominant mechanism for zn2 adsorption on sno2 moreover zn2 sorption on go nanosheets and sio2 nanoparticles is mainly attributed to outer sphere surface complexation or ion exchange at low ph and inner sphere surface complexation at high ph values this finding is in agreement with previous findings of studies that addressed the removal of other metal cations by go 31 a previous study on the sorption of cd2 and co2 by go has also shown that the delocalized π electron systems of graphene sheets can act as lewis base to form electron through the lewis donor acceptor complexes with zn2 strong surface complexation between go nanosheets and zn2 occurs through the lewis acid base interaction which also contributes to zn2 sorption on go nansheets 31 furthermore zeta potential determines the colloidal stability of particles in a suspension for instance the zeta potential of the charged go surfaces becomes much less negative and leads to colloidal instability at low ph values as can be concluded from fig 7c these findings suggest that the electrostatic repulsions between ionized carboxyl groups at the go sheet edges provide the major barrier preventing the go sheets from aggregating 41 also adsorption of zn2 on go at high ph values i e above 6 1 decreases the colloidal stability and increases aggregation similarly the same findings can be concluded for adsorption of zn2 on sio2 and sno2 thus in general colloidal stability decreases after adsorption for the three nanomaterials tested 3 8 sio2 adsorbent regeneration as shown previously sio2 was found to be the most efficient adsorbent for zn2 removal from embr effluent to test the recycling potential of this adsorbent zn2 loaded adsorbent was separated and gently washed with distilled deionized water to remove any unadsorbed zn2 then the adsorbent was placed in di water and hcl was added until a ph of 2 1 was reached the mixture was agitated for 2 h and the amount of desorbed zn2 was measured to estimate the amount of zn2 still adsorbed and thus desorption percentage one run was conducted and it was found that 64 2 of the adsorbed zn2 was desorbed into the mixture thus showing a potential to recycle the adsorbent and reuse it for zn2 removal more desorption studies can be conducted in the future to find the optimum method to obtain the highest desorption 4 conclusions in this study zn2 in the treated embr effluent was post treated by adsorption using nanomaterials three nanomaterials were tested namely go sio2 and sno2 ph and adsorbent dosage were optimized and the maximum zn removal efficiency was reported to be 93 1 2 1 99 1 0 3 and 83 2 3 5 for go sio2 and sno2 respectively the maximum zn2 adsorption capacity were reported to be 243 9 1 and 102 mg g for go sio2 and sno2 respectively adsorption isotherms verified a mechanism of monolayer adsorption for the three nanomaterials tested moreover adsorption kinetic studies revealed that chemisorption is the predominant removal mechanism for the three nanomaterials adsorption of zn2 on sno2 followed inner sphere surface complex mechanism moreover adsorption of zn2 on sio2 and go followed inner sphere mechanism for higher ph values and outer sphere surface complex at low ph values as a result using a two stage treatment process that involves embr technology and nanomaterials has been found to be promising for industrial wastewater rich in metals treatment future work should address studying the

14316,water supplied to customers must be safe and fit for purpose it is thus important that the water from water treatment plants wtps meets world health organization standards or local standards such as the south african national standard before distribution this study focuses on the treatment of natural organic matter nom in south african wtps the problems associated with nom include 1 it affects the organoleptic properties of water 2 increases coagulant demand 3 reacts with chlorine to form disinfection by products and 4 causes membrane fouling the aim of the study was to characterise the nom composition of various water sources specifically the objectives were 1 to assess the character of nom in selected regions of south africa and 2 to evaluate the nom removal efficiencies of the selected wtps to achieve these various characterisation techniques were used to determine parameters such as dissolved organic carbon ultraviolet absorbance specific ultraviolet absorbance and dissolved organic matter using fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy the character of nom evolved throughout the treatment process as a result of coagulation sedimentation and filtration processes as indicated by suva a decrease in the hydrophobic fraction of nom from raw to final water was observed except for plant c2 in region c where a drastic increase in suva from 1 26 31 95 l mg m was observed indicating an increase in the hydrophobic compounds in water all wtps were shown to have different removal efficiencies because of the character of nom in the raw water and the coagulation conditions used keywords dissolved organic carbon natural organic matter water treatment plants 1 introduction safe drinking water is a major concern in developing and water scarce countries such as south africa rapid population growth extensive industrialisation and agricultural activities have resulted in the pollution of water sources nkambule et al 2012 these activities contribute a wide range of organic and inorganic pollutants in water sources through surface runoff point source waste discharges and other diffuse non point sources 1 natural organic matter nom is a complex combination of organic compounds formed from the decay of plant and animal matter in water sources and soil 2 and is one of the major problematic pollutants found in drinking water sources 3 5 these organic compounds originate from autochthonous sources which are created within the water body and allochthonous sources which are derived from outside the water body 6 the composition of nom in water sources depends on the geographic and climatic conditions and its character changes throughout the water treatment process 7 8 based on the polarity nom is divided into hydrophobic humic hydrophilic non humic and transphilic intermediate polarity fractions 9 10 the hydrophobic fraction consists of humic substances hs which in turn are made up of humic acids ha fulvic acids fa and humin 6 these substances contribute to the yellow brownish colour of water impacting the water quality 11 the hydrophilic fraction consists of non humic substances such as proteins carbohydrates and polysaccharides 12 while the transphilic fraction is composed of mainly of carboxylic acids 13 the presence of nom in raw water causes numerous problems in water treatment processes such as high coagulant dosage production of disinfection by products dbps unpleasant taste odour and yellow brownish colour membrane fouling and the promotion of bacterial re growth in the distribution system since nom serves as a source of food for heterotrophic organisms 14 16 nkambule et al 2012 these problems indicate the need to remove nom from drinking water supplies to date only a few studies on the characterisation and quantification of nom at water treatment plants wtps in south africa have reported nom occurrence at individual wtps 7 17 9 marais et al 2018 5 these studies assessed the composition of nom in water using various parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc which gives the quantity of nom in water and ultra violet absorbance analysis uva which identifies the different chromophores of nom for instance uv at 254 nm indicates aromaticity and uv at 272 nm is a good indicator of dbp formation potential specific ultraviolet absorbance suva gives an indication of the amount of humic substances vs non humic substances in nom 18 in terms of hydrophobic suva 4 hydrophilic suva 2 and transphilic 2 suva 4 fractions fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectroscopy provides information on the structural composition of nom based on excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorophores within nom most wtps in south africa use the conventional treatment process with coagulation flocculation as the major nom removal processes and chlorination as the disinfection process 4 it is therefore important to track the nature of nom at each treatment step to assess the nom removal efficiency of treatment processes given the diverse types of water sources in south africa 4 this will assist in wtp optimisation which will lead to enhanced nom removal due to the diverse nature of south african fresh water sources the character of nom varies and thus it cannot be effectively removed with only one treatment regime thus this work sought to develop an understanding of the nom character in water treatment plants in a bid to improve nom removal through process optimisation the aim was to characterise the nom composition of various water sources and the objectives were 1 to assess the nature composition and character of nom in selected regions of south africa and 2 to evaluate the nom removal efficiency of selected water treatment plants the work focused on the individual nom fractions in three south african provinces and their removal by different water treatment plants the study is part of a series of assessments conducted on the same plants over all four seasons and is representative of the behaviour of nom in south african water treatment plants 2 methodology 2 1 sampling sites the wtps selected for this study are located in three regions across south africa and are represented by codes fig 1 from region a plants a1 a2 and a3 were sampled from region b plants b1 b2 b3 and b4 were selected and from region c plants c1 and c2 were chosen the treatment processes used in each of the plants are provided in table s1 2 2 sampling and sample analyses sampling at all nine water treatment plants was performed in triplicate samples were collected at each of the treatment steps using 1 l amber glass bottles and stored in a cooler bag the turbidity conductivity and ph were measured onsite using a turbidity meter thermo scientific orion aquafast aq3010 a conductivity meter xs instruments carpi mo italy and a ph meter xs instruments carpi mo italy respectively these parameters were measured to obtain the physical properties of the water 19 dissolved organic carbon analyses were performed using a torch total organic carbon analyzer teledyne tekmar mason ohio usa after filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm filter dissolved organic carbon doc is the fraction of total organic carbon that passes through the 0 45 μm filter 20 ultraviolet visible absorbance analyses were performed using a fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectrometer aqualog horiba scientific new jersey usa all samples were analysed over a full wavelength spectrum 200 800 nm to effectively study the nom character particular attention was given to the following wavelengths which are representative of particular nom fractions 214 nm indicates the presence of nitrates and nitrites 254 nm indicates the presence of humic substances and aromatics 272 nm is the best predictor of the formation of trihalomethanes thm 9 15 furthermore it is possible to classify and distinguish humic substances of various origins using feem data chen et al 2003 the ratio between uv absorbance at 254 nm and doc is called the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva equation 1 and is an indication of the quantity of humic substances in comparison with non humic substances in nom 18 1 s u v a u v 254 d o c 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of water except for plant b1 with final water turbidity of 1 4 ntu the final water of all wtps was found to have a turbidity of 1 ntu fig 2 a slight increase in turbidity was observed after the filtration stage for plants b1 and b2 with values ranging from 0 to 1 4 and 0 to 0 96 ntu respectively this could be due to the breakthrough of the retained solutes on the schmutzdecke dirt cover and the filter bed 21 22 the schmutzdecke is a biological layer that builds up on the surface of the slow sand filter and facilitates the effective purification in the treatment of drinking water dehwah and missimer 2007 all the wtps studied use coagulation flocculation for the removal of turbidity and color an increase in turbidity from 0 to 0 2 ntu was observed at plant c1 following the addition of a coagulant at plant b2 the increase in turbidity from 0 6 to 2 7 ntu after sedimentation could be due to the accumulation of scum on the tanks and floc carryover a drastic increase in turbidity from 0 3 to 2 7 ntu for the other plants was observed after sedimentation indicating poor control of the coagulation process turbidity is an indication of the presence of suspended and colloidal particles in water oladoja et al 2017 turbidity describes the amount of light scattered by particles in the water and it can be used as an indicator of the performance of the coagulation process the south african national standard 23 specifies that the turbidity of the final water must be less than 1 ntu the ph of water is another critical parameter that greatly influences the quality of produced water especially during coagulation the removal of nom during coagulation is largely influenced by ph 5 the final ph of water for the plants ranged from 7 3 9 3 which is within the 23 specification of ph 5 9 7 the ph for a3 was stable due to no addition of lime and there were no major changes in ph for plants a1 a2 and a3 fig 3 the slight increase in ph for the coastal plants b3 b4 c1 and c2 was due to the addition of hydrated lime which made the water alkaline however the ph decreased after chlorination due to the formation of hypochlorous ions which reduced the ph of the water to acceptable levels another parameter that affects the quality of water is electrical conductivity which describes the load of charged species in water 19 these are a result of dissolved salts and inorganic materials such as alkalis chlorides sulphides and carbonate compounds present in the water raw water conductivity values of 10 ms cm which correlate to fresh water were observed at plants a2 and a3 however there was a significant increase in conductivity for the feed streams from regions b and c which illustrates the varied types of raw water as influenced by the geographic locations which subsequently affect the properties of nom in the water the electrical conductivity of all the plants investigated varied for each plant due to different types and dosage of coagulants used table s1 with the lowest being recorded in plant a1 with a conductivity value approaching 0 ms m and the highest conductivity recorded in plant b2 129 ms m overall compliance in terms of the aesthetic limits 2015 blue drop limits of less than 170 ms m set by the south african national standard sans for drinking water 23 was observed for all the plants 3 2 dissolved organic carbon the concentration of doc in raw water was found to be different for each treatment plant fig 3 due to the different geographic location of each plant for example plant a1 doc 0 74 mg l obtains its raw water from a dam located on the slopes of mountains consequently the plant does not apply sedimentation as a treatment step it is noteworthy that the doc concentration of the final treated water from all wtps was found to be below the limits set by 23 which is 10 mg l dissolved organic carbon analysis alone does not provide adequate information on the transformation of nom throughout the treatment process 24 however coagulation and flocculation processes are responsible for the reduction of doc at wtps 25 despite the largely similar treatment processes in most wtps table s1 doc removal efficiencies were found to be different at all wtps these differences can be attributed to the different coagulants and dosages used during coagulation plants in region c which use aluminium based salt polymer as a coagulant have the highest doc removal efficiency 46 3 and 61 8 for plants c1 and c2 respectively since the treatment processes used by these wtps are essentially similar to those of other wtps the high removal efficiency is likely to be due to either the nom character in that region or the coagulant type and dosage used or a combination of these the aim of further investigations should be to elucidate the impact of various coagulants on doc removal laboratory scale experiments involving jar testing to optimise ph and coagulant dosage would be a good starting point the character of nom is influenced by the surrounding geology and human activities 4 26 interestingly there was an increase in doc content throughout the treatment process for plants a1 a2 and b4 this could be due to clogged sand filters or biological degradation occurring on the edges of the sedimentation tanks as shown by flakes of decomposing matter that are washed off into the water 27 3 3 ultraviolet absorbance ultraviolet absorbance uva was measured at a wavelength range of 200 600 nm as mentioned before absorbance at 214 nm represents nitrites and nitrates while 254 nm represents the aromaticity of nom and absorbance at 272 nm signifies the potential of dbp formation 6 a decrease in the absorbance at 254 nm was observed from raw water to final water for all the wtps fig 4 this result shows that the aromatic content of the water decreases throughout the treatment processes the highest uv254 absorbance 0 47 cm 1 was observed at plant c2 indicating that the raw water is rich in aromatic compounds the uv214 for raw water of all investigated wtps is high indicating the presence of high levels of nitrates and nitrites furthermore all wtps showed high potential for dbp formation as indicated by the high uv272 absorbances from these results the highest percent removal of nom was observed at plants c1 and c2 with removal efficiencies of 64 3 and 89 4 respectively low nom removal efficiencies were observed for the other wtps the difference in removal efficiency is attributable to different types of water sources and coagulants used in the treatment processes 3 4 specific ultraviolet absorbance specific ultraviolet absorbance suva gives an indication of the hydrophobicity transphilic and hydrophilicity of the nom in the water 10 28 a low suva value 2 l mg m indicates the presence of mainly hydrophilic fractions of nom while a high suva value 4 l mg m indicates the presence of mainly hydrophobic fractions of nom and suva values of between 2 and 4 l mg m indicate the presence of the transphilic fractions of nom 5 27 the suva values for raw water in all the plants investigated were greater than 4 l mg m implying that the raw water consists mainly of hydrophobic nom table 1 from the results suva values for the final water treated at plants b4 b2 and a2 were 2 92 3 06 and 3 19 respectively this indicates that the nature of the nom found in the water treated changed to transphilic along the treatment trains this is consistent with previous studies that reported transphilic nom in final water at a wtp in south africa 20 the suva values for plants a1 and b3 were found to increase after coagulation suggesting the transformation of nom into hydrophobic fractions this result is unexpected because hydrophobic nom is more amenable to removal by coagulation 20 plants a1 and b3 use polymer u3800 and zeta floc 553 respectively as coagulants however it seems that these coagulants are ineffective in removing nom the overall trend observed throughout the plants is that the suva values decreased after the raw water was treated using these different water treatment processes it should be noted that nom is not routinely monitored in wtps in sa and as such wtps do not prioritise its removal in fact because its impact is an emerging area of study and due to its propensity to form disinfection by products dbps nom and dbps have been classified as emerging pollutants 29 30 however as demonstrated in table 1 doc is present even in treated water albeit at low concentrations 0 79 2 09 mg l it is currently not known what doc concentrations would offset the formation of dbps thus these concentrations should also be monitored 3 5 fluorescence emission excitation matrices fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectroscopy provides information on the structural composition of nom based on the excitation and emission wavelength of the fluorophores table 2 and the absorption wavelengths together with the assigned compounds are derived from current guidelines based on previous studies 31 the feem results showed peaks in three regions namely a c and t fig 5 31 the spectra demonstrated that the most dominant nom category is humic like with excitation wavelengths of between 260 and 360 nm and emission wavelengths of between 400 and 460 nm for all the plants investigated however different excitation emission wavelengths were recorded for plant b3 which indicated the presence of both tryptophan like and humic like compounds in raw water abstracted from the river 6 32 narrow peaks were observed in the final water for plants c1 b3 a3 and a2 indicating that the treatment process effectively removed ha from the water broad peaks were observed in the final water of plants c2 b2 b1 a1 and b4 indicating that the treatment process is ineffective for the complete removal of ha in the water 33 overall there is a clear trend that the intensity of the peaks declines as the water moves through the treatment process suggesting that the nom content was reduced as predicted by equation 1 an increase in doc and a decrease in uva resulted in a decrease in suva however for plants a3 c1 b3 and b1 the trend was found to be inconsistent further research would be required to investigate this discrepancy from feem spectra there is a monotonic waning of the peaks indicating a progressive decline in nom along the treatment train the same general trend is shown for doc 4 conclusion this work sought to develop an understanding of the nom character in selected water treatment plants in south africa in a bid to improve nom removal through process optimisation the aim was to characterise the nom composition of various water sources in south africa the study demonstrated that nom undergoes transformation as the water traverses through the treatment train this was shown by the changing hydrophobicity of nom along the treatment train through suva it was observed that nom generally becomes less hydrophobic after coagulation and flocculation processes however the major limitation of the current approach is that the characterisation methods do not provide adequate information about the evolving chemical character of nom techniques based on molecular weight distribution and or more advanced approaches such as the polarity rapid assessment method pram or liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd would be useful in future studies the removal of nom using conventional treatment processes has been reported to depend on the character of nom which in turn is influenced by its origin the highest doc removal efficiency was observed at plant c2 negative doc removal efficiencies were observed at plants a1 a2 and b4 due to either clogged filters or the biological activity on the edges of the sedimentation tanks an increase in doc was accompanied by a decrease in uva and suva for most plants however for plants a3 b1 b3 and c1 the trend was inconsistent further research would be required to investigate this discrepancy although all the wtps studied used the conventional treatment process the coagulation conditions used at each of these plants were different these conditions could possibly account for the differences in nom removal performance observed among the various wtps finally because nom removal is influenced by the nom character in raw water it is advisable to study the character of nom to enable the selection of appropriate water treatment processes

namely a c and t fig 5 31 the spectra demonstrated that the most dominant nom category is humic like with excitation wavelengths of between 260 and 360 nm and emission wavelengths of between 400 and 460 nm for all the plants investigated however different excitation emission wavelengths were recorded for plant b3 which indicated the presence of both tryptophan like and humic like compounds in raw water abstracted from the river 6 32 narrow peaks were observed in the final water for plants c1 b3 a3 and a2 indicating that the treatment process effectively removed ha from the water broad peaks were observed in the final water of plants c2 b2 b1 a1 and b4 indicating that the treatment process is ineffective for the complete removal of ha in the water 33 overall there is a clear trend that the intensity of the peaks declines as the water moves through the treatment process suggesting that the nom content was reduced as predicted by equation 1 an increase in doc and a decrease in uva resulted in a decrease in suva however for plants a3 c1 b3 and b1 the trend was found to be inconsistent further research would be required to investigate this discrepancy from feem spectra there is a monotonic waning of the peaks indicating a progressive decline in nom along the treatment train the same general trend is shown for doc 4 conclusion this work sought to develop an understanding of the nom character in selected water treatment plants in south africa in a bid to improve nom removal through process optimisation the aim was to characterise the nom composition of various water sources in south africa the study demonstrated that nom undergoes transformation as the water traverses through the treatment train this was shown by the changing hydrophobicity of nom along the treatment train through suva it was observed that nom generally becomes less hydrophobic after coagulation and flocculation processes however the major limitation of the current approach is that the characterisation methods do not provide adequate information about the evolving chemical character of nom techniques based on molecular weight distribution and or more advanced approaches such as the polarity rapid assessment method pram or liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd would be useful in future studies the removal of nom using conventional treatment processes has been reported to depend on the character of nom which in turn is influenced by its origin the highest doc removal efficiency was observed at plant c2 negative doc removal efficiencies were observed at plants a1 a2 and b4 due to either clogged filters or the biological activity on the edges of the sedimentation tanks an increase in doc was accompanied by a decrease in uva and suva for most plants however for plants a3 b1 b3 and c1 the trend was inconsistent further research would be required to investigate this discrepancy although all the wtps studied used the conventional treatment process the coagulation conditions used at each of these plants were different these conditions could possibly account for the differences in nom removal performance observed among the various wtps finally because nom removal is influenced by the nom character in raw water it is advisable to study the character of nom to enable the selection of appropriate water treatment processes

14317,scientists have been exploring new sustainable alternatives in effluent treatment due to the growing concern with highly stable organic pollutants in this work a photocatalytic flow reactor was developed from poli ethylene terephthalate pet bottles in order to optimise photocatalysis of two synthetic dyes commonly found in food industry wastewater four different photo oxidative systems were tested within 360 min under uv c radiation the best results were obtained in a uv c h2o2 tio2 system due to the synergic effect of the oxidizing agents the influence of the oxidizing agent s amounts was investigated in a 2² experimental planning and 99 25 of dyes degradation could be reached in 180 min a kinetic study was carried out with these results and the kinetic rate for the global reaction was estimated at 0 016 min 1 and half life reaction time at 43 32 min applying the pseudo first order kinetic model acute toxicity assays revealed the ic50 increased 165 8 after the treatment indicating the by products were less toxic than the parental compounds toc and cod were evaluated as water quality parameters and decreased from 40 50 and 103 4 mg l 1 to 8 25 and 15 0 mg l 1 after the photocatalytic process respectively cost analysis of the construction and operation expenses and removal efficiency presented the developed pet flow reactor as a feasible alternative to the treatment of synthetic organic dyes keywords advanced oxidation processes photocatalytic reactor reactor design food dyes pet applications 1 introduction the food industry is one of the greatest sources of pollution in large economies international and national laws and guidelines are currently arising concerned about the environmental impact caused by its wastewater it is commonly characterized by pathogenic microorganisms fat macromolecules and synthetic substances 1 3 the synthetic dyes are widely applied in a variety of food products due to their high stability coloring efficiency and low cost when compared to natural dyes 4 6 as a result of the manufacturing process around 10 20 of dyes are lost and may be discharged in water bodies causing adverse effects to the environment such as decreasing oxygen dissolution and light penetration and consequently energy absorption in autotrophic organism s growth therefore all the ecosystem equilibrium 3 7 in addition to these matters a great parcel of commercial food dyes and their breakdown products are pointed to be toxic and threatening to human health 6 8 tartrazine yellow tt and brilliant blue bb are synthetic dyes widely applied by food industry all around the world and mixed to produce different shades of green although they are pointed to be safe for human consumption by many countries several studies highlight their carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic properties in addition to contamination of water bodies 9 10 many countries such as austria norwegian and denmark have already forbidden their application in food products and several others have regulated their concentration limits 4 10 alternative removal routes of these substances apply different technologies such as adsorption chemical coagulation flocculation membranes microbiological treatments and advanced oxidation processes aops 11 12 aops deserve special attention in the removal of synthetic organic pollutants due to the generation of highly oxidizing radicals in situ able to destroy even the most stable organic molecules the efficiency of the process depends mostly on the radicals generation rate consequently depending on photons and chemicals concentrations ultra violet uv radiation is the favorite to promote free radicals generation like hydroxyl oh and peroxyl oor 6 13 16 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is the most applied oxidizing agent because it is easily decomposed into hydroxyl radicals semiconductor materials such as titanium dioxide or titania tio2 are also able to generate oh and oor from photoabsorption and not be destroyed acting as photocatalysts 15 18 photocatalytic reactors are chambers built to process reactions dependent on light exposure as the radiation source the reactor design is equally important in the efficiency of the treatment since it is related to the light harvesting extent and the radicals generation rates 18 19 it is a common practice to coat the reactor inner chamber with reflective material and apply transparent vessels in order to improve photon harvesting as important and challenging as the photon distribution inside the chamber is the mass transfer the success of the pollutant degradation depends on good mass transport along the surface of the porous material and a good homogeneity of the radicals in the aqueous phase 16 20 21 the efficiency of flow reactors are strictly dependent on flow regime and hydrodynamic parameters are important to be considered when developing a new design such as velocity profiles input and output rates stirring degree residence time shape material and accumulation zones in order to optimize external mass transfer and photon harvesting 19 20 22 literature has reported in recent years a large number of photocatalytic reactor models which aim to overcome these challenges 16 18 20 23 this study aimed to develop a new flow photocatalytic reactor for aop systems made out of recyclable material pet water bottles and evaluate its efficiency and costs compared to a traditional bench photocatalytic reactor in the degradation of a mixture of tt and bb dyes in addition a kinetic study of the reaction was conducted acute toxicity bioassays and water quality parameter analyses were also performed in order to guarantee the treatment feasibility 2 materials and methods 2 1 preliminary tests the preliminary tests were all conducted in the traditional photocatalytic reactor represented by fig 1 additionally the samples were undergone to magnetic stirring the samples consisted of 250 ml tt and bb mixture 20 mg l 1 each dye acquired from f trajano aromas e ingredientes ltda four systems were tested in order to select the one which presented higher removal rates in 360 min of treatment table 1 employing the mixture of dyes the uv c radiation source consisted of a germicidal lamp ilumisampa t8 20 w on the top of the chamber as shown in fig 1 the systems were also tested in the absence of radiation titania acquired from evonik degussa brasil ltda and h2o2 coremal pochteca were employed at concentrations of 5 06 mmol l 1 and 9 2 mmol l 1 respectively the h2o2 addition was fractioned in two parts the first at the beginning of the experiment and the second at 180 min according to previous studies 24 25 the lamp was pre heated for 20 min before each experiment and the systems containing tio2 were pre stirred for 30 min in the absence of radiation in order to achieve adsorption equilibrium the amounts of oxidizing agents were selected based on previous experiments 24 the analytical procedure was based on uv vis spectroscopy spectroquant pharo 300 and the absorbance peaks detected at wavelengths of 254 nm for aromatics 411 nm for tt and 635 nm for bb minimum detection limit 0 05 mg l 1 the removal rates were calculated from the initial concentration titania samples were all centrifuged for 20 min at 3500 rpm before the analysis in order to remove the suspended material the inner temperature of the chamber was controlled at 25 2 c with room cooling in order to avoid excessive heating the chamber 2 2 experiments in the pet flow reactor a photocatalytic reactor was designed with three transparent pet water bottles 1 5 l as diagramed by fig 2 a robertshaw pump 34 w was employed to promote the reactor flow and silicon tubes with a diameter of 1 2 cm were used to connect the bottles around 160 cm² of pet area was removed from the side of each bottle horizontally aligned in order to allow direct light harvesting in the solution as shown in fig 2 the selected system from the preliminary tests was carried out in the developed flow reactor applying the same concentration of tio2 and h2o2 and degradation time the reactor maximum capacity was 2 5 l without risk of leaking the assays were performed with 2 225 l per run the volumes were estimated at 1 160 ml inside the chamber 880 ml in the reservoir and 210 ml in the tubes operating at a flow rate of 8 5 ml s 1 in the reaction chamber input and output the flow rate was chosen based on previous tests in this reactor the inner temperature of the chamber was also controlled 25 2 c during the experiments 2 2 1 experimental planning and kinetic study the duration of the process was set 150 min and removal rates of aromatics and dyes were used as responses for the experimental planning study concentration of h2o2 and tio2 ranged in the assays as shown in table 2 the central point was carried out in triplicate the influence of the variables was studied from a pareto chart and the assay which exhibited the highest removal rates was repeated and sampled between 1 to 360 min linear fittings of zero order pseudo first and second order kinetic models were accomplished by regression analysis and the correlation coefficients r² were used to estimate the best fitting kinetic rate constant k and half life reaction time t1 2 equation 1 were calculated according to the most suitable fitting 1 t 1 2 ln 2 k 2 2 2 reactor design optimization in order to attempt an improvement in mass transfer a new design was implemented in the pet container applying the best conditions obtained in the experimental planning study fig 3 shows the second design employed for the pet flow reactor container the bottoms of two water bottles were joined horizontally in order to avoid the junction of the tops present in the previous model the area where the reaction rate is believed to be zero due to a deficiency in light penetration the efficiency of the modified pet flow reactor was compared to the previous design 2 3 acute phytotoxicity assesment the samples at concentrations of 100 50 25 12 5 6 25 and 3 125 v v were undergone to a phytotoxicity bioassay with lactuca sativa l lettuce seeds four ml of each solution at each concentration were dropped in petri plates with 15 seeds each over a filter paper each plate was prepared in quintuplicate the germinated seeds were counted after 96 h of incubation at 22 c and the roots elongation was measured in millimetres germination rates and half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 were calculated for the samples before and after the treatment the positive control was carried out with distilled water and the negative control with hg2so4 0 5 mmol l 1 according to dutka 25 and greene 26 methods q test was applied for the results at a confidence level of 95 2 4 water quality parameters total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod analyses were performed to evaluate organic content degradation according to the standard methods 27 conductivity and ph were also measured for the samples before and after the treatment under the selected conditions from the experimental planning study 2 5 cost analysis cost analyses were performed taking into consideration energy usage reactants construction costs removal rates and volume capacity for the pet flow reactor model and the traditional bench reactor the currency applied was the brazilian reais r since all the materials and reactants were acquired in the country 3 results and discussions 3 1 preliminary tests the experiments carried out in the absence of radiation did not present significant degradation rates after 360 min similar results were found by nascimento júnior et al 2018 28 for the same chemicals which points out to the fact these substances are highly stable to uv c radiation 29 table 3 shows the degradation results for each system after 360 min uv c h2o2 tio2 presented to be the most efficient system in accordance with the literature many studies have reported a synergic effect of h2o2 presence in the performance of tio2 photocatalytic mechanisms it might be related to the targeted compounds by enhancing the global rate of reaction 6 18 28 30 31 titania band gap is also believed to be shifted when in the presence of h2o2 presenting greater performance when its uv absorption spectrum is broadened 32 33 uvc h2o2 presented similar efficiency in the degradation of dyes but did not reach similar results for the aromatic content which indicates a resistance of these species to h2o2 degradation mechanism then tio2 usage is found to be essential in the degradation of aromatic by products that can eventually present larger toxicity than the parental compounds 18 34 3 2 experimental planning and kinetic study the selected system uv c h2o2 tio2 was run in the designed pet flow reactor shown in fig 2 operating with 2 225 l of dyes sample removal rates of 84 50 and 99 12 for aromatic and total dyes content respectively were achieved in 210 min and then the time set for the experiments was fixed at 150 min for a 2² experimental planning study table 4 shows the removal rates achieved in the performed assays the central point presented average removal rates of 95 25 0 53 and 69 58 1 96 for dyes and aromatics respectively the average deviations of both results were considered low and the pure error estimated at 0 2821 in the response assuring the reproducibility of the assays statistica experimental design 6 0 was used to generate a pareto chart fig 4 according to the chart only h2o2 concentration presented statistical significance in the removal of dyes at the levels studied this result can be explained by the activation energy band of h2o2 and tio2 since h2o2 molecule is only broken at wavelengths of λ 290 nm and tio2 is mostly photo activated by wavelengths between 300 390 nm h2o2 mechanism of radicals generation prevails under uvc radiation once it comprises wavelengths shorter than 280 nm 34 35 although tio2 presence contributed notoriously for the removal of aromatics table 1 none of the variables effects presented statistical significance for the aromatics data at the levels studied response surface analysis was not performed since tio2 concentration and h2o2xtio2 interaction did not present statistical significance from the statistical analysis it could be concluded that the best conditions were achieved in assay 2 obtaining the highest dyes removal rates at 150 min and tio2 reached the excess in the conditions 0 and 1 as reported by rozas et al 2016 17 the light harvesting by h2o2 molecules depends on characteristics of the sample such as turbidity thus the excess of tio2 in suspension would decrease the generation of radicals via h2o2 decomposition decreasing the global rate reaction instead of enhancing it since titania concentration did not present statistical significance in the levels which were studied the minor level of it was selected assay 2 the experiment was repeated under assay 2 conditions and the concentration profiles for the aromatics tt and bb degradation versus time are displayed in fig 5 as displayed in the chart 99 25 of total dyes removal was obtained after 180 min of treatment after 270 min of treatment aromatics reached 97 of degradation and did not vary significantly the kinetic profiles of dyes degradation presented to be similar although aromatic content exhibited more resistance to the degradation as it can be seen in fig 5 this result may be related to the higher resistance of aromatic rings to the radicals attack due to its higher stability than the tt and bb molecules but also may be due to uv vis spectroscopy sensibility linear model fitting was carried out applying zero order pseudo first order and second order kinetic models as expected the pseudo first order kinetic model presented the best fit to the data r² 0 95 when compared to the zero order and second order models 0 93 and 0 58 respectively as stated by teixeira and jardim 34 aops are complex systems due to the transient nature of the radicals and the complex structure of most targeted pollutants the degradation tends to follow a pseudo first order kinetic model while the pollutants are in excess where the global kinetic rate constant depends only on the oxidizing species concentration 6 18 36 it is assumed that the slowest reaction step is the formation of radicals dependent on h2o2 tio2 and photons concentrations since photons concentration cannot be measured it is assumed the excess of h2o2 and tio2 during the beginning of the reaction describing a pseudo first order kinetic model the rate reaction law for the degradation is described by equation 2 and it is not dependent on the dyes concentration following the assumptions made 2 r k r a d where rad represents the hypothetical free radical concentration in order to achieve a better fitting for the kinetic rate the linear pseudo first order model was fitted to the set of experimental data for the first 90 min to take in consideration the period the reactants were in excess the coefficient r² reached a value of 0 99 the rate constant value was estimated at 0 016 min 1 and the t1 2 at 43 32 min 3 3 modified reactor experiments the degradation profiles from the experiment in the modified pet flow reactor are displayed in fig 6 the modified designed only reached dyes removal rates of 99 after 240 min while the first proposed design reached similar rates in 180 min time similar behavior was found or aromatic content these results may be explained by the sample volume inside the chamber and the treatment and the mixing of phases due to the junction of the bottles bottoms in the modified design a larger area of bottles was removed and thus the volume inside the photocatalytic chamber where the degradation is processed decreased although the total volume capacities of both designs were the same the previous design provided a larger fraction of sample in contact with the radiation source consequently the reservoir volume is increased during the treatment where no reaction proceeds it is also believed that the junction of the tops of the two bottles in the first design may contribute to better mixing of the sample phases avoiding the accumulation of powder over the bottom of the reactor 3 4 phytotoxicity and water quality parameters analyses phytotoxicity and water quality parameters analyses were performed with the samples treated under assay 2 conditions in the first design for the pet flow reactor for 360 min table 5 shows the results obtained in the phytotoxicity bioassay for the germination rates and the ic50 in the pet flow reactor the ic50 values were obtained from the relation of the relative growth of roots in relation to the growth in the negative control according to the table the germination rate has increased with the treatment as well as the ic50 indicating a decline in the acute phytotoxicity of the samples after treatment since smaller values indicate higher acute toxicities the controls demonstrated the seeds were healthy and germinable since 100 of rate was reached in water negative control germination rates with raw sample demonstrated considerable acute toxicity inflicted on lettuce seeds since less than 100 of seeds were germinated while the treated samples provided full germination rate an increase in ic50 value of 163 indicates higher concentrations of contaminants 50 9 mg l 1 are required to inhibit the growth of the tissues of 50 of the lettuce species these two results point out to the fact that more toxic by products were not formed after aop treatment regarding lettuce seeds and it is suitable for the pollutants removal although this study is directly related to vegetative plant growth and is not able to provide conclusive data about human health effects according to a phytotoxicity study performed by nascimento júnior et al 2018 24 with lactuca sativa seeds tt and bb presented a raise from 3931 v v to 8773 v v in ic50 from the raw samples to treated samples the removal of pollutants was carried out in the same uv c h2o2 tio2 system in a traditional bench reactor the results of the water quality parameter analyses are exhibited in table 6 an approximate decrease of 80 was achieved in toc as a result of the oxidation of the organic species to co2 and other inorganic by products consequently cod decreased 85 from its initial value as a result of the removal of oxidizable organic matter evidencing the improvement in water quality 13 the rise in conductivity is explained by the formation of ionic species such as sulphonic and diazonium compounds groups found in bb and tt molecules the rise in ph can be explained by the adsorption route on tio2 surface which causes a surplus of oh that attacks water alkalizing the medium in small levels 37 3 5 cost analysis cost analysis results are exhibited in table 7 for the traditional and the initial pet flow reactor model to operate 1 cycle comparing the results we can observe that the operating costs of the pet flow reactor are about twice the total cost to operate the traditional reactor achieving a slightly higher efficiency 89 49 of dyes degradation but with a capacity 4 5 times greater this can be explained by the best surface area exposed to uvc radiation in the reactor improving power usage important for scale up processes the pet flow reactor operated for 23 cycles in total without losing considerable efficiency the advantages of the reactor rely on the use of recyclable material readily available simple construction and maintenance that can be possibly applied to a variety of organic pollutants in different models for scaling up and its use with natural solar or artificial light 4 conclusions in the present study a photocatalytic reactor could be developed from recyclable material demonstrating high efficiency 99 25 of dyes in 180 min in the treatment of resistant synthetic dyes commonly applied by the food industry the reactor design was studied in order to improve the removal response over time toxicity and water quality parameters analyses assured the improvements in the environmental quality of water with a decrease in acute toxicity of approximately 63 and 80 in total organic carbon the costs of running one degradation cycle presented to be twice as high as the traditional bench reactor although related to 4 5 times greater the treated volume thus pet presented itself as a feasible alternative in the development of photocatalytic reactors for aops among them its cost safety color and easy maintenance future works arise from this study once nascimento júnior et al 2018 28 have reported high removal rates 99 for tt and bb under uv solar systems the use of natural sunlight may be a feasible alternative to reduce largely the power costs associated with the treatment series reactors may also represent a path for scale up processes in continuous mode and could be investigated with the use of natural sunlight and artificial uv radiation another advantage related to pet usage is the possibility of tio2 immobilization over the surface of the reactor itself as described by the methodology proposed by singh et al 2013 38 it is widely known that tio2 suspension systems provide better contact area but they also depend on further separation steps that could be avoided

efficient system in accordance with the literature many studies have reported a synergic effect of h2o2 presence in the performance of tio2 photocatalytic mechanisms it might be related to the targeted compounds by enhancing the global rate of reaction 6 18 28 30 31 titania band gap is also believed to be shifted when in the presence of h2o2 presenting greater performance when its uv absorption spectrum is broadened 32 33 uvc h2o2 presented similar efficiency in the degradation of dyes but did not reach similar results for the aromatic content which indicates a resistance of these species to h2o2 degradation mechanism then tio2 usage is found to be essential in the degradation of aromatic by products that can eventually present larger toxicity than the parental compounds 18 34 3 2 experimental planning and kinetic study the selected system uv c h2o2 tio2 was run in the designed pet flow reactor shown in fig 2 operating with 2 225 l of dyes sample removal rates of 84 50 and 99 12 for aromatic and total dyes content respectively were achieved in 210 min and then the time set for the experiments was fixed at 150 min for a 2² experimental planning study table 4 shows the removal rates achieved in the performed assays the central point presented average removal rates of 95 25 0 53 and 69 58 1 96 for dyes and aromatics respectively the average deviations of both results were considered low and the pure error estimated at 0 2821 in the response assuring the reproducibility of the assays statistica experimental design 6 0 was used to generate a pareto chart fig 4 according to the chart only h2o2 concentration presented statistical significance in the removal of dyes at the levels studied this result can be explained by the activation energy band of h2o2 and tio2 since h2o2 molecule is only broken at wavelengths of λ 290 nm and tio2 is mostly photo activated by wavelengths between 300 390 nm h2o2 mechanism of radicals generation prevails under uvc radiation once it comprises wavelengths shorter than 280 nm 34 35 although tio2 presence contributed notoriously for the removal of aromatics table 1 none of the variables effects presented statistical significance for the aromatics data at the levels studied response surface analysis was not performed since tio2 concentration and h2o2xtio2 interaction did not present statistical significance from the statistical analysis it could be concluded that the best conditions were achieved in assay 2 obtaining the highest dyes removal rates at 150 min and tio2 reached the excess in the conditions 0 and 1 as reported by rozas et al 2016 17 the light harvesting by h2o2 molecules depends on characteristics of the sample such as turbidity thus the excess of tio2 in suspension would decrease the generation of radicals via h2o2 decomposition decreasing the global rate reaction instead of enhancing it since titania concentration did not present statistical significance in the levels which were studied the minor level of it was selected assay 2 the experiment was repeated under assay 2 conditions and the concentration profiles for the aromatics tt and bb degradation versus time are displayed in fig 5 as displayed in the chart 99 25 of total dyes removal was obtained after 180 min of treatment after 270 min of treatment aromatics reached 97 of degradation and did not vary significantly the kinetic profiles of dyes degradation presented to be similar although aromatic content exhibited more resistance to the degradation as it can be seen in fig 5 this result may be related to the higher resistance of aromatic rings to the radicals attack due to its higher stability than the tt and bb molecules but also may be due to uv vis spectroscopy sensibility linear model fitting was carried out applying zero order pseudo first order and second order kinetic models as expected the pseudo first order kinetic model presented the best fit to the data r² 0 95 when compared to the zero order and second order models 0 93 and 0 58 respectively as stated by teixeira and jardim 34 aops are complex systems due to the transient nature of the radicals and the complex structure of most targeted pollutants the degradation tends to follow a pseudo first order kinetic model while the pollutants are in excess where the global kinetic rate constant depends only on the oxidizing species concentration 6 18 36 it is assumed that the slowest reaction step is the formation of radicals dependent on h2o2 tio2 and photons concentrations since photons concentration cannot be measured it is assumed the excess of h2o2 and tio2 during the beginning of the reaction describing a pseudo first order kinetic model the rate reaction law for the degradation is described by equation 2 and it is not dependent on the dyes concentration following the assumptions made 2 r k r a d where rad represents the hypothetical free radical concentration in order to achieve a better fitting for the kinetic rate the linear pseudo first order model was fitted to the set of experimental data for the first 90 min to take in consideration the period the reactants were in excess the coefficient r² reached a value of 0 99 the rate constant value was estimated at 0 016 min 1 and the t1 2 at 43 32 min 3 3 modified reactor experiments the degradation profiles from the experiment in the modified pet flow reactor are displayed in fig 6 the modified designed only reached dyes removal rates of 99 after 240 min while the first proposed design reached similar rates in 180 min time similar behavior was found or aromatic content these results may be explained by the sample volume inside the chamber and the treatment and the mixing of phases due to the junction of the bottles bottoms in the modified design a larger area of bottles was removed and thus the volume inside the photocatalytic chamber where the degradation is processed decreased although the total volume capacities of both designs were the same the previous design provided a larger fraction of sample in contact with the radiation source consequently the reservoir volume is increased during the treatment where no reaction proceeds it is also believed that the junction of the tops of the two bottles in the first design may contribute to better mixing of the sample phases avoiding the accumulation of powder over the bottom of the reactor 3 4 phytotoxicity and water quality parameters analyses phytotoxicity and water quality parameters analyses were performed with the samples treated under assay 2 conditions in the first design for the pet flow reactor for 360 min table 5 shows the results obtained in the phytotoxicity bioassay for the germination rates and the ic50 in the pet flow reactor the ic50 values were obtained from the relation of the relative growth of roots in relation to the growth in the negative control according to the table the germination rate has increased with the treatment as well as the ic50 indicating a decline in the acute phytotoxicity of the samples after treatment since smaller values indicate higher acute toxicities the controls demonstrated the seeds were healthy and germinable since 100 of rate was reached in water negative control germination rates with raw sample demonstrated considerable acute toxicity inflicted on lettuce seeds since less than 100 of seeds were germinated while the treated samples provided full germination rate an increase in ic50 value of 163 indicates higher concentrations of contaminants 50 9 mg l 1 are required to inhibit the growth of the tissues of 50 of the lettuce species these two results point out to the fact that more toxic by products were not formed after aop treatment regarding lettuce seeds and it is suitable for the pollutants removal although this study is directly related to vegetative plant growth and is not able to provide conclusive data about human health effects according to a phytotoxicity study performed by nascimento júnior et al 2018 24 with lactuca sativa seeds tt and bb presented a raise from 3931 v v to 8773 v v in ic50 from the raw samples to treated samples the removal of pollutants was carried out in the same uv c h2o2 tio2 system in a traditional bench reactor the results of the water quality parameter analyses are exhibited in table 6 an approximate decrease of 80 was achieved in toc as a result of the oxidation of the organic species to co2 and other inorganic by products consequently cod decreased 85 from its initial value as a result of the removal of oxidizable organic matter evidencing the improvement in water quality 13 the rise in conductivity is explained by the formation of ionic species such as sulphonic and diazonium compounds groups found in bb and tt molecules the rise in ph can be explained by the adsorption route on tio2 surface which causes a surplus of oh that attacks water alkalizing the medium in small levels 37 3 5 cost analysis cost analysis results are exhibited in table 7 for the traditional and the initial pet flow reactor model to operate 1 cycle comparing the results we can observe that the operating costs of the pet flow reactor are about twice the total cost to operate the traditional reactor achieving a slightly higher efficiency 89 49 of dyes degradation but with a capacity 4 5 times greater this can be explained by the best surface area exposed to uvc radiation in the reactor improving power usage important for scale up processes the pet flow reactor operated for 23 cycles in total without losing considerable efficiency the advantages of the reactor rely on the use of recyclable material readily available simple construction and maintenance that can be possibly applied to a variety of organic pollutants in different models for scaling up and its use with natural solar or artificial light 4 conclusions in the present study a photocatalytic reactor could be developed from recyclable material demonstrating high efficiency 99 25 of dyes in 180 min in the treatment of resistant synthetic dyes commonly applied by the food industry the reactor design was studied in order to improve the removal response over time toxicity and water quality parameters analyses assured the improvements in the environmental quality of water with a decrease in acute toxicity of approximately 63 and 80 in total organic carbon the costs of running one degradation cycle presented to be twice as high as the traditional bench reactor although related to 4 5 times greater the treated volume thus pet presented itself as a feasible alternative in the development of photocatalytic reactors for aops among them its cost safety color and easy maintenance future works arise from this study once nascimento júnior et al 2018 28 have reported high removal rates 99 for tt and bb under uv solar systems the use of natural sunlight may be a feasible alternative to reduce largely the power costs associated with the treatment series reactors may also represent a path for scale up processes in continuous mode and could be investigated with the use of natural sunlight and artificial uv radiation another advantage related to pet usage is the possibility of tio2 immobilization over the surface of the reactor itself as described by the methodology proposed by singh et al 2013 38 it is widely known that tio2 suspension systems provide better contact area but they also depend on further separation steps that could be avoided 
14318,this research surveyed influent and effluent concentration of pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants to analyze detection state on the basis of analysis results lab experiments were carried out to improve treatment rate and the result was proposed as a water quality control guideline of wastewater treatment plants according to monthly pharmaceuticals concentration analysis result antiinflammatory analgesic drug and antibiotics including acetaminophen diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were detected in high concentration in the winter while antiepileptics including carbamazepine were detected similar regardless of season existing biological treatment processes removed little of 4 pharmaceuticals except for the acetaminophen so they may be exposed to the surface water in a lab experience to improve removal rate of pharmaceuticals the compromise was not effect in removing pharmaceuticals while the ozonation was effective to remove 99 or more of pharmaceuticals in addition the activated carbon adsorption process showed high removal efficiency therefore the biological treatment process and combined physicochemical oxidation process of ozone or aop are effect in removing pharmaceuticals and it is proposed as the base data for water quality control so as to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants keywords pharmaceuticals coagulation ozone activated carbon wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction with the growing population and extended life span of human beings due to their quality living environments millions of medicines have been developed to maintain good health organization for economic co operation and development oecd is currently advising countries to limit their pharmaceutical production but the united kingdom uk germany and other countries with pharmaceutical production is an economic income source are reportedly still producing numerous medicines 1 as of 2015 the global pharmaceutical market recorded usd 1 06 trillion sales with an annual average growth rate of 5 2 the market size is reportedly usd 363 2 billion in north america usd 315 1 billion in europe and usd

in 2015 increased by 3 4 from the previous year recording krw 16 969 6 billion with an average annual growth rate of 2 1 for the last 5 years the pharmaceutical market is expected to continue to rapidly grow in the next 5 years 2 thus numerous pharmaceuticals are consumed leading to their greater discharge into the ecosystem as pharmaceuticals are manufactured to prevent biodegradation until they perform certain pharmacological roles after being injected 3 much of the active pharmaceuticals are excreted through metabolism with urination after being taken 4 a very small amount several ng l μg l of the remaining pharmaceuticals is discharged into the water ecosystem making the acute toxicity risk low but they are accumulated and circulated through the marine animals consumed by humans and are thus expected to have adverse effects on human health 5 in a chronic toxicity experiment with some medicine a trout was reported to have manifested cytological changes in its liver kidney and gill after it was exposed to diclofenac 1 μg l for 28 days 6 while carbamazepine reportedly showed carcinogenicity in a mouse experiment and mass stranding of fishes with mere concentration in another experiment 7 these results prove the potential risk posed by the remaining pharmaceuticals to the ecosystem the pharmaceuticals arrive at sewage treatment plants through discharge from human bodies mistreatment of the expired ones and other paths some pharmaceuticals however are not completely removed through the treatment processes of sewage treatment plants leading to pollution in the natural water system land and underground water while going back to the water sources through the water circulation 8 indeed a survey found that out of 16 of the 18 types of survey target substances in the influent of a sewage treatment plant 6 had 50 or less treatment efficiency 9 while pharmaceuticals are detected in the influent and effluent of sewage treatment plants continuous reliable surveys have not been carried out and no removal plan or countermeasure has been established this research thus surveyed the detection status by analyzing the concentration of pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of sewage and wastewater treatment plants and the treatment trend for different types of pharmaceuticals by considering the treatment efficiency of such plants processes in addition the pharmaceutical removal rates were obtained from the results of the lab experiments that were conducted on the aforementioned processes and were suggested to be used as data for controlling the water quality of sewage and wastewater treatment plants for the purpose of improving the treatment rate 2 experimental methods 2 1 survey treatment plants this research selected gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants as the survey target as of the end of october 2017 gyeongsan city had a population of 268 611 and its plants had a 140 000 m3 d capacity two industrial complexes are located around the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants which receive the wastewater and domestic sewage from such complexes fig 1 shows the flowchart of the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants and system parameters and dimension were summarized in table 1 2 2 sampling storage 2 2 1 sampling and storage the influent and effluent of the target treatment plants were collected and experimented on monthly from november 2016 to october 2017 and they were sampled by time day of week and process to survey the changed concentration of the target pharmaceuticals a non raining and average flow rate day was selected for sampling composite sampling was used to collect samples grab sampling was used to collect water by month day of week and process and an automatic water sampler was used to collect water by time a brown 1 l glass bottle was used to contain each sample and pre treatment was performed for the individual analysis items after sampling while keeping 4 of it during storage and transportation before the experiments all samples were analyzed within 1 5 h after sampling we performed all the experiments three times and used the average values 2 2 2 target substances this research reviewed pharmaceuticals under overseas studies and selected five types of target substances 2 anti inflammatory analgesic drugs acetaminophen diclofenac 2 antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and 1 antiepileptic carbamazepine which are frequently detected in river water and wastewater treatment plants based on the south korean status survey by the national institute of environmental research and have high priorities 10 11 table 2 shows the target substances 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pharmaceuticals for the pre treatment process an internal standard substance for the refinement of a 20 μl amount was added to 100 ml of the sample oasis hlb 500 mg 6cc lp extraction cartridge was used for solid phase extraction it was performed in five steps conditioning loading washing centrifugation and elution methanol 10 ml ultrapure water 5 ml and 0 1 formic acid 5 ml were used for the conditioning and the sample passed through it the loading time was 10 ml min the cartridge was washed with the ultrapure water the centrifugation was performed at 3500 rpm for 5 min and the elution was performed with the methanol the eluent was concentrated with the nitrogen gas and then analyzed using a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer lc ms ms the analysis conditions of lc ms and minimum detection level and minimum quantification level were summarized tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 4 lab scale experiment coagulation and sedimentation ozonation and activated carbon experiments were performed and a lab experiment was performed on the target sample the supernatant of the original influent of the target treatment plants 2 4 1 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with the coagulation and sedimentation process the coagulation experiment was performed with a jar tester of wisestir and alum al2 so4 3 18h2o as the coagulant for the experiment a 1 l beaker was filled with the original water and 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l coagulant was injected by stage naoh and h2so4 were used to fix it to ph 7 and it was rapidly stirred at 67 rpm for 1 min and then slowly at 31 rpm for 10 min after sedimentation for 30 min the supernatant was collected and analyzed table 5 shows the coagulation ozone and gac experiment conditions 2 4 2 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with ozonation the ozone demand flask experiment determines the ozone concentration by filling the demand flask with the sample water and then injecting a certain amount of ozone into the top inlet to see how much water comes out from the bottom the ki titration method was used to determine the ozone amount to inject and ozone was injected with 1 2 3 4 and 5 mg l concentrations the demand flask had a 1 5 l volume and it was sufficiently shaken for 20 min to improve its contact efficiency in the experiment table 5 shows the ozonation experiment conditions 2 4 3 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with the activated carbon adsorption the pharmaceutical adsorption experiment with activated carbon used a column with a 23 mm internal diameter and a 350 mm length and a piece of mesh was installed under the column to prevent the activated carbon from escaping granular activated carbon was washed with distilled water and then dried in an oven and then under its natural condition before use a constant delivery pump was used to inject the original influent from the top so that it would flow downward the column was filled with 217 mm activated carbon and the empty bed contact time ebct was changed to 5 10 and 15 min for the experiment after each experiment the activated carbon was replaced for the next experiment without any backwashing the size of the activated carbon used in this study was between 4 8 and 8 30 mesh table 5 shows the activated carbon experiment conditions 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in the pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 monthly concentration change fig 2 shows the monthly concentration changes of the pharmaceuticals in the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants acetaminophen fig 2 a an anti inflammatory analgesic drug that can be purchased without a prescription was detected in the influent at a 14 0 67 5 μg l concentration it was influent at a higher concentration than the other pharmaceuticals but it could be easily removed through a biological treatment process with a 99 8 average removal rate as shown in fig 2 b diclofenac was detected in the influent at an average concentration of 0 11 μg l and in the effluent at an average concentration of 0 13 μg l the detected concentration was relatively lower than that in other countries 12 but the pharmaceutical was barely removed with an average removal rate of 48 8 which means that it was detected in higher concentrations in the effluent this is because the said pharmaceutical is not removed by the pharmaceutical removal process but is even accumulated and as such its concentration becomes higher in the effluent the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs acetaminophen and diclofenac showed higher concentrations in winter than in summer as shown in fig 2 c the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim flowed into the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants at 0 013 0 610 and 0 006 0 101 μg l concentrations respectively unlike the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs they require a prescription and are thus less used and detected they were also detected more in winter than in summer other researches showed similar tendencies 13 15 the concentrations of pharmaceuticals change by season because more pharmaceuticals are used in winter due to the higher attack rates of flu and other diseases 16 and the hrt hydraulic retention time and temperature of treatment plants have an effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals by season moreover the detected concentrations of pharmaceuticals are higher due to the reduced water consumption and rainfall in the cold seasons 17 carbamazepine is used to treat epilepsy bipolar disorder and other mental diseases and it needs to be continuously dosed unlike the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs and antibiotics that increase in winter the monthly influent concentration of carbamazepine is relatively constant at 0 056 0 176 μg l for the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants the concentration of carbamazepine in each step of the treatment process did not show any significant difference the monthly pharmaceutical concentration change survey detected higher concentrations in winter due to the increased consumption and reduced flow compared to summer 3 2 behavior of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant fig 3 shows the treatment efficiency of the five target pharmaceuticals by process at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants acetaminophen had a higher concentration than the other pharmaceuticals in the influent but 99 9 of it was removed it is quickly biodegraded and hydrophile and can thus be removed through coagulation and adsorption diclofenac shows a tendency to slightly decrease in the bioreactor but its concentration is higher in the effluent than in the influent it is not easily biodegraded and agglomerated and is thus removed sulfamethoxazole showed a lower concentration in the bioreactor of the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants but increased again in the second sedimentation basin the final removal rate was low at 21 3 fig 3 for trimethoprim 32 4 of it was removed at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants like acetaminophen it is hydrophile and can thus be partially removed through the coagulation process to combine electrostatically with a coagulant it is reported however that it is not efficiently removed only through coagulation treatment and a similar result was shown in this study 18 less than 10 of the carbamazepine was removed at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants given its unchanged concentration in the entire process it is difficult to remove only through the biological and coagulation treatments this result coincides with the report that it is not easily agglomerated and biodegraded and is thus barely removed due to its hydrophobicity 19 20 the concentrations of diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine increased in the effluent as glucuronidase and other metabolites are transformed due to the enzyme process and the accumulation of the untreated pharmaceuticals also has an effect 21 the process specific removal rate research results showed that the existing biological treatment processes removed only small amounts of the four pharmaceuticals other than acetaminophen this result is similar to that of the pharmaceutical removal rate research for seven wastewater treatment plants in spain where 96 100 of the acetaminophen 30 100 of the diclofenac and 30 92 of the sulfamethoxazole were removed but most of the removal rates were incomplete 22 the removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants is reported to have different results according to the environmental conditions and physicochemical characteristics including the characteristics of the target pharmaceuticals the treatment processes the hydraulic retention time the temperature and the intensity of light 23 24 as such continued research and data accumulation are required to improve the stable removal rate of pharmaceuticals 3 3 removal of the pharmaceuticals through a lab experiment a batch test was performed for the target pharmaceuticals with the original influent water and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals via coagulation and sedimentation ozonation and activated carbon adsorption was surveyed the ozone contact and activated carbon adsorption experiments however were performed for the four pharmaceuticals other than acetaminophen which can be removed through the existing biological treatment process 3 3 1 coagulation and sedimentation experiment fig 4 a shows the experiment results with the changed concentration of the coagulant from 10 to 50 mg l the acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by approximately 20 30 while the diclofenac and carbamazepine were treated by under 10 which means they were barely removed it was difficult to remove the pharmaceuticals only through the coagulation and sedimentation process which is similar to the past research results 10 25 it is considered that additional follow up processes are required to remove pharmaceuticals 3 3 2 ozonation experiment fig 4 b shows the experiment results with the changed ozone concentration from 1 to 5 mg l the experiment results showed high removal efficiency for all the items the anti inflammatory analgesic diclofenac was removed by 98 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone while the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 96 and 97 respectively the anti epileptic carbamazepine was removed by 94 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone with the injection of 4 mg l ozone all the items were removed by 99 the diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole were oxidized degraded and thus removed in the double bond to connect the aromatic amino group and 2 phenyls of carbamazepine 26 in the removal rate experiment results with the ozonation of the pharmaceuticals for the 2nd effluent the carbamazepine was removed by 86 3 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone but by 95 3 with the injection of 6 mg l ozone 27 when ozone was injected at 3 mg l all of the substances showed a high removal rate of 90 or more another south korean experiment which injected ozone into the 2nd effluent containing 25 pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine diclofenac and trimethoprim while changing the ozone concentrations to 2 4 and 6 mg l reported that the 6 mg l concentration removed the pharmaceuticals efficiently 28 as with the other research results this research showed very high removal rates in the ozonation experiment proving that the ozonation process is very effective in removing pharmaceuticals if the ozonation or aop process is carried out after the biological treatment process the treatment rate will be increased for the pharmaceuticals that are not removed by the existing biological sewage treatment process 3 3 3 activated carbon adsorption fig 4 c shows the activated carbon adsorption test results with the ebct changed from 5 to 15 min the diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed by 95 or more with the ebct of 15 min while the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 90 with the same ebct the activated carbon adsorption test results showed high removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals stackelberg researched on the removal rate by setting the contact time of the gac filter to 1 5 3 minutes and reported that the short contact time removed about 53 of the pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds 29 other studies reported similar results that is the pharmaceuticals were effectively removed through the activated carbon adsorption process 30 32 which was also shown in this research 3 3 4 removal efficiency comparison by process an effective treatment method was considered to remove the pharmaceuticals based on the process specific analysis results of the target treatment plants and the lab experiment results the biological treatment process showed low removal rates except for acetaminophen while the ozonation experiment showed 99 or higher removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals the activated carbon adsorption process showed a 90 or higher average removal rate the ozonation process will be more efficient for removal even though the activated carbon adsorption process showed high removal rates in the experiment in this study thus more pharmaceuticals will be removed and the operation of sewage treatment plants will be more efficient if the ozonation or aop process will be additionally used table 6 shows the removal efficiency by pharmaceutical 4 conclusion the following have been analogized by surveying the water quality changes of pharmaceuticals for sewage and wastewater treatment plants 1 for the monthly concentration changes of the target pharmaceuticals the anti inflammatory analgesics acetaminophen and diclofenac and the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim showed higher influent concentrations in winter than in summer due to the increased consumption and reduced flow rate while the anti epileptic carbamazepine showed little influent concentration change by season due to its characteristics 2 the process specific pharmaceutical concentration survey results showed that the acetaminophen was removed by 99 for both treatment plants while the other pharmaceuticals were not removed and thus would be difficult to remove only through biological treatment 3 in the lab experiment there was difficulty removing the target pharmaceuticals effectively through coagulation and sedimentation the ozonation experiment removed all the target pharmaceuticals by 99 or more while the activated carbon adsorption experiment removed them effectively pharmaceuticals can thus be most effectively removed by adding the ozonation and aop process to the existing biological treatment process 4 the diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed by 95 or more with the ebct of 15 min while the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 90 with the same ebct the activated carbon adsorption test results showed high removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals acknowledgement this work was supported by korea environment industry

research reviewed pharmaceuticals under overseas studies and selected five types of target substances 2 anti inflammatory analgesic drugs acetaminophen diclofenac 2 antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and 1 antiepileptic carbamazepine which are frequently detected in river water and wastewater treatment plants based on the south korean status survey by the national institute of environmental research and have high priorities 10 11 table 2 shows the target substances 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pharmaceuticals for the pre treatment process an internal standard substance for the refinement of a 20 μl amount was added to 100 ml of the sample oasis hlb 500 mg 6cc lp extraction cartridge was used for solid phase extraction it was performed in five steps conditioning loading washing centrifugation and elution methanol 10 ml ultrapure water 5 ml and 0 1 formic acid 5 ml were used for the conditioning and the sample passed through it the loading time was 10 ml min the cartridge was washed with the ultrapure water the centrifugation was performed at 3500 rpm for 5 min and the elution was performed with the methanol the eluent was concentrated with the nitrogen gas and then analyzed using a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer lc ms ms the analysis conditions of lc ms and minimum detection level and minimum quantification level were summarized tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 4 lab scale experiment coagulation and sedimentation ozonation and activated carbon experiments were performed and a lab experiment was performed on the target sample the supernatant of the original influent of the target treatment plants 2 4 1 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with the coagulation and sedimentation process the coagulation experiment was performed with a jar tester of wisestir and alum al2 so4 3 18h2o as the coagulant for the experiment a 1 l beaker was filled with the original water and 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l coagulant was injected by stage naoh and h2so4 were used to fix it to ph 7 and it was rapidly stirred at 67 rpm for 1 min and then slowly at 31 rpm for 10 min after sedimentation for 30 min the supernatant was collected and analyzed table 5 shows the coagulation ozone and gac experiment conditions 2 4 2 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with ozonation the ozone demand flask experiment determines the ozone concentration by filling the demand flask with the sample water and then injecting a certain amount of ozone into the top inlet to see how much water comes out from the bottom the ki titration method was used to determine the ozone amount to inject and ozone was injected with 1 2 3 4 and 5 mg l concentrations the demand flask had a 1 5 l volume and it was sufficiently shaken for 20 min to improve its contact efficiency in the experiment table 5 shows the ozonation experiment conditions 2 4 3 experiment to remove the pharmaceuticals with the activated carbon adsorption the pharmaceutical adsorption experiment with activated carbon used a column with a 23 mm internal diameter and a 350 mm length and a piece of mesh was installed under the column to prevent the activated carbon from escaping granular activated carbon was washed with distilled water and then dried in an oven and then under its natural condition before use a constant delivery pump was used to inject the original influent from the top so that it would flow downward the column was filled with 217 mm activated carbon and the empty bed contact time ebct was changed to 5 10 and 15 min for the experiment after each experiment the activated carbon was replaced for the next experiment without any backwashing the size of the activated carbon used in this study was between 4 8 and 8 30 mesh table 5 shows the activated carbon experiment conditions 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in the pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 monthly concentration change fig 2 shows the monthly concentration changes of the pharmaceuticals in the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants acetaminophen fig 2 a an anti inflammatory analgesic drug that can be purchased without a prescription was detected in the influent at a 14 0 67 5 μg l concentration it was influent at a higher concentration than the other pharmaceuticals but it could be easily removed through a biological treatment process with a 99 8 average removal rate as shown in fig 2 b diclofenac was detected in the influent at an average concentration of 0 11 μg l and in the effluent at an average concentration of 0 13 μg l the detected concentration was relatively lower than that in other countries 12 but the pharmaceutical was barely removed with an average removal rate of 48 8 which means that it was detected in higher concentrations in the effluent this is because the said pharmaceutical is not removed by the pharmaceutical removal process but is even accumulated and as such its concentration becomes higher in the effluent the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs acetaminophen and diclofenac showed higher concentrations in winter than in summer as shown in fig 2 c the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim flowed into the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants at 0 013 0 610 and 0 006 0 101 μg l concentrations respectively unlike the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs they require a prescription and are thus less used and detected they were also detected more in winter than in summer other researches showed similar tendencies 13 15 the concentrations of pharmaceuticals change by season because more pharmaceuticals are used in winter due to the higher attack rates of flu and other diseases 16 and the hrt hydraulic retention time and temperature of treatment plants have an effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals by season moreover the detected concentrations of pharmaceuticals are higher due to the reduced water consumption and rainfall in the cold seasons 17 carbamazepine is used to treat epilepsy bipolar disorder and other mental diseases and it needs to be continuously dosed unlike the anti inflammatory analgesic drugs and antibiotics that increase in winter the monthly influent concentration of carbamazepine is relatively constant at 0 056 0 176 μg l for the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants the concentration of carbamazepine in each step of the treatment process did not show any significant difference the monthly pharmaceutical concentration change survey detected higher concentrations in winter due to the increased consumption and reduced flow compared to summer 3 2 behavior of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant fig 3 shows the treatment efficiency of the five target pharmaceuticals by process at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants acetaminophen had a higher concentration than the other pharmaceuticals in the influent but 99 9 of it was removed it is quickly biodegraded and hydrophile and can thus be removed through coagulation and adsorption diclofenac shows a tendency to slightly decrease in the bioreactor but its concentration is higher in the effluent than in the influent it is not easily biodegraded and agglomerated and is thus removed sulfamethoxazole showed a lower concentration in the bioreactor of the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants but increased again in the second sedimentation basin the final removal rate was low at 21 3 fig 3 for trimethoprim 32 4 of it was removed at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants like acetaminophen it is hydrophile and can thus be partially removed through the coagulation process to combine electrostatically with a coagulant it is reported however that it is not efficiently removed only through coagulation treatment and a similar result was shown in this study 18 less than 10 of the carbamazepine was removed at the gyeongsan public wastewater treatment plants given its unchanged concentration in the entire process it is difficult to remove only through the biological and coagulation treatments this result coincides with the report that it is not easily agglomerated and biodegraded and is thus barely removed due to its hydrophobicity 19 20 the concentrations of diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine increased in the effluent as glucuronidase and other metabolites are transformed due to the enzyme process and the accumulation of the untreated pharmaceuticals also has an effect 21 the process specific removal rate research results showed that the existing biological treatment processes removed only small amounts of the four pharmaceuticals other than acetaminophen this result is similar to that of the pharmaceutical removal rate research for seven wastewater treatment plants in spain where 96 100 of the acetaminophen 30 100 of the diclofenac and 30 92 of the sulfamethoxazole were removed but most of the removal rates were incomplete 22 the removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants is reported to have different results according to the environmental conditions and physicochemical characteristics including the characteristics of the target pharmaceuticals the treatment processes the hydraulic retention time the temperature and the intensity of light 23 24 as such continued research and data accumulation are required to improve the stable removal rate of pharmaceuticals 3 3 removal of the pharmaceuticals through a lab experiment a batch test was performed for the target pharmaceuticals with the original influent water and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals via coagulation and sedimentation ozonation and activated carbon adsorption was surveyed the ozone contact and activated carbon adsorption experiments however were performed for the four pharmaceuticals other than acetaminophen which can be removed through the existing biological treatment process 3 3 1 coagulation and sedimentation experiment fig 4 a shows the experiment results with the changed concentration of the coagulant from 10 to 50 mg l the acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by approximately 20 30 while the diclofenac and carbamazepine were treated by under 10 which means they were barely removed it was difficult to remove the pharmaceuticals only through the coagulation and sedimentation process which is similar to the past research results 10 25 it is considered that additional follow up processes are required to remove pharmaceuticals 3 3 2 ozonation experiment fig 4 b shows the experiment results with the changed ozone concentration from 1 to 5 mg l the experiment results showed high removal efficiency for all the items the anti inflammatory analgesic diclofenac was removed by 98 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone while the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 96 and 97 respectively the anti epileptic carbamazepine was removed by 94 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone with the injection of 4 mg l ozone all the items were removed by 99 the diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole were oxidized degraded and thus removed in the double bond to connect the aromatic amino group and 2 phenyls of carbamazepine 26 in the removal rate experiment results with the ozonation of the pharmaceuticals for the 2nd effluent the carbamazepine was removed by 86 3 with the injection of 3 mg l ozone but by 95 3 with the injection of 6 mg l ozone 27 when ozone was injected at 3 mg l all of the substances showed a high removal rate of 90 or more another south korean experiment which injected ozone into the 2nd effluent containing 25 pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine diclofenac and trimethoprim while changing the ozone concentrations to 2 4 and 6 mg l reported that the 6 mg l concentration removed the pharmaceuticals efficiently 28 as with the other research results this research showed very high removal rates in the ozonation experiment proving that the ozonation process is very effective in removing pharmaceuticals if the ozonation or aop process is carried out after the biological treatment process the treatment rate will be increased for the pharmaceuticals that are not removed by the existing biological sewage treatment process 3 3 3 activated carbon adsorption fig 4 c shows the activated carbon adsorption test results with the ebct changed from 5 to 15 min the diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed by 95 or more with the ebct of 15 min while the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 90 with the same ebct the activated carbon adsorption test results showed high removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals stackelberg researched on the removal rate by setting the contact time of the gac filter to 1 5 3 minutes and reported that the short contact time removed about 53 of the pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds 29 other studies reported similar results that is the pharmaceuticals were effectively removed through the activated carbon adsorption process 30 32 which was also shown in this research 3 3 4 removal efficiency comparison by process an effective treatment method was considered to remove the pharmaceuticals based on the process specific analysis results of the target treatment plants and the lab experiment results the biological treatment process showed low removal rates except for acetaminophen while the ozonation experiment showed 99 or higher removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals the activated carbon adsorption process showed a 90 or higher average removal rate the ozonation process will be more efficient for removal even though the activated carbon adsorption process showed high removal rates in the experiment in this study thus more pharmaceuticals will be removed and the operation of sewage treatment plants will be more efficient if the ozonation or aop process will be additionally used table 6 shows the removal efficiency by pharmaceutical 4 conclusion the following have been analogized by surveying the water quality changes of pharmaceuticals for sewage and wastewater treatment plants 1 for the monthly concentration changes of the target pharmaceuticals the anti inflammatory analgesics acetaminophen and diclofenac and the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim showed higher influent concentrations in winter than in summer due to the increased consumption and reduced flow rate while the anti epileptic carbamazepine showed little influent concentration change by season due to its characteristics 2 the process specific pharmaceutical concentration survey results showed that the acetaminophen was removed by 99 for both treatment plants while the other pharmaceuticals were not removed and thus would be difficult to remove only through biological treatment 3 in the lab experiment there was difficulty removing the target pharmaceuticals effectively through coagulation and sedimentation the ozonation experiment removed all the target pharmaceuticals by 99 or more while the activated carbon adsorption experiment removed them effectively pharmaceuticals can thus be most effectively removed by adding the ozonation and aop process to the existing biological treatment process 4 the diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed by 95 or more with the ebct of 15 min while the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed by 90 with the same ebct the activated carbon adsorption test results showed high removal rates for all the target pharmaceuticals acknowledgement this work was supported by korea environment industry

14319,the flow radiation intensity and concentration of microorganisms in three uv reactors are simulated using an integrated mathematical model for uv disinfection all governing equations are solved using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent the effect of internal configuration on the disinfection level in the reactor is discussed in detail there exists a relatively strong recirculation in the lower part of the u type reactor the two baffled reactors improve the mixing of microorganisms the longitudinal baffled reactor can achieve the highest disinfection level it is recommended that the arrangement of baffle should produce a longer flow path keywords cfd uv disinfection reactor configuration radiative transfer equation 1 introduction uv disinfection is a reliable technology to inactivate microorganisms in drinking water which can kill most microorganisms without producing disinfection by products 1 4 when microorganisms move in uv reactors they are inactivated under the illumination of uv light as a result the disinfection level of microorganisms depends on the radiation intensity and the hydrodynamics in the reactor therefore it is very important to optimize the flow field and radiation distribution in the reactor the flow field in reactors is usually described under the eulerian framework 5 12 the concentration of microorganisms can be described by an advection diffusion reaction equation under the eulerian framework 11 13 17 or by the particle method under the lagrangian framework a comparison between the eulerian and lagrangian methods showed that good agreement was obtained for high flow rates whereas some discrepancies were observed for low flow rates 17 in general this discrepancy may be overcome by taking the scalar diffusion coefficient to be zero 14 the flow is usually turbulent in reactors the previous studies proved that k ε turbulence models can describe well the turbulent diffusion 18 20 in general cfd simulation based on the eulerian method and k ε turbulence models have gained success in the simulation of uv disinfection cfd simulation can easily consider the internal configuration and the assembly of inlet and outlet of the reactor there exists the lamp array consisting of several uv lamps in the reactor which may produce a well mixing flow by reducing the dead zones as well as short circuiting and thus enhance the disinfection 21 on the other hand baffles are usually installed in reactors to direct the flow 22 25 experimental studies showed that baffled reactors achieved high disinfection efficiency 26 27 numerical studies proved that baffles can affect the residence time distribution and the uv dose 28 29 it has been reported that the shape and size of the reactor has a complex effect on the reactor performance 26 30 31 the aforementioned studies show that the effect of reactor configuration on the disinfection is complex the present study aims to simulate the disinfection level in uv reactors with different internal structures the governing equations under the eulerian framework are used to describe the flow and the concentration of microorganisms 2 governing equations the hydraulic characteristics in a reactor plays an important role in the prediction of the concentration of microorganisms considering the velocity in the reactor the flow is turbulent water can be viewed as an incompressible fluid thus the continuity equation and the momentum equation can be described as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ μ t u i x j where ui and uj are the

incident radiation of uv light as shown in eq 6 the disinfection of microorganisms depends on the distribution of the incident radiation which can be computed by 7 g r 0 4 π i r s d ω where i is the radiation intensity r is the position vector and s is the direction vector the radiation intensity can be described by the radiative transfer equation which reads 8 d i r s d s a σ s i r s σ s 4 π 0 4 π i r s φ s s d ω where s is the scattering direction a is the absorption coefficient σs is the scattering coefficient ф is the phase function and ω is the solid angle 3 simulation details three uv reactors with different internal configurations are studied the main body of each reactor has a length of 0 94 m and a diameter of 0 089 m a uv lamp with the radiation power of 2 12 w at 254 nm is installed in reactors the lamp surface area is 0 0424 m2 and the effective radiation intensity is 50 w m 2 the lamp has a diameter of 0 0225 m and a length of 0 94 m the diameters of inlet and outlet tube are 0 022 m respectively fig 1 a shows a u type reactor fig 1 b shows a transverse baffled reactor equipped with six baffles perpendicular to the x direction located at x 0 25 m x 0 47 m and x 0 69 m respectively fig 1 c presents a longitudinal baffled reactor with a baffle of 0 9 m long the computational domain is discretized into the tetrahedron grid using ansys icem the grid near the inlet outlet and the wall is refined gird sensitivity tests show that at least a half million mesh is required to obtain a satisfactory result thus the mesh numbers are 687636 538816 and 533035 for the u type reactor the longitudinal baffled reactor and the transverse baffled reactor respectively all governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method and solved using ansys fluent the simple algorithm is used to deal with the pressure velocity coupling the second order upwind scheme is adopted to discretize the advection term the radiative transfer equation is solved using the discrete coordinate do model the theta and phi divisions as well as the theta and phi pixels are taken to be 5 5 and 3 3 respectively all flow equations are assumed to converge when the normalized residuals are less than 1 0 10 4 the radiative transfer equation and the concentration equation are assumed to converge when the normalized residuals are less than 1 0 10 6 no slip condition is assumed at all walls for all reactors the inlet velocity turbulent intensity and turbulence length scale are 0 658 m s 1 2 and 0 00154 m respectively the scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient of water is 1 m 1 and 10 5 m 1 respectively the diffuse reflectance of both the reactor inner wall and baffles is unity lamp surface is semi transparent and the diffuse fraction is unity the density and dynamic viscosity of water is 998 kg m 3 and 1 003 10 3 pa s respectively the turbulent schmidt number σc is 0 7 the first order rate constant km is 0 0036 j 1 m2 32 4 validation sozzi and taghipou 17 measured the velocity in a photocatalytic reactor similar to the present u type rector as shown in fig 2 the present computation accords well with the experimental data meaning that the present cfd model can reproduce the flow field in the u type reactor the same computational procedure will be applied to the two baffled reactors and thus the flow field in the two baffled reactors is reliable 5 result and discussion fig 3 shows the velocity distribution in the plane y 0 m the flow is relatively uniform in the two baffled reactors especially in the longitudinal baffled reactor which shows that baffles significantly improves the flow in the reactor fig 4 shows the velocity vector in the region near the outlet in the plane y 0 m the recirculation region is observed in all three reactors compared with the two baffled reactors there exists a large recirculation region in the u type reactor fig 5 shows the plot of x velocity component along the line x 0 47 m y 0 m the velocity in the region near the lamp is greater in the two baffled reactors than that in the u type reactor the x velocity component in the two baffled reactors is more uniform than that in the u type reactor fig 6 depicts the distribution of turbulent viscosity in the plane y 0 m the turbulent viscosity is larger in the region near the inlet than near the outlet the turbulent viscosity in the transverse baffled reactor is the most uniform due to the existence of six baffles there exists a large region with low turbulent viscosity in the longitudinal baffled reactor which helps to increase the residence time of microorganisms in the reactor the existence of baffles may increase the turbulence as shown in fig 7 the turbulent viscosity in the upper part of the line x 0 47 m y 0 m increases for the transverse baffled reactor whereas decreases for the longitudinal baffled reactor fig 8 shows the residence time distribution in the plane y 0 m the residence times of the microorganisms in the lower part of u type reactor are much larger than that in the center which is due to the existence of a dead zone in the lower part of u type reactor as shown in fig 3 a compared with the u type reactor there exists a large region with long residence time in the transverse baffled reactor due to the configuration of baffles the region with the largest residence time is located in the region near the outlet in the longitudinal baffled reactor which may be helpful for the inactivation of microorganisms fig 9 shows the radiation intensity distribution in the transverse baffled in the plane y 0 m the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is very high in a region around the lamp and decays faster in the radial direction the high radiation intensity region near the lamp is the most effective inactivation region implying that microorganisms should be directed to stay in this region as long as possible the radiation intensity profiles in the other two reactors are similar to fig 9 which are not shown here for simplicity the distribution of the normalized microorganism concentration in the plane y 0 m is shown in fig 10 the concentration of microorganism in all three reactors gradually decreased as the fluid moves from the inlet to the outlet the normalized microorganism concentrations at the outlet are 0 239 0 242 and 0 215 for the u type reactor the transverse baffled reactor and the longitudinal baffled reactor respectively under the same operating conditions the longitudinal baffled reactor obtains the best disinfection efficiency which can be ascribed to the increase of flow path and the decrease of recirculation zones thus a longer flow path is recommended when arranging baffles in the reactor 6 conclusions the disinfection of microorganisms in three uv reactors is simulated in the present study baffles improve the flow in reactors the flow in the two baffled reactors is more uniform than in the u type reactor there exists a large region with low turbulent viscosity in the longitudinal baffled reactor the normalized microorganism concentrations at the reactor outlet is the lowest for the longitudinal baffled reactor which can be ascribed to its longest flow path whereas is the largest for the transverse baffled reactor in short the configuration of baffles should make the flow path as long as possible

most effective inactivation region implying that microorganisms should be directed to stay in this region as long as possible the radiation intensity profiles in the other two reactors are similar to fig 9 which are not shown here for simplicity the distribution of the normalized microorganism concentration in the plane y 0 m is shown in fig 10 the concentration of microorganism in all three reactors gradually decreased as the fluid moves from the inlet to the outlet the normalized microorganism concentrations at the outlet are 0 239 0 242 and 0 215 for the u type reactor the transverse baffled reactor and the longitudinal baffled reactor respectively under the same operating conditions the longitudinal baffled reactor obtains the best disinfection efficiency which can be ascribed to the increase of flow path and the decrease of recirculation zones thus a longer flow path is recommended when arranging baffles in the reactor 6 conclusions the disinfection of microorganisms in three uv reactors is simulated in the present study baffles improve the flow in reactors the flow in the two baffled reactors is more uniform than in the u type reactor there exists a large region with low turbulent viscosity in the longitudinal baffled reactor the normalized microorganism concentrations at the reactor outlet is the lowest for the longitudinal baffled reactor which can be ascribed to its longest flow path whereas is the largest for the transverse baffled reactor in short the configuration of baffles should make the flow path as long as possible
