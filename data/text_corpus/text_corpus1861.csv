9305,soil system budgets ssb of nutrients are generally performed annually over arable land to infer their use efficiency and water pollution risk in highly exploited agricultural watersheds they are seldom partitioned into seasonal budgets and matched with seasonal nutrient transport in adjacent river reaches we calculated seasonal soil nitrogen n budgets in a mincio river sub basin italy and we analyzed the dissolved inorganic n net export in the river reach draining such sub basin our results show seasonal differences of ssb with n excess in winter and even more in spring equilibrium among sources and sinks during autumn and n deficit during summer seasonal inorganic n loads transported by the river were not correlated with ssb as they peaked in late summer and were at their minimum in early spring fertilization uncoupled to significant uptake supports n excess in winter and spring whereas crop uptake uncoupled to n inputs supports summer n deficit nitrification cannot explain nitrate accumulation in the river reach suggesting alternative dynamics driving the local hydrology flood irrigation results in large soil nitrate solubilization transport and in upward migration of the groundwater piezometric head during spring and summer periods river water is likely replaced by nitrate rich groundwater when the groundwater recharge exceeds a certain threshold coinciding with late summer irrigation is then interrupted and the piezometric head together with nitrate exchange decreases this work suggests that a deep understanding of n dynamics in agricultural watersheds with flooding irrigation on permeable soils needs the reconstruction of the vertical pathways of nitrate and of river groundwater interactions moreover the partitioning of annual into seasonal n budgets and their combination with irrigation practices allows the identification of hot moments in n cycling agricultural practices minimizing nitrate excess its mobility and the risk of surface and groundwater pollution are suggested for this area keywords nitrogen retention transport loads irrigation river groundwater interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dramatic increase of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen n inputs in watersheds with intensive agriculture and animal farming has demonstrated negative effects for inland water and groundwater chemical and biological quality drinking water supplies ecosystem integrity and functioning and human health van grinsven et al 2006 galloway et al 2008 rivett et al 2008 schlesinger 2009 sobota et al 2015 huang et al 2017 such negative effects are amplified by the human derived alteration of the hydrological cycle at the watershed scale and by climate change galloway et al 2008 overeem et al 2013 woolway and merchant 2019 woolway et al 2020 among the underlying mechanisms are water abstraction for irrigation or industrial purposes or climate change related drought reducing river discharge and its capacity to dilute and process n loads palmer et al 2008 low discharge promotes also hyporheic anoxia and ammonium recycling from sediments hlaváčová et al 2005 hydrological extremes include also short term heavy precipitations resulting in high discharge events transferring large n loads from cultivated areas saturating riverine denitrification capacity viaroli et al 2018 magri et al 2020 nitrogen budgets calculated for agricultural soils within a river basin allow to evaluate the potential risk of diffuse n pollution oenema et al 2003 soana et al 2011 in agricultural soils n inputs associated with organic or synthetic fertilizers atmospheric deposition or biological fixation can be either temporarily retained in crops or released to the atmosphere as gaseous losses nitrogen inputs in excess to temporary retention or permanent loss can be transferred via runoff to adjacent aquatic ecosystems howarth et al 1996 seitzinger et al 2006 pinardi et al 2018 2020 kwon et al 2022 if soil system budgets in arable land produce reliable snapshots of n pools and fluxes in cultivated areas the detailed reconstruction and partitioning of n pools and fluxes within watersheds is a challenging objective for example seasonally variable water inputs to agricultural soils via precipitation and irrigation affect soil n leaching horizontal and vertical transport and transformation n use efficiency as well as river groundwater interactions and associated n exchange schaefer and alber 2007 chae et al 2009 howarth et al 2012 sinha and michalak 2016 moreover in intensively cultivated floodplains the hydrological cycle has been regulated by the realization of infrastructures as dams and networks of canals that help buffering climatic anomalies and ensure water availability for crops in italy for example the alpine sector of the po river basin hosts large dams that regulate the release of water from deep subalpine lakes maggiore como iseo idro and garda lakes to their emissaries ticino adda oglio chiese and mincio rivers winter water retention in subalpine lakes occurs at the cost and drawbacks of reduced water discharge and contributes to the downward vertical migration of groundwater often resulting in downwelling river groundwater interactions i e the river feeds the groundwater rotiroti et al 2019 severini et al 2021 on the contrary summer irrigation besides representing a vehicle for n transport produces opposite effects often reversing the direction of river groundwater interactions i e upwelling the groundwater feeds the river these practices that characterize anthropogenic intensively cultivated and hydraulically regulated watersheds with permeable soil introduce marked seasonality in n budgets lin et al 2019 racchetti et al 2019 many authors reported a significant correlation between annual n input to croplands and river n export neff et al 2003 yan et al 2010 xu et al 2013 strokal et al 2014 tong et al 2017 but they did rarely account for the seasonality of n input and export mccrackin et al 2014 chen et al 2019 studies targeting n budgets in agricultural watersheds are generally conceived at the annual scale for mainly practical reasons as agricultural census data are collected and published by national statistical institutions with annual frequency such an approach from one side allows to calculate n use efficiency in cropland and potential n loss but from the other side it misses temporal resolution and precludes the understanding of seasonal variations of the array of n related processes potentially regulated also by climate change for example human activities e g crop production and altered hydrology may influence the seasonality of n river export basu et al 2010 compton et al 2020 together with the seasonal evolution of temperature that influences n losses retention and removal processes e g denitrification mccrackin et al 2014 understanding how seasonal variations in human activities and hydrology influence n budgets in agricultural soils and n transport by rivers is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying n transformations along the terrestrial aquatic path improve agricultural practices to increase n use efficiency and decrease n pollution and eventually forecast how climate change will affect n dynamics mas pla and menció 2019 this important set of objectives is a difficult target at the scale of whole watersheds due to scarce resolution of available data and spatial heterogeneity e g pedology land use etc smaller scales of analysis targeting specific and homogeneous river and watershed sectors seem much more promising mccrackin et al 2014 chen et al 2019 compton et al 2020 different studies carried out at large temporal and spatial scales soana et al 2011 pinardi et al 2018 viaroli et al 2018 lassaletta et al 2021 have highlighted the presence of hot spots within watersheds that represent outliers in n budgets e g with very large n excess or very low n use efficiency they also emphasized the presence of hot moments within watersheds that are specific periods during which n mass transfer peaks as a combination of decreased uptake increased runoff or variation of the water table level resulting in the reactivation of river groundwater interaction rosenzweig et al 2008 preisendanz et al 2020 taherisoudejani et al 2018 the analysis of n hot spots and hot moments in watersheds require specific studies focusing on small spatial and temporal scales in northern italy the po river valley is an alluvial plain heavily exploited by human activities such as agriculture animal farming industry and tourism land use change and hydrological alterations determined high pressure on both surface and groundwater may 2013 pérez martín et al 2014 lasagna and de luca 2019 and a wide portion of the plain is classified as vulnerable to nitrate pollution martinelli et al 2018 the main aim of this study is to analyze the seasonal evolution of dissolved inorganic n loads in a fluvial segment of the mincio river a tributary of the po river characterized by natural banks gravel bottom with submerged vegetation and regulated discharge this segment crosses a transitional area between permeable and non permeable soils characterized by springs and classified as an area of river groundwater interactions balestrini et al 2021 due to its hydrogeological features and the large water availability the considered sub basin is a hotspot of intensive agriculture and animal farming and represents a key study area to analyze if and how the seasonality of agricultural practices affects n dynamics in this sector of the po river groundwater in the phreatic and shallow aquifer has a short residence time as compared to semiconfined or confined deeper aquifers this is supported by fast few days surface groundwater dynamics of micro pollutants balderacchi et al 2016 and low concentrations of total dissolved solids martinelli et al 2018 results of balderacchi et al 2016 suggest also fast response of shallow aquifers to changing conditions as such they allow to trace agricultural practices e g use of herbicides or fertilization and they respond quickly to hydrologic variations e g drought precipitations irrigation it can be assumed that macrocontaminants as nitrates undergo the same fast transfer mechanisms also due to their elevated solubility and absence of interaction with soil and sediment the main hypotheses of this work are that river groundwater interactions affect n transport in specific river sectors and vary seasonally due to combination of irrigation practices and inorganic nitrogen excess in soil we also hypothesized that the seasonal dynamics of such variable interactions can be captured analyzing comparatively seasonal n budget in agricultural soils and seasonal riverine n transport in this context the main aim of the present study was to contrast seasonal n soil budget in an agricultural area drained by a river stretch with seasonal n loads transported by the same draining river stretch to assess riverine n dynamics in relation to agricultural practices 2 study area the mincio river 75 km originates from the lake garda the largest italian lake and is a tributary of the po river fig 1 the hydrological regime of the mincio river is regulated upstream by a dam which controls the water discharge from the lake garda along the river course a series of dams and weirs feeds a network of canals for irrigation and industrial purposes and controls discharge variations to avoid the flooding of cities and villages water management for lake garda recreational activities and for agricultural purposes results in marked flow variations indeed since the establishment of the river regulation in the 60 s of the last century the mincio river discharge averaged 80 and 30 m3 s 1 during the irrigation may to september and outside the irrigation periods respectively lombardy region 2017 more recently projections of decreasing water availability resulted in a further reduction of the mincio river discharge to 14 m3 s 1 www laghi net in autumn and winter to keep water in the lake garda and guarantee water availability for irrigation and tourism in the summer season during winter the flow reduction and absence of irrigation result in a decreased aquifer recharge a phenomenon described by different authors in this geographical area at regional rotiroti et al 2019 and local scales severini et al 2021 and consequently in a lowering of the phreatic surface this water transfer dynamic results in a decrease of groundwater upwelling in winter and early spring balderacchi et al 2016 a wide segment of the mincio river including the portion investigated in this study flows in a flood plain characterized by a multilayered aquifer system with a cyclic facies architecture mainly made of fluvial channel gravel and sand and floodplain clay deposits amorosi et al 2008 as a result the northern part of the plain high plain is locally characterized by shallow phreatic aquifers while in the southern part low plain the floodplain facies act as aquitards or aquicludes resulting in confined and semi confined aquifers chelli et al 2018 the river reach investigated from s1 to s2 length 8 1 km mean depth 1 m mean water velocity 1 0 m s 1 is in the high medium plain of the mincio watershed this river segment drains the surface of four municipalities 1 valeggio sul mincio 2 volta mantovana 3 goito and 4 marmirolo total area 184 km2 fig 1 since 2006 these municipalities are classified as nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs according to the european nitrate directive 91 676 cee the area of the four municipalities investigated in mainly classified as agricultural land with fertile soils due to calcareous gravel deposits with favor intensively exploitation by agriculture utilized agricultural area uaa covers 76 of the study area fig 1 and animal farming 1 2 and 0 6 t of

the other aquatic environments such as quarry lakes is 0 62 km2 3 material and methods 3 1 nitrogen budgets and water inputs a comprehensive input output n budget across the utilized agricultural area uaa was compiled by using locally derived data on farming activity agronomic coefficients and atmospheric deposition one of the elements of strength of the present work is the reliability of the soil n budget that is built on a detailed dataset of statistical data and on an accurate set of species specific coefficients taken from the literature in the field nitrogen budget was first calculated at the municipal scale i e the administrative level at which official agricultural statistics are available then weighted for the percentage of each municipality surface included within the study area and finally summed up census data were integrated in a nutrient budgeting approach proposed by oenema et al 2003 recently reviewed by zhang et al 2020 and formerly applied to the whole mincio river basin pinardi et al 2018 four inputs of n to the uaa were considered land application of livestock manure land application of synthetic fertilizers atmospheric deposition and biological fixation by crops together with four outputs of n from uaa crop harvest crop stock ammonia volatilization and denitrification in soils the difference between n inputs and outputs results in a net which represents a condition of equilibrium surplus or deficit of n across the uaa the soil system budget ssb was calculated as follow ssb n nman nfert nfix ndep nharv nstock nvol nden where nman n in livestock manure applied to agricultural soils nfert n in synthetic fertilizer applied to agricultural soils nfix agricultural n2 fixation associated with n fixing crops ndep atmospheric n deposition on agricultural land nharv n exported from agricultural soils with crop harvest nstock organic n in crop s standing stock nvol nh3 volatilization in agricultural soils nden denitrification in agricultural soils all budget terms were expressed in unit of mass per time t n y 1 and on a per area basis after normalization for the uaa kg n ha 1 y 1 the soil n budget was estimated by employing agricultural census data referring to the agricultural year 2015 2016 the agricultural year overlaps the vegetative cropping cycle covering two consecutive years i e from november of the first year to october of the following one the n budget calculated for the agricultural year 2015 2016 is relevant in the present day because in the last decade only minor variations occurred in crop surfaces and livestock densities of the study area and fertilization rates did not change appreciably the calculation was based on agriculture and farming data reported by the agricultural information system of lombardy region siarl www siarl regione lombardia it and by the annals of agrarian statistics published yearly by the national institute of statistics istat http agri istat it siarl databases retrieved from the open data portal of the lombardy region https dati lombardia it provided data for livestock density and agricultural areas at the municipality level whereas the database of the annals of agrarian statistics provided data for crop yield and fertilizer application http dati istat it at the provincial level inputs and outputs were initially calculated for each municipality and then aggregated at the study area level uncertainty in n budget calculations was assessed by a monte carlo analysis using excel and r software r core team 2019 all coefficients used to convert census data into n amounts were assumed to vary stochastically and independently around the average value with a normal probability distribution for each simulation a set of coefficients was randomly generated from probability distribution functions and a total of 1000 simulations were run budget calculation was conducted both at the annual and at the seasonal scales and compared with seasonal in stream n loads details about annual budget data equations seasonal breakdown and sources of census data and agronomic coefficients are presented in supplementary material a the n loads produced by the urban areas were not included in the calculation because more than 95 of the sewers in the study area are connected to wastewater treatment plants wwtp nearly 75 of the n inputs to wwtp is removed via denitrification in tertiary treatment lombardy region 2017 indeed the calculation of the urban load produced by the resident population obtained by the conversion of equivalent inhabitant in kg of n per day resulted in less than 2 of the total n input by diffuse sources pinardi et al 2018 the daily precipitation data were downloaded from the arpa lombardy website https www arpalombardia it pages meteorologia richiesta dati misurati aspx at ponti sul mincio station fig 1 for the period from 2010 to 2017 the mean annual seasonal irrigation and non irrigation period and monthly precipitation data were

aggregated at the study area level 3 2 water sampling and analyses two stations located at the extremes of the identified river reach s1 and s2 fig 1 were sampled for water analyses the two stations were selected as they were located upstream and downstream the area where the mincio river can be considered as a gaining river in groundwater surface water interaction that is the river is fed by groundwater racchetti et al 2019 given the constant discharge between s1 and s2 the identified river reach was more recently characterized as a flow through reach severini et al 2022 with groundwater feeding the river in the western bank and being fed by the river in the eastern bank field campaigns were carried out seasonally with a series of daily cycles of repeated samplings carried out on 12 13 august and 15 16 november 2016 14 15 february 12 13 april and 13 14 june 2017 water samples were taken in three replicates every 4 h for a 24 hour period an aliquot was transferred into a 12 ml exetainer labco uk added with 100 μl of hgcl2 and analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon dic with gran titration 0 1 n hcl within 24 h from sampling dic was measured as it may trace differences between surface and groundwater chemistry water aliquots were filtered gf f glass fiber filters and transferred to plastic vials for nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n determination by spectrophotometric methods rodier 1978 apha awwa wpcf 1999 there are two main reasons for focusing on inorganic nitrogen the first is that from our database and from those of national monitoring agencies in the mincio river nearly 80 of the total n load is made of inorganic n din and within the din pool 90 is nitrate the second is that from the same dataset nitrate represents more than 95 of the total dissolved n in groundwater hourly or daily water flow data were obtained by the interregional agency for the po river aipo and by the mincio consortium for pozzolo and goito sites the mann whitney rank sum test was used to test the difference between upstream and downstream values of water flow no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dic concentrations the r software package r core team 2019 was used to perform all statistical tests 3 3 dissolved inorganic nitrogen and carbon daily loads for each sampling date daily no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dic riverine loads transported at s1 and s2 kg d 1 were calculated multiplying concentrations by river discharge the difference between loads at s2 and s1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 δno3 n or no2 n nh4 n dic ct x δt x q s2 ct x δt

equilibrium between inputs and outputs negative suggesting net retention or dissipation e g uptake or denitrification or positive suggesting the occurrence of production or additional inputs along the stretch e g nitrification or point and diffuse inputs a standard deviation was associated to no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dic measurements made in replicates the errors conveyed through the mathematical description were calculated with classical error propagation equations 4 results 4 1 nitrogen budgets and water inputs in the four municipalities under study the total n inputs to arable land 6010 498 t y 1 were mainly due to livestock manure 59 nitrogen outputs 5078 494 t y 1 accounted for 84 of the n inputs and were mainly due to crop harvest 50 of the total n outputs the main cultivated crop is maize 63 of arable land followed by permanent grassland the difference between n inputs and outputs denoted a n soil surplus 932 702 t y 1 the mean areal n surplus was 67 50 kg ha 1 y 1 with values calculated for the different municipalities ranging between 172 and 204 kg ha 1 y 1 all these results are reported in supplementary material b table b 1 and figure b 1 the seasonal ssb is reported in fig 2 manure n fertilization was higher in spring 1590 268 t and summer 883 149 t and similar in autumn and winter 530 89 t synthetic n fertilization was higher in spring 769 190 t and winter 257 63 t biological n fixation was higher in summer 559 259 t and spring 350 162 t whereas atmospheric n depositions were concentrated mainly in summer and autumn 32 4 and 38 4 t respectively in spring n associated to the crop s standing stock 487 98 t was higher than n in the crop harvest 398 80 t with respect to n outputs crop harvest was highest in summer 1492 301 t and autumn 637 128 t ammonia volatilization and soil denitrification were quantitatively important in spring 324 233 t and 210 102 t respectively coupling the seasonal input and output data a transition from n deficit to n surplus is evident moving from summer 971 472 t to spring 1317 464 t during the 2010 2017 period the mean annual precipitation in the study area was 910 197 mm y 1 of which about 43 6 occurred during the irrigation period fig 3 during the may september period a water volume of 53 3 106 m3 was used to irrigate 13 513 ha of uaa which represent 75 of the total arable land flooding and sprinkler were the main irrigation typologies 72 and 27 of the irrigated surface respectively data from the national institute of statistics 4 2 water physico chemical features of sampling sites nitrate and dic concentrations were significantly higher at the downstream site for all sampling dates mann whitney rank sum test p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter fig 4 on the contrary the concentrations of the other dissolved inorganic forms of nitrogen no2 n and nh4 n were significantly higher at the upstream site p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter fig 4 the highest no3 n and dic concentrations were measured in june 2017 at both sampling sites 1 6 and 3 0 mg no3 n l 1 and 33 and 41 mg dic l 1 at s1 and s2 respectively the highest values of no2 n were recorded in summer at s1 and s2 up to 101 and 31 µg l 1 respectively whereas nh4 n concentrations peaked in august 2016 at s1 up to 122 µg l 1 and were high at both sites in february 2017 nitrate was always the main form of inorganic nitrogen accounting on average for 88 and 98 of the total n at s1 and s2 respectively the mean annual water flow was 10 3 2 5 m3 s 1 in the s1 s2 river reach whole dataset 2016 2017 n 140 during the irrigation period the water flow was not significantly different upstream and downstream 11 7 2 0 m3 s 1 at s1 and 13 0 3 9 m3 s 1 at s2 p 0 05 no significant differences were also found between water flow during the irrigation and not irrigation periods p 0 05 n 34 the water discharge measured during the experimental activities fell within the annual range of flow variation 4 3 dissolved inorganic nitrogen and carbon daily loads in all seasons no3 n and dic transported loads were higher at s2 whereas no2 n and nh4 n loads were higher at s1 but by much lower extent fig 5 a positive correlation was found between no3 n and dic concentrations pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 899 p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter supporting the possibility of the same origin for the two solutes a similar seasonal trend was detected for dic and no3 n accumulation along the analyzed river reach fig 5 the maximum increase of transported loads nearly 11 000 and 1500 kg d 1 for dic and no3 n respectively was measured in august 2016 whereas the minimum increase nearly 2000 and 200 kg d 1 for dic and no3 n respectively was measured in april 2017 fig 5 the highest no2 n and nh4 n loads reduction along the stretch were recorded during summer months fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 the seasonality of soil n budgets previous studies carried out in the po river basin and in other geographical areas characterized by intensive agriculture and animal farming suggest a generalized n surplus and inefficient n use leading to large n losses to surface and groundwater soana et al 2011 hou et al 2015 özbek and leip 2015 viaroli et al 2018 häußermann et al 2020 in the po river plain to our knowledge only a few sub basins e g ticino and po di volano represent exceptions to this rule due to very limited animal farming and synthetic fertilizers inputs balanced with crop needs racchetti et al 2019 soana et al 2021 all those studies were carried out on an annual temporal scale that potentially masked marked seasonal differences our calculations suggest a clear seasonal variation in n soil budgets changing along seasons with periods with deficit summer equilibrium autumn moderate winter or large spring excess these differences arise from variable seasonal balance among agricultural practices such as large spring manure and synthetic fertilizer spreading uncoupled to crop uptake moderate spread of fertilizers during winter with little to no uptake or large summer crop uptake in excess to n inputs chen et al 2019 the n assimilation term is calculated as the product of the standing stock by the biomass specific uptake rates and peaks in summer indeed the biomass specific uptake tends to decrease along with the crop s growth but the crop s standing stock is much smaller in spring than in summer large spring n inputs are therefore coupled to relatively low uptake resulting in a maximum surplus exceeding that calculated for winter when uptake is minimum large summer uptake on the contrary exceeds inputs and results in a seasonal deficit of n in the soil system budget high fertilization is probably driven by the n need of the main cultivated crop i e maize which is a water and n demanding species fao 2006 these results on intra annual variations in n mass budgets support the relevance of seasonal studies in highlighting critical moments in terms of potential water pollution lin et al 2019 compton et al 2020 as nitrate water pollution is correlated with n excess in soils our outcomes indicate a maximum nitrate pollution risk in the spring a minimum risk in the summer and something intermediate in winter and autumn results from seasonal river n transport suggest something different as the highest n accumulation along the stretch was measured in summer and the lowest in spring taken together these apparently contrasting results indicate that more factors are involved in the horizontal transfer of soil n excess to surface water and that such factors determine a temporal lag in the perspective of efficient n use at the soil level our results stress that the spring is a critical season that requires a thorough re thinking of practices by better balancing crops needs with fertilizers inputs during spring organic and synthetic n inputs need to be better balanced with n uptake as the crops have high potential growth but low biomass which results in an insufficient uptake of the large n inputs robertson and vitousek 2009 5 2 the seasonality of inorganic n loads in the mincio river results from this work add to a few seasonal studies coupling land mass budgets of n and net river n export retention e g chen et al 2019 lin et al 2019 compton et al 2020 for the portion of the mincio river considered in this study fig 6 reports the monthly water inputs either from precipitation or irrigation the seasonal soil system n budget and the nitrate accumulation between s1 and s2 which is the difference of the nitrate loads transported past the two river sections in the regulated river reach under study which is characterized by gravel bottom and colonized by submerged macrophytes ammonium and nitrite loads were higher upstream and suggested net retention in all seasons peaking in summer when the primary producers activity is maximum differently dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrate loads evidenced a significant increase from upstream to downstream in all the investigated seasons nitrate and inorganic carbon net export decreased from august to april with august as the central month for irrigation and april the last month before the start of the irrigation period from these results we calculated the annual net export of inorganic carbon and nitrate multiplying the daily values by the number of days between consecutive samplings and then integrating the results over one year despite 6 8 repeated water samplings during the 24 h these calculations are based on measurements carried out in single days along different seasons however the nitrate concentrations measured in this study are consistent with the seasonal no3 n concentrations measured by arpa lombardy the authority that manages water monitoring for the wfd in the period 2009 2017 and by the laboratory of aquatic ecology of the university of parma in the period 2011 2017 fig c 1 in supplementary material c it was estimated that 2153 174 t dic y 1 and 317 12 t no3 n y 1 were net exported from the 8 km long reach between s1 and s2 these amounts can be explained by element transformation e g respiration or nitrification and lateral or vertical inputs as the loads of the other two inorganic n forms were negligible as compared to nitrate this calculation was done only for the latter using dissolved oxygen budgets not reported in this work we converted dark river respiration rates night oxygen uptake along this stretch from 1 3 to 5 7 mm o2 m 2 h 1 in winter and summer respectively into potential nitrification rates 75 t n y 1 according to nitrification stoichiometry to this purpose we assumed that 100 of the oxygen consumed was used to oxidize ammonium to nitrate results suggest that microbes mediated processes as nitrification can explain at most 23 of the nitrate accumulation in the river reach in all seasons such percentage is a large overestimation of the real value as it was obtained neglecting all other oxygen consuming processes including macrophytes fish macroinvertebrates and the whole heterotrophic microbial community respiration a comparable nitrate production 80 t n y 1 was obtained using the nitrification rate set by taherisoudejani et al 2018 in the qual2kw model applied to the oglio river a nearby po river tributary with similar hydrological characteristics pinardi et al 2014 found that the processes in the hyporheic zone or the microbial metabolism of carbonate dissolution could explain up to 15 of the dic increase including the role of macrophytes in modulating dissolved co2 saturation values and fixation of c if biological processes cannot explain inorganic carbon and nitrate increase also point pollution sources can be excluded due to low discharge of small tributaries along this stretch with water chemistry comparable to that of the mincio river another potential source of n and dic is groundwater via seasonally variable river groundwater interactions indeed the level of the phreatic surface increases and interacts with the river due to precipitation flooding and sprinkler irrigation during the spring summer period racchetti et al 2019 severini et al 2020 fig 7 in a period before and after fertilization from march to may 2021 severini et al 2022 measured in the same area of the mincio river significantly higher hco3 concentrations in groundwater than in surface water appelo and postma 2005 hence the dic increase in the investigated river stretch can be associated to the groundwater feeding the mincio river considering the abundant use of organic fertilizers in the area the higher dic in groundwater can be related to the presence of calcite caco3 in the mineralogical composition of the aquifer and to the oxidation of the organic matter which promotes a higher dic concentration in groundwater future investigations should include the mineralogical composition of the aquifer 5 3 linking soil n budgets and n riverine export the key role of the aquifer the main period of n fertilization is in spring when there is the highest n soil surplus and surface and groundwater pollution risk due to limited crop uptake the crop harvest occurs mainly in summer and autumn when the n soil budget is in deficit or close to equilibrium respectively these data are reflected by an increasing n export by the river reach from spring to summer favored by large volumes of nitrate enriched water displaced through the irrigation across the aquifer river continuum isidoro et al 2006 using sio2 as tracer severini et al 2022 typified the investigated river stretch as a flow through system where groundwater feeds the mincio river in its west bank and it is fed from the river s east bank fig 7 as a result n rich groundwater can displace n poor water from the mincio river without a significant modification of the river flow fig 7 our data are consistent with this hydrogeological conceptual model since the higher no3 n delta loads were found in summer when the groundwater level are the highest and there is the maximum groundwater seeping to the mincio river highlighting the deep effects of the recharge given by irrigation on the contrary some differences were found during the rest of the year characterized by a less anthropic recharge of the aquifer these differences are more related to the dissimilar distribution of precipitation and percolation of water and n to groundwater which fosters the migration of n to the mincio river in fact as we move away from the end of the irrigation period september the lower groundwater heads reported in severini et al 2022 could result in a lower groundwater seepage to the river fig 7 having less nutrient enriched water available guarantees a minor nitrate surplus in the river reach even if n fertilization starts again in winter resulting in another period with n soil surplus figs 6 7 considering that the mean annual n surplus on the agricultural land in the study area averaged 67 kg ha 1 y 1 it is possible to speculate that the agricultural land surface that can potentially generate the no3 n river export 317 12 t no3 n y 1 is equivalent to 4700 ha 1 in addition dividing this surface by the length of the river reach investigated it is possible to estimate the width from the river which is about 2 9 km for each side that might be involved in the n surplus production these data allow to speculate that the n surplus was generated in the 25 of the surface of municipalities under study giving useful information to better address arable land management our results on n input and output trends in agricultural soils and into the river reach at annual and seasonal basis allow to better understand n patterns from land to river and the potential nitrate pollution to surface and groundwater this information at seasonal resolution can help policy makers in developing effective plans to improve n management at the macroscale in fact this combination of information can guide the identification of proper spatial temporal management strategies to reduce n pollution and river export to avoid eutrophication processes of water bodies for example our results suggest that more nitrate was delivered downstream in summer because of spring soil n excess coupled to flood irrigation over permeable soils hence it is important to focus on agricultural sources manure and synthetic fertilizers in particular to better balance n inputs and output by crop harvest or stock our approach was applied in a pilot study at the sub basin level but it is exportable to the whole basin and to other rivers it becomes very important to have local information and basin specific data to perform seasonal analysis on n patterns lassaletta et al 2021 5 4 possible remediation strategies in the context of climate change and the regulation of river discharge temporal disconnections between n fertilization transport and uptake in agricultural land can result in low n use efficiency robertson and vitousek 2009 specific monitoring of crop growth nutrient demand and soil availability is useful to obtain a more synchronous nutrient supply in response to crop needs quemada et al 2013 alternative practices arranged to implement nutrient management directly in the field include actions such as variable rate or split of fertilizer applications matched to crop growth demand improvements in efficiency of irrigation practices and use of nitrification inhibitors lacey and armstrong 2015 fernández et al 2016 the nutrient best management practices for n should be designed in view of seasonal n leaching losses and hydrologic export to properly depict crop growth dynamics and n demand soil conditions and hydrology lin et al 2019 it is during summer that the investigated reach experienced the highest water nitrate accumulation an action useful to buffer the n export is the implementation of riparian buffer strips that can promote n retention during the spring summer irrigation period or the use of cover crops in winter dabney et al 2010 cole et al 2020 during winter our calculations suggest n soil excess in a period where uptake is minimum and denitrification is likely limited by low temperatures and by the thick unsaturated soil the latter follows the downward winter migration of the water table previously discussed for this reason the adoption of practices that can favor water retention to increase soil humidity in the cold season and the presence of water in canals commonly dry in autumn and winter might be a solution that can favor denitrification process as an example the construction of artificial ponds or wetlands can be useful to intercept n runoff from agricultural lands nõges et al 2003 carstensen et al 2020 in the geographical area of our case study the alps host a series of large lakes regulated by dams that feed rivers among which the mincio river the dams regulate the lake water level and the river discharge with rules that aims to accumulate water in winter and release it during the irrigation period adapting also to local meteorology and water inputs to lakes this regulation practice guarantees sufficient summer level in lakes for tourism and navigation purposes and large water availability for irrigation and electricity production in the downstream river section irrigation is supported by several water abstraction infrastructures that facilitated agriculture and animal farming activities irrigation practices supported mainly by flooding irrigation in the sector of the po river plain including our study area are carried out over permeable soils and favor the recharge of the aquifer mainly in summer rotiroti et al 2019 therefore water retention upstream during non irrigation periods and flood irrigation with large water volumes during summer are probably the main drivers of the groundwater head variation which is subject to strong seasonal differences taherisoudejani et al 2018 under the current climate change scenario also in this geographical area the rapid changes of global warming are manifested with lower precipitation dry winters heatwaves and storms events and an increasing number of consecutive days with high temperatures cifrodelli et al 2015 pedro monzonís et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2021 ranasinghe et al 2021 the response to these global trends could increase or decrease river nitrate concentration depending on regional or site specific linkage between n concentration and discharge stelzer et al 2020 for this reason the geographical sector under study seems extremely vulnerable to climate change as the system is depicted and managed for large water availability i e large lakes regulation high water demanding crops and flooding as main irrigation practice and therefore a discussion on water management at political level is urgent predicting scenarios on the fate of the n excess with different water availability is difficult we can hypothesize a reduction of water discharge from rivers and consequently from irrigation that will not recharge sufficiently the groundwater due to its deep level taherisoudejani et al 2018 this condition will lead to more thick vadose zones fostering a higher nitrification rate and nitrate accumulation in soil during winter whereas denitrification the main process that removes n permanently from the system is favored in water saturated soils with high organic matter ascott et al 2017 in soil and rivers close to n saturation it is expected a lower nitrate retention efficiency and therefore an increase in n availability and vertical and horizontal transfer stelzer et al 2020 moreover for the future it can be expected a delay in the river feeding by groundwater with hot moments of n mass transfer in fact we can expect that with the increment of unsaturated zone the rate of soil denitrification will be reduced and conversely the nitrification process will be favored supplying a short n mass transfer as soon as the first rainfall or flooding irrigation will occur carrying water with high n concentration to surface or groundwater a possible solution to limit this hot moment can be the improvement of irrigation practices with less water consumption and a more widespread use of precision farming supported for example with remote sensing technique nutini et al 2021 such a new vision on the irrigation practices can allow a lower winter water retention in the lake garda that can be partially used in the non irrigation period to guarantee a minimal vital flow in a certain number of drainage canals as well as in the mincio river favoring denitrification process also in autumn and winter although with lower rates driven by lower temperatures 6 conclusions published soil system budgets in agricultural areas generally reveal net n excess on an annual basis whereas the present study reveals seasonally variable inventories of inputs and outputs resulting in periods of large n excess and periods of pronounced deficit the export of n excess via the river draining the investigated area has a temporal lag that depends on irrigation vertical migration of the water table and subsurface water flow flood irrigation first fills the unsaturated zone and then favors river groundwater interactions subsurface water flow replaces n poor river water with n rich groundwater seasonal soil n budget and the mechanisms of n transfer described in this study should foster more efficient agricultural practices minimizing n losses and improving n use results from this work should also be carefully considered in future planning of agricultural and irrigation activities in a scenario of climate change and variable availability of water winter retention of water in lakes upstream the agricultural areas has serious drawbacks as it will increase the volume of the unsaturated soil and the production of nitrate via organic n ammonification and nitrification adaptive strategies based on precision farming new material to retain soil humidity irrigation techniques alternative to flooding and a management of the canal network targeting the restoration of

9305,soil system budgets ssb of nutrients are generally performed annually over arable land to infer their use efficiency and water pollution risk in highly exploited agricultural watersheds they are seldom partitioned into seasonal budgets and matched with seasonal nutrient transport in adjacent river reaches we calculated seasonal soil nitrogen n budgets in a mincio river sub basin italy and we analyzed the dissolved inorganic n net export in the river reach draining such sub basin our results show seasonal differences of ssb with n excess in winter and even more in spring equilibrium among sources and sinks during autumn and n deficit during summer seasonal inorganic n loads transported by the river were not correlated with ssb as they peaked in late summer and were at their minimum in early spring fertilization uncoupled to significant uptake supports n excess in winter and spring whereas crop uptake uncoupled to n inputs supports summer n deficit nitrification cannot explain nitrate accumulation in the river reach suggesting alternative dynamics driving the local hydrology flood irrigation results in large soil nitrate solubilization transport and in upward migration of the groundwater piezometric head during spring and summer periods river water is likely replaced by nitrate rich groundwater when the groundwater recharge exceeds a certain threshold coinciding with late summer irrigation is then interrupted and the piezometric head together with nitrate exchange decreases this work suggests that a deep understanding of n dynamics in agricultural watersheds with flooding irrigation on permeable soils needs the reconstruction of the vertical pathways of nitrate and of river groundwater interactions moreover the partitioning of annual into seasonal n budgets and their combination with irrigation practices allows the identification of hot moments in n cycling agricultural practices minimizing nitrate excess its mobility and the risk of surface and groundwater pollution are suggested for this area keywords nitrogen retention transport loads irrigation river groundwater interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dramatic increase of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen n inputs in watersheds with intensive agriculture and animal farming has demonstrated negative effects for inland water and groundwater chemical and biological quality drinking water supplies ecosystem integrity and functioning and human health van grinsven et al 2006 galloway et al 2008 rivett et al 2008 schlesinger 2009 sobota et al 2015 huang et al 2017 such negative effects are amplified by the human derived alteration of the hydrological cycle at the watershed scale and by climate change galloway et al 2008 overeem et al 2013 woolway and merchant 2019 woolway et al 2020 among the underlying mechanisms are water abstraction for irrigation or industrial purposes or climate change related drought reducing river discharge and its capacity to dilute and process n loads palmer et al 2008 low discharge promotes also hyporheic anoxia and ammonium recycling from sediments hlaváčová et al 2005 hydrological extremes include also short term heavy precipitations resulting in high discharge events transferring large n loads from cultivated areas saturating riverine denitrification capacity viaroli et al 2018 magri et al 2020 nitrogen budgets calculated for agricultural soils within a river basin allow to evaluate the potential risk of diffuse n pollution oenema et al 2003 soana et al 2011 in agricultural soils n inputs associated with organic or synthetic fertilizers atmospheric deposition or biological fixation can be either temporarily retained in crops or released to the atmosphere as gaseous losses nitrogen inputs in excess to temporary retention or permanent loss can be transferred via runoff to adjacent aquatic ecosystems howarth et al 1996 seitzinger et al 2006 pinardi et al 2018 2020 kwon et al 2022 if soil system budgets in arable land produce reliable snapshots of n pools and fluxes in cultivated areas the detailed reconstruction and partitioning of n pools and fluxes within watersheds is a challenging objective for example seasonally variable water inputs to agricultural soils via precipitation and irrigation affect soil n leaching horizontal and vertical transport and transformation n use efficiency as well as river groundwater interactions and associated n exchange schaefer and alber 2007 chae et al 2009 howarth et al 2012 sinha and michalak 2016 moreover in intensively cultivated floodplains the hydrological cycle has been regulated by the realization of infrastructures as dams and networks of canals that help buffering climatic anomalies and ensure water availability for crops in italy for example the alpine sector of the po river basin hosts large dams that regulate the release of water from deep subalpine lakes maggiore como iseo idro and garda lakes to their emissaries ticino adda oglio chiese and mincio rivers winter water retention in subalpine lakes occurs at the cost and drawbacks of reduced water discharge and contributes to the downward vertical migration of groundwater often resulting in downwelling river groundwater interactions i e the river feeds the groundwater rotiroti et al 2019 severini et al 2021 on the contrary summer irrigation besides representing a vehicle for n transport produces opposite effects often reversing the direction of river groundwater interactions i e upwelling the groundwater feeds the river these practices that characterize anthropogenic intensively cultivated and hydraulically regulated watersheds with permeable soil introduce marked seasonality in n budgets lin et al 2019 racchetti et al 2019 many authors reported a significant correlation between annual n input to croplands and river n export neff et al 2003 yan et al 2010 xu et al 2013 strokal et al 2014 tong et al 2017 but they did rarely account for the seasonality of n input and export mccrackin et al 2014 chen et al 2019 studies targeting n budgets in agricultural watersheds are generally conceived at the annual scale for mainly practical reasons as agricultural census data are collected and published by national statistical institutions with annual frequency such an approach from one side allows to calculate n use efficiency in cropland and potential n loss but from the other side it misses temporal resolution and precludes the understanding of seasonal variations of the array of n related processes potentially regulated also by climate change for example human activities e g crop production and altered hydrology may influence the seasonality of n river export basu et al 2010 compton et al 2020 together with the seasonal evolution of temperature that influences n losses retention and removal processes e g denitrification mccrackin et al 2014 understanding how seasonal variations in human activities and hydrology influence n budgets in agricultural soils and n transport by rivers is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying n transformations along the terrestrial aquatic path improve agricultural practices to increase n use efficiency and decrease n pollution and eventually forecast how climate change will affect n dynamics mas pla and menció 2019 this important set of objectives is a difficult target at the scale of whole watersheds due to scarce resolution of available data and spatial heterogeneity e g pedology land use etc smaller scales of analysis targeting specific and homogeneous river and watershed sectors seem much more promising mccrackin et al 2014 chen et al 2019 compton et al 2020 different studies carried out at large temporal and spatial scales soana et al 2011 pinardi et al 2018 viaroli et al 2018 lassaletta et al 2021 have highlighted the presence of hot spots within watersheds that represent outliers in n budgets e g with very large n excess or very low n use efficiency they also emphasized the presence of hot moments within watersheds that are specific periods during which n mass transfer peaks as a combination of decreased uptake increased runoff or variation of the water table level resulting in the reactivation of river groundwater interaction rosenzweig et al 2008 preisendanz et al 2020 taherisoudejani et al 2018 the analysis of n hot spots and hot moments in watersheds require specific studies focusing on small spatial and temporal scales in northern italy the po river valley is an alluvial plain heavily exploited by human activities such as agriculture animal farming industry and tourism land use change and hydrological alterations determined high pressure on both surface and groundwater may 2013 pérez martín et al 2014 lasagna and de luca 2019 and a wide portion of the plain is classified as vulnerable to nitrate pollution martinelli et al 2018 the main aim of this study is to analyze the seasonal evolution of dissolved inorganic n loads in a fluvial segment of the mincio river a tributary of the po river characterized by natural banks gravel bottom with submerged vegetation and regulated discharge this segment crosses a transitional area between permeable and non permeable soils characterized by springs and classified as an area of river groundwater interactions balestrini et al 2021 due to its hydrogeological features and the large water availability the considered sub basin is a hotspot of intensive agriculture and animal farming and represents a key study area to analyze if and how the seasonality of agricultural practices affects n dynamics in this sector of the po river groundwater in the phreatic and shallow aquifer has a short residence time as compared to semiconfined or confined deeper aquifers this is supported by fast few days surface groundwater dynamics of micro pollutants balderacchi et al 2016 and low concentrations of total dissolved solids martinelli et al 2018 results of balderacchi et al 2016 suggest also fast response of shallow aquifers to changing conditions as such they allow to trace agricultural practices e g use of herbicides or fertilization and they respond quickly to hydrologic variations e g drought precipitations irrigation it can be assumed that macrocontaminants as nitrates undergo the same fast transfer mechanisms also due to their elevated solubility and absence of interaction with soil and sediment the main hypotheses of this work are that river groundwater interactions affect n transport in specific river sectors and vary seasonally due to combination of irrigation practices and inorganic nitrogen excess in soil we also hypothesized that the seasonal dynamics of such variable interactions can be captured analyzing comparatively seasonal n budget in agricultural soils and seasonal riverine n transport in this context the main aim of the present study was to contrast seasonal n soil budget in an agricultural area drained by a river stretch with seasonal n loads transported by the same draining river stretch to assess riverine n dynamics in relation to agricultural practices 2 study area the mincio river 75 km originates from the lake garda the largest italian lake and is a tributary of the po river fig 1 the hydrological regime of the mincio river is regulated upstream by a dam which controls the water discharge from the lake garda along the river course a series of dams and weirs feeds a network of canals for irrigation and industrial purposes and controls discharge variations to avoid the flooding of cities and villages water management for lake garda recreational activities and for agricultural purposes results in marked flow variations indeed since the establishment of the river regulation in the 60 s of the last century the mincio river discharge averaged 80 and 30 m3 s 1 during the irrigation may to september and outside the irrigation periods respectively lombardy region 2017 more recently projections of decreasing water availability resulted in a further reduction of the mincio river discharge to 14 m3 s 1 www laghi net in autumn and winter to keep water in the lake garda and guarantee water availability for irrigation and tourism in the summer season during winter the flow reduction and absence of irrigation result in a decreased aquifer recharge a phenomenon described by different authors in this geographical area at regional rotiroti et al 2019 and local scales severini et al 2021 and consequently in a lowering of the phreatic surface this water transfer dynamic results in a decrease of groundwater upwelling in winter and early spring balderacchi et al 2016 a wide segment of the mincio river including the portion investigated in this study flows in a flood plain characterized by a multilayered aquifer system with a cyclic facies architecture mainly made of fluvial channel gravel and sand and floodplain clay deposits amorosi et al 2008 as a result the northern part of the plain high plain is locally characterized by shallow phreatic aquifers while in the southern part low plain the floodplain facies act as aquitards or aquicludes resulting in confined and semi confined aquifers chelli et al 2018 the river reach investigated from s1 to s2 length 8 1 km mean depth 1 m mean water velocity 1 0 m s 1 is in the high medium plain of the mincio watershed this river segment drains the surface of four municipalities 1 valeggio sul mincio 2 volta mantovana 3 goito and 4 marmirolo total area 184 km2 fig 1 since 2006 these municipalities are classified as nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs according to the european nitrate directive 91 676 cee the area of the four municipalities investigated in mainly classified as agricultural land with fertile soils due to calcareous gravel deposits with favor intensively exploitation by agriculture utilized agricultural area uaa covers 76 of the study area fig 1 and animal farming 1 2 and 0 6 t of

the other aquatic environments such as quarry lakes is 0 62 km2 3 material and methods 3 1 nitrogen budgets and water inputs a comprehensive input output n budget across the utilized agricultural area uaa was compiled by using locally derived data on farming activity agronomic coefficients and atmospheric deposition one of the elements of strength of the present work is the reliability of the soil n budget that is built on a detailed dataset of statistical data and on an accurate set of species specific coefficients taken from the literature in the field nitrogen budget was first calculated at the municipal scale i e the administrative level at which official agricultural statistics are available then weighted for the percentage of each municipality surface included within the study area and finally summed up census data were integrated in a nutrient budgeting approach proposed by oenema et al 2003 recently reviewed by zhang et al 2020 and formerly applied to the whole mincio river basin pinardi et al 2018 four inputs of n to the uaa were considered land application of livestock manure land application of synthetic fertilizers atmospheric deposition and biological fixation by crops together with four outputs of n from uaa crop harvest crop stock ammonia volatilization and denitrification in soils the difference between n inputs and outputs results in a net which represents a condition of equilibrium surplus or deficit of n across the uaa the soil system budget ssb was calculated as follow ssb n nman nfert nfix ndep nharv nstock nvol nden where nman n in livestock manure applied to agricultural soils nfert n in synthetic fertilizer applied to agricultural soils nfix agricultural n2 fixation associated with n fixing crops ndep atmospheric n deposition on agricultural land nharv n exported from agricultural soils with crop harvest nstock organic n in crop s standing stock nvol nh3 volatilization in agricultural soils nden denitrification in agricultural soils all budget terms were expressed in unit of mass per time t n y 1 and on a per area basis after normalization for the uaa kg n ha 1 y 1 the soil n budget was estimated by employing agricultural census data referring to the agricultural year 2015 2016 the agricultural year overlaps the vegetative cropping cycle covering two consecutive years i e from november of the first year to october of the following one the n budget calculated for the agricultural year 2015 2016 is relevant in the present day because in the last decade only minor variations occurred in crop surfaces and livestock densities of the study area and fertilization rates did not change appreciably the calculation was based on agriculture and farming data reported by the agricultural information system of lombardy region siarl www siarl regione lombardia it and by the annals of agrarian statistics published yearly by the national institute of statistics istat http agri istat it siarl databases retrieved from the open data portal of the lombardy region https dati lombardia it provided data for livestock density and agricultural areas at the municipality level whereas the database of the annals of agrarian statistics provided data for crop yield and fertilizer application http dati istat it at the provincial level inputs and outputs were initially calculated for each municipality and then aggregated at the study area level uncertainty in n budget calculations was assessed by a monte carlo analysis using excel and r software r core team 2019 all coefficients used to convert census data into n amounts were assumed to vary stochastically and independently around the average value with a normal probability distribution for each simulation a set of coefficients was randomly generated from probability distribution functions and a total of 1000 simulations were run budget calculation was conducted both at the annual and at the seasonal scales and compared with seasonal in stream n loads details about annual budget data equations seasonal breakdown and sources of census data and agronomic coefficients are presented in supplementary material a the n loads produced by the urban areas were not included in the calculation because more than 95 of the sewers in the study area are connected to wastewater treatment plants wwtp nearly 75 of the n inputs to wwtp is removed via denitrification in tertiary treatment lombardy region 2017 indeed the calculation of the urban load produced by the resident population obtained by the conversion of equivalent inhabitant in kg of n per day resulted in less than 2 of the total n input by diffuse sources pinardi et al 2018 the daily precipitation data were downloaded from the arpa lombardy website https www arpalombardia it pages meteorologia richiesta dati misurati aspx at ponti sul mincio station fig 1 for the period from 2010 to 2017 the mean annual seasonal irrigation and non irrigation period and monthly precipitation data were

aggregated at the study area level 3 2 water sampling and analyses two stations located at the extremes of the identified river reach s1 and s2 fig 1 were sampled for water analyses the two stations were selected as they were located upstream and downstream the area where the mincio river can be considered as a gaining river in groundwater surface water interaction that is the river is fed by groundwater racchetti et al 2019 given the constant discharge between s1 and s2 the identified river reach was more recently characterized as a flow through reach severini et al 2022 with groundwater feeding the river in the western bank and being fed by the river in the eastern bank field campaigns were carried out seasonally with a series of daily cycles of repeated samplings carried out on 12 13 august and 15 16 november 2016 14 15 february 12 13 april and 13 14 june 2017 water samples were taken in three replicates every 4 h for a 24 hour period an aliquot was transferred into a 12 ml exetainer labco uk added with 100 μl of hgcl2 and analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon dic with gran titration 0 1 n hcl within 24 h from sampling dic was measured as it may trace differences between surface and groundwater chemistry water aliquots were filtered gf f glass fiber filters and transferred to plastic vials for nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n determination by spectrophotometric methods rodier 1978 apha awwa wpcf 1999 there are two main reasons for focusing on inorganic nitrogen the first is that from our database and from those of national monitoring agencies in the mincio river nearly 80 of the total n load is made of inorganic n din and within the din pool 90 is nitrate the second is that from the same dataset nitrate represents more than 95 of the total dissolved n in groundwater hourly or daily water flow data were obtained by the interregional agency for the po river aipo and by the mincio consortium for pozzolo and goito sites the mann whitney rank sum test was used to test the difference between upstream and downstream values of water flow no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dic concentrations the r software package r core team 2019 was used to perform all statistical tests 3 3 dissolved inorganic nitrogen and carbon daily loads for each sampling date daily no3 n no2 n nh4 n and dic riverine loads transported at s1 and s2 kg d 1 were calculated multiplying concentrations by river discharge the difference between loads at s2 and s1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 δno3 n or no2 n nh4 n dic ct x δt x q s2 ct x δt

description were calculated with classical error propagation equations 4 results 4 1 nitrogen budgets and water inputs in the four municipalities under study the total n inputs to arable land 6010 498 t y 1 were mainly due to livestock manure 59 nitrogen outputs 5078 494 t y 1 accounted for 84 of the n inputs and were mainly due to crop harvest 50 of the total n outputs the main cultivated crop is maize 63 of arable land followed by permanent grassland the difference between n inputs and outputs denoted a n soil surplus 932 702 t y 1 the mean areal n surplus was 67 50 kg ha 1 y 1 with values calculated for the different municipalities ranging between 172 and 204 kg ha 1 y 1 all these results are reported in supplementary material b table b 1 and figure b 1 the seasonal ssb is reported in fig 2 manure n fertilization was higher in spring 1590 268 t and summer 883 149 t and similar in autumn and winter 530 89 t synthetic n fertilization was higher in spring 769 190 t and winter 257 63 t biological n fixation was higher in summer 559 259 t and spring 350 162 t whereas atmospheric n depositions were concentrated mainly in summer and autumn 32 4 and 38 4 t respectively in spring n associated to the crop s standing stock 487 98 t was higher than n in the crop harvest 398 80 t with respect to n outputs crop harvest was highest in summer 1492 301 t and autumn 637 128 t ammonia volatilization and soil denitrification were quantitatively important in spring 324 233 t and 210 102 t respectively coupling the seasonal input and output data a transition from n deficit to n surplus is evident moving from summer 971 472 t to spring 1317 464 t during the 2010 2017 period the mean annual precipitation in the study area was 910 197 mm y 1 of which about 43 6 occurred during the irrigation period fig 3 during the may september period a water volume of 53 3 106 m3 was used to irrigate 13 513 ha of uaa which represent 75 of the total arable land flooding and sprinkler were the main irrigation typologies 72 and 27 of the irrigated surface respectively data from the national institute of statistics 4 2 water physico chemical features of sampling sites nitrate and dic concentrations were significantly higher at the downstream site for all sampling dates mann whitney rank sum test p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter fig 4 on the contrary the concentrations of the other dissolved inorganic forms of nitrogen no2 n and nh4 n were significantly higher at the upstream site p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter fig 4 the highest no3 n and dic concentrations were measured in june 2017 at both sampling sites 1 6 and 3 0 mg no3 n l 1 and 33 and 41 mg dic l 1 at s1 and s2 respectively the highest values of no2 n were recorded in summer at s1 and s2 up to 101 and 31 µg l 1 respectively whereas nh4 n concentrations peaked in august 2016 at s1 up to 122 µg l 1 and were high at both sites in february 2017 nitrate was always the main form of inorganic nitrogen accounting on average for 88 and 98 of the total n at s1 and s2 respectively the mean annual water flow was 10 3 2 5 m3 s 1 in the s1 s2 river reach whole dataset 2016 2017 n 140 during the irrigation period the

between no3 n and dic concentrations pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 899 p 0 001 n 68 for each parameter supporting the possibility of the same origin for the two solutes a similar seasonal trend was detected for dic and no3 n accumulation along the analyzed river reach fig 5 the maximum increase of transported loads nearly 11 000 and 1500 kg d 1 for dic and no3 n respectively was measured in august 2016 whereas the minimum increase nearly 2000 and 200 kg d 1 for dic and no3 n respectively was measured in april 2017 fig 5 the highest no2 n and nh4 n loads reduction along the stretch were recorded during summer months fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 the seasonality of soil n budgets previous studies carried out in the po river basin and in other geographical areas characterized by intensive agriculture and animal farming suggest a generalized n surplus and inefficient n use leading to large n losses to surface and groundwater soana et al 2011 hou et al 2015 özbek and leip 2015 viaroli et al 2018 häußermann et al 2020 in the po river plain to our knowledge only a few sub basins e g ticino and po di volano represent exceptions to this rule due to very limited animal farming and synthetic fertilizers inputs balanced with crop needs racchetti et al 2019 soana et al 2021 all those studies were carried out on an annual temporal scale that potentially masked marked seasonal differences our calculations suggest a clear seasonal variation in n soil budgets changing along seasons with periods with deficit summer equilibrium autumn moderate winter or large spring excess these differences arise from variable seasonal balance among agricultural practices such as large spring manure and synthetic fertilizer spreading uncoupled to crop uptake moderate spread of fertilizers during winter with little to no uptake or large summer crop uptake in excess to n inputs chen et al 2019 the n assimilation term is calculated as the product of the standing stock by the biomass specific uptake rates and peaks in summer indeed the biomass specific uptake tends to decrease along with the crop s growth but the crop s standing stock is much smaller in spring than in summer large spring n inputs are therefore coupled to relatively low uptake resulting in a maximum surplus exceeding that calculated for winter when uptake is minimum large summer uptake on the contrary exceeds inputs and results in a seasonal deficit of n in the soil system budget high fertilization is probably driven by the n need of the main cultivated crop i e maize which is a water and n demanding species fao 2006 these results on intra annual variations in n mass budgets support the relevance of seasonal studies in highlighting critical moments in terms of potential water pollution lin et al 2019 compton et al 2020 as nitrate water pollution is correlated with n excess in soils our outcomes indicate a maximum nitrate pollution risk in the spring a minimum risk in the summer and something intermediate in winter and autumn results from seasonal river n transport suggest something different as the highest n accumulation along the stretch was measured in summer and the lowest in spring taken together these apparently contrasting results indicate that more factors are involved in the horizontal transfer of soil n excess to surface water and that such factors determine a temporal lag in the perspective of efficient n use at the soil level our results stress that the spring is a critical season that requires a thorough re thinking of practices by better balancing crops needs with fertilizers inputs during spring organic and synthetic n inputs need to be better balanced with n uptake as the crops have high potential growth but low biomass which results in an insufficient uptake of the large n inputs robertson and vitousek 2009 5 2 the seasonality of inorganic n loads in the mincio river results from this work add to a few seasonal studies coupling land mass budgets of n and net river n export retention e g chen et al 2019 lin et al 2019 compton et al 2020 for the portion of the mincio river considered in this study fig 6 reports the monthly water inputs either from precipitation or irrigation the seasonal soil system n budget and the nitrate accumulation between s1 and s2 which is the difference of the nitrate loads transported past the two river sections in the regulated river reach under study which is characterized by gravel bottom and colonized by submerged macrophytes ammonium and nitrite loads were higher upstream and suggested net retention in all seasons peaking in summer when the primary producers activity is maximum differently dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrate loads evidenced a significant increase from upstream to downstream in all the investigated seasons nitrate and inorganic carbon net export decreased from august to april with august as the central month for irrigation and april the last month before the start of the irrigation period from these results we calculated the annual net export of inorganic carbon and nitrate multiplying the daily values by the number of days between consecutive samplings and then integrating the results over one year despite 6 8 repeated water samplings during the 24 h these calculations are based on measurements carried out in single days along different seasons however the nitrate concentrations measured in this study are consistent with the seasonal no3 n concentrations measured by arpa lombardy the authority that manages water monitoring for the wfd in the period 2009 2017 and by the laboratory of aquatic ecology of the university of parma in the period 2011 2017 fig c 1 in supplementary material c it was estimated that 2153 174 t dic y 1 and 317 12 t no3 n y 1 were net exported from the 8 km long reach between s1 and s2 these amounts can be explained by element transformation e g respiration or nitrification and lateral or vertical inputs as the loads of the other two inorganic n forms were negligible as compared to nitrate this calculation was done only for the latter using dissolved oxygen budgets not reported in this work we converted dark river respiration rates night oxygen uptake along this stretch from 1 3 to 5 7 mm o2 m 2 h 1 in winter and summer respectively into potential nitrification rates 75 t n y 1 according to nitrification stoichiometry to this purpose we assumed that 100 of the oxygen consumed was used to oxidize ammonium to nitrate results suggest that microbes mediated processes as nitrification can explain at most 23 of the nitrate accumulation in the river reach in all seasons such percentage is a large overestimation of the real value as it was obtained neglecting all other oxygen consuming processes including macrophytes fish macroinvertebrates and the whole heterotrophic microbial community respiration a comparable nitrate production 80 t n y 1 was obtained using the nitrification rate set by taherisoudejani et al 2018 in the qual2kw model applied to the oglio river a nearby po river tributary with similar hydrological characteristics pinardi et al 2014 found that the processes in the hyporheic zone or the microbial metabolism of carbonate dissolution could explain up to 15 of the dic increase including the role of macrophytes in modulating dissolved co2 saturation values and fixation of c if biological processes cannot explain inorganic carbon and nitrate increase also point pollution sources can be excluded due to low discharge of small tributaries along this stretch with water chemistry comparable to that of the mincio river another potential source of n and dic is groundwater via seasonally variable river groundwater interactions indeed the level of the phreatic surface increases and interacts with the river due to precipitation flooding and sprinkler irrigation during the spring summer period racchetti et al 2019 severini et al 2020 fig 7 in a period before and after fertilization from march to may 2021 severini et al 2022 measured in the same area of the mincio river significantly higher hco3 concentrations in groundwater than in surface water appelo and postma 2005 hence the dic increase in the investigated river stretch can be associated to the groundwater feeding the mincio river considering the abundant use of organic fertilizers in the area the higher dic in groundwater can be related to the presence of calcite caco3 in the mineralogical composition of the aquifer and to the oxidation of the organic matter which promotes a higher dic concentration in groundwater future investigations should include the mineralogical composition of the aquifer 5 3 linking soil n budgets and n riverine export the key role of the aquifer the main period of n fertilization is in spring when there is the highest n soil surplus and surface and groundwater pollution risk due to limited crop uptake the crop harvest occurs mainly in summer and autumn when the n soil budget is in deficit or close to equilibrium respectively these data are reflected by an increasing n export by the river reach from spring to summer favored by large volumes of nitrate enriched water displaced through the irrigation across the aquifer river continuum isidoro et al 2006 using sio2 as tracer severini et al 2022 typified the investigated river stretch as a flow through system where groundwater feeds the mincio river in its west bank and it is fed from the river s east bank fig 7 as a result n rich groundwater can displace n poor water from the mincio river without a significant modification of the river flow fig 7 our data are consistent with this hydrogeological conceptual model since the higher no3 n delta loads were found in summer when the groundwater level are the highest and there is the maximum groundwater seeping to the mincio river highlighting the deep effects of the recharge given by irrigation on the contrary some differences were found during the rest of the year characterized by a less anthropic recharge of the aquifer these differences are more related to the dissimilar distribution of precipitation and percolation of water and n to groundwater which fosters the migration of n to the mincio river in fact as we move away from the end of the irrigation period september the lower groundwater heads reported in severini et al 2022 could result in a lower groundwater seepage to the river fig 7 having less nutrient enriched water available guarantees a minor nitrate surplus in the river reach even if n fertilization starts again in winter resulting in another period with n soil surplus figs 6 7 considering that the mean annual n surplus on the agricultural land in the study area averaged 67 kg ha 1 y 1 it is possible to speculate that the agricultural land surface that can potentially generate the no3 n river export 317 12 t no3 n y 1 is equivalent to 4700 ha 1 in addition dividing this surface by the length of the river reach investigated it is possible to estimate the width from the river which is about 2 9 km for each side that might be involved in the n surplus production these data allow to speculate that the n surplus was generated in the 25 of the surface of municipalities under study giving useful information to better address arable land management our results on n input and output trends in agricultural soils and into the river reach at annual and seasonal basis allow to better understand n patterns from land to river and the potential nitrate pollution to surface and groundwater this information at seasonal resolution can help policy makers in developing effective plans to improve n management at the macroscale in fact this combination of information can guide the identification of proper spatial temporal management strategies to reduce n pollution and river export to avoid eutrophication processes of water bodies for example our results suggest that more nitrate was delivered downstream in summer because of spring soil n excess coupled to flood irrigation over permeable soils hence it is important to focus on agricultural sources manure and synthetic fertilizers in particular to better balance n inputs and output by crop harvest or stock our approach was applied in a pilot study at the sub basin level but it is exportable to the whole basin and to other rivers it becomes very important to have local information and basin specific data to perform seasonal analysis on n patterns lassaletta et al 2021 5 4 possible remediation strategies in the context of climate change and the regulation of river discharge temporal disconnections between n fertilization transport and uptake in agricultural land can result in low n use efficiency robertson and vitousek 2009 specific monitoring of crop growth nutrient demand and soil availability is useful to obtain a more synchronous nutrient supply in response to crop needs quemada et al 2013 alternative practices arranged to implement nutrient management directly in the field include actions such as variable rate or split of fertilizer applications matched to crop growth demand improvements in efficiency of irrigation practices and use of nitrification inhibitors lacey and armstrong 2015 fernández et al 2016 the nutrient best management practices for n should be designed in view of seasonal n leaching losses and hydrologic export to properly depict crop growth dynamics and n demand soil conditions and hydrology lin et al 2019 it is during summer that the investigated reach experienced the highest water nitrate accumulation an action useful to buffer the n export is the implementation of riparian buffer strips that can promote n retention during the spring summer irrigation period or the use of cover crops in winter dabney et al 2010 cole et al 2020 during winter our calculations suggest n soil excess in a period where uptake is minimum and denitrification is likely limited by low temperatures and by the thick unsaturated soil the latter follows the downward winter migration of the water table previously discussed for this reason the adoption of practices that can favor water retention to increase soil humidity in the cold season and the presence of water in canals commonly dry in autumn and winter might be a solution that can favor denitrification process as an example the construction of artificial ponds or wetlands can be useful to intercept n runoff from agricultural lands nõges et al 2003 carstensen et al 2020 in the geographical area of our case study the alps host a series of large lakes regulated by dams that feed rivers among which the mincio river the dams regulate the lake water level and the river discharge with rules that aims to accumulate water in winter and release it during the irrigation period adapting also to local meteorology and water inputs to lakes this regulation practice guarantees sufficient summer level in lakes for tourism and navigation purposes and large water availability for irrigation and electricity production in the downstream river section irrigation is supported by several water abstraction infrastructures that facilitated agriculture and animal farming activities irrigation practices supported mainly by flooding irrigation in the sector of the po river plain including our study area are carried out over permeable soils and favor the recharge of the aquifer mainly in summer rotiroti et al 2019 therefore water retention upstream during non irrigation periods and flood irrigation with large water volumes during summer are probably the main drivers of the groundwater head variation which is subject to strong seasonal differences taherisoudejani et al 2018 under the current climate change scenario also in this geographical area the rapid changes of global warming are manifested with lower precipitation dry winters heatwaves and storms events and an increasing number of consecutive days with high temperatures cifrodelli et al 2015 pedro monzonís et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2021 ranasinghe et al 2021 the response to these global trends could increase or decrease river nitrate concentration depending on regional or site specific linkage between n concentration and discharge stelzer et al 2020 for this reason the geographical sector under study seems extremely vulnerable to climate change as the system is depicted and managed for large water availability i e large lakes regulation high water demanding crops and flooding as main irrigation practice and therefore a discussion on water management at political level is urgent predicting scenarios on the fate of the n excess with different water availability is difficult we can hypothesize a reduction of water discharge from rivers and consequently from irrigation that will not recharge sufficiently the groundwater due to its deep level taherisoudejani et al 2018 this condition will lead to more thick vadose zones fostering a higher nitrification rate and nitrate accumulation in soil during winter whereas denitrification the main process that removes n permanently from the system is favored in water saturated soils with high organic matter ascott et al 2017 in soil and rivers close to n saturation it is expected a lower nitrate retention efficiency and therefore an increase in n availability and vertical and horizontal transfer stelzer et al 2020 moreover for the future it can be expected a delay in the river feeding by groundwater with hot moments of n mass transfer in fact we can expect that with the increment of unsaturated zone the rate of soil denitrification will be reduced and conversely the nitrification process will be favored supplying a short n mass transfer as soon as the first rainfall or flooding irrigation will occur carrying water with high n concentration to surface or groundwater a possible solution to limit this hot moment can be the improvement of irrigation practices with less water consumption and a more widespread use of precision farming supported for example with remote sensing technique nutini et al 2021 such a new vision on the irrigation practices can allow a lower winter water retention in the lake garda that can be partially used in the non irrigation period to guarantee a minimal vital flow in a certain number of drainage canals as well as in the mincio river favoring denitrification process also in autumn and winter although with lower rates driven by lower temperatures 6 conclusions published soil system budgets in agricultural areas generally reveal net n excess on an annual basis whereas the present study reveals seasonally variable inventories of inputs and outputs resulting in periods of large n excess and periods of pronounced deficit the export of n excess via the river draining the investigated area has a temporal lag that depends on irrigation vertical migration of the water table and subsurface water flow flood irrigation first fills the unsaturated zone and then favors river groundwater interactions subsurface water flow replaces n poor river water with n rich groundwater seasonal soil n budget and the mechanisms of n transfer described in this study should foster more efficient agricultural practices minimizing n losses and improving n use results from this work should also be carefully considered in future planning of agricultural and irrigation activities in a scenario of climate change and variable availability of water winter retention of water in lakes upstream the agricultural areas has serious drawbacks as it will increase the volume of the unsaturated soil and the production of nitrate via organic n ammonification and nitrification adaptive strategies based on precision farming new material to retain soil humidity irrigation techniques alternative to flooding and a management of the canal network targeting the restoration of

9306,plastic ﬁlm and gravel mulching in combination with fertilization are widely used to increase crop yields and water productivity wp in arid and semiarid areas but soil surface mulching may stimulate soil organic carbon soc mineralization therefore ﬁlm mulching with manure amendment was proposed to improve soil fertility however the combined effects of these practices on yield wp and the stocks of soc and total nitrogen tn need to be better understood this study investigated the long term effects of different practices on crop yields wp and soc and tn stocks in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm layers based on a 12 year spring maize zea mays l ﬁeld experiment on the loess plateau the treatments included no mulching npk ck gravel mulching npk gm film mulching npk fm and film mulching npk cow manure fcm in 2019 and 2020 compared with the control both fm and fcm significantly increased crop yields wp n uptake efficiency nupe and n fertilizer productivity nfp compared with ck the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc and tn stocks by 44 10 and 39 51 respectively on average and the minimum c input that could maintain the soil c balance on the loess plateau was 0 67 mg ha 1 yr 1 over the 12 experimental years compared with the initial value in 2009 the trends of soc and tn contents in the fm treatment were downward while those in the fcm treatment increased by 41 61 and 30 27 respectively but yearly input of manure led to soc equilibrium compared with ck the fcm treatment significantly decreased soc and tn sequestration potential by 33 38 and 19 59 respectively on average in topsoil 0 20 cm but it had less of an effect on soc and tn sequestration at 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil depths the reasons for soc reaching equilibrium in the fcm treatment were analyzed and periodic subsoiling was proposed to break the equilibrium state to further improve the sequestration amount of soc and tn at 0 60 cm soil depths in conclusion ﬁlm mulching with manure amendment was recommended as a long term strategy to improve soil productivity and soil fertility in semiarid farmland graphical abstract ga1 keywords carbon equilibrium long term field experiment sequestration potential soil fertility water productivity yield data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil is an important carbon c and nitrogen n sink in terrestrial ecosystems for the global c and n cycles which contains 1550 pg soil organic carbon soc and 300 pg of total nitrogen tn up to 1 m depth and these amounts are considerably greater than the c and n in all living terrestrial plants lal 2004a relatively small changes in soil c and n pools may have substantial effects on atmospheric concentrations and global warming belay tedla et al 2009 the trends of soc and tn are consistent in most cases because soil organic matter som is composed of a continuum of compounds rich in c and n manzoni and porporato 2009 so it works closely with soil fertility and nutrient cycling for crop productivity improvement in agricultural systems cai et al 2019 liu et al 2022 therefore increasing the som content has high potential for reducing co2 emissions increasing both soc and tn stocks and ensuring sustainable soil productivity li et al 2021 xu et al 2022 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semiarid agricultural region in china and crop yield in the region is limited by low air temperatures and drought during the early crop growth stage in the spring liu et al 2009 film mulching and gravel mulching with n fertilizer are effective tools to improve crop yields and water productivity wp in arid and semiarid regions bu et al 2013 li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however improved hydrothermal conditions also increase the risk of soc mineralization leading to soc depletion yin et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to take other complementary practices with mulching to maintain high yields and soil fertility to obtain higher yields farmers often plant higher densities of crops however a high planting density not only increases soil water consumption jiang et al 2014b but also aggravates soil degradation superposing the continuous use of chemical fertilizers and film mulching ju et al 2009 in particular it triggers a chain reaction such as soil compaction which leads to poor water storage and soil nutrient content thus damaging soil quality and failing to maintain high yields in the long term wang et al 2017b manure amendments can supply a large amount of available c sources and other nutrients such as n phosphorus p and potassium k which is helpful for improving crop yields and soil quality zhang et al 2021a liu et al 2021 the application of manure also enhances soil structure lowers soil bulk density and improves soil porosity and water storage capacity jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b which means that the same amount of land can support higher densities for higher yields combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers is a common practice of intensive agriculture to improve plant nutrition and thereby crop yields semenov et al 2021 yang et al 2015 wei et al 2016 which possesses the potential of stabilizing crop production by improving soil water nutrient conditions in arid and semiarid regions however long term application of organic inputs resulted in an increase in soil c and n retention from year to year and many studies have reported that an upper limit of som exists known as saturation six et al 2002 stewart et al 2008 wiesmeier et al 2014 therefore long term fertilization experiments are necessary for studying the interannual variability in soc and tn agricultural soils have a high potential for c sequestration because significant depletion of c stocks has been observed in most cultivated soils paustian et al 1997 lal 2004b smith 2004 organic inputs are a promising management option for increasing c sequestration in cultivated soils and previous studies have confirmed that organic inputs could significantly increase soc stocks yang et al 2015 shahid et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the upper limit of soc storage is related to the limited potential of soils to stabilize som against microbial mineralization baldock and skjemstad 2000 which is based on three mechanisms a recalcitrance level b spatial inaccessibility and c interaction with mineral surfaces vonlützow et al 2008 the latter is considered to be the most important in terms of the correlations between soc stocks and the content of the fine fraction 20 µm and is used to quantitatively estimate c and n saturation hassink 1997 this method has been used by several studies to estimate the degree of c saturation in cultivated soils and it has been proven to be reliable six et al 2002 zhao et al 2006 wiesmeier et al 2014 the c and n sequestration potential is the difference between the c and n saturations and the actual measured c and n contents of the fine fraction it is helpful to quantitatively estimate the amount of c and n that can continue to be sequestered by various soils however the soil c and n sequestration potential of the loess plateau is currently unknown in addition little information is available on the application rate of organic inputs required under mulching to achieve soc balance on the loess plateau in this study a long term field experiment since 2009 was conducted to test the following hypothesis film mulching with manure amendment is a sustainable management strategy to achieve long term yield benefits and promote soc and tn sequestration the objectives of the study were to 1 identify an agricultural management practice for semiarid areas based on the combined effects on yield wp n fertilizer use efficiency nfue and soil fertility and 2 investigate whether long term manure amendment leads to soc and tn equilibrium or saturation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were performed at the

naturally air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve to determine the soil particle distribution and the remaining soil was screened by 0 25 mm to determine soc and tn soil particle distribution was measured by a malvern laser granulator apa2000 model malvern co ltd uk bulk density bd was measured using a conventional core method soc was determined by the wet oxidation method nelson and sommers

by wiesmeier et al 2014 with lower ultrasonication energies briefly 10 g of dry soil 2 mm was suspended in 50 ml of deionized water to disrupt only weakly stabilized soil macroaggregates and prevent the disruption of mineral associated som the ultrasound energy was adjusted to 22 j ml 1 using a calibrated ultrasonic probe type bandelin berlin germany the sand sized fraction was isolated by wet sieving through a 53 µm mesh the remaining suspension was separated by wet sieving through a 20 µm mesh using pressure filtration to overcome capillary forces at a 20 µm level to obtain the stable soc

water storage sws mm was the total water in the proﬁle of the 0 200 cm depth calculated with the following formula wang et al 2017b 1 sws swc h bd 10 where swc is the soil water content h is the soil depth cm and bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 the total evapotranspiration et mm during the spring maize growing season was calculated according to the equation described by allen et al 1998 2 et p i sws2 sws1 c d r where p mm is the total precipitation during the maize growing season i is the amount of irrigation mm sws1 mm is the soil water storage at sowing sws2 mm is the soil water storage at harvest c mm is the upward flow into the root zone d mm is the downward drainage out of the root zone and r mm is the surface runoff in the experimental region et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration with transpiration being the larger component of et the groundwater table at the experimental site was located at a depth of approximately 60 m below the surface so upward flow into the roots was not considered in this area the experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions no rainstorms occurred during the experimental period and high ridges surrounded each plot to prevent the occurrence of runoff the local rainfall was generally low and did not cause underground drainage at depths exceeding 200 cm therefore a simplified equation was used to calculate et and further used to calculate wp fernández et al 2020 3 et p δsw 4 wp y et where δsw mm is the difference between sws2 and sws1 wp kg ha 1 mm 1 is water productivity and y kg ha 1 is the grain yield water stress ws is expressed using relative water content table s1 i e soil water content as a percentage of the maximum field water holding capacity the water stress degree wsd was classified into four

approximately 85 of maize root biomass is distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer jiang et al 2014a zhang et al 2020 2 4 3 calculation of c and n sequestration potential the potential c and n saturations of particles 20 µm were calculated using the equation of hassink 1997 and wiesmeier et al 2014 10 csat 4 09 0 37 particles 20 μ m 11 nsat 0 40 0 037 particles 20 μ m where csat is the potential c saturation g kg 1 nsat is the potential n saturation g kg 1 and particles 20 µm are the proportion of fine soil particles 20 µm the c or n saturation deficit of the fine fraction 20 µm was calculated by the equation of wiesmeier et al 2014 which is as follows 12 tdef tsat tcur where tdef is the c saturation deficit g kg 1 or the n saturation deficit g kg 1 tcur is the current c or n

ibm corporation armonk usa and all ﬁgures were prepared by originpro 2021 originlab usa one way analysis of variance anova was employed to determine means among different treatments by the least signiﬁcant difference test lsd at a 0 05 level p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage grain yield wp and nfue the sws ranged from 390 6 to 614 05 mm in the range of 0 200 cm throughout the two years and the order of sws at r6 was fm gm fcm ck in 2019 and fm fcm gm ck in 2020 fig 2 the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer of both the fcm and fm treatments at pt was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment in both years indicating that the fcm and fm treatments could increase topsoil moisture and promote seed germination the sws in all mulching treatments was significantly higher than that in ck at v6 and v10 suggesting that the mulching treatments were able to maintain sufficient moisture in the topsoil for crop seedling growth the sws of the 0 200 cm soil layer in the fcm treatment was lower than that in the control at r1 in 2020 while the sws in the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that in the control at r1 in 2019 regardless of the soil layer the difference in sws among the fm fcm and gm treatments was not significant in the 0 60 cm soil layer at r3 and r6 in 2020 while the sws of the fm and fcm treatments in the 0 200 cm soil layer was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment at r6 in 2019 in addition the sws of the four treatments tended to increase and then decrease from shallow to deep while the sws of 60 120 cm was lower than that of 0 60 cm and 120 200 cm the et in both the fm and fcm treatments was significantly lower than that in the control in 2019 but there was no significant difference in et among the treatments in 2020 and the fcm treatment had the lowest et in both years the above results indicated that mulching practices can effectively increase the sws of soil at r6 while the no mulching treatment intensified the loss of soil water at the seedling stage and reduced the sws of soil throughout the growth period compared with the control the maize yield of the fm and fcm treatments signiﬁcantly increased by 14 20 and 24 60 in 2019 and by 20 87 and 28 14 in 2020 respectively while that in the gm treatment decreased by 4 98 in 2019 and 5 45 in 2020 table 1 a higher kernel number per ear and 1000 kernel weight rather than hi often resulted in higher yields in the fm and fcm treatments table 1 although precipitation was highly variable in 2019 and 2020 the treatments showed the same trend in maize yield and yield components in both years the results of this study showed that the fcm treatment had the highest maize yield and the lowest et in all treatments compared with ck the wp of the fm and fcm treatments was significantly higher by 22 53 and 28 97 and 20 82 and 29 83 in 2019 and 2020 respectively while the wp of the gm treatment was slightly lower than that of ck in both years p 0 05 in general film mulching with manure amendment significantly increased yield and wp across the two years compared to the control nupe and nfp in the fcm treatment significantly increased by an average of 44 90 and 13 73 over the two years and that in the fm treatment significantly increased by 20 02 and 17 52 averaged over the two years respectively while nupe and nfp in the gm treatment decreased by 8 67 and 5 22 on average over the two years respectively table 2 however the variation trends of npe and nhi were completely distinct from those of nupe and nfp table 2 except for the gm treatment in 2020 the size order of npe in both years was gm ck fm fcm however the nhi was not significantly different among all treatments in both 2019 and 2020 3 2 soc tn and their long term dynamics the effects of different practices on soc stocks in 2019 and 2020 are shown in table 3 the trend of the soc stock in each treatment in each soil layer was consistent in 2019 and 2020 the soc stock of the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that of the other treatments in topsoil 0 20 cm and the soc stocks were not significantly different among treatments in the 20 40 soil layer while the highest soc stock was in the gm treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the effects of different agricultural practices on the crop biomass c inputs and manure c inputs in the two year experiment are shown in table 4 the c inputs from crop residues fluctuated within a range from 276 21 to 468 33 kg ha 1 yr 1 among all treatments while manure c inputs reached 2184 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the fcm treatment the c inputs of the ck gm and fm treatments were all from stubble and roots with the fm treatment having the highest c inputs among them in both years reaching 436 02 and 468 33 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively the trend of c inputs from crop residues in each treatment in both years was generally consistent with that of the yields in that year the total c inputs of the fcm treatment were mainly from the combination of crop residues and manure so it was significantly higher than the other treatments in both years the total c inputs in the ck gm fm and fcm treatments were 0 40 0 29 0 41 and 2 62 mg ha 1 yr 1 on average respectively according to the relationships between the annual average soc accumulation rate and the annual average c inputs among the treatments fig 3a the two year results showed that at least 0 67 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was required to maintain the soc balance on the loess plateau since separate models had different results for fitting the dynamics of soc and tn contents of topsoil with experiment years the relationships between soc and tn contents of topsoil with experiment years were fitted with linear and logarithmic equations in this study respectively table 5 both equations fitted well for the fcm treatment and by comparing the r2 values of the fitting results the linear equations could better illustrate the relationships between soc contents in topsoil and experiment years in all the treatments while the logarithmic equations could better illustrate the relationships between tn contents in topsoil and experiment years in all the treatments the temporal dynamics of different agricultural practices affecting soc content in topsoil from 2009 to 2020 are shown in fig 4 compared to the initial value of 8 20 g kg 1 in 2009 over the 12 years the ck and fcm treatments increased by 2 93 and 41 61 respectively while the gm and fm treatments decreased by 0 49 and 9 15 respectively the soc contents showed a decreasing trend with the increase in years in the gm and fm treatments but increased substantially with the increase in years in the fcm treatment and then gradually leveled off the c accumulation rates of the ck gm and fm treatments were 0 0051 0 0216 and 0 0449 g kg 1 year 1 respectively while that of the fcm treatment was 0 4872 g kg 1 year 1 before reaching equilibrium in the 7th year compared with ck the soc content increased significantly by 37 59 in the fcm treatment over 12 years the tn stocks ﬂuctuated within a wide range from 1 76 to 3 55 mg ha 1 across the two years table 3 in the 0 20 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in tn stock among the ck gm and fm treatments but their tn stocks were all significantly lower than that of the fcm treatment there was no significant difference in tn stocks among the treatments in the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers moreover the differences in the c n ratio among the soil layers and the treatments were also not significant the temporal dynamics of different agricultural practices affecting tn content in topsoil from 2009 to 2020 are shown in table 5 the tn content in the fcm treatment increased significantly from 1 05 g kg 1 at the beginning of the experiment in 2009 to 1 37 g kg 1 in 2020 with an increase of 30 27 while the tn contents in the ck gm and fm treatments showed different degrees of decrease compared to the initial value 1 05 g kg 1 decreasing by 2 17 4 12 and 10 67 respectively in terms of long term dynamics the tn content of the ck and gm treatments was basically unchanged and that of the fm treatment had a decreasing trend and gradually stabilized while that of the fcm treatment significantly increased 0 0277 g kg 1 year 1 in brief in the long term the fm treatment decreased the soc and tn contents of topsoil but the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc and tn contents of the topsoil especially soc reaching equilibrium 3 3 c and n saturation pool and sequestration potential the different practices affected the fine fraction 20 µm soc and tn saturation pools soc and tn current pools and soc and tn sequestration potential at the different soil depths in 2019 and 2020 fig 5 the variation trends in the soc and tn saturation pools were fully consistent with that of the proportion of particles 20 µm the fm treatment had the largest saturated soc and tn pools throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in both years but the difference among treatments did not reach a significant level in both the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers the fcm treatment had the largest current soc pool in both years which was higher than that of the other treatments the current tn pools were significantly different among treatments only in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the current tn pool of the fcm treatments was significantly higher than that of the control by 17 33 in 2019 and 24 06 in 2020 the soc and tn sequestration potential in topsoil was the lowest in the fcm treatment in both years and it was significantly lower than that in the fm treatment compared with that in topsoil there was a small effect in the 20 40 cm soil layer and little effect in the 40 60 cm soil layer the order of soc and tn sequestration potential in the 0 60 cm soil layer was the same in both years both of which were fm gm ck fcm overall mulching practices decreased the current soc and tn pools and increased their sequestration potential while the highest current soc and tn pools and the lowest soc and tn sequestration potential were both in the fcm treatment 4 discussion the 12 consecutive year field experiment revealed that compared to the control long term gravel mulching had no significant effect on yield wp nfue and soc and tn stocks while long term film mulching significantly increased yield and wp by 17 37 and 20 94 on average respectively but decreased soc and tn stocks significantly compared to the fm treatment the fcm treatment further increased yield and wp by 8 85 and 11 46 on average respectively and substantially increased soc and tn stocks however long term manure amendment may lead to soc equilibrium therefore we not only discussed the effects of different management practices on yield wp nfue and soc and tn dynamics but also proposed a targeted solution to soc equilibrium due to long term manure inputs and elucidated the mechanisms of breaking c equilibrium 4 1 effects of different agricultural practices on soil water storage crop yields wp and nfue mulching practices can reduce unproductive water losses from the soil surface and improve soil water and thermal status bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015a compared with the control the swc of fm and fcm treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased significantly at the early stages pt v6 of maize growth fig s1 improving the survival rate of seeds and accelerating seedling emergence liu et al 2009 hernández et al 2020 compared with the ck the gm fm and fcm treatments significantly increased the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer at the v6 and v10 stages in 2019 and 2020 this is because the rate of water vapor flux under mulching measures is usually much slower than the rate of water loss from uncovered soil surfaces however the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the fcm treatment was lower than that in the fm treatment in all stages this result is probably due to the higher planting density which increases the water evaporation flux which is consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2019 hernández et al 2020 a lower sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed at the r1 and r3 stages for all treatments during the maize growing season in 2019 while that was increased continuously in 2020 this is apparently due to the significant difference in rainfall between the two years in july and august fig 1 in addition low precipitation and increased plant growth at the r1 late july and r3 early august stages in 2019 resulted in high soil transpiration rates further explaining the lower sws of 0 60 cm in both in both years the pt v6 stage was subjected to severe water stress while water stress in subsequent stages varied depending on the annual rainfall distribution the sws of 0 200 cm in the fcm treatment was lower than that of the fm treatment in all stages and layers in both years because the higher planting density in the fcm treatment resulted in higher water consumption gravel mulching can increase water infiltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water in the soil profile wang et al 2018 the sws of 0 200 cm in the gm treatment was higher than that in the control at all stages in both years which was consistent with the results of bu et al 2013 the effectiveness of gravel mulching in reducing evaporation weakened over time after more than 5 years of mulching xu et al 2011 in this study although the density was nearly a quarter higher in the fcm treatment there was no significant decline in the sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer while significant declines in the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer occurred at the v6 and v10 stages relative to the fm treatment significant improvements in annual yield and its associated wp were found in the fm and fcm treatments compared to the control in the two year study however in the gm treatment there was a slight decrease table 1 the results of yield and wp in the gm treatment were distinct from the previous reports by our team bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015b it was also shown that soc tn and available n in the gm treatment reached their highest levels after 4 5 years of continuous cultivation and declined thereafter xu et al 2011 this suggested that the effect of the gm treatment on water and fertilizer retention to increase yields may last only approximately five or six years the fcm treatment had the highest yield and wp among these treatments which was consistent with the results of previous studies for example wei et al 2016 demonstrated that organics fertilizer can significantly increase the yield of wheat maize and rice by an average of 29 relative to organic fertilizer alone and 8 relative to chemical fertilizer alone wang et al 2017b reported that organic manure stably increased grain yield by 5 10 and wp increased by 3 8 under the integrated effect of manure and density especially improved 50 150 cm soil water use in addition there is evidence that organic manures have better long term yield potential than chemical fertilizers shahid et al 2017 gai et al 2018 in our study although the fm treatment also significantly increased crop yield relative to the control the yield enhancing effect gradually diminished in the long term compared with the results reported by our team previously bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015b the fcm and fm treatments signiﬁcantly increased nupe and nfp compared to the control in both years table 2 which agrees with the results of previous studies li et al 2016 the aboveground n accumulation in the fm treatment was significantly higher than that in the control in the present study which suggested that film mulching could significantly improve nupe and nfp however the nupe and nfp in the gm treatment decreased slightly which may be due to the decade long gravel mulching that caused a constant increase in the soilsand ratio in topsoil and poor water and fertilizer retention capacity qiu et al 2020 overall the fm treatment particularly the fcm treatment can significantly improve yield wp nupe and nfp in arid and semiarid regions 4 2 effects of different agricultural practices on soc and tn and their long term dynamics soc contents rather than soc stocks were directly used to perform a fit analysis with the experimental years fig 4a because the year after the year of tillage may result in large changes in the bd of the cultivated soil the fitted curves of soc contents with the experimental years in this study were distinct from gai et al 2018 which may be related to the differences in the amount of fertilizer inputs and soil types the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc content and current soc pool in topsoil compared to the control and it also significantly deceased the c sequestration potential of the topsoil there are two main sources of soc in the fcm treatment first the direct inputs of manure itself second the additional inputs of c in crop residues benefited from the fertilization effects of manure nutrients jalali and ranjbar 2009 in contrast compared to the initial soc value mulching practices all showed an obvious downward trend after up to 12 years of mulching fig 4 this may be because long term mulching significantly increases soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activity li et al 2004 zhang et al 2022 resulting in inputs from plant derived organic sources less than losses by microbial decomposition liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 found that crop yields would increase as soc increases according to the results of correlation analyses from long term experiments thus optimal manure amendments are recommended to replenish the loss of soc pool mineralization caused by mulching and improve yield in arid and semiarid areas tn stocks were signiﬁcantly increased by an average of 24 09 in the fcm treatment compared with the control in both years table 3 the tn stock at the 0 20 cm soil depth in the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that in the other treatments which was related to the mineralization of manure itself to produce n both mulching and manure amendment could promote root growth to increase the soil organic n but the higher density of the fcm treatment may lead to more root return the positive increase in tn in the fcm treatment mainly came from n released from manure directly and the mineralization of som tong et al 2009 saha et al 2021 over the 12 years the variation trends of tn and soc were similar in all treatments in the gm and fm treatments the tn content decreased from an initial 1 05 g kg 1 to 1 01 and 0 94 g kg 1 respectively indirectly confirming that mulching improves nfue in the fcm treatment the tn content increased substantially from 1 05 g kg 1 to 1 37 g kg 1 which was attributed to the direct provision of n by manure itself and mulching improves hydrothermal conditions to promote som mineralization to produce n indirectly li et al 2004 it would be valuable to see the temporal patterns of water production alongside the soc and tn data the results of pearson s correlation analysis in this study showed that there were interactions between soc tn and wp table s2 soc and tn were highly correlated r 0 910 p 0 01 so wp was highly correlated with both soc r 0 543 p 0 01 and tn r 0 539 p 0 01 the correlation between bd and wp r 0 600 p 0 01 was higher than that between wp and soc or tn which suggested that the core role of bd in improving wp needs to be emphasized moreover changes in soil bd were difficult to achieve in the short term and were influenced by long term changes in soc content long term exogenous som input can decrease soil bd and increase soil porosity chaudhary et al 2017 which implies an increase in soil water retention capacity the results indicated that an appropriate amount of manure inputs could improve the wp of the soil compared to the ck 4 3 effects of different agricultural practices on the sequestration potential of soc and tn after 12 years of manure amendment the soc content of the fcm treated soils gradually fluctuated within a certain range probably due to the proximity of c equilibrium with manure c input reaching 2 18 mg c yr 1 table 4 our results on the saturated c pool and c sequestration potential also confirmed this finding fig 5 after reaching c equilibrium part of the remaining manure c would be consumed through soil respiration thereby creating a negative c budget lai et al 2017 the potential of soils to sequester soc in a stable form which is limited by the stabilization of soc against microbial mineralization is largely unknown wiesmeier et al 2014 the high variability in c sink duration is influenced by climatic regions and soil physicochemical properties stewart et al 2009 the capacity of soils to preserve soc is limited by the proportion of silt and clay particles particularly fine fraction 20 µm which suppresses the increase in som even with increased external or internal inputs six et al 2002 zhao et al 2006 hassink 1997 in this study the proportion of the fine fraction ranged from 54 to 64 which was much lower than the 82 clay and silt content of the north china plain li et al 2020 the c pool capacity of agricultural soil in the north china plain reached equilibrium in 17 years with a manure application rate of 15 mg ha 1 yr 1 contained 22 8 c du et al 2014 while that on the loess plateau reached equilibrium at a manure application rate of 30 mg ha 1 yr 1 contained 7 25 c under mulching after 7 years however previous studies have shown that long term manure input did not lead to the equilibrium of soc stock in fluvial soil in the north china plain gao et al 2015 gai et al 2018 which was different from the results in cumuli ustic isohu mosols on the loess plateau this result indicated that soil type was probably the main factor influencing the saturated c and n pools of soils the results of this study showed that the soc pool of the fcm treatment reached equilibrium when it attained only approximately 65 75 of the theoretical saturated c pool which may be influenced by the excessive input of manure 6 8 t ha 1 yr 1 dry weight and the theoretical overestimation of the saturated c pool wiesmeier et al 2014 this was due to the limited surface area of clay minerals and the fine fraction was more likely to reach c saturation than that of the bulk soil stewart et al 2008 therefore although achieving the precisely estimated c saturation capacity is unrealistic it is certain that different agricultural practices have a great impact on estimating the saturated c pool 4 4 enhancing c and n sequestration in subsoils a schematic diagram of changes in yield wp soil bd fine grained fraction soc and tn sequestration potential under different treatments was established fig 6 although both fm and fcm treatments significantly increased yields and wp compared with the control table 1 the fm treatment had the negative effect of increasing soil bd in all soil layers a similar result was reported by wang et al 2017a the increase in the fine fraction in the fm treatment was probably due to the improved hydrothermal conditions by film mulching which accelerated the decomposition and turnover of som in the aggregates by microorganisms li et al 2004 wang et al 2017a studies in different regions have reported that organic fertilizers can increase soil aggregation and decrease the proportion of silt clay li et al 2020 mangalassery et al 2019 long term manure amendment reduced the soil bd fine fraction and c and n sequestration potential in topsoil and c tended to gradually reach equilibrium but the effect on subsoil was small fig 6 according to the report of kautz et al 2013 the key to solving the problem of soil soc equilibrium was to determine the ways to bring soil soc from the topsoil into the subsoil which included preferential flow subsoiling biopores and deep rooting crops subsoiling was the easiest of these measures to apply on a large scale and has been shown to be effective for improving yield and wp in several studies q zhang et al 2021 jiao et al 2022 moreover subsoils while highly heterogeneous were in many cases more suited to long term c sequestration than topsoils button et al 2022 although the soc and tn contents of the topsoil decreased the total sequestration of soc and tn increased in the 0 60 cm soil layer however c sequestration by improved management of agricultural soils reached a new equilibrium at a higher soc level after a certain period of time wiesmeier et al 2014 therefore subsoiling within a certain period every seven years in this study is probably an effective practice to improve the soc and tn sequestration potential in the fcm treatment the mechanism related to breaking c equilibrium by subsoiling can be elaborated in terms of both time and the amount of manure inputs fig 7 from a temporal perspective the trend of soc content over time under manure input is shown in fig 7a at the beginning the background value of the c content was low and the soc content increased sharply with manure inputs showing a period of c accumulation then the rate of soc accumulation slowed down with manure inputs and gradually tended to a relatively stable state equilibrium i in fig 7a after subsoiling equilibrium i was broken and the soc content decreased if the manure input was continued the soc content would repeat this process at a higher level resulting in another increase in soc content and a new steady state equilibrium ii in fig 7a however this process of repeated accumulation was not without limits in fact as the manure input continued the soc content rose to a certain level and then stabilized at that level at which point the steady state was saturated in terms of manure inputs fig 7b the soc content increased with increasing manure inputs after the accumulation of soc in soils with low background c content the soc content stabilized at a low level equilibrium i in fig 7b after subsoiling the soc content of topsoil decreased and then increased with the increase in manure inputs and the soc level also increased when it reached a new stable state equilibrium ii in fig 7b but the rate of soc content increase gradually decreased after the soil reached saturation the variation in soc content tended to zero with the soc level reaching the highest value then the soc content remained stable and no longer increased with the increase in manure input stewart et al 2007 soils with a low initial soc content have larger c saturation deficits so the saturation deficit i saturation deficit ii overall integrating manure in inorganic fertilizer under mulching with periodic subsoiling is probably a sustainable management approach in semiarid agroecosystems 5 conclusions application of npk fertilizers in combination with organic manure improved crop yields and wp soc and tn stocks in semiarid farmland compared with the control the effect of long term gravel mulching on increasing yield was no longer significant while long term film mulching could still significantly increase yield but it had negative effects on soil c and n stocks the minimum c input to maintain the soil c balance under mulching was 0 67 mg ha 1 yr 1 on the loess plateau in terms of time dynamics the trend of soc in topsoil gradually grew to a stable level while tn in topsoil continued to grow over 12 years in the fcm treatment which suggested that long term manure inputs led to soc equilibrium and decreased soc and tn sequestration potential the fm and fcm treatments had a significant effect on soc and tn sequestration potential in topsoil and less on that in subsoil the effects of the fm and fcm treatments on soil physical properties and soil c and n sequestration potential were analyzed comprehensively and revealed how subsoiling tillage broke the existing soc equilibrium to further enhance the soil c and n sequestration capacity of both topsoil and subsoil this study demonstrated that manure amendment under film mulching is an important strategy for the long term maintenance of high crop productivity and soil fertility in semiarid farmland credit authorship

9306,plastic ﬁlm and gravel mulching in combination with fertilization are widely used to increase crop yields and water productivity wp in arid and semiarid areas but soil surface mulching may stimulate soil organic carbon soc mineralization therefore ﬁlm mulching with manure amendment was proposed to improve soil fertility however the combined effects of these practices on yield wp and the stocks of soc and total nitrogen tn need to be better understood this study investigated the long term effects of different practices on crop yields wp and soc and tn stocks in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm layers based on a 12 year spring maize zea mays l ﬁeld experiment on the loess plateau the treatments included no mulching npk ck gravel mulching npk gm film mulching npk fm and film mulching npk cow manure fcm in 2019 and 2020 compared with the control both fm and fcm significantly increased crop yields wp n uptake efficiency nupe and n fertilizer productivity nfp compared with ck the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc and tn stocks by 44 10 and 39 51 respectively on average and the minimum c input that could maintain the soil c balance on the loess plateau was 0 67 mg ha 1 yr 1 over the 12 experimental years compared with the initial value in 2009 the trends of soc and tn contents in the fm treatment were downward while those in the fcm treatment increased by 41 61 and 30 27 respectively but yearly input of manure led to soc equilibrium compared with ck the fcm treatment significantly decreased soc and tn sequestration potential by 33 38 and 19 59 respectively on average in topsoil 0 20 cm but it had less of an effect on soc and tn sequestration at 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil depths the reasons for soc reaching equilibrium in the fcm treatment were analyzed and periodic subsoiling was proposed to break the equilibrium state to further improve the sequestration amount of soc and tn at 0 60 cm soil depths in conclusion ﬁlm mulching with manure amendment was recommended as a long term strategy to improve soil productivity and soil fertility in semiarid farmland graphical abstract ga1 keywords carbon equilibrium long term field experiment sequestration potential soil fertility water productivity yield data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil is an important carbon c and nitrogen n sink in terrestrial ecosystems for the global c and n cycles which contains 1550 pg soil organic carbon soc and 300 pg of total nitrogen tn up to 1 m depth and these amounts are considerably greater than the c and n in all living terrestrial plants lal 2004a relatively small changes in soil c and n pools may have substantial effects on atmospheric concentrations and global warming belay tedla et al 2009 the trends of soc and tn are consistent in most cases because soil organic matter som is composed of a continuum of compounds rich in c and n manzoni and porporato 2009 so it works closely with soil fertility and nutrient cycling for crop productivity improvement in agricultural systems cai et al 2019 liu et al 2022 therefore increasing the som content has high potential for reducing co2 emissions increasing both soc and tn stocks and ensuring sustainable soil productivity li et al 2021 xu et al 2022 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semiarid agricultural region in china and crop yield in the region is limited by low air temperatures and drought during the early crop growth stage in the spring liu et al 2009 film mulching and gravel mulching with n fertilizer are effective tools to improve crop yields and water productivity wp in arid and semiarid regions bu et al 2013 li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however improved hydrothermal conditions also increase the risk of soc mineralization leading to soc depletion yin et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to take other complementary practices with mulching to maintain high yields and soil fertility to obtain higher yields farmers often plant higher densities of crops however a high planting density not only increases soil water consumption jiang et al 2014b but also aggravates soil degradation superposing the continuous use of chemical fertilizers and film mulching ju et al 2009 in particular it triggers a chain reaction such as soil compaction which leads to poor water storage and soil nutrient content thus damaging soil quality and failing to maintain high yields in the long term wang et al 2017b manure amendments can supply a large amount of available c sources and other nutrients such as n phosphorus p and potassium k which is helpful for improving crop yields and soil quality zhang et al 2021a liu et al 2021 the application of manure also enhances soil structure lowers soil bulk density and improves soil porosity and water storage capacity jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b which means that the same amount of land can support higher densities for higher yields combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers is a common practice of intensive agriculture to improve plant nutrition and thereby crop yields semenov et al 2021 yang et al 2015 wei et al 2016 which possesses the potential of stabilizing crop production by improving soil water nutrient conditions in arid and semiarid regions however long term application of organic inputs resulted in an increase in soil c and n retention from year to year and many studies have reported that an upper limit of som exists known as saturation six et al 2002 stewart et al 2008 wiesmeier et al 2014 therefore long term fertilization experiments are necessary for studying the interannual variability in soc and tn agricultural soils have a high potential for c sequestration because significant depletion of c stocks has been observed in most cultivated soils paustian et al 1997 lal 2004b smith 2004 organic inputs are a promising management option for increasing c sequestration in cultivated soils and previous studies have confirmed that organic inputs could significantly increase soc stocks yang et al 2015 shahid et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the upper limit of soc storage is related to the limited potential of soils to stabilize som against microbial mineralization baldock and skjemstad 2000 which is based on three mechanisms a recalcitrance level b spatial inaccessibility and c interaction with mineral surfaces vonlützow et al 2008 the latter is considered to be the most important in terms of the correlations between soc stocks and the content of the fine fraction 20 µm and is used to quantitatively estimate c and n saturation hassink 1997 this method has been used by several studies to estimate the degree of c saturation in cultivated soils and it has been proven to be reliable six et al 2002 zhao et al 2006 wiesmeier et al 2014 the c and n sequestration potential is the difference between the c and n saturations and the actual measured c and n contents of the fine fraction it is helpful to quantitatively estimate the amount of c and n that can continue to be sequestered by various soils however the soil c and n sequestration potential of the loess plateau is currently unknown in addition little information is available on the application rate of organic inputs required under mulching to achieve soc balance on the loess plateau in this study a long term field experiment since 2009 was conducted to test the following hypothesis film mulching with manure amendment is a sustainable management strategy to achieve long term yield benefits and promote soc and tn sequestration the objectives of the study were to 1 identify an agricultural management practice for semiarid areas based on the combined effects on yield wp n fertilizer use efficiency nfue and soil fertility and 2 investigate whether long term manure amendment leads to soc and tn equilibrium or saturation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were performed at the

respectively the average water content of the cow dung over the years was 77 26 equivalent to 6 8 mg dry weight chemical fertilizers and manure were applied on a yearly basis and the application doses were the same every year urea n 46 was applied 3 times at a ratio of 4 3 3 in the other treatments and topdressing was carried out in the jointing stage 30 and the silking stage 30 calcium superphosphate p2o5 12 was applied at a rate of 40 kg p ha 1 potassium sulfate k2o 51 was applied to provide 80 kg k ha 1 and p and k fertilizer usage were consistent for all treatments all p and k fertilizers and 40 chemical n fertilizer were applied as basal fertilizer after plowing to a depth of 30 cm in all plots all basal fertilizers were surface applied and incorporated into the soil immediately maize zea mays l pioneer 335 was sown at a depth of 5 cm the density was 65 000 plants ha 1 in the ck gm and fm treatments while that in the fcm treatment was 80 000 plants ha 1 the ridge furrow was constructed in all treatments with plastic film or gravel cover throughout the year to minimize the loss of soil moisture no irrigation was provided during the growing period 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant sample collection and determination after harvesting all plant materials were manually transported out of the experimental field thus only roots and crop residues were returned to the soil three plants were randomly selected from the harvested plants in each plot and then divided by stem leaf bract rachis and grain fresh plant samples were oven dried at 105 for 30 min and then 75 dried to constant weight the dry samples were crushed to determine plant c and n 2 3 2 grain yield and harvest index the maize plants within 9 m2 4 5 m 2 m at the center of each plot were harvested manually to determine the grain yield at the physiologically mature stage which was calculated with a standard moisture content of 15 5 the kernel number per ear was counted on ﬁve maize cobs per plot one thousand kernel weights were determined by counting a subsample of 1000 grains and obtaining the dry weight the harvest index hi was calculated by the total kernel weight divided by the total aboveground biomass at the mature stage 2 3 3 soil water content the soil water content swc was measured gravimetrically at 20 cm intervals in the 0 200 cm soil proﬁle in each plot at different maize growing stages i before sowing pt ii the jointing stage v6 iii the 10 leaf stage v10 iv the silking stage r1 v the milk stage r3 and vi the physiological maturity stage r6 in each of the plots three random soil core samples were drilled using a hand held soil iron drill and sealed in an aluminum case soil samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to calculate swc fig s1 2 3 4 soil sampling and soil physicochemical properties soil cores were drilled randomly with a soil auger 4 cm diameter after harvesting in 2019 and 2020 in each plot three cores were mixed as a composite sample for each soil depth 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm the composite soil samples were packed into plastic bags and then transported to the laboratory a portion of the soil samples was naturally air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve to determine the soil particle distribution and the remaining soil was screened by 0 25 mm to determine soc and tn soil particle distribution was measured by a malvern laser granulator apa2000 model malvern co ltd uk bulk density bd was measured using a conventional core method soc was determined by the wet oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 tn was determined by the kieldahl method 2 3 5 extraction of fine fraction 20 µm the soil fraction 20 µm was obtained by physical fractionation using the protocol of amelung et al 1998 modified by wiesmeier et al 2014 with lower ultrasonication energies briefly 10 g of dry soil 2 mm was suspended in 50 ml of deionized water to disrupt only weakly stabilized soil macroaggregates and prevent the disruption of mineral associated som the ultrasound energy was adjusted to 22 j ml 1 using a calibrated ultrasonic probe type bandelin berlin germany the sand sized fraction was isolated by wet sieving through a 53 µm mesh the remaining suspension was separated by wet sieving through a 20 µm mesh using pressure filtration to overcome capillary forces at a 20 µm level to obtain the stable soc fraction spielvogel et al 2006 steffens et al 2009 wiesmeier et al 2014 the supernatant was then passed through a 0 45 µm membrane filter to measure labile dissolved organic c and n using a multi n c 3000 analyzer analytik jena ag germany the fraction 20 µm was dried at 60 weighed ground and analyzed for soc and tn 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 calculation of soil water storage wp and nfue the soil water storage sws mm was the total water in the proﬁle of the 0 200 cm depth calculated with the following formula wang et al 2017b 1 sws swc h bd 10 where swc is the soil water content h is the soil depth cm and bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 the total evapotranspiration et mm during the spring maize growing season was calculated according to the equation described by allen et al 1998 2 et p i sws2 sws1 c d r where p mm is the total precipitation during the maize growing season i is the amount of irrigation mm sws1 mm is the soil water storage at sowing sws2 mm is the soil water storage at harvest c mm is the upward flow into the root zone d mm is the downward drainage out of the root zone and r mm is the surface runoff in the experimental region et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration with transpiration being the larger component of et the groundwater table at the experimental site was located at a depth of approximately 60 m below the surface so upward flow into the roots was not considered in this area the experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions no rainstorms occurred during the experimental period and high ridges surrounded each plot to prevent the occurrence of runoff the local rainfall was generally low and did not cause underground drainage at depths exceeding 200 cm therefore a simplified equation was used to calculate et and further used to calculate wp fernández et al 2020 3 et p δsw 4 wp y et where δsw mm is the difference between sws2 and sws1 wp kg ha 1 mm 1 is water productivity and y kg ha 1 is the grain yield water stress ws is expressed using relative water content table s1 i e soil water content as a percentage of the maximum field water holding capacity the water stress degree wsd was classified into four classes with 75 being no water stress 55 75 being mild water stress 40 55 being moderate water stress and 40 being heavy water stress zheng and yan 2006 table s1 the indexes of nfue are key parameters

calculate the annual c inputs into soil the main sources of c inputs including both manure and crop residues roots exudation and dead materials need to be quantified the amount of crop residues equivalent to 16 of the aboveground dry matter production datta et al 2018 and rhizodeposition constituting 1 4 of root c shamoot et al 1968 for maize were assumed for calculation in addition approximately 85 of maize root biomass is distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer jiang et al 2014a zhang et al 2020 2 4 3 calculation of c and n sequestration potential the potential c and n saturations of particles 20 µm were calculated using the equation of hassink 1997 and wiesmeier et al 2014 10 csat 4 09 0 37 particles 20 μ m 11 nsat 0 40 0 037 particles 20 μ m where csat is the potential c saturation g kg 1 nsat is the potential n saturation g kg 1 and particles 20 µm are the proportion of fine soil particles 20 µm the c or n saturation deficit of the fine fraction 20 µm was calculated by the equation of wiesmeier et al 2014 which is as follows 12 tdef tsat tcur where tdef is the c saturation deficit g kg 1 or the n saturation deficit g kg 1 tcur is the current c or n

ibm corporation armonk usa and all ﬁgures were prepared by originpro 2021 originlab usa one way analysis of variance anova was employed to determine means among different treatments by the least signiﬁcant difference test lsd at a 0 05 level p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage grain yield wp and nfue the sws ranged from 390 6 to 614 05 mm in the range of 0 200 cm throughout the two years and the order of sws at r6 was fm gm fcm ck in 2019 and fm fcm gm ck in 2020 fig 2 the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer of both the fcm and fm treatments at pt was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment in both years indicating that the fcm and fm treatments could increase topsoil moisture and promote seed germination the sws in all mulching treatments was significantly higher than that in ck at v6 and v10 suggesting that the mulching treatments were able to maintain sufficient moisture in the topsoil for crop seedling growth the sws of the 0 200 cm soil layer in the fcm treatment was lower than that in the control at r1 in 2020 while the sws in the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that in the control at r1 in 2019 regardless of the soil layer the difference in sws among the fm fcm and gm treatments was not significant in the 0 60 cm soil layer at r3 and r6 in 2020 while the sws of the fm and fcm treatments in the 0 200 cm soil layer was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment at r6 in 2019 in addition the sws of the four treatments tended to increase and then decrease from shallow to deep while the sws of 60 120 cm was lower than that of 0 60 cm and 120 200 cm the et in both the fm and fcm treatments was significantly lower than that in the control in 2019 but there was no significant difference in et among the treatments in 2020 and the fcm treatment had the lowest et in both years the above results indicated that mulching practices can effectively increase the sws of soil at r6 while the no mulching treatment intensified the loss of soil water at the seedling stage and reduced the sws of soil throughout the growth period compared with the control the maize yield of the fm and fcm treatments signiﬁcantly increased by 14 20 and 24 60 in 2019 and by 20 87 and 28 14 in 2020 respectively while that in the gm treatment decreased by 4 98 in 2019 and 5 45 in 2020 table 1 a higher kernel number per ear and 1000 kernel weight rather than hi often resulted in higher yields in the fm and fcm treatments table 1 although precipitation was highly variable in 2019 and 2020 the treatments showed the same trend in maize yield and yield components in both years the results of this study showed that the fcm treatment had the highest maize yield and the lowest et in all treatments compared with ck the wp of the fm and fcm treatments was significantly higher by 22 53 and 28 97 and 20 82 and 29 83 in 2019 and 2020 respectively while the wp of the gm treatment was slightly lower than that of ck in both years p 0 05 in general film mulching with manure amendment significantly increased yield and wp across the two years compared to the control nupe and nfp in the fcm treatment significantly increased by an average of 44 90 and 13 73 over the two years and that in the fm treatment significantly increased by 20 02 and 17 52 averaged over the two years respectively while nupe and nfp in the gm treatment decreased by 8 67 and 5 22 on average over the two years respectively table 2 however the variation trends of npe and nhi were completely distinct from those of nupe and nfp table 2 except for the gm treatment in 2020 the size order of npe in both years was gm ck fm fcm however the nhi was not significantly different among all treatments in both 2019 and 2020 3 2 soc tn and their long term dynamics the effects of different practices on soc stocks in 2019 and 2020 are shown in table 3 the trend of the soc stock in each treatment in each soil layer was consistent in 2019 and 2020 the soc stock of the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that of the other treatments in topsoil 0 20 cm and the soc stocks were not significantly different among treatments in the 20 40 soil layer while the highest soc stock was in the gm treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the effects of different agricultural practices on the crop biomass c inputs and manure c inputs in the two year experiment are shown in table 4 the c inputs from crop residues fluctuated within a range from 276 21 to 468 33 kg ha 1 yr 1 among all treatments while manure c inputs reached 2184 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the fcm treatment the c inputs of the ck gm and fm treatments were all from stubble and roots with the fm treatment having the highest c inputs among them in both years reaching 436 02 and 468 33 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively the trend of c inputs from crop residues in each treatment in both years was generally consistent with that of the yields in that year the total c inputs of the fcm treatment were mainly from the combination of crop residues and manure so it was significantly higher than the other treatments in both years the total c inputs in the ck gm fm and fcm treatments were 0 40 0 29 0 41 and 2 62 mg ha 1 yr 1 on average respectively according to the relationships between the annual average soc accumulation rate and the annual average c inputs among the treatments fig 3a the two year results showed that at least 0 67 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was required to maintain the soc balance on the loess plateau since separate models had different results for fitting the dynamics of soc and tn contents of topsoil with experiment years the relationships between soc and tn contents of topsoil with experiment years were fitted with linear and logarithmic equations in this study respectively table 5 both equations fitted well for the fcm treatment and by comparing the r2 values of the fitting results the linear equations could better illustrate the relationships between soc contents in topsoil and experiment years in all the treatments while the logarithmic equations could better illustrate the relationships between tn contents in topsoil and experiment years in all the treatments the temporal dynamics of different agricultural practices affecting soc content in topsoil from 2009 to 2020 are shown in fig 4 compared to the initial value of 8 20 g kg 1 in 2009 over the 12 years the ck and fcm treatments increased by 2 93 and 41 61 respectively while the gm and fm treatments decreased by 0 49 and 9 15 respectively the soc contents showed a decreasing trend with the increase in years in the gm and fm treatments but increased substantially with the increase in years in the fcm treatment and then gradually leveled off the c accumulation rates of the ck gm and fm treatments were 0 0051 0 0216 and 0 0449 g kg 1 year 1 respectively while that of the fcm treatment was 0 4872 g kg 1 year 1 before reaching equilibrium in the 7th year compared with ck the soc content increased significantly by 37 59 in the fcm treatment over 12 years the tn stocks ﬂuctuated within a wide range from 1 76 to 3 55 mg ha 1 across the two years table 3 in the 0 20 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in tn stock among the ck gm and fm treatments but their tn stocks were all significantly lower than that of the fcm treatment there was no significant difference in tn stocks among the treatments in the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers moreover the differences in the c n ratio among the soil layers and the treatments were also not significant the temporal dynamics of different agricultural practices affecting tn content in topsoil from 2009 to 2020 are shown in table 5 the tn content in the fcm treatment increased significantly from 1 05 g kg 1 at the beginning of the experiment in 2009 to 1 37 g kg 1 in 2020 with an increase of 30 27 while the tn contents in the ck gm and fm treatments showed different degrees of decrease compared to the initial value 1 05 g kg 1 decreasing by 2 17 4 12 and 10 67 respectively in terms of long term dynamics the tn content of the ck and gm treatments was basically unchanged and that of the fm treatment had a decreasing trend and gradually stabilized while that of the fcm treatment significantly increased 0 0277 g kg 1 year 1 in brief in the long term the fm treatment decreased the soc and tn contents of topsoil but the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc and tn contents of the topsoil especially soc reaching equilibrium 3 3 c and n saturation pool and sequestration potential the different practices affected the fine fraction 20 µm soc and tn saturation pools soc and tn current pools and soc and tn sequestration potential at the different soil depths in 2019 and 2020 fig 5 the variation trends in the soc and tn saturation pools were fully consistent with that of the proportion of particles 20 µm the fm treatment had the largest saturated soc and tn pools throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in both years but the difference among treatments did not reach a significant level in both the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers the fcm treatment had the largest current soc pool in both years which was higher than that of the other treatments the current tn pools were significantly different among treatments only in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the current tn pool of the fcm treatments was significantly higher than that of the control by 17 33 in 2019 and 24 06 in 2020 the soc and tn sequestration potential in topsoil was the lowest in the fcm treatment in both years and it was significantly lower than that in the fm treatment compared with that in topsoil there was a small effect in the 20 40 cm soil layer and little effect in the 40 60 cm soil layer the order of soc and tn sequestration potential in the 0 60 cm soil layer was the same in both years both of which were fm gm ck fcm overall mulching practices decreased the current soc and tn pools and increased their sequestration potential while the highest current soc and tn pools and the lowest soc and tn sequestration potential were both in the fcm treatment 4 discussion the 12 consecutive year field experiment revealed that compared to the control long term gravel mulching had no significant effect on yield wp nfue and soc and tn stocks while long term film mulching significantly increased yield and wp by 17 37 and 20 94 on average respectively but decreased soc and tn stocks significantly compared to the fm treatment the fcm treatment further increased yield and wp by 8 85 and 11 46 on average respectively and substantially increased soc and tn stocks however long term manure amendment may lead to soc equilibrium therefore we not only discussed the effects of different management practices on yield wp nfue and soc and tn dynamics but also proposed a targeted solution to soc equilibrium due to long term manure inputs and elucidated the mechanisms of breaking c equilibrium 4 1 effects of different agricultural practices on soil water storage crop yields wp and nfue mulching practices can reduce unproductive water losses from the soil surface and improve soil water and thermal status bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015a compared with the control the swc of fm and fcm treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased significantly at the early stages pt v6 of maize growth fig s1 improving the survival rate of seeds and accelerating seedling emergence liu et al 2009 hernández et al 2020 compared with the ck the gm fm and fcm treatments significantly increased the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer at the v6 and v10 stages in 2019 and 2020 this is because the rate of water vapor flux under mulching measures is usually much slower than the rate of water loss from uncovered soil surfaces however the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the fcm treatment was lower than that in the fm treatment in all stages this result is probably due to the higher planting density which increases the water evaporation flux which is consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2019 hernández et al 2020 a lower sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed at the r1 and r3 stages for all treatments during the maize growing season in 2019 while that was increased continuously in 2020 this is apparently due to the significant difference in rainfall between the two years in july and august fig 1 in addition low precipitation and increased plant growth at the r1 late july and r3 early august stages in 2019 resulted in high soil transpiration rates further explaining the lower sws of 0 60 cm in both in both years the pt v6 stage was subjected to severe water stress while water stress in subsequent stages varied depending on the annual rainfall distribution the sws of 0 200 cm in the fcm treatment was lower than that of the fm treatment in all stages and layers in both years because the higher planting density in the fcm treatment resulted in higher water consumption gravel mulching can increase water infiltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water in the soil profile wang et al 2018 the sws of 0 200 cm in the gm treatment was higher than that in the control at all stages in both years which was consistent with the results of bu et al 2013 the effectiveness of gravel mulching in reducing evaporation weakened over time after more than 5 years of mulching xu et al 2011 in this study although the density was nearly a quarter higher in the fcm treatment there was no significant decline in the sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer while significant declines in the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer occurred at the v6 and v10 stages relative to the fm treatment significant improvements in annual yield and its associated wp were found in the fm and fcm treatments compared to the control in the two year study however in the gm treatment there was a slight decrease table 1 the results of yield and wp in the gm treatment were distinct from the previous reports by our team bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015b it was also shown that soc tn and available n in the gm treatment reached their highest levels after 4 5 years of continuous cultivation and declined thereafter xu et al 2011 this suggested that the effect of the gm treatment on water and fertilizer retention to increase yields may last only approximately five or six years the fcm treatment had the highest yield and wp among these treatments which was consistent with the results of previous studies for example wei et al 2016 demonstrated that organics fertilizer can significantly increase the yield of wheat maize and rice by an average of 29 relative to organic fertilizer alone and 8 relative to chemical fertilizer alone wang et al 2017b reported that organic manure stably increased grain yield by 5 10 and wp increased by 3 8 under the integrated effect of manure and density especially improved 50 150 cm soil water use in addition there is evidence that organic manures have better long term yield potential than chemical fertilizers shahid et al 2017 gai et al 2018 in our study although the fm treatment also significantly increased crop yield relative to the control the yield enhancing effect gradually diminished in the long term compared with the results reported by our team previously bu et al 2013 luo et al 2015b the fcm and fm treatments signiﬁcantly increased nupe and nfp compared to the control in both years table 2 which agrees with the results of previous studies li et al 2016 the aboveground n accumulation in the fm treatment was significantly higher than that in the control in the present study which suggested that film mulching could significantly improve nupe and nfp however the nupe and nfp in the gm treatment decreased slightly which may be due to the decade long gravel mulching that caused a constant increase in the soilsand ratio in topsoil and poor water and fertilizer retention capacity qiu et al 2020 overall the fm treatment particularly the fcm treatment can significantly improve yield wp nupe and nfp in arid and semiarid regions 4 2 effects of different agricultural practices on soc and tn and their long term dynamics soc contents rather than soc stocks were directly used to perform a fit analysis with the experimental years fig 4a because the year after the year of tillage may result in large changes in the bd of the cultivated soil the fitted curves of soc contents with the experimental years in this study were distinct from gai et al 2018 which may be related to the differences in the amount of fertilizer inputs and soil types the fcm treatment significantly increased the soc content and current soc pool in topsoil compared to the control and it also significantly deceased the c sequestration potential of the topsoil there are two main sources of soc in the fcm treatment first the direct inputs of manure itself second the additional inputs of c in crop residues benefited from the fertilization effects of manure nutrients jalali and ranjbar 2009 in contrast compared to the initial soc value mulching practices all showed an obvious downward trend after up to 12 years of mulching fig 4 this may be because long term mulching significantly increases soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activity li et al 2004 zhang et al 2022 resulting in inputs from plant derived organic sources less than losses by microbial decomposition liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 found that crop yields would increase as soc increases according to the results of correlation analyses from long term experiments thus optimal manure amendments are recommended to replenish the loss of soc pool mineralization caused by mulching and improve yield in arid and semiarid areas tn stocks were signiﬁcantly increased by an average of 24 09 in the fcm treatment compared with the control in both years table 3 the tn stock at the 0 20 cm soil depth in the fcm treatment was significantly higher than that in the other treatments which was related to the mineralization of manure itself to produce n both mulching and manure amendment could promote root growth to increase the soil organic n but the higher density of the fcm treatment may lead to more root return the positive increase in tn in the fcm treatment mainly came from n released from manure directly and the mineralization of som tong et al 2009 saha et al 2021 over the 12 years the variation trends of tn and soc were similar in all treatments in the gm and fm treatments the tn content decreased from an initial 1 05 g kg 1 to 1 01 and 0 94 g kg 1 respectively indirectly confirming that mulching improves nfue in the fcm treatment the tn content increased substantially from 1 05 g kg 1 to 1 37 g kg 1 which was attributed to the direct provision of n by manure itself and mulching improves hydrothermal conditions to promote som mineralization to produce n indirectly li et al 2004 it would be valuable to see the temporal patterns of water production alongside the soc and tn data the results of pearson s correlation analysis in this study showed that there were interactions between soc tn and wp table s2 soc and tn were highly correlated r 0 910 p 0 01 so wp was highly correlated with both soc r 0 543 p 0 01 and tn r 0 539 p 0 01 the correlation between bd and wp r 0 600 p 0 01 was higher than that between wp and soc or tn which suggested that the core role of bd in improving wp needs to be emphasized moreover changes in soil bd were difficult to achieve in the short term and were influenced by long term changes in soc content long term exogenous som input can decrease soil bd and increase soil porosity chaudhary et al 2017 which implies an increase in soil water retention capacity the results indicated that an appropriate amount of manure inputs could improve the wp of the soil compared to the ck 4 3 effects of different agricultural practices on the sequestration potential of soc and tn after 12 years of manure amendment the soc content of the fcm treated soils gradually fluctuated within a certain range probably due to the proximity of c equilibrium with manure c input reaching 2 18 mg c yr 1 table 4 our results on the saturated c pool and c sequestration potential also confirmed this finding fig 5 after reaching c equilibrium part of the remaining manure c would be consumed through soil respiration thereby creating a negative c budget lai et al 2017 the potential of soils to sequester soc in a stable form which is limited by the stabilization of soc against microbial mineralization is largely unknown wiesmeier et al 2014 the high variability in c sink duration is influenced by climatic regions and soil physicochemical properties stewart et al 2009 the capacity of soils to preserve soc is limited by the proportion of silt and clay particles particularly fine fraction 20 µm which suppresses the increase in som even with increased external or internal inputs six et al 2002 zhao et al 2006 hassink 1997 in this study the proportion of the fine fraction ranged from 54 to 64 which was much lower than the 82 clay and silt content of the north china plain li et al 2020 the c pool capacity of agricultural soil in the north china plain reached equilibrium in 17 years with a manure application rate of 15 mg ha 1 yr 1 contained 22 8 c du et al 2014 while that on the loess plateau reached equilibrium at a manure application rate of 30 mg ha 1 yr 1 contained 7 25 c under mulching after 7 years however previous studies have shown that long term manure input did not lead to the equilibrium of soc stock in fluvial soil in the north china plain gao et al 2015 gai et al 2018 which was different from the results in cumuli ustic isohu mosols on the loess plateau this result indicated that soil type was probably the main factor influencing the saturated c and n pools of soils the results of this study showed that the soc pool of the fcm treatment reached equilibrium when it attained only approximately 65 75 of the theoretical saturated c pool which may be influenced by the excessive input of manure 6 8 t ha 1 yr 1 dry weight and the theoretical overestimation of the saturated c pool wiesmeier et al 2014 this was due to the limited surface area of clay minerals and the fine fraction was more likely to reach c saturation than that of the bulk soil stewart et al 2008 therefore although achieving the precisely estimated c saturation capacity is unrealistic it is certain that different agricultural practices have a great impact on estimating the saturated c pool 4 4 enhancing c and n sequestration in subsoils a schematic diagram of changes in yield wp soil bd fine grained fraction soc and tn sequestration potential under different treatments was established fig 6 although both fm and fcm treatments significantly increased yields and wp compared with the control table 1 the fm treatment had the negative effect of increasing soil bd in all soil layers a similar result was reported by wang et al 2017a the increase in the fine fraction in the fm treatment was probably due to the improved hydrothermal conditions by film mulching which accelerated the decomposition and turnover of som in the aggregates by microorganisms li et al 2004 wang et al 2017a studies in different regions have reported that organic fertilizers can increase soil aggregation and decrease the proportion of silt clay li et al 2020 mangalassery et al 2019 long term manure amendment reduced the soil bd fine fraction and c and n sequestration potential in topsoil and c tended to gradually reach equilibrium but the effect on subsoil was small fig 6 according to the report of kautz et al 2013 the key to solving the problem of soil soc equilibrium was to determine the ways to bring soil soc from the topsoil into the subsoil which included preferential flow subsoiling biopores and deep rooting crops subsoiling was the easiest of these measures to apply on a large scale and has been shown to be effective for improving yield and wp in several studies q zhang et al 2021 jiao et al 2022 moreover subsoils while highly heterogeneous were in many cases more suited to long term c sequestration than topsoils button et al 2022 although the soc and tn contents of the topsoil decreased the total sequestration of soc and tn increased in the 0 60 cm soil layer however c sequestration by improved management of agricultural soils reached a new equilibrium at a higher soc level after a certain period of time wiesmeier et al 2014 therefore subsoiling within a certain period every seven years in this study is probably an effective practice to improve the soc and tn sequestration potential in the fcm treatment the mechanism related to breaking c equilibrium by subsoiling can be elaborated in terms of both time and the amount of manure inputs fig 7 from a temporal perspective the trend of soc content over time under manure input is shown in fig 7a at the beginning the background value of the c content was low and the soc content increased sharply with manure inputs showing a period of c accumulation then the rate of soc accumulation slowed down with manure inputs and gradually tended to a relatively stable state equilibrium i in fig 7a after subsoiling equilibrium i was broken and the soc content decreased if the manure input was continued the soc content would repeat this process at a higher level resulting in another increase in soc content and a new steady state equilibrium ii in fig 7a however this process of repeated accumulation was not without limits in fact as the manure input continued the soc content rose to a certain level and then stabilized at that level at which point the steady state was saturated in terms of manure inputs fig 7b the soc content increased with increasing manure inputs after the accumulation of soc in soils with low background c content the soc content stabilized at a low level equilibrium i in fig 7b after subsoiling the soc content of topsoil decreased and then increased with the increase in manure inputs and the soc level also increased when it reached a new stable state equilibrium ii in fig 7b but the rate of soc content increase gradually decreased after the soil reached saturation the variation in soc content tended to zero with the soc level reaching the highest value then the soc content remained stable and no longer increased with the increase in manure input stewart et al 2007 soils with a low initial soc content have larger c saturation deficits so the saturation deficit i saturation deficit ii overall integrating manure in inorganic fertilizer under mulching with periodic subsoiling is probably a sustainable management approach in semiarid agroecosystems 5 conclusions application of npk fertilizers in combination with organic manure improved crop yields and wp soc and tn stocks in semiarid farmland compared with the control the effect of long term gravel mulching on increasing yield was no longer significant while long term film mulching could still significantly increase yield but it had negative effects on soil c and n stocks the minimum c input to maintain the soil c balance under mulching was 0 67 mg ha 1 yr 1 on the loess plateau in terms of time dynamics the trend of soc in topsoil gradually grew to a stable level while tn in topsoil continued to grow over 12 years in the fcm treatment which suggested that long term manure inputs led to soc equilibrium and decreased soc and tn sequestration potential the fm and fcm treatments had a significant effect on soc and tn sequestration potential in topsoil and less on that in subsoil the effects of the fm and fcm treatments on soil physical properties and soil c and n sequestration potential were analyzed comprehensively and revealed how subsoiling tillage broke the existing soc equilibrium to further enhance the soil c and n sequestration capacity of both topsoil and subsoil this study demonstrated that manure amendment under film mulching is an important strategy for the long term maintenance of high crop productivity and soil fertility in semiarid farmland credit authorship

processed forms such as frozen conserves juices and purees graham and woodhead 2009 the world s total raspberry harvested surface area in 2019 was approximately 127 578 ha which yielded an average of 7067 5838 kg ha 1 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 chile is seventh among the main raspberry producers worldwide with 3888 ha of harvested surface area which yields an average of approximately 4100 kg ha 1 in addition this country leads in the export of frozen raspberries from the southern hemisphere food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 the chilean raspberry production is mainly concentrated on small farms whose surface areas are less than 0 75 ha and are predominantly irrigated by furrow irrigation systems morales et al 2017 the chilean raspberry orchards are located in mediterranean type climate regions where a mega drought has significantly decreased rainfall and water availability for irrigation since 2010 garreaud et al 2020 in addition the raspberry farmers do not use adequately irrigation technologies to schedule water application which has been the main limitation for improving yield and water productivity jara rojas et al 2018 for future water scarcity scenarios furrow irrigated raspberry orchards require the development of irrigation management strategies to increase water productivity wp and reduce water applications without decreasing yield and quality raspberries have a shallow root system that requires a regular water supply from fruit set to harvest based on soil plant climate interactions morales et al 2013 however the available information on the yield quality and wp responses of raspberries to different irrigation regimes is still limited and most of the studies on small fruits have been conducted in blueberry orchards in this regard bryla et al 2011 reported that the yields and berry weights were greater for highbush blueberry plants irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc than those at 150 etc and were significantly decreased by water restrictions e g 50 etc for a drip irrigated blueberry orchard lobos et al 2016 2018 indicated that irrigation at 75 etc produced similar yields and berry weights as water applications at 100 etc ortega farias et al 2021 for blueberry plants observed that the water use in plants at 100 etc was between 20 and 27 lower than that at 125 etc but the yield and quality were similar at both water application levels in addition water stressed plants 50 etc produced fruits with the highest soluble solids ss contents but the yield fruit weight and fruits per plant were significantly reduced in comparison with well watered plants likewise ehret et al 2012 and bryla et al 2011 for blueberries reported that either under or over

nissen 1998 reported that the wps ranged from 0 20 kg m 3 for the non watered treatment to 0 16 kg m 3 for the drip and sprinkler irrigated treatments the authors also reported that the yield number of fruits and fruit weight were lower under the non irrigated treatment than those under the drip and sprinkler irrigation treatments in this experiment the yield was 2062 kg ha 1 for drip irrigation treatment 1831 kg ha 1 for sprinkler irrigation treatments and 1113 kg ha 1 for rain fed orchards in addition the yield for raspberries under a drip irrigation system was statistically similar to that under a sprinkler irrigation system in poland cold and temperate climate rolbiecki et al 2002 found that the marketable yields were 10 2070 and 2520 kg ha 1 while the wps were 0 004 0 63 and 0 97 kg m

significant differences between non irrigated raspberry plants and those irrigated at 100 etc for the ss but the total acidity was higher under the well watered treatment information regarding the irrigation scheduling strategies for furrow irrigated raspberry orchards growing under mediterranean type climate conditions is still scarce thus an evaluation of the effects of different irrigation levels on yield fruit quality and wp is needed to adapt raspberry production to water scarcity in mediterranean type climate areas in addition the plant water status associated with different irrigation levels is required to assess the optimum irrigation scheduling based on the soil plant climate interactions ortega farias and intrigliolo 2021 wu et al 2021 in this context this study aims to evaluate the effects of four irrigation regimes on yield fruit quality and wp for a furrow irrigated red raspberry heritage orchard growing in mediterranean semiarid climate conditions in addition the effects of irrigation treatments on the ψstem and wsi values were included as additional information 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the irrigation experiment 3 3 ha was carried out

seasons the plants were established in a furrow irrigated orchard in 0 8 m wide beds with north to south furrow directions red raspberry plants were planted at 33 rows per hectare 100 m long each at a density between 5 and 8 canes per m2 effective cultivation surface of 2640 m2 ha 1 the climate at the study site is warm temperate with an average monthly temperature of 7 8 c during winter and 18 7 c during summer santibañez et al 2017 the annual precipitation is 1137 mm and is mainly concentrated from may to august the cumulative annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is approximately 1108 mm with the maximum values observed during january lópez olivari et al 2016 this condition usually leads to significant decreases in water availability during the summer months the soil at the experimental site is classified as a colbún series mollisol family ultic argixerolls with a clay loam texture e g 26 sand 45 silt and 29 clay 3 plant measurements measurements of the midday stem water potential ψstem were obtained from fruit set to 15 days after harvest e g december to march each season the ψstem measurements were conducted once a week on individual leaves at solar noon e g between 12 00 and 14 00 h by using a pressure chamber pms instrument co model 600 corvallis or usa these measurements were only performed before each irrigation the leaves were wrapped with plastic transparent film and aluminum foil one hour before the measurements to describe the cumulative effects of the irrigation level treatments the water stress integral wsi was calculated as follows zuñiga

measured during the season and n is the number of days in each time interval the values of c were 0 40 and 0 45 mpa for the 2012 13 and 2013 14 growing seasons respectively for this study budburst and harvest occurred on september 25 2012 and march 29 2013 for the 2012 13 growing season while those occurred on september 16 2013 and april 06 2014 for the 2013 14 season respectively 4 irrigation water management at the experimental site the irrigation water was conveyed distributed and delivered using flexible plastic pipes commonly called polypipes a 32 mm diameter pvc tube was inserted into the flexible plastic pipe for uniform water distribution in each furrow fig 1 the irrigation frequency if was determined when the sum of the daily etc was approximately equal to the readily available soil water raw the etc was obtained by multiplying the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 by single crop coefficients kc et0 was determined using the penman monteith method which uses solar radiation rs temperature ta relative humidity rh and wind speed ws as the input variables the daily values for the rainfall r ta rh rs and ws were recorded by an automatic weather station aws that was installed above a grass reference crop located 1 2 km from the study area in addition the effective daily rainfall er mm day 1 values were computed as follows goodwin and victoria 1995 2 er r 10 0 75 where r is the rainfall mm day 1 the irrigation times tr min were empirically determined as follows kostiakov 1932 3 tr raw c 1 b where c and b are the empirical coefficients obtained using the furrow infiltrometer method holzapfel et al 2004 c and b were 0 750 and 0 839 respectively the readily available soil water raw mm values were calculated to estimate the water applications using the following expressions 4 taw w fc w wp 100 d a d w p r 5 raw p taw where taw is the total available soil water mm w fc and w wp are the gravimetric soil water contents at the field capacity and

2014 during the second season also crop coefficients kc for red raspberries jerez et al 1994 and reference evapotranspiration eto for both seasons are indicated in table 1 4 1 irrigation water treatments the irrigation treatments with four repetitions each were 125 t1 100 t2 75 t3 and 50 t4 of etc t1 corresponded to the standard irrigation management that has been applied by raspberry farmers in the region each experimental unit consisted of a 0 96 m2 plot with dimensions of 1 2 m 0 8 m rows of red raspberry plants guarded the trial to avoid edge effects the furrows were blocked at the end of the field to prevent surface runoff which is a common practice in this area the total water application for each treatment and growing season is shown in table 2 4 2 yield components water productivity and fruit quality during the first and second seasons the fruits were harvested from december 26 2012 to march 29 2013 33 harvests and from december 12 to may 5 2014 22 harvests respectively for each harvest and for each experimental unit 0 96 m2 plot the fruits were counted and weighed to estimate the total yield y kg m 2 number of fruits per m2 fm2 and fruit weight fw g fruit 1 according to funt and hall 2013 the average fw2 values were determined by counting and weighing a random sample of 30 fruits from each experimental unit the raspberry water productivity wp kg

the data means of all the measured variables and parameters were compared at p 0 05 using tukey s studentized range test hsd the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 18 0 software spss inc chicago illinois usa furthermore a principal component analysis pca was carried out on all databases in which the values were standardized on a per field basis before the pca was performed this analysis was performed using matlab r2019a mathworks inc natick ma usa 5 results 5 1 irrigation scheduling and climatic variables the daily ta values ranged between 0 1 and 33 6 c and 1 8 and 34 6 c for the first and second seasons respectively fig 2 in this study six events with ta 0 c were observed from september 17 30 2013 which coincided with the budburst period fig 2 the precipitation values were 252 and 122 mm while those of et0 were 772 and 849 mm for the 2012 13 and 2013 14 growing seasons respectively fig 2 for these growing seasons the maximum atmospheric demand was observed in january with monthly et0 levels ranging between 155 and 173 mm month 1 in addition the precipitation amounts were 222 and 43 4 mm for 2012 and 2013 during october and december spring season respectively fig 2 these rainfall differences reduced the soil water availability during the second season and water applications were increased especially during the flowering and ripening periods table 2 the total water applications for the raspberry orchard irrigated at 100 75 and 50 etc were between 10 and 11 19 36 and 48 54 lower than those at 125 etc 5 2 midday stem water potential and water stress integral at the beginning of the experiment there were no significant differences among the treatments for ψstem with values 0 93 mpa for the two growing seasons significant differences among the irrigation treatments appeared during the first week of december in the 2012 13 season and last week of december in the 2013 14 season fig 3 for the water stressed plants 50 etc the ψstem values decreased from the second week of december until reaching values of 1 45 mpa on doy 39 2013 and 1 15 mpa on doy 2 2014 for the first and second seasons respectively additionally the ψstem values were less than 1 0 mpa from doy 17 42 in 2013 and from doy 02 27 in 2014 after that the ψstem values increased with values greater than 0 86 mpa during march in both seasons when the cumulative et0 values were less than 104 mm month 1 for the plants watered at 75 125 and 100 etc the ψstem values were greater than 1 0 mpa during both seasons except for the 75 etc from doy 30 46 2013 which presented values ranging from 1 05 to 1 15 mpa the average ψstem values for the plants irrigated at 125 and 100 etc were between 0 90 and 0 89 mpa while those at 75 ranged between 0 99 and 0 85 mpa for both growing seasons the water stress integral wsi was influenced by the irrigation treatments growing seasons and the interactions between both factors fig 4 table 3 fig 5 indicates that the significant differences among treatments for wsi started from doy 340 2012 and doy 5 2014 for the first and second seasons respectively and persisted until the end of the experiment table 3 indicates that there were significant effects due to the irrigation treatments on the wsi with the highest and lowest values for those plants watered at 50 and 125 etc respectively however there were no significant differences between the t1 and t2 treatments for the wsi with values ranging between 46 4 and 48 9 mpaday in addition the wsi values suggested that the level of raspberry water stress was greater during the first growing season than during the second growing season the average wsi values for the t1 and t4 treatments were 53 6 and 75 5 mpa day in 2012 13 while they were 39 2 and 56 1 mpa day in 2013 14 respectively 5 3 yield component water productivity and fruit quality except for the fw there were significant effects due to the irrigation treatments on the y fm2 and wp table 3 higher y and fm2 values were observed in those plants irrigated at 75 etc with values of 9 25 kg m 2 and 4691 fruits m 2 respectively the yields of plants watered at 75 etc were 20 7 and 10 higher than those of plants irrigated at 125 100 and 50 etc respectively the lowest yields were observed in plants watered at 50 and 125 etc with values ranging between 7 37 and 8 63 kg m 2 also fig 6 indicates that there were significant differences among treatments for the cumulative y from doy 59 to harvest in the first growing season the highest and lowest y were observed for plants watered at 75 and 125 etc respectively but no significant differences were detected in the second growing season significant differences among treatments for wp were observed with values of 7 27 and 3 19 kg m 3 for the plants watered at 50 and 125 etc respectively in addition the y fm2 fw and wp values were 26 24 3 and 41 respectively higher during the first season than those during the second season regarding the fruit quality the irrigation treatments were only significant for the ta with the lowest values observed in plants at 125 etc table 4 in addition there were significant effects of the growing season on the ta and ss values in this case the ss was lower in 2012 13 than that in 2013 14 but the ta was higher in the first season the principal component analysis results indicated that two principal components e g pc 1 and pc 2 explained 75 of the overall variability in the data e g 62 and 13 for pc 1 and pc 2 respectively fig 7 pc 1 was highly correlated with y ta and ss and moderately correlated with fw wp fm2 and wsi while pc 2 was most strongly correlated with wv the ss was inversely associated with y and ta and was characterized by the low water stress treatment 125 etc y and ta were highly correlated with each other but higher y values were more strongly associated with a moderate water stress treatment 75 etc this analysis also revealed that higher values of wsi and wp were more strongly associated with the high water stress treatment 50 etc 6 discussion the atmospheric water demand was similar in both seasons with maximum et0 values occurring during january however the rainfall during spring in 2012 october and december was greater than that in 2013 this rainfall pattern delayed the effects of the irrigation treatments on the ψstem values and decreased the water application in the first season in comparison with the second season under these atmospheric conditions ψstem values 1 0 mpa were maintained for the plants that were irrigated at 125 and 100 etc during both growing seasons the ψstem values for the plants that were irrigated at 75 and 50 etc ranged between 0 48 and 1 15 mpa and between 0 50 and 1 45 mpa respectively although knowledge of the ψstem thresholds for raspberry is still scarce several studies have indicated that ψstem values 1 0 mpa are commonly found for well irrigated small fruits such as blueberries estrada 2015 and lobos et al 2018 recommended that ψstem thresholds 1 0 mpa can be used to prevent water stress and avoid important reductions in yield and quality in blueberry orchards bryla and strik 2007 and mingeau et al 2001 for well irrigated highbush blueberries reported that the ψstem values ranged between 0 5 and 0 4 mpa at the end of spring and between 1 6 to 1 4 mpa at harvest ortega farias et al 2021 for a drip irrigated blueberry orchard indicated that the ψstem values were 0 85 0 86 0 97 and 1 11 mpa for the 125 100 75 and 50 etc treatments respectively the water stress integral indicated that the plant water stress was greater in the first season than during the second season although a rainy spring occurred in 2012 this wsi difference between the seasons was associated with a reduction in water availability for irrigation during the period between doy 17 39 2013 which coincided with the maximum atmospheric demand for water vapor under these conditions the plants irrigated at 50 etc were under high water stress ψstem between 1 20 and 1 45 mpa while those at the 100 and 125 etc levels were under moderate to mild water stress ψstem 0 9 mpa for the plants in the 75 etc treatment the ψstem values ranged between 0 80 and 1 15 mpa which suggested that these plants were under moderate water stress during late january and early february 2013 the results indicated that the average y fm2 and fw values were significantly greater in 2012 13 than those in 2013 2014 although the plants growing during the first season exhibited higher cumulative water stress than those growing during the second season this difference in yield components was associated with six frost events e g ta 1 0 0c that occurred during the budbreak period e g between september 17 and 30 in 2013 additionally over and underirrigation of the raspberry orchard decreased the y and fm2 values in this regard the maximum yield was obtained from plants irrigated at 75 etc which had ψstem

plants at 75 etc were 11 and 25 higher than those at 50 and 125 etc respectively although there is no available information about the effect of overwatering on raspberry root growth the abovementioned results evidence that the 125 etc treatment or small scale farmers regular irrigation practice overwetted the soil profile this situation probably created environmental conditions favorable for the development of fungal diseases that damaged the root system which in turn caused a reduction in plant yield bryla and linderman 2007 and bryla et al 2011 for blueberries irrigated at 150 etc reported that the presence of phytophthora cinnamomi and pythium cinnamomi reduced plant yields and berry weights on the other hand water application at 50 etc exhibited high water productivity and water savings but significantly increased the raspberry water stress water stress induces stomatal closure and diminishes co2 assimilation which in turn reduces yield bryla and strik 2007 lobos et al 2018

irrigation treatments famiani et al 2015 and prange and deell 1997 indicated that the effect of soil water availability on acids and sugar compounds is complex because of the interactions among the cultivar climate and growth period when water stress was applied lobos et al 2016 2018 found the highest levels of ta as a percentage of citric acid in highbush blueberries that were irrigated at 100

and ortega farias et al 2021 reported that blueberry plants irrigated at 50 etc exhibited the highest ss values in the maule region raspberry farmers often apply excessive irrigation water during growing seasons because they do not use calibrated values of kc to schedule water application in this study the total water applications at 100 and 75 etc were between 10 and 11 and 19 36 lower than those at 125 etc farmer irrigation management in this regard water application at 75 etc associated with ψstem close to 1 0 mpa could be a suitable irrigation management strategy for furrow irrigated red raspberry orchards growing in mediterranean climate conditions however future research is required to evaluate the effect of soil plant water interactions and irrigation systems on plant water

7067 5838 kg ha 1 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 chile is seventh among the main raspberry producers worldwide with 3888 ha of harvested surface area which yields an average of approximately 4100 kg ha 1 in addition this country leads in the export of frozen raspberries from the southern hemisphere food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 the chilean raspberry production is mainly concentrated on small farms whose surface areas are less than 0 75 ha and are predominantly irrigated by furrow irrigation systems morales et al 2017 the chilean raspberry orchards are located in mediterranean type climate regions where a mega drought has significantly decreased rainfall and water availability for irrigation since 2010 garreaud et al 2020 in addition the raspberry farmers do not use adequately irrigation technologies to schedule water application which has been the main limitation for improving yield and water productivity jara rojas et al 2018 for future water scarcity scenarios furrow irrigated raspberry orchards require the development of irrigation management strategies to increase water productivity wp and reduce water applications without decreasing yield and quality raspberries have a shallow root system that requires a regular water supply from fruit set to harvest based on soil plant climate interactions morales et al 2013 however the available information on the yield quality and wp responses of raspberries to different irrigation regimes is still limited and most of the studies on small fruits have been conducted in blueberry orchards in this regard bryla et al 2011 reported that the yields and berry weights were greater for highbush blueberry plants irrigated at 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc

significant differences between non irrigated raspberry plants and those irrigated at 100 etc for the ss but the total acidity was higher under the well watered treatment information regarding the irrigation scheduling strategies for furrow irrigated raspberry orchards growing under mediterranean type climate conditions is still scarce thus an evaluation of the effects of different irrigation levels on yield fruit quality and wp is needed to adapt raspberry production to water scarcity in mediterranean type climate areas in addition the plant water status associated with different

6 c for the first and second seasons respectively fig 2 in this study six events with ta 0 c were observed from september 17 30 2013 which coincided with the budburst period fig 2 the precipitation values were 252 and 122 mm while those of et0 were 772 and 849 mm for the 2012 13 and 2013 14 growing seasons respectively fig 2 for these growing seasons the maximum atmospheric demand was observed in january with monthly et0 levels ranging between 155 and 173 mm month 1 in addition the precipitation amounts were 222 and 43 4 mm for 2012 and 2013 during october and december spring season respectively fig 2 these rainfall differences reduced the soil water availability during the second season and water applications were increased especially during the flowering and ripening periods table 2 the total water applications for the raspberry orchard irrigated at 100 75 and 50 etc were between 10 and 11 19 36 and 48 54 lower than those at 125 etc 5 2 midday stem water potential and water stress integral at the beginning of the experiment there were no significant differences among the treatments for ψstem with values 0 93 mpa for the two growing seasons significant differences among the irrigation treatments appeared during the first week of december in the 2012 13 season and last week of december in the 2013 14 season fig 3 for the water stressed plants 50 etc the ψstem values decreased from the second week of december until reaching values of 1 45 mpa on doy 39 2013 and 1 15 mpa on doy 2 2014 for the first and second seasons respectively additionally the ψstem values were less than 1 0 mpa from doy 17 42 in 2013 and from doy 02 27 in 2014 after that the ψstem values increased with values greater than 0 86 mpa during march in both seasons when the cumulative et0 values were less than 104 mm month 1 for the plants watered at 75 125 and 100 etc the ψstem values were greater than 1 0 mpa during both seasons except for the 75 etc from doy 30 46 2013 which presented values ranging from 1 05 to 1 15 mpa the average ψstem values for the plants irrigated at 125 and 100 etc were between 0 90 and 0 89 mpa while those at 75 ranged between 0 99 and 0 85 mpa for both growing seasons the water stress integral wsi was influenced by the irrigation treatments growing seasons and the interactions between both factors fig 4 table 3 fig 5 indicates that the significant differences among treatments for wsi started from doy 340 2012 and doy 5 2014 for the first and second seasons respectively and persisted until the end of the experiment table 3 indicates that there were significant effects due to the irrigation treatments on the wsi with the highest and lowest values for those plants watered at 50 and 125 etc respectively however there were no significant differences between the t1 and t2 treatments for the wsi with values ranging between 46 4 and 48 9 mpaday in addition the wsi values suggested that the level of raspberry water stress was greater during the first growing season than during the second growing season the average wsi values for the t1 and t4 treatments were 53 6 and 75 5 mpa day in 2012 13 while they were 39 2 and 56 1 mpa day in 2013 14 respectively 5 3 yield component water productivity and fruit quality except for the fw there were significant effects due to the irrigation treatments on the y fm2 and wp table 3 higher y and fm2 values were observed in those plants irrigated at 75 etc with values of 9 25 kg m 2 and 4691 fruits m 2 respectively the yields of plants watered at 75 etc were 20 7 and 10 higher than those of plants irrigated at 125 100 and 50 etc respectively the lowest yields were observed in plants watered at 50 and 125 etc with values ranging between 7 37 and 8 63 kg m 2 also fig 6 indicates that there were significant differences among treatments for the cumulative y from doy 59 to harvest in the first growing season the highest and lowest y were observed for plants watered at 75 and 125 etc respectively but no significant differences were detected in the second growing season significant differences among treatments for wp were observed with values of 7 27 and 3 19 kg m 3 for the plants watered at 50 and 125 etc respectively in addition the y fm2 fw and wp values were 26 24 3 and 41 respectively higher during the first season than those during the second season regarding the fruit quality the irrigation treatments were only significant for the ta with the lowest values observed in plants at 125 etc table 4 in addition there were significant effects of the growing season on the ta and ss values in this case the ss was lower in 2012 13 than that in 2013 14 but the ta was higher in the first season the principal component analysis results indicated that two principal components e g pc 1 and pc 2 explained 75 of the overall variability in the data e g 62 and 13 for pc 1 and pc 2 respectively fig 7 pc 1 was highly correlated with y ta and ss and moderately correlated with fw wp fm2 and wsi while pc 2 was most strongly correlated with wv the ss was inversely associated with y and ta and was characterized by the low water stress treatment 125 etc y and ta were highly correlated with each other but higher y values were more strongly associated with a moderate water stress treatment 75 etc this analysis also revealed that higher values of wsi and wp were more strongly associated with the high water stress treatment 50 etc 6 discussion the atmospheric water demand was similar in both seasons with maximum et0 values occurring during january however the rainfall during spring in 2012 october and december was greater than that in 2013 this rainfall pattern delayed the effects of the irrigation treatments on the ψstem values and decreased the water application in the first season in comparison with the second season under these atmospheric conditions ψstem values 1 0 mpa were maintained for the plants that were irrigated at 125 and 100 etc during both growing seasons the ψstem values for the plants that were irrigated at 75 and 50 etc ranged between 0 48 and 1 15 mpa and between 0 50 and 1 45 mpa respectively although knowledge of the ψstem thresholds for raspberry is still scarce several studies have indicated that ψstem values 1 0 mpa are commonly found for well irrigated small fruits such as blueberries estrada 2015 and lobos et al 2018 recommended that ψstem thresholds 1 0 mpa can be used to prevent water stress and avoid important reductions in yield and quality in blueberry orchards bryla and strik 2007 and mingeau et al 2001 for well irrigated highbush blueberries reported that the ψstem values ranged between 0 5 and 0 4 mpa at the end of spring and between 1 6 to 1 4 mpa at harvest ortega farias et al 2021 for a drip irrigated blueberry orchard indicated that the ψstem values were 0 85 0 86 0 97 and 1 11 mpa for the 125 100 75 and 50 etc treatments respectively the water stress integral indicated that the plant water stress was greater in the first season than during the second season although a rainy spring occurred in 2012 this wsi difference between the seasons was associated with a reduction in water availability for irrigation during the period between doy 17 39 2013 which coincided with the maximum atmospheric demand for water vapor under these conditions the plants irrigated at 50 etc were under high water stress ψstem between 1 20 and 1 45 mpa while those at the 100 and 125 etc levels were under moderate to mild water stress ψstem 0 9 mpa for the plants in the 75 etc treatment the ψstem values ranged between 0 80 and 1 15 mpa which suggested that these plants were under moderate water stress during late january and early february 2013 the results indicated that the average y fm2 and fw values were significantly greater in 2012 13 than those in 2013 2014 although the plants growing during the first season exhibited higher cumulative water stress than those growing during the second season this difference in yield components was associated with six frost events e g ta 1 0 0c that occurred during the budbreak period e g between september 17 and 30 in 2013 additionally over and underirrigation of the raspberry orchard decreased the y and fm2 values in this regard the maximum yield was obtained from plants irrigated at 75 etc which had ψstem values 1 15 mpa throughout the two growing seasons the minimum yield was observed for plants irrigated at 125 etc overirrigation which presented the lowest wp and wsi values the total fruit yields in plants at 75 etc were 11 and 25 higher than those at 50 and 125 etc respectively although there is no available information about the effect of overwatering on raspberry root growth the abovementioned results evidence that the 125 etc treatment or small scale farmers regular irrigation practice overwetted the soil profile this situation probably created environmental conditions favorable for the development of fungal diseases that damaged the root system which in turn caused a reduction in plant yield bryla and linderman 2007 and bryla et al 2011 for blueberries irrigated at 150 etc reported that the presence of phytophthora cinnamomi and pythium cinnamomi reduced plant yields and berry weights on the other hand water application at 50 etc exhibited high water productivity and water savings but significantly increased the raspberry water stress water stress induces stomatal closure and diminishes co2 assimilation which in turn reduces yield bryla and strik 2007 lobos et al 2018 reported that 50 etc treatments average ψstem 0 90 mpa reduced the net assimilation vegetative growth and fruit quality e g berry size titratable acidity soluble solids and weight while blueberry plants watered at 75 etc average ψstem 0 93 mpa produced similar fruit yields and quality e g firmness fruit size titratable acidity soluble solids and berry weight but with higher wps than those at 100 etc average ψstem 1 02 mpa finally this study indicated that the ta levels increased as the amounts of water applications were reduced whereas the ss and wv remained unaffected for the different irrigation treatments famiani et al 2015 and prange and deell 1997 indicated that the effect of soil water availability on acids and sugar compounds is complex because of the interactions among the cultivar climate and growth period when water stress was applied lobos et al 2016 2018 found the highest levels of ta as a percentage of citric acid in highbush blueberries that were irrigated at 100 etc for lowbush blueberries glass et al 2005 reported that drought stressed plants exhibited similar ss values compared to rainfed plants but higher ss values than irrigated plants lobos et al 2018 and ortega farias et al 2021 reported that blueberry plants irrigated at 50 etc exhibited the highest ss values in the maule region raspberry farmers often apply excessive irrigation water during growing seasons because they do not use calibrated values of kc to schedule water application in this study the total water applications at 100 and 75 etc were between 10 and 11 and 19 36 lower than those at 125 etc farmer irrigation management in this regard water application at 75 etc associated with ψstem close to 1 0 mpa could be a suitable irrigation management strategy for furrow irrigated red raspberry orchards growing in mediterranean climate conditions however future research is required to evaluate the effect of soil plant water interactions and irrigation systems on plant water status gas exchange and yield of raspberry orchards in addition threshold values of ψstem for maintaining raspberry orchards well watered during the growing season are needed to optimize wp yield and quality 7 conclusion for the furrow irrigated red raspberry orchard this study corroborated the negative effects of under and overirrigation on yields the lowest yields were observed in plants that were irrigated at 50 and 125 etc while the highest yields were found in plants that were watered at 75 etc the severe deficit 50 etc treatment exhibited the highest water productivity but the lowest yield in comparison to the 75 and 100 etc treatments water application using 75 etc associated with ψstem values close to 1 0 mpa seems to be an appropriate irrigation management strategy for furrow

prototypes were more resistant to clogging and did not clog during the experiments once added to the water the ssp functioned as an effective competitor of caco3 nucleation and growth sites thus heterogeneous nucleation started occurring preferably on the ssp surface reducing the fouling in the labyrinth walls the prototypes that clogged in the tests in the absence of ssp were resistant to clogging in the ssp concentration of 500 mg l 1 the presence of ssp changed the crystal habit of caco3 and it precipitated in the form of calcite the nucleation of caco3 directly on the ssp surface is

puig bargués et al 2010 partial or total clogging of drippers is closely related to irrigation water quality and occurs as a result of physical biological and chemical agents present in irrigation water gilbert et al 1981 goyal et al 2016 şahin et al 2005 in most cases dripper clogging does not occur due to the individual action of these agents but is the result of the interaction between them causing partial or total reduction of the discharge li et al 2019b ramachandrula and kasa 2020 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 water filtration is essential in drip irrigation systems however due to practical and economic limitations this technique only removes suspended solids larger than a nominal filtration grade duran ros et al 2009 oliveira et al 2020 puig bargués and lamm 2013 particles of lower size pass through the filters and reach other components of the irrigation system and may also interact with substances in the water by processes of precipitation co precipitation adsorption desorption flocculation ion exchange among others which makes understanding the clogging process more challenging deslouis et al 2006 liu et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in several regions of brazil and the world using groundwater in irrigation systems is a common practice in many of these regions water has an alkaline ph and high concentrations of calcium magnesium carbonate and bicarbonate ions gomes et al 2017 muniz et al 2020 under supersaturation conditions chemical precipitates of calcium carbonate caco3 and or magnesium carbonate mgco3 will form caco3 is one of the most common salts found in the labyrinths of clogged emitters in dripper irrigation systems green et al 2018 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 deposits are formed when the solution is supersaturated by calcium and carbonate ions eq 1 or bicarbonate ion eq 2 stumm and morgan 1996 1 ca aq 2 co 3 aq 2 caco 3 s 2 ca aq 2 2hco 3 aq caco 3 s co 2 aq h 2 o l caco3 fouling formation comprises nucleation followed by crystal growth the first initiates the formation of the crystal while the latter is responsible for increasing its size the precipitate can form either in the solution or directly on the walls of the system additionally crystals that grow in the solution can later deposit on the walls the presence of dispersed particles in the saturated solution interferes with the precipitation of caco3 deslouis et al 2006 hui et al 2004 karoui et al 2010 therefore investigating caco3 crystallization mechanisms in the presence of suspended solid particles ssp is important while understanding fouling processes investigations on the fouling mechanisms and characteristics of the caco3 precipitates in waters containing small size ssp 125 µm i e fine sand silt and clay are scarce in the literature most dripper clogging studies focus on studying cause and effect relationships which limits the understanding of clogging processes and the search for improvement of possible solutions to the problem zhangzhong et al 2019 evaluated the occurrence of chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems by applying saline water and determined the amount and chemical characteristics of chemical fouling the results showed a direct impact of the type of emitter and salinity of the water on the growth of the crystals calcium magnesium carbonates were the main clogging materials found in labyrinths accounting for 63 3 91 1 of the total deposited content zhangzhong et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 evaluated the rate of chemical clogging of emitters in a drip irrigation system using pisciculture effluent the results showed that the material accumulated in the emitters consisted of both organic matter and minerals the main one being calcium carbonate which reflects a possible interaction of these factors in the cause of clogging maroufpoor et al 2020 investigated interactions between biofilm and solid particles present in water these authors observed that the clogging of emitters is more severe when microbiological activity is intense with release of extracellular polymeric substances which function as an adhesive for solid and precipitated particles of caco3 and mgco3 intensifying the fouling surface waters used in irrigation systems often have a high ssp concentration mainly of small granulometry which go through filtration systems and interact with chemicals present in water and may aggravate or attenuate the clogging processes thus studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of interaction between ssp solution and caco3 crystals in the nucleation growth and fouling processes of these crystals inside dripper labyrinths this study aimed to investigate the formation and fouling processes of caco3 inside dripper labyrinths in waters with different hardness values and ssp concentrations prototype drippers were evaluated for clogging resistance and caco3 fouling patterns in the presence and absence of ssp changes in caco3 morphology and mineralogy in the presence of ssp were investigated and discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 labyrinth prototypes eleven flat non pressure compensating prototypes of drippers with trapezoidal labyrinths and rectangular flow section were used in this study the prototypes were designed and built in a previous study lavanholi et al 2020 and the labyrinth design strategies were linked to the fundamentals of clogging processes found in commercial emitters two models of dripper prototypes model a and model b were studied in both models the labyrinths were designed to provide discharges close to 1 4 l h 1 operating at 100 kpa of pressure and these values were defined to reproduce the usual practical conditions model a fig 1a emitters have developed vortices of distinct magnitudes as a function of the geometric characteristics of the labyrinth model b fig 1b emitters feature geometry and flow characteristics that provide uniform flow throughout the channel section and undeveloped vortices table 1 shows the characteristics of the studied prototypes the prototypes were manufactured in polymethyl methacrylate pmma plates with a thickness of 2 mm and length and width varied according to the dimensions of the labyrinth the plates with the engraved labyrinths were mounted on a polypropylene accessory fig 2 allowing the prototype to operate similarly to commercial drippers the accessories are equipped with screws for fixing on the test bench and screws for fixing a translucent 8 mm thick glass plate which allows the acquisition of images of the interior of the labyrinth the accessories have a main flow channel with an internal diameter of 10 mm and are connected to each other by means of a brass coupling sealed with an o ring thus simulating an irrigation lateral each accessory had a coupling cavity for the dripper prototype the cavity consisted of a level surface 15 mm wide and 120 mm long in the cavity a 2 mm thick silicone rubber was installed between the pmma plate and the polypropylene surface to prevent water leakage a 3 mm diameter hole allowed water to flow from the main flow channel into the labyrinth the prototypes were randomly placed on the bench considering the purposes of the research only one prototype of each model was manufactured and studied 2 2 test bench the bench used in the tests consisted of a hydraulically closed circuit fig 3 equipped with a system for heating water electrical resistance of 2 kw in a water bath and a cooling system with a condenser unit of 14 77 mj a temperature sensor was installed in the bench circuit for monitoring and control of the water temperature the devices to control the water temperature were mounted in a water bath to prevent the water used in the tests from coming into contact with these components and fouling them an aluminum reservoir with a capacity of 140 l was submerged in a plastic water tank of 250 l chemical and ssp solutions were dosed in the internal reservoir a propeller stirrer was used to keep the ssp in suspension and the rod and propeller were made of stainless steel to avoid oxidation and contamination of the mixture a pump with an impeller and housing in stainless steel was used to pump the mixture to a polyethylene tube connected to the main flow line the flow velocity on the line was approximately 1 m s 1 and was controlled by a nozzle installed at the end of the line a continuous injection system of solution was used to maintain constant calcium and bicarbonate concentrations throughout the assays two reservoirs with sodium bicarbonate stock solution nahco3 dinâmica brazil 0 32 m and calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2 h2o dinâmica brazil 0 16 m were coupled to the bench and two peristaltic pumps were responsible for pumping the stock solutions to the inner reservoir the supports with the labyrinth prototypes were installed above a gutter responsible for collecting the water drained from the prototypes and conveying it into the reservoir a sieve of 150 µm aperture size was installed at the end of the gutter to retain contaminants to acquire images of the interior of the labyrinths throughout the tests a stereoscope microscope coupled to a high resolution camera xcam1080pha series hdmi and full hd screen was used installed on a mobile stand with displacement on the x z axes and fine tuning in y the prototypes were randomly placed on the bench all emitters were mounted along a straight line free of barbs of only 1 6 m in length in such a small length head loss along the line is negligible preferential flow paths and trends of clogging related to the position of the prototype are not expected to occur 2 3 study water synthetic water with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 and ph in the range of 8 0 8 3 was used in the assays the water temperature was maintained at 23 c 2 c in all tests iso 9261 2004 hardness values were obtained by adding purely analytical reagents cacl2 2 h2o and nahco3 in deionized water 0 05 ms cm 1 morais et al 2020 zhi and zhang 2014 zhu et al 2019 the physical chemical characteristics of the water table 2 were determined at the beginning of each test following methodologies presented in apha 2017 the ph and electrical conductivity were measured using a ph meter dm 22 digimed and a conductivity sensor dm 22 digimed respectively and the temperature was measured using a pt100 temperature sensor 0 5 ºc the addition of ssp to the water did not cause changes in the values of the parameters presented thus these same initial conditions were maintained in all tests performed at the same hardness value 2 4 suspended solid particles ssp the ssp used in the experiments consisted of a mixture of fine sand silt and clay particle size 125 µm obtained from a natural soil sample classified as a distroferric red latosol santos et al 2013 the natural soil has 49 1 clay 23 7 silt and 27 2 sand the ssp were characterized regarding the main chemical characteristics of interest and x ray diffraction was used to identify the constituent mineral fractions an x pert mpd x ray diffractometer philips analytical x ray was used in the following configurations kαcu radiation 1 54 å 40 kv 40 ma with 2θ ranging from 0 to 50 angular step of 0 02 and counting time of 1 s per step the supplementary information shows the results of the chemical characterization and the soil diffractogram table s1 and fig s1 respectively the xrd analysis revealed the following mineral fractions kaolinite 35 6 quartz 22 5 hematite 22 2 gypsum 19 8 and goethite 0 5 note that almost 80 of the particles used are predominantly type 1 1 clays whose surface charges at the ph value of the test conditions are predominantly negative revealed by the point of zero charge pzc equal to 6 51 2 5 testing conditions and routines two concentrations of ssp were studied 125 and 500 mg l 1 in waters with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 resulting in six test conditions waters with suspended solids concentrations above 100 mg l 1 offer a high risk of dripper clogging nakayama and bucks 1981 and waters with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 offer moderate and severe risk of dripper obstruction respectively goyal et al 2016 to determine the risk of precipitation of caco3 considering only the hardness value of the water is insufficient alkalinity ph value temperature and concentration of dissolved solids in the water are also important parameters these variables can be combined into a single saturation index and the most commonly used index is the langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 the lsi was used in this study to determine the risk of caco3 precipitation in each condition the lsi has been used in different areas in precipitation studies ghobadi nia et al 2010 sheikholeslami 2005 van der bruggen et al 2009 and the supplementary information shows its equations eq s1 to eq s7 table 3 shows the test conditions to obtain the hardness values in the water stoichiometric calculations were performed considering the reaction of caco3 formation from the reagents used eq 3 3 cacl 2 2 h 2 o 2 nahco 3 caco 3 2 nacl 2 h 2 o co 2 the masses of each reagent were weighed on a high precision analytical scale atx224 shimadzu resolution 0 1 mg and dissolved in deionized water in the test reservoir after starting the motor pump and past the induction time that is the period necessary for the formation of the first caco3 clusters the precipitation process becomes continuous which implies a decrease in the concentration of the reagents in the reservoir thus to keep the concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate steady the continuous injection system of nahco3 0 32 m and cacl2 2 h2o 0 16 m solutions was activated the injection flow was determined according to the decay rate τ of calcium and bicarbonate concentrations at the beginning of each cycle the water hardness was adjusted to the target value and the tests were started without the injection of the reagents after a preestablished period calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined by collecting sample aliquots at the exit of the return gutter obtaining by difference τ of each analyte as a function of time eq 4 calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined by titration filtering the sample in cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 µm 4 τ x 0 x t t where τ is the ionic decay rate mg l 1 h 1 x 0 is the initial concentration of ca2 or hco 3 mg l 1 in the reservoir x t is the concentration of ca2 or hco 3 in the reservoir after a period t mg l 1 and t is the time between readings h the procedure was repeated until a constant τ value was obtained after obtaining τ the discharge of the injector pumps was adjusted so that the concentrations of the analytes in the reservoir remained close to the initial value calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined every 2 h when necessary the flow of the injection pumps was adjusted to obtain the desired concentrations in addition to calcium and bicarbonate concentrations total hardness total alkalinity ph electrical conductivity and temperature were continuously analyzed to monitor the test conditions the tests were performed in 12 h cycles with the system operating for 10 h and idle for 2 h each condition lasted 20 cycles totaling 200 h of operation 10 days the discharge of drippers was measured every two cycles by water mass determination and at each measurement images were acquired from the labyrinths during the tests the system pressure was kept at 100 kpa the curve of ph versus time was obtained and provides relevant information describing the behavior of the system according to the applied conditions menzri et al 2017 reis et al 2018 sousa et al 2016 in this study the curves were constructed to help clarify the influence of ssp on caco3 precipitation 2 6 prototype performance three main aspects were used to evaluate the effect of the different water quality conditions on the performance of the prototypes 1 discharge variation rate dra evaluation of the ratio between the current and initial discharge of each dripper 2 fouling patterns evaluation of the sites of deposition and accumulation of sediments precipitates inside the labyrinth by images and 3 fouling mass measurement of the mass fouling each labyrinth at the end of each test regarding the quantitative aspect the prototype models with dra below 75 were considered clogged pereira et al 2020 wei et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 the dra was calculated according to pereira et al 2020 eq 5 5 dra 100 q i q 0 where dra is the ratio between the current and initial discharge of the emitter q i is the current discharge of the emitter l h 1 and q 0 is the initial discharge of the emitter operating with clean water l h 1 to assess whether the fouling mass has a relationship with the geometric parameters of the labyrinth a cluster analysis of the prototypes using the hierarchical method was performed interconnecting the samples by their associations producing a dendrogram where the prototypes of similar drippers were grouped together according to the fouling mass in the labyrinth the ward connection method and the euclidean distance were used for similarity measurements ward 1963 the statistica 10 software was used to create the dendrogram 2 7 analysis of the clogging material the material deposited inside the labyrinth of the emitters was collected for imaging under a scanning electron microscope sem to verify changes in the morphological behavior of caco3 in the presence of ssp the particulate matter was spread over a carbon tape in a metal stub and then the samples were metallized with au s and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope jeol sm 5800lv with an image capture system semafore 5 21 operating at 15 kv the determination of the crystal phases of the precipitate was obtained from x ray diffraction data with refinement by the rietveld method rietveld 1969 the diffractograms were recorded with 2θ ranging from 5 to 70 angular step of 0 02 counting time of 0 5 s per step and in the radiation range kαcu 1 5406 å 40 kv 45 ma 3 results 3 1 lsi and ph behavior the supplementary information fig s2 shows the results of water hardness alkalinity ph temperature electrical conductivity calcium bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations the values of each variable influence on the degree of saturation of caco3 indicated by the lsi shown in fig 4 for each condition evaluated positive lsi values indicate the tendency of calcium carbonate to precipitate and the higher the lsi value the higher the formation of caco3 precipitates langelier 1946 fig 4 shows that in the tests performed with water with the same hardness value the lsi values were similar indicating adequate and proper control in the test conditions the increase in lsi in the first hours of testing is due to an increase in the ph value during the supersaturation phase fig 5 the maximum ph value equivalent to the degree of supersaturation required for caco3 precipitation to occur is known as critical ph phc and the ph value at which the system enters equilibrium and ultimately stabilizes is called saturation ph phs sousa et al 2016 the times at which phc and phs occur are called critical time tc that is the time required for the first nuclei to form and saturation time ts which is the time required for the system to enter equilibrium respectively fig 5a also shows that the crystal formation process is divided into three different phases called the supersaturation phase nucleation phase and growth phase the nucleation and growth phases can overlap each other reis et al 2018 the curves indicate the behavior of parameters in the absence and presence of ssp allowing to obtain relevant information that helps to clarify the interaction mechanisms that occur in the system as well as the influence of ssp on caco3 precipitation 3 2 dripper prototype performance fig 6 shows the dra of dripper prototypes in the treatments with hard water of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 the formation of fouling in the labyrinths of dripper prototypes was more intense in the absence of ssp caco3 fouling occurred in greater magnitude in the absence of ssp in the water causing complete clogging of all drippers of model b the impact of fouling on the discharge of these drippers was observed from 80 h of operation at which time the prototypes b2 and b3 presented dra 75 with 120 h of operation all model b prototypes were clogged however the model a prototypes did not reach the 75 dra threshold that characterizes clogging although they also showed minor discharge variation figs 6c to 6f show the impact of the addition of ssp on the dra of dripper prototypes similar to the tests in the absence of ssp the dra variations in model a were insufficient to characterize these prototypes as clogged regardless of the ssp concentration in water figs 6c and 6e the model b prototypes presented severe dra reductions in the tests with 125 mg l 1 of ssp and all prototypes clogged by the end of the 200 h of operation fig 6d the increase in ssp concentration in water to 500 mg l 1 proved beneficial to keep the dra of model b prototype above 75 fig 6f thus the prototypes that had been clogged in the previous trials remained operating at the end of the 200 h of the test with dra above 75 demonstrating the interaction of ssp with the caco3 precipitates which could be impacting the nucleation deposition and fouling processes in the labyrinths of the prototypes directly affecting the dra of these drippers fig 7 shows dra results in the tests performed with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 7 shows a greater impact of caco3 fouling in the dra compared with tests using water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 however similarly to the tests performed with water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 in the tests performed with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 the model a prototypes maintained a dra above 90 in all studied conditions with and without addition of ssp conversely the model b prototypes showed high sensitivity in dra in the absence of ssp fig 7b and reached the threshold dra 75 faster than when ssp were added fig 7d and f increasing the concentration of ssp in water from 125 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 the dra of the prototypes remained above 90 except for the b2 prototype which was clogged with 160 h of operation based on these results it can be assumed that the processes of deposition and fouling in the labyrinths of dripper prototypes were considerably reduced which was sufficient to keep the dra drippers above 90 at the end of the 200 h of the test fig 7f 3 3 fouling mass in the labyrinths at the end of each test condition the dripper prototypes were weighed to obtain the caco3 and ssp mass fouling in the labyrinth fig 8 fig 8 shows that in the two hardness conditions studied the fouling mass followed a trend which varied according to the dripper prototype and the ssp concentration in the water the fouling mass was higher in treatments with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 which agrees with the dra results and show a greater impact on the dra of the prototypes when the water hardness value was increased the fouling mass has a relationship with the geometric parameters of the labyrinth to evaluate this assumption a cluster analysis was performed and the results are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the shorter the distance between the points the greater the similarity between the prototypes the dendrogram cutting criterion blue line was the one with the highest vertical line cut by one cross line at most resulting in three different groups defined according to the distance group 1 g1 only has model a emitters and can also be divided into two subgroups subgroup 1 sg1 and subgroup 2 sg2 the sg1 includes the a1 and a2 prototypes and the sg2 includes the a4 and a5 prototypes prototypes a1 and a2 have the same channel width 1 0 mm and the same flow section area 1 0 mm2 as common characteristics similarly prototypes a4 and a5 also have the same channel width 1 3 mm and the same flow section area 1 69 mm2 as common characteristics group 2 g2 comprises model b emitters which have in common the same width and channel depth 0 5 mm and the same flow section area 0 25 mm2 group 3 g3 comprises the prototypes that have the longest labyrinth length that is they are formed by model b prototypes which have in common the same width and channel depth 0 8 mm and the same flow section area 0 64 mm2 and by model a3 which is a model a prototype with geometric characteristics similar to models a4 and a5 differing by tooth height and labyrinth length in general observing the formed groups and analyzing the geometric characteristics common in each group the width of the channel the flow section area and the labyrinth length were the geometric parameters that most influenced the deposition of caco3 and ssp other studies reported in the literature also indicate that the flow section and channel depth are critical factors and are correlated with the fouling by chemical precipitates li et al 2019a 2019b lili et al 2016 in this study it was observed that although the fouling mass is related to the geometric characteristics of the labyrinth it is not directly linked to the clogging of dripper prototypes for example the a3 and a4 models have high fouling mass values but maintained their dra above 90 throughout the test time fig 10 shows the caco3 and ssp mass deposited in each labyrinth as a function of the ssp concentration in the water as ssp was added to the water the fouling mass in the dripper prototype decreased this behavior was observed in all prototypes and all conditions studied regarding the model b prototypes it was observed that models b4 b5 and b6 showed a similar behavior to the model a drippers so when 125 mg l 1 of ssp were added to the water the drop in fouling mass was more abrupt with the addition of 500 mg l 1 of ssp this decrease was more pronounced however models b1 b2 and b3 showed more fouling mass variation in all ssp concentration changes which may be related to the flow characteristics in the labyrinths of these drippers as will be discussed further the length of the labyrinth influenced the fouling process as shown in fig 9 in relation to the groups of prototypes formed the g3 is constituted by the prototypes with the longest labyrinth length analyzing the results of the amount of mass deposited in the labyrinths fig 10 it can be observed that the prototypes that constitute g3 group were the ones that accumulated the highest quantity of deposits a3 b4 b5 and b6 for a given flow section area when the geometry of a labyrinth does not contribute to efficient energy dissipation longer labyrinths are required to achieve the nominal discharge defined at the design state of the prototype longer labyrinths of larger flow sections and less turbulence presented less sediment transport capacity and were more prone to the accumulation of deposits during the tests although the a3 model was one of the prototypes that accumulated the highest quantity of sediments it did not clog in any of the conditions studied while the flow section area of prototypes b4 b5 and b6 was 0 64 mm² the model a3 flow section area was 1 69 mm² the larger flow section of the prototype a3 contributed to its better resistance to clogging when compared to b4 b5 and b6 3 4 fouling patterns to evaluate the fouling patterns of caco3 and ssp in the labyrinths of drippers images of the labyrinths were taken every 40 h the analysis of the images revealed that the caco3 and ssp deposition in the labyrinths occurred gradually throughout the test days despite the abrupt decreases in the dra values the abrupt decreases observed may be related to the flow measurement interval i e 40 h this period may have been sufficient for the deposition and growth of crystals to occur in a way that completely interrupted the water discharge in the labyrinth in a relatively short period of time since the flow conditions in the labyrinths of the drippers that clogged favored the processes of agglomeration of crystals in addition to the small flow section area of these channels fig 11 shows the fouling patterns in the labyrinth of prototype b6 fig 11a shows the labyrinth in the treatment with only hard water whose hardness was 300 mg l 1 as caco3 and fig 11b and c show the labyrinths in treatments with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 125 mg l 1 of ssp and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 500 mg l 1 of ssp respectively in the treatment without addition of ssp fig 11a caco3 fouling was more accentuated and occurred uniformly throughout the labyrinth with the addition of 125 mg l 1 of ssp the fouling pattern changed and the deposits occurred with greater magnitude in the first baffle only fig 11b increasing the concentration of ssp to 500 mg l 1 resulted in minimal deposition and occurred only in corner areas with the labyrinth remaining practically clean fig 11c the fouling patterns in model a prototypes were similar and are represented by model a5 fig 12 model a5 is part of the prototype group with the largest flow section 1 69 mm2 and is the model with the highest h w ratio 1 6 therefore it has well developed vortices with recirculation zones near the walls and zones of higher flow velocity in the main discharge region the images shown refer to the first baffle which was most affected by fouling the other baffles remained almost clean until the end of the tests in this prototype you can also observe changes in fouling patterns depending on the addition of ssp apparently caco3 and ssp fouling was highly dependent on the flow velocity in the channel in the baffles where fouling occurred the high flow velocity zones remained clean and with this it was found that the discharge in these baffles occurred in these zones keeping the dra of these prototypes above 90 until the end of the tests even with fouling in much of the baffle section 3 5 analysis of the clogging material after weighing the material deposited in the labyrinths the sample was collected for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the crystal phases using x ray diffraction with refinement by the rietveld method and analysis of changes in morphology and crystal habit by sem fig 13 shows the diffractograms according to xrd patterns the samples consist exclusively of calcite which is the least soluble phase and the most thermodynamically stable crystal form of caco3 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 although calcite is the most thermodynamically stable form aragonite and vaterite under certain temperature conditions or in the presence of other ions can kinetically stabilize and predominate in relation to calcite which did not occur in this study due to temperature conditions and the absence of other ions in water calcite is characterized as a crystal phase that is very difficult to remove due to its strong attachment to the walls of pipes sohaili et al 2016 ssp did not influence the crystal phase although the presence of ssp was not detected the samples presented typical staining of solid particles due to the caco3 adhesion on the particles surface these particles were completely covered by the precipitate and were undetected by the xrd analysis fig 14 shows the morphology of the fouling material fig 14a and b show that caco3 crystals exhibit cubic format rhombohedral structures which is the typical structure of calcite the only crystal phase present showing good agreement with the xrd results ketrane et al 2010 liendo et al 2021 sheikholeslami and ong 2003 sohaili et al 2016 4 discussion lili et al 2020 observed that drippers clogging by caco3 deposits can occur in three ways the first is due to the flow of calcium and magnesium carbonate precipitates in the dripper labyrinth surface charges and molecular forces promote the collision and aggregation of this precipitates forming larger constituents that are fixed on the inner wall of the emitters these processes gradually reduce the flow section which can affect the discharge of emitters the second way clogging occurs refers to discharge oscillations caused by continuous processes of accumulation and detachment of fouling in the surface of the emitters due to shear stress effects the third would be the sudden reduction of the discharge which occurs in supersaturation conditions under conditions of high supersaturation appreciable amounts of precipitate are rapidly formed leading to larger aggregates that quickly deposit onto the internal walls of the emitter lili et al 2020 in this study clogging occurred due to a gradual and sudden reduction in discharge the dra fluctuations observed were insufficient to classify the drippers as clogged besides having been observed mainly in model a dripper prototypes which present very diverse flow characteristics in the same baffle lavanholi et al 2020 the low susceptibility to clogging of model a dripper prototypes can be explained by the flow characteristics in the labyrinth of these emitters as observed in the fouling patterns two reasons can explain the caco3 and ssp fouling patterns observed in model a prototypes and both are related to the flow characteristics in the labyrinth the first is that model a prototypes have a flow section large enough to form vortex and main flow zones in the labyrinth the vortex zone is characterized by recirculation regions formed by individual flows distributed on both sides of the main flow area it presents a central region of low flow velocity and another peripheral region with relatively high flow velocities al muhammad et al 2018 wei et al 2006 yu et al 2018 in vortex zones the already formed caco3 crystals are highly susceptible to deposition if they enter the central region or they can remain in recirculation in the peripheral zones until molecular and adhesion forces actuate fixing the crystal on the surface of the labyrinth wall in the main flow zone which occurs in the central region of the labyrinth the flow velocity is high enough to impede crystal deposition the second reason that may explain the low deposition in the main flow zone is related to the shear stress provided in this region due to the high flow velocity the geometric characteristics of model a prototypes provide turbulent flow due to the low discharge exponent of these emitters x 0 489 associated with well developed vortices due to an increased h w ratio lavanholi et al 2020 yu et al 2018 according to zhangzhong et al 2019 the sedimentation rate of the chemical precipitate is proportional to the average velocity in the flow section which is proportional to the shear forces the shear forces in the material fluid interfaces are responsible for the removal of fouling and the removal rate is proportional to the shear stress and inversely proportional to the fouling thickness the removal rate is affected by various parameters such as flow tension on the walls shear resistance of the fouling layer and density of the fouling layer alsadaie and mujtaba 2019 the minimum shear stress to remove surface fouling is called critical shear stress and depends on the adhesion forces between the deposit and the substrate and the morphology of the deposit royer et al 2010 the shear stress could act by two different mechanisms that explain the removal of the deposited crystals sliding detachment mechanism and rolling detachment mechanism ahmadi et al 2007 chang and hammer 1996 the forces acting on a particle of diameter dp deposited on a surface with roughness ɛ include the drag force f d the lift force f l the frictional resistance of the particle substrate interface f r and the adhesive force f a the external moment of the surface stresses about the center of the particle is noted as md a particle is removed via sliding when f d f r whereas rolling detachment occurs when the external moment md about the downstream particle contact point overcomes the resisting moment due to the adhesion force md f d l 1 f d l 2 f a l 2 where l 1 is the vertical distance between the drag force vector and the point around which rolling occurs while l 2 is the horizontal distance between the lift and adhesion force vectors and the point around which rolling occurs ahmadi et al 2007 burdick et al 2005 royer et al 2010 rolling is the preferred mechanism for the removal of caco3 spherical particles ahmadi et al 2007 soltani and ahmadi 1994 taheri and bragg 1992 thus the shear stress in the main flow region would be responsible for slowing or limiting the increase in fouling thickness and removing deposited crystals the fouling patterns did not change when the water hardness increased from 200 to 300 mg l 1 as caco3 only the fouling mass increased as shown in fig 8 the crystal agglomeration mechanisms that occur in the crystallization process can explain the relationship between flow area and caco3 fouling agglomeration is a common phenomenon when there are high supersaturations and relatively small crystals it occurs in the presence of cohesion forces between two or more crystals that remain together long enough to grow as stable crystalline entities containing them with highly irregular properties and shapes sometimes these crystalline entities can occlude small amounts of mother solution leading to the increase of the crystal or even adhere to other growing crystals both processes originating larger crystals cosmo et al 2019 costa and giulietti 2010 wójcik and jones 1998 thus emitters with smaller flow sections are more susceptible to complete channel clogging in shorter operating times the xrd analysis revealed that caco3 precipitated as calcite regardless of the ssp presence in water caco3 precipitation as calcite may directly imply corrective measures to unclog the emitters using acids a common practice adopted by farmers when the uniformity of the irrigation system is compromised due to emitters clogged by caco3 deposits the presence of the most stable polymorph in this case would lead to increased consumption of reagent and longer application time of the product for recovery of the irrigation system and may raise maintenance routine costs the analysis of the crystal habit fig 14 revealed a wide distribution of crystals which is probably due to agglomeration phenomena liendo et al 2021 in the absence of ssp the system saturation ratio affected crystal growth in water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 14a the crystals were larger than the crystals formed in water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 14b in more supersaturated systems the nucleation time is shorter consequently the crystal forms faster but with a limited growth rate liendo et al 2021 qian et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 under both conditions calcite crystals are connected in a uniform crystalline network forming clusters in the presence of ssp the crystal habit changed completely although calcite is still the dominant form it was verified that the crystals are dispersed and linked to the ssp which confirms the conclusions regarding surface adhesion at the lowest ssp concentrations the crystals still tried to reorganize themselves in a crystalline network but due to the changes in the external face this was not possible the growth of the crystals was affected by the presence of ssp the edges became more rounded and in treatments with higher ssp concentration figs 14d and 14f larger overlapping particles appeared costa and giulietti 2010 cite that the presence of impurities in extremely low concentrations in the solution can already greatly modify crystal morphology this confirms that ssp influence on caco3 fouling process in labyrinths of drippers the results of this study suggest that the heterogeneous nucleation of caco3 is induced on the surface of the ssp and that they are largely flushed by the flow out of the labyrinth minimizing fouling precipitation on the particles consumes the ions from the solution and decreases precipitation on the walls of prototypes the precipitate removal mechanisms discussed earlier also apply to particles to prevent them from depositing and adhering to the walls in this case it can be concluded that the ssp functioned as anti fouling for caco3 which is shown in fig 11 in the absence of ssp nucleation and adhesion of caco3 clusters on the surface of the dripper material pmma is preferred leading to rapid interruption of the flow due to the increased thickness of the fouling layer when ssp was added to the water nucleation actually occurred on the surface of the ssp these in turn due to being small enough not to deposit and added to the flow conditions in the labyrinth were dragged by the flow and eliminated by the dripper thus minimizing the clogging processes which were less when the water contained 500 mg l 1 of ssp therefore there is a mechanism of competition for nucleation sites of caco3 which became preferential on the ssp surface than on the walls of the prototypes this is due to the characteristics of ssp and surface free energy in addition to nucleation occurring directly on the ssp surface the adhesion of caco3 crystalline nuclei on the ssp surface is not ruled out the ssp surface is subject to a set of chemical reactions which comprise adsorption desorption precipitation and complexation phenomena silveira et al 1999 the electronegativity of clays for example indicated by the point of zero charge causes them to act electrostatically attracting the caco3 precipitate in the dripper labyrinths once adhered to the surfaces of the ssp the precipitate tends to follow their same flow being carried out of the dripper labyrinth thus justifying the lower clogging conditions in the presence of higher ssp concentration therefore dripper prototypes that have better sediment transport capacity are less susceptible to caco3 fouling processes in the presence of ssp 5 conclusions a study to investigate the influence of ssp on the precipitation and deposition of caco3 in the labyrinth of dripper prototypes with different geometric configurations was performed water of different hardness values and different ssp concentrations was used in this experiment dripper prototypes of several geometries were evaluated the model b prototypes were more sensitive to caco3 fouling than the model a prototypes the model a prototypes have a wider flow section well developed vortices and higher turbulence different from the model b prototypes which have a narrower flow section and undeveloped vortices the addition of ssp in the water reduced caco3 fouling in the labyrinths and consequently led to smaller changes in the dra of the dripper prototypes the increase in the supersaturation of the carbonate system reduced the time required for the dra of the model b prototypes to reach the threshold that characterizes clogging dra 75 however it was not sufficient to clog the model a prototypes in terms of resistance to clogging the geometric characteristics of the labyrinths were more relevant than the water qualities evaluated for a given flow section area when the geometry of a labyrinth does not contribute to efficient energy dissipation longer labyrinths are required to achieve the nominal discharge defined at the design state of the prototype longer labyrinths of low turbulence presented less sediment transport capacity and were more prone to the accumulation of deposits during the tests an increase in the ssp concentration in water resulted in a decrease in the fouling mass in the labyrinths indicating that the ssp functioned as anti fouling for caco3 additionally the addition of ssp induced heterogeneous nucleation to occur on the surface of the ssp and no longer on the walls of the labyrinths ssp are effective competitors for the precipitation process in the walls of the dripper prototypes attenuating the precipitation directly on the walls of the channels thus avoiding the clogging of the dripper prototypes by caco3 fouling the results also revealed that caco3 precipitated as calcite whose morphology was completely modified in the presence of ssp although the clogging processes by caco3 precipitates are different from the processes caused by solid particles the results obtained in this study point to evidence that drippers with better performance when evaluated at risk of clogging by ssp also show superior performance when evaluated at risk of clogging by caco3 fouling this evidence leads to the conclusion that drippers whose labyrinth has better sediment transport capacity are emitters more resistant to clogging for waters that pose a risk of clogging by physical agents and chemical precipitates the results obtained do not consider biological clogging agents but contribute to advances in the understanding of clogging processes and are applicable to the design and selection of drippers more resistant to clogging and the definition of standardized methodologies for the evaluation of drippers declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9308,calcium carbonate caco3 fouling process in dripper prototypes was studied in the absence and presence of suspended solid particles ssp at concentrations of 125 and 500 mg l 1 eleven flat and non pressure compensating dripper prototypes were evaluated five prototypes model a present flow with well developed vortices whereas the other six prototypes model b present more uniform flow with undeveloped vortices water with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 was used in the experiments the dripper prototypes operated for 200 h and the discharge variation rate dra was determined every 40 h images of the interior of the labyrinths were acquired to investigate the fouling patterns the mass of material fouling the labyrinth of the prototypes was determined and correlated to the geometric parameters of the labyrinths the deposited material was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd the ssp directly influenced the caco3 fouling processes in the absence of ssp heterogeneous nucleation was dominant in the prototype walls and occurred uniformly throughout the labyrinth interfering directly in the dra of the model b prototypes the model a prototypes were more resistant to clogging and did not clog during the experiments once added to the water the ssp functioned as an effective competitor of caco3 nucleation and growth sites thus heterogeneous nucleation started occurring preferably on the ssp surface reducing the fouling in the labyrinth walls the prototypes that clogged in the tests in the absence of ssp were resistant to clogging in the ssp concentration of 500 mg l 1 the presence of ssp changed the crystal habit of caco3 and it precipitated in the form of calcite the nucleation of caco3 directly on the ssp surface is

water gilbert et al 1981 goyal et al 2016 şahin et al 2005 in most cases dripper clogging does not occur due to the individual action of these agents but is the result of the interaction between them causing partial or total reduction of the discharge li et al 2019b ramachandrula and kasa 2020 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 water filtration is essential in drip irrigation systems however due to practical and economic limitations this technique only removes suspended solids larger than a nominal filtration grade duran ros et al 2009 oliveira et al 2020 puig bargués and lamm 2013 particles of lower size pass through the filters and reach other components of the irrigation system and may also interact with substances in the water by processes of precipitation co precipitation adsorption desorption flocculation ion exchange among others which makes understanding the clogging process more challenging deslouis et al 2006 liu et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in several regions of brazil and the world using groundwater in irrigation systems is a common practice in many of these regions water has an alkaline ph and high concentrations of calcium magnesium carbonate and bicarbonate ions gomes et al 2017 muniz et al 2020 under supersaturation conditions chemical precipitates of calcium carbonate caco3 and or magnesium carbonate mgco3 will form caco3 is one of the most common salts found in the labyrinths of clogged emitters in dripper irrigation systems green et al 2018 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 deposits are formed when the solution is

comprises nucleation followed by crystal growth the first initiates the formation of the crystal while the latter is responsible for increasing its size the precipitate can form either in the solution or directly on the walls of the system additionally crystals that grow in the solution can later deposit on the walls the presence of dispersed particles in the saturated solution interferes with the precipitation of caco3 deslouis et al 2006 hui et al 2004 karoui et al 2010 therefore investigating caco3 crystallization mechanisms in the presence of suspended solid particles ssp is important while understanding fouling processes investigations on the fouling mechanisms and characteristics of the caco3 precipitates in waters containing small size ssp 125 µm i e fine sand silt and clay are scarce in the literature most dripper clogging studies focus on studying cause and effect relationships which limits the understanding of clogging processes and the search for improvement of possible solutions to the problem zhangzhong et al 2019 evaluated the occurrence of chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems by applying saline water and determined the amount and chemical characteristics of chemical fouling the results showed a direct impact of the type of emitter and salinity of the water on the growth of the crystals calcium magnesium carbonates were the main clogging materials found in labyrinths accounting for 63 3 91 1 of the total deposited content zhangzhong et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 evaluated the rate of chemical clogging of emitters in a drip irrigation system using pisciculture effluent the results showed that the material accumulated in the emitters consisted of both organic matter and minerals the main one being calcium carbonate which reflects a possible interaction of these factors in the cause of clogging maroufpoor et al 2020 investigated interactions between biofilm and solid particles present in water these authors observed that the clogging of emitters is more severe when microbiological activity is intense with release of extracellular polymeric substances which function as an adhesive for solid and precipitated particles of caco3 and mgco3 intensifying the fouling surface waters used in irrigation systems often have a high ssp concentration mainly of small granulometry which go through filtration systems and interact with chemicals present in water and may aggravate or attenuate the clogging processes thus studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of interaction between ssp solution and caco3 crystals in the nucleation growth and fouling processes of these crystals inside dripper labyrinths this study aimed to investigate the formation and fouling processes of caco3 inside dripper labyrinths in waters with different hardness values and ssp concentrations prototype drippers were evaluated for clogging resistance and caco3 fouling patterns in the presence and absence of ssp changes in caco3 morphology and mineralogy in the presence of ssp were investigated and discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 labyrinth prototypes eleven flat non pressure compensating prototypes of drippers with trapezoidal labyrinths and rectangular flow section were used in this study the prototypes were designed and built in a previous study lavanholi et al 2020 and the labyrinth design strategies were linked to the fundamentals of clogging processes found in commercial emitters two models of dripper prototypes model a and model b were studied in both models the labyrinths were designed to provide discharges close to 1 4 l h 1 operating at 100 kpa of pressure and these values were defined to reproduce the usual practical conditions model a fig 1a emitters have developed vortices of distinct magnitudes as a function of the geometric characteristics of the labyrinth model b fig 1b emitters feature geometry and flow characteristics that provide uniform flow throughout the channel section and undeveloped vortices table 1 shows the characteristics of the studied prototypes the prototypes were manufactured in polymethyl methacrylate pmma plates with a thickness of 2 mm and length and width varied according to the dimensions of the labyrinth the plates with the engraved labyrinths were mounted on a polypropylene accessory fig 2 allowing the prototype to operate similarly to commercial drippers the accessories are equipped with screws for fixing on the test bench and screws for fixing a translucent 8 mm thick glass plate which allows the acquisition of images of the interior of the labyrinth the accessories have a main flow channel with an internal diameter of 10 mm and are connected to each other by means of a brass coupling sealed with an o ring thus simulating an irrigation lateral each accessory had a coupling cavity for the dripper prototype the cavity consisted of a level surface 15 mm wide and 120 mm long in the cavity a 2 mm thick silicone rubber was installed between the pmma plate and the polypropylene surface to prevent water leakage a 3 mm diameter hole allowed water to flow from the main flow channel into the labyrinth the prototypes were randomly placed on the bench considering the purposes of the research only one prototype of each model was manufactured and studied 2 2 test bench the bench used in the tests consisted of a hydraulically closed circuit fig 3 equipped with a system for heating water electrical resistance of 2 kw in a water bath and a cooling system with a condenser unit of 14 77 mj a temperature sensor was installed in the bench circuit for monitoring and control of the water temperature the devices to control the water temperature were mounted in a water bath to prevent the water used in the tests from coming into contact with these components and fouling them an aluminum reservoir with a capacity of 140 l was submerged in a plastic water tank of 250 l chemical and ssp solutions were dosed in the internal reservoir a propeller stirrer was used to keep the ssp in suspension and the rod and propeller were made of stainless steel to avoid oxidation and contamination of the mixture a pump with an impeller and housing in stainless steel was used to pump the mixture to a polyethylene tube connected to the main flow line the flow velocity on the line was approximately 1 m s 1 and was controlled by a nozzle installed at the end of the line a continuous injection system of solution was used to maintain constant calcium and bicarbonate concentrations throughout the assays two reservoirs with sodium bicarbonate stock solution nahco3 dinâmica brazil 0 32 m and calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2 h2o dinâmica brazil 0 16 m were coupled to the bench and two peristaltic pumps were responsible for pumping the stock solutions to the inner reservoir the supports with the labyrinth prototypes were installed above a gutter responsible for collecting the water drained from the prototypes and conveying it into the reservoir a sieve of 150 µm aperture size was installed at the end of the gutter to retain contaminants to acquire images of the interior of the labyrinths throughout the tests a stereoscope microscope coupled to a high resolution camera xcam1080pha series hdmi and full hd screen was used installed on a mobile stand with displacement on the x z axes and fine tuning in y the prototypes were randomly placed on the bench all emitters were mounted along a straight line free of barbs of only 1 6 m in length in such a small length head loss along the line is negligible preferential flow paths and trends of clogging related to the position of the prototype are not expected to occur 2 3 study water synthetic water with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 and ph in the range of 8 0 8 3 was used in the assays the water temperature was maintained at 23 c 2 c in all tests iso 9261 2004 hardness values were obtained by adding purely analytical reagents cacl2 2 h2o and nahco3 in deionized water 0 05 ms cm 1 morais et al 2020 zhi and zhang 2014 zhu et al 2019 the physical chemical characteristics of the water table 2 were determined at the beginning of each test following methodologies presented in apha 2017 the ph and electrical conductivity were measured using a ph meter dm 22 digimed and a conductivity sensor dm 22 digimed respectively and the temperature was measured using a pt100 temperature sensor 0 5 ºc the addition of ssp to the water did not cause changes in the values of the parameters presented thus these same initial conditions were maintained in all tests performed at the same hardness value 2 4 suspended solid particles ssp the ssp used in the experiments consisted of a mixture of fine sand silt and clay particle size 125 µm obtained from a natural soil sample classified as a distroferric red latosol santos et al 2013 the natural soil has 49 1 clay 23 7 silt and 27 2 sand the ssp were characterized regarding the main chemical characteristics of interest and x ray diffraction was used to identify the constituent mineral fractions an x pert mpd x ray diffractometer philips analytical x ray was used in the following configurations kαcu radiation 1 54 å 40 kv 40 ma with 2θ ranging from 0 to 50 angular step of 0 02 and counting time of 1 s per step the supplementary information shows the results of the chemical characterization and the soil diffractogram table s1 and fig s1 respectively the xrd analysis revealed the following mineral fractions kaolinite 35 6 quartz 22 5 hematite 22 2 gypsum 19 8 and goethite 0 5 note that almost 80 of the particles used are predominantly type 1 1 clays whose surface charges at the ph value of the test conditions are predominantly negative revealed by the point of zero charge pzc equal to 6 51 2 5 testing conditions and routines two concentrations of ssp were studied 125 and 500 mg l 1 in waters with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 resulting in six test conditions waters with suspended solids concentrations above 100 mg l 1 offer a high risk of dripper clogging nakayama and bucks 1981 and waters with hardness of 200 and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 offer moderate and severe risk of dripper obstruction respectively goyal et al 2016 to determine the risk of precipitation of caco3 considering only the hardness value of the water is insufficient alkalinity ph value temperature and concentration of dissolved solids in the water are also important parameters these variables can be combined into a single saturation index and the most commonly used index is the langelier saturation index lsi langelier 1936 the lsi was used in this study to determine the risk of caco3 precipitation in each condition the lsi has been used in different areas in precipitation studies ghobadi nia et al 2010 sheikholeslami 2005 van der bruggen et al 2009 and the supplementary information shows its equations eq s1 to eq s7 table 3 shows the test conditions to obtain the hardness values in the water stoichiometric calculations were performed considering the reaction of caco3 formation from the reagents used eq 3 3 cacl 2 2 h 2 o 2 nahco 3 caco 3 2 nacl 2 h 2 o co 2 the masses of each reagent were weighed on a high precision analytical scale atx224 shimadzu resolution 0 1 mg and dissolved in deionized water in the test reservoir after starting the motor pump and past the induction time that is the period necessary for the formation of the first caco3 clusters the precipitation process becomes continuous which implies a decrease in the concentration of the reagents in the reservoir thus to keep the concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate steady the continuous injection system of nahco3 0 32 m and cacl2 2 h2o 0 16 m solutions was activated the injection flow was determined according to the decay rate τ of calcium and bicarbonate concentrations at the beginning of each cycle the water hardness was adjusted to the target value and the tests were started without the injection of the reagents after a preestablished period calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined by collecting sample aliquots at the exit of the return gutter obtaining by difference τ of each analyte as a function of time eq 4 calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined by titration filtering the sample in cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 µm 4 τ x 0 x t t where τ is the ionic decay rate mg l 1 h 1 x 0 is the initial concentration of ca2 or hco 3 mg l 1 in the reservoir x t is the concentration of ca2 or hco 3 in the reservoir after a period t mg l 1 and t is the time between readings h the procedure was repeated until a constant τ value was obtained after obtaining τ the discharge of the injector pumps was adjusted so that the concentrations of the analytes in the reservoir remained close to the initial value calcium and bicarbonate concentrations were determined every 2 h when necessary the flow of the injection pumps was adjusted to obtain the desired concentrations in addition to calcium and bicarbonate concentrations total hardness total alkalinity ph electrical conductivity and temperature were continuously analyzed to monitor the test conditions the tests were performed in 12 h cycles with the system operating for 10 h and idle for 2 h each condition lasted 20 cycles totaling 200 h of operation 10 days the discharge of drippers was measured every two cycles by water mass determination and at each measurement images were acquired from the labyrinths during the tests the system pressure was kept at 100 kpa the curve of ph versus time was obtained and provides relevant information describing the behavior of the system according to the applied conditions menzri et al 2017 reis et al 2018 sousa et al 2016 in this study the curves were constructed to help clarify the influence of ssp on caco3 precipitation 2 6 prototype performance three main aspects were used to evaluate the effect of the different water quality conditions on the performance of the prototypes 1 discharge variation rate dra evaluation of the ratio between the current and initial discharge of each dripper 2 fouling patterns evaluation of the sites of deposition and accumulation of sediments precipitates inside the labyrinth by images and 3 fouling mass measurement of the mass fouling each labyrinth at the end of each test regarding the quantitative aspect the prototype models with dra below 75 were considered clogged pereira et al 2020 wei et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 the dra was calculated according to pereira et al 2020 eq 5 5 dra 100 q i q 0 where dra is the ratio between the current and initial discharge of the emitter q i is the current discharge of the emitter l h 1 and q 0 is the initial discharge of the emitter operating with clean water l h 1 to assess whether the fouling mass has a relationship with the geometric parameters of the labyrinth a cluster analysis of the prototypes using the hierarchical method was performed interconnecting the samples by their associations producing a dendrogram where the prototypes of similar drippers were grouped together according to the fouling mass in the labyrinth the ward connection method and the euclidean distance were used for similarity measurements ward 1963 the statistica 10 software was used to create the dendrogram 2 7 analysis of the clogging material the material deposited inside the labyrinth of the emitters was collected for imaging under a scanning electron microscope sem to verify changes in the morphological behavior of caco3 in the presence of ssp the particulate matter was spread over a carbon tape in a metal stub and then the samples were metallized with au s and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope jeol sm 5800lv with an image capture system semafore 5 21 operating at 15 kv the determination of the crystal phases of the precipitate was obtained from x ray diffraction data with refinement by the rietveld method rietveld 1969 the diffractograms were recorded with 2θ ranging from 5 to 70 angular step of 0 02 counting time of 0 5 s per step and in the radiation range kαcu 1 5406 å 40 kv 45 ma 3 results 3 1 lsi and ph behavior the supplementary information fig s2 shows the results of water hardness alkalinity ph temperature electrical conductivity calcium bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations the values of each variable influence on the degree of saturation of caco3 indicated by the lsi shown in fig 4 for each condition evaluated positive lsi values indicate the tendency of calcium carbonate to precipitate and the higher the lsi value the higher the formation of caco3 precipitates langelier 1946 fig 4 shows that in the tests performed with water with the same hardness value the lsi values were similar indicating adequate and proper control in the test conditions the increase in lsi in the first hours of testing is due to an increase in the ph value during the supersaturation phase fig 5 the maximum ph value equivalent to the degree of supersaturation required for caco3 precipitation to occur is known as critical ph phc and the ph value at which the system enters equilibrium and ultimately stabilizes is called saturation ph phs sousa et al 2016 the times at which phc and phs occur are called critical time tc that is the time required for the first nuclei to form and saturation time ts which is the time required for the system to enter equilibrium respectively fig 5a also shows that the crystal formation process is divided into three different phases called the supersaturation phase nucleation phase and growth phase the nucleation and growth phases can overlap each other reis et al 2018 the curves indicate the behavior of parameters in the absence and presence of ssp allowing to obtain relevant information that helps to clarify the interaction mechanisms that occur in the system as well as the influence of ssp on caco3 precipitation 3 2 dripper prototype performance fig 6 shows the dra of dripper prototypes in the treatments with hard water of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 the formation of fouling in the labyrinths of dripper prototypes was more intense in the absence of ssp caco3 fouling occurred in greater magnitude in the absence of ssp in the water causing complete clogging of all drippers of model b the impact of fouling on the discharge of these drippers was observed from 80 h of operation at which time the prototypes b2 and b3 presented dra 75 with 120 h of operation all model b prototypes were clogged however the model a prototypes did not reach the 75 dra threshold that characterizes clogging although they also showed minor discharge variation figs 6c to 6f show the impact of the addition of ssp on the dra of dripper prototypes similar to the tests in the absence of ssp the dra variations in model a were insufficient to characterize these prototypes as clogged regardless of the ssp concentration in water figs 6c and 6e the model b prototypes presented severe dra reductions in the tests with 125 mg l 1 of ssp and all prototypes clogged by the end of the 200 h of operation fig 6d the increase in ssp concentration in water to 500 mg l 1 proved beneficial to keep the dra of model b prototype above 75 fig 6f thus the prototypes that had been clogged in the previous trials remained operating at the end of the 200 h of the test with dra above 75 demonstrating the interaction of ssp with the caco3 precipitates which could be impacting the nucleation deposition and fouling processes in the labyrinths of the prototypes directly affecting the dra of these drippers fig 7 shows dra results in the tests performed with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 7 shows a greater impact of caco3 fouling in the dra compared with tests using water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 however similarly to the tests performed with water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 in the tests performed with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 the model a prototypes maintained a dra above 90 in all studied conditions with and without addition of ssp conversely the model b prototypes showed high sensitivity in dra in the absence of ssp fig 7b and reached the threshold dra 75 faster than when ssp were added fig 7d and f increasing the concentration of ssp in water from 125 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 the dra of the prototypes remained above 90 except for the b2 prototype which was clogged with 160 h of operation based on these results it can be assumed that the processes of deposition and fouling in the labyrinths of dripper prototypes were considerably reduced which was sufficient to keep the dra drippers above 90 at the end of the 200 h of the test fig 7f 3 3 fouling mass in the labyrinths at the end of each test condition the dripper prototypes were weighed to obtain the caco3 and ssp mass fouling in the labyrinth fig 8 fig 8 shows that in the two hardness conditions studied the fouling mass followed a trend which varied according to the dripper prototype and the ssp concentration in the water the fouling mass was higher in treatments with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 which agrees with the dra results and show a greater impact on the dra of the prototypes when the water hardness value was increased the fouling mass has a relationship with the geometric parameters of the labyrinth to evaluate this assumption a cluster analysis was performed and the results are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the shorter the distance between the points the greater the similarity between the prototypes the dendrogram cutting criterion blue line was the one with the highest vertical line cut by one cross line at most resulting in three different groups defined according to the distance group 1 g1 only has model a emitters and can also be divided into two subgroups subgroup 1 sg1 and subgroup 2 sg2 the sg1 includes the a1 and a2 prototypes and the sg2 includes the a4 and a5 prototypes prototypes a1 and a2 have the same channel width 1 0 mm and the same flow section area 1 0 mm2 as common characteristics similarly prototypes a4 and a5 also have the same channel width 1 3 mm and the same flow section area 1 69 mm2 as common characteristics group 2 g2 comprises model b emitters which have in common the same width and channel depth 0 5 mm and the same flow section area 0 25 mm2 group 3 g3 comprises the prototypes that have the longest labyrinth length that is they are formed by model b prototypes which have in common the same width and channel depth 0 8 mm and the same flow section area 0 64 mm2 and by model a3 which is a model a prototype with geometric characteristics similar to models a4 and a5 differing by tooth height and labyrinth length in general observing the formed groups and analyzing the geometric characteristics common in each group the width of the channel the flow section area and the labyrinth length were the geometric parameters that most influenced the deposition of caco3 and ssp other studies reported in the literature also indicate that the flow section and channel depth are critical factors and are correlated with the fouling by chemical precipitates li et al 2019a 2019b lili et al 2016 in this study it was observed that although the fouling mass is related to the geometric characteristics of the labyrinth it is not directly linked to the clogging of dripper prototypes for example the a3 and a4 models have high fouling mass values but maintained their dra above 90 throughout the test time fig 10 shows the caco3 and ssp mass deposited in each labyrinth as a function of the ssp concentration in the water as ssp was added to the water the fouling mass in the dripper prototype decreased this behavior was observed in all prototypes and all conditions studied regarding the model b prototypes it was observed that models b4 b5 and b6 showed a similar behavior to the model a drippers so when 125 mg l 1 of ssp were added to the water the drop in fouling mass was more abrupt with the addition of 500 mg l 1 of ssp this decrease was more pronounced however models b1 b2 and b3 showed more fouling mass variation in all ssp concentration changes which may be related to the flow characteristics in the labyrinths of these drippers as will be discussed further the length of the labyrinth influenced the fouling process as shown in fig 9 in relation to the groups of prototypes formed the g3 is constituted by the prototypes with the longest labyrinth length analyzing the results of the amount of mass deposited in the labyrinths fig 10 it can be observed that the prototypes that constitute g3 group were the ones that accumulated the highest quantity of deposits a3 b4 b5 and b6 for a given flow section area when the geometry of a labyrinth does not contribute to efficient energy dissipation longer labyrinths are required to achieve the nominal discharge defined at the design state of the prototype longer labyrinths of larger flow sections and less turbulence presented less sediment transport capacity and were more prone to the accumulation of deposits during the tests although the a3 model was one of the prototypes that accumulated the highest quantity of sediments it did not clog in any of the conditions studied while the flow section area of prototypes b4 b5 and b6 was 0 64 mm² the model a3 flow section area was 1 69 mm² the larger flow section of the prototype a3 contributed to its better resistance to clogging when compared to b4 b5 and b6 3 4 fouling patterns to evaluate the fouling patterns of caco3 and ssp in the labyrinths of drippers images of the labyrinths were taken every 40 h the analysis of the images revealed that the caco3 and ssp deposition in the labyrinths occurred gradually throughout the test days despite the abrupt decreases in the dra values the abrupt decreases observed may be related to the flow measurement interval i e 40 h this period may have been sufficient for the deposition and growth of crystals to occur in a way that completely interrupted the water discharge in the labyrinth in a relatively short period of time since the flow conditions in the labyrinths of the drippers that clogged favored the processes of agglomeration of crystals in addition to the small flow section area of these channels fig 11 shows the fouling patterns in the labyrinth of prototype b6 fig 11a shows the labyrinth in the treatment with only hard water whose hardness was 300 mg l 1 as caco3 and fig 11b and c show the labyrinths in treatments with water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 125 mg l 1 of ssp and 300 mg l 1 as caco3 500 mg l 1 of ssp respectively in the treatment without addition of ssp fig 11a caco3 fouling was more accentuated and occurred uniformly throughout the labyrinth with the addition of 125 mg l 1 of ssp the fouling pattern changed and the deposits occurred with greater magnitude in the first baffle only fig 11b increasing the concentration of ssp to 500 mg l 1 resulted in minimal deposition and occurred only in corner areas with the labyrinth remaining practically clean fig 11c the fouling patterns in model a prototypes were similar and are represented by model a5 fig 12 model a5 is part of the prototype group with the largest flow section 1 69 mm2 and is the model with the highest h w ratio 1 6 therefore it has well developed vortices with recirculation zones near the walls and zones of higher flow velocity in the main discharge region the images shown refer to the first baffle which was most affected by fouling the other baffles remained almost clean until the end of the tests in this prototype you can also observe changes in fouling patterns depending on the addition of ssp apparently caco3 and ssp fouling was highly dependent on the flow velocity in the channel in the baffles where fouling occurred the high flow velocity zones remained clean and with this it was found that the discharge in these baffles occurred in these zones keeping the dra of these prototypes above 90 until the end of the tests even with fouling in much of the baffle section 3 5 analysis of the clogging material after weighing the material deposited in the labyrinths the sample was collected for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the crystal phases using x ray diffraction with refinement by the rietveld method and analysis of changes in morphology and crystal habit by sem fig 13 shows the diffractograms according to xrd patterns the samples consist exclusively of calcite which is the least soluble phase and the most thermodynamically stable crystal form of caco3 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 although calcite is the most thermodynamically stable form aragonite and vaterite under certain temperature conditions or in the presence of other ions can kinetically stabilize and predominate in relation to calcite which did not occur in this study due to temperature conditions and the absence of other ions in water calcite is characterized as a crystal phase that is very difficult to remove due to its strong attachment to the walls of pipes sohaili et al 2016 ssp did not influence the crystal phase although the presence of ssp was not detected the samples presented typical staining of solid particles due to the caco3 adhesion on the particles surface these particles were completely covered by the precipitate and were undetected by the xrd analysis fig 14 shows the morphology of the fouling material fig 14a and b show that caco3 crystals exhibit cubic format rhombohedral structures which is the typical structure of calcite the only crystal phase present showing good agreement with the xrd results ketrane et al 2010 liendo et al 2021 sheikholeslami and ong 2003 sohaili et al 2016 4 discussion lili et al 2020 observed that drippers clogging by caco3 deposits can occur in three ways the first is due to the flow of calcium and magnesium carbonate precipitates in the dripper labyrinth surface charges and molecular forces promote the collision and aggregation of this precipitates forming larger constituents that are fixed on the inner wall of the emitters these processes gradually reduce the flow section which can affect the discharge of emitters the second way clogging occurs refers to discharge oscillations caused by continuous processes of accumulation and detachment of fouling in the surface of the emitters due to shear stress effects the third would be the sudden reduction of the discharge which occurs in supersaturation conditions under conditions of high supersaturation appreciable amounts of precipitate are rapidly formed leading to larger aggregates that quickly deposit onto the internal walls of the emitter lili et al 2020 in this study clogging occurred due to a gradual and sudden reduction in discharge the dra fluctuations observed were insufficient to classify the drippers as clogged besides having been observed mainly in model a dripper prototypes which present very diverse flow characteristics in the same baffle lavanholi et al 2020 the low susceptibility to clogging of model a dripper prototypes can be explained by the flow characteristics in the labyrinth of these emitters as observed in the fouling patterns two reasons can explain the caco3 and ssp fouling patterns observed in model a prototypes and both are related to the flow characteristics in the labyrinth the first is that model a prototypes have a flow section large enough to form vortex and main flow zones in the labyrinth the vortex zone is characterized by recirculation regions formed by individual flows distributed on both sides of the main flow area it presents a central region of low flow velocity and another peripheral region with relatively high flow velocities al muhammad et al 2018 wei et al 2006 yu et al 2018 in vortex zones the already formed caco3 crystals are highly susceptible to deposition if they enter the central region or they can remain in recirculation in the peripheral zones until molecular and adhesion forces actuate fixing the crystal on the surface of the labyrinth wall in the main flow zone which occurs in the central region of the labyrinth the flow velocity is high enough to impede crystal deposition the second reason that may explain the low deposition in the main flow zone is related to the shear stress provided in this region due to the high flow velocity the geometric characteristics of model a prototypes provide turbulent flow due to the low discharge exponent of these emitters x 0 489 associated with well developed vortices due to an increased h w ratio lavanholi et al 2020 yu et al 2018 according to zhangzhong et al 2019 the sedimentation rate of the chemical precipitate is proportional to the average velocity in the flow section which is proportional to the shear forces the shear forces in the material fluid interfaces are responsible for the removal of fouling and the removal rate is proportional to the shear stress and inversely proportional to the fouling thickness the removal rate is affected by various parameters such as flow tension on the walls shear resistance of the fouling layer and density of the fouling layer alsadaie and mujtaba 2019 the minimum shear stress to remove surface fouling is called critical shear stress and depends on the adhesion forces between the deposit and the substrate and the morphology of the deposit royer et al 2010 the shear stress could act by two different mechanisms that explain the removal of the deposited crystals sliding detachment mechanism and rolling detachment mechanism ahmadi et al 2007 chang and hammer 1996 the forces acting on a particle of diameter dp deposited on a surface with roughness ɛ include the drag force f d the lift force f l the frictional resistance of the particle substrate interface f r and the adhesive force f a the external moment of the surface stresses about the center of the particle is noted as md a particle is removed via sliding when f d f r whereas rolling detachment occurs when the external moment md about the downstream particle contact point overcomes the resisting moment due to the adhesion force md f d l 1 f d l 2 f a l 2 where l 1 is the vertical distance between the drag force vector and the point around which rolling occurs while l 2 is the horizontal distance between the lift and adhesion force vectors and the point around which rolling occurs ahmadi et al 2007 burdick et al 2005 royer et al 2010 rolling is the preferred mechanism for the removal of caco3 spherical particles ahmadi et al 2007 soltani and ahmadi 1994 taheri and bragg 1992 thus the shear stress in the main flow region would be responsible for slowing or limiting the increase in fouling thickness and removing deposited crystals the fouling patterns did not change when the water hardness increased from 200 to 300 mg l 1 as caco3 only the fouling mass increased as shown in fig 8 the crystal agglomeration mechanisms that occur in the crystallization process can explain the relationship between flow area and caco3 fouling agglomeration is a common phenomenon when there are high supersaturations and relatively small crystals it occurs in the presence of cohesion forces between two or more crystals that remain together long enough to grow as stable crystalline entities containing them with highly irregular properties and shapes sometimes these crystalline entities can occlude small amounts of mother solution leading to the increase of the crystal or even adhere to other growing crystals both processes originating larger crystals cosmo et al 2019 costa and giulietti 2010 wójcik and jones 1998 thus emitters with smaller flow sections are more susceptible to complete channel clogging in shorter operating times the xrd analysis revealed that caco3 precipitated as calcite regardless of the ssp presence in water caco3 precipitation as calcite may directly imply corrective measures to unclog the emitters using acids a common practice adopted by farmers when the uniformity of the irrigation system is compromised due to emitters clogged by caco3 deposits the presence of the most stable polymorph in this case would lead to increased consumption of reagent and longer application time of the product for recovery of the irrigation system and may raise maintenance routine costs the analysis of the crystal habit fig 14 revealed a wide distribution of crystals which is probably due to agglomeration phenomena liendo et al 2021 in the absence of ssp the system saturation ratio affected crystal growth in water with hardness of 200 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 14a the crystals were larger than the crystals formed in water with hardness of 300 mg l 1 as caco3 fig 14b in more supersaturated systems the nucleation time is shorter consequently the crystal forms faster but with a limited growth rate liendo et al 2021 qian et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 under both conditions calcite crystals are connected in a uniform crystalline network forming clusters in the presence of ssp the crystal habit changed completely although calcite is still the dominant form it was verified that the crystals are dispersed and linked to the ssp which confirms the conclusions regarding surface adhesion at the lowest ssp concentrations the crystals still tried to reorganize themselves in a crystalline network but due to the changes in the external face this was not possible the growth of the crystals was affected by the presence of ssp the edges became more rounded and in treatments with higher ssp concentration figs 14d and 14f larger overlapping particles appeared costa and giulietti 2010 cite that the presence of impurities in extremely low concentrations in the solution can already greatly modify crystal morphology this confirms that ssp influence on caco3 fouling process in labyrinths of drippers the results of this study suggest that the heterogeneous nucleation of caco3 is induced on the surface of the ssp and that they are largely flushed by the flow out of the labyrinth minimizing fouling precipitation on the particles consumes the ions from the solution and decreases precipitation on the walls of prototypes the precipitate removal mechanisms discussed earlier also apply to particles to prevent them from depositing and adhering to the walls in this case it can be concluded that the ssp functioned as anti fouling for caco3 which is shown in fig 11 in the absence of ssp nucleation and adhesion of caco3 clusters on the surface of the dripper material pmma is preferred leading to rapid interruption of the flow due to the increased thickness of the fouling layer when ssp was added to the water nucleation actually occurred on the surface of the ssp these in turn due to being small enough not to deposit and added to the flow conditions in the labyrinth were dragged by the flow and eliminated by the dripper thus minimizing the clogging processes which were less when the water contained 500 mg l 1 of ssp therefore there is a mechanism of competition for nucleation sites of caco3 which became preferential on the ssp surface than on the walls of the prototypes this is due to the characteristics of ssp and surface free energy in addition to nucleation occurring directly on the ssp surface the adhesion of caco3 crystalline nuclei on the ssp surface is not ruled out the ssp surface is subject to a set of chemical reactions which comprise adsorption desorption precipitation and complexation phenomena silveira et al 1999 the electronegativity of clays for example indicated by the point of zero charge causes them to act electrostatically attracting the caco3 precipitate in the dripper labyrinths once adhered to the surfaces of the ssp the precipitate tends to follow their same flow being carried out of the dripper labyrinth thus justifying the lower clogging conditions in the presence of higher ssp concentration therefore dripper prototypes that have better sediment transport capacity are less susceptible to caco3 fouling processes in the presence of ssp 5 conclusions a study to investigate the influence of ssp on the precipitation and deposition of caco3 in the labyrinth of dripper prototypes with different geometric configurations was performed water of different hardness values and different ssp concentrations was used in this experiment dripper prototypes of several geometries were evaluated the model b prototypes were more sensitive to caco3 fouling than the model a prototypes the model a prototypes have a wider flow section well developed vortices and higher turbulence different from the model b prototypes which have a narrower flow section and undeveloped vortices the addition of ssp in the water reduced caco3 fouling in the labyrinths and consequently led to smaller changes in the dra of the dripper prototypes the increase in the supersaturation of the carbonate system reduced the time required for the dra of the model b prototypes to reach the threshold that characterizes clogging dra 75 however it was not sufficient to clog the model a prototypes in terms of resistance to clogging the geometric characteristics of the labyrinths were more relevant than the water qualities evaluated for a given flow section area when the geometry of a labyrinth does not contribute to efficient energy dissipation longer labyrinths are required to achieve the nominal discharge defined at the design state of the prototype longer labyrinths of low turbulence presented less sediment transport capacity and were more prone to the accumulation of deposits during the tests an increase in the ssp concentration in water resulted in a decrease in the fouling mass in the labyrinths indicating that the ssp functioned as anti fouling for caco3 additionally the addition of ssp induced heterogeneous nucleation to occur on the surface of the ssp and no longer on the walls of the labyrinths ssp are effective competitors for the precipitation process in the walls of the dripper prototypes attenuating the precipitation directly on the walls of the channels thus avoiding the clogging of the dripper prototypes by caco3 fouling the results also revealed that caco3 precipitated as calcite whose morphology was completely modified in the presence of ssp although the clogging processes by caco3 precipitates are different from the processes caused by solid particles the results obtained in this study point to evidence that drippers with better performance when evaluated at risk of clogging by ssp also show superior performance when evaluated at risk of clogging by caco3 fouling this evidence leads to the conclusion that drippers whose labyrinth has better sediment transport capacity are emitters more resistant to clogging for waters that pose a risk of clogging by physical agents and chemical precipitates the results obtained do not consider biological clogging agents but contribute to advances in the understanding of clogging processes and are applicable to the design and selection of drippers more resistant to clogging and the definition of standardized methodologies for the evaluation of drippers declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9309,drip irrigation underneath plastic film mulch was extensively applied to mitigate water scarcity in oasis agroecosystems over arid northwest china however the local climate effects induced by the agricultural practice were still not appraised clearly especially from the perspective of the mountain oasis desert system mods a basic landscape configuration widely formed in northwest china in this study a drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch scheme was developed within the land surface model surfex and the regional climate effects during summer were further explored by coupling the regional climate model alaro to the modified surfex during 2009 2018 from a comparison to the local observations the revised regional climate model was substantially improved in simulating lower boundary layer properties including sensible and latent heat fluxes surface air temperature and soil temperature though neutral impacts were found on some variables including ground heat fluxes and precipitation the drip irrigation practice could reduce the climatological mean temperature by about 3 73 0 14 c over the oasis areas while the implementation of plastic mulch weakened such irrigation induced cooling effect marginally by about 0 2 c besides irrigation had limited influences on precipitation over oasis areas but enhanced it remotely at the mid mountain areas with a value of 15 mm during summer additionally the plastic mulch had marginal impacts on precipitation with a value of 2 86 mm summer overall these results suggest a positive climate feedback for mitigating climate warming and strengthening the local hydrological cycle in mods by using drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch in northwestern china keywords mountain oasis desert system irrigation plastic mulch surfex data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tightly connected via the runoff induced by glacier snow melt and precipitation from mountains the basic and specific landscape mountain oasis desert system mods is widely formed in the extensive arid regions of northwest china luo et al 2005 restricted by local water resources the high water saving agricultural technology drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch has been widely implemented in oasis agroecosystems which exerted significant impacts on local climate in mods through water and energy exchanges forced by local atmospheric circulations hou et al 2010 yuan et al 2019 zong et al 2021 however the modified surface processes e g water cycle and energy partitioning and associated climate effects induced by such an anthropogenic activity in oases are rarely studied over the arid region of northwest china which posed a key restriction for regional weather forecasting and climate projections in arid semi arid regions a long line of studies identified the profound climate impacts of irrigation based on various observation based in situ measurements or simulations done by global regional climate models gcms rcms chen and dirmeyer 2019 liu et al 2021 pei et al 2016 in particular by reducing soil albedo and increasing evapotranspiration the cooling effects of irrigation were documented widely at both regional and continental scales such as in northwestern india chen and dirmeyer 2019 eastern china yang et al 2016 as well as north america huang and ullrich 2016 pei et al 2016 etc however the magnitude of irrigated cooling differs among regions and the cooling effect can attenuate or even offset the effect of global warming which is mainly determined by local irrigation management practices such as the irrigation frequency and or the irrigation quota lobell et al 2009 thiery et al 2017 as with precipitation the induced effects are divergent and are still debated which are location specific and highly dependent on the local topography and background climate among other things for example a significant irrigation induced decrease in summer total precipitation was detected in southern china and the central united states liu et al 2021 pei et al 2016 this decrease was attributed to the interplay between large scale meteorological conditions and the non convective component of local precipitations yang et al 2016 in contrast more convective precipitation is easily generated in the downwind areas as a result of increased convective available potential energy such as in the northwest of china zhang et al 2019 and california central valley of the united states yang et al 2017 two local circulations mountain plain circulation and oasis desert breeze circulation co exist in the mods cai et al 2020 li et al 2016 caused by the significant differences in heat and moisture fluxes within the horizontal boundary layer consequently the water and energy cycles are extensively influenced by local circulations through vapor and energy transport horizontally cai et al 2020 however how will irrigation influences local climate under such a special mods geomorphology and their underlying physical mechanisms are still unclear by the high capacity to reduce water loss from the soil surface and thus to mitigate water scarcity plastic mulch has a high potential for applications in arid regions yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2012 however the usage of plastic mulch is also expected to alter the local climate by modifying exchanges of water and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere yuan et al 2019 for example less radiation will be absorbed by the white plastic film with higher albedo while more energy will be stored inside the plastic mulch as a result of suppressing energy loss through latent heat fluxes fan et al 2015 ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 furthermore the daily soil temperature would be 2 9 c higher inside the plastic mulch than that outside the mulch based on field experiments wang et al 2009 in addition the local precipitation will decrease with a reduction of water vapor in the lower atmosphere wu et al 2020 overall previous studies identified the surface energy transfers between soil mulch vegetation systems at a site scale or simulated possible changes in some key climate variables under specific bulk assumptions but none evaluated its climate effects by coupling to drip irrigation at site specific or regional scales land surface models lsms coupled with global or regional climate models serve as advanced tools for simulating biogeochemical and biophysical mechanisms including representations of water carbon and energy processes and these lsms have been widely applied to study irrigation and or plastic mulch induced surface processes wu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 two kinds of irrigation schemes i e dynamic and fixed irrigation schemes can be roughly classified based on previous studies the difference between them is how the irrigation module is triggered in lsms yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 more specifically dynamic irrigation schemes are usually designed to be triggered under specific weather or soil moisture conditions by predefining thresholds lobell et al 2009 yang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 while the fixed irrigation schemes used a constant value of irrigation frequency or realistic irrigation amount regardless of the climatic conditions lo and famiglietti 2013 ozdogan et al 2010 sacks et al 2009 however to date none of them has been accepted universally as irrigation practices can differ markedly between regions in addition the physical processes induced by plastic mulch were also attempted to be incorporated into lsms based on surface energy balance theory ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 or by modifying some key surface variables empirically such as the albedo and soil evaporation wu et al 2020 however these studies were based on the assumption that the soil surface was fully only covered by mulch but none of them considered the real agricultural practices that the soil surface was covered partly e g 80 according to the records in northwest china zhou et al 2012 and further explored their regional climate effects as mods is generally distributed fragmentally in arid regions rcms are preferable for modeling the climate impacts at regional scales coupled with the externalized surface scheme surface externalisée surfex the regional climate model alaro allows numerical simulation at a high spatial resolution of 4 km which provides an alternative for the climate simulation at mods therefore the first object in this study is to develop a drip irrigation underneath the plastic mulch module to simulate vapor and energy fluxes within surfex and evaluate it in offline mode the second focus of this study aims to quantify the climate effects induced by the above high water saving technology on a typical mods in northwest china based on coupled alaro surfex simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tianshan mountain located deep inside the eurasian continent 39 30 45 45 n 74 10 96 15 e is the largest mountain system in central asia ca with peaks ranging from 4000 to 6000 m gheyret et al 2020 the tianshan mountain is regarded as the ca s water tower by providing the water resource for supporting human activities including industrial and agricultural water usage as well as for maintaining the stability of the ecological systems in the downstream areas the study area of interest 43 12 46 12 n 83 24 88 47 e located in the north slope of tianshan mountain nstm is the largest and one of the typical mods in ca with mountain oasis and desert accounting for 34 6 18 2 and 47 2 respectively this region is characterized by long term high temperatures and less precipitation and is strongly influenced by a continental climate with a mean annual temperature of around 6 c and an annual precipitation amount of around 220 mm cai et al 2019 stressed by water scarcity the cropland is almost covered by irrigated plants and the artificial reservoir and groundwater provide the main steady source of water for irrigation with a rapid increase in population and the associated demand for water consumption since the 21st century drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was widely applied instead of traditional flood irrigation and the irrigation quota has dropped by almost twice during the period 2000 2018 from more than 1000 mm m2 to about 500 mm m2 zhang et al 2019 2 2 model description and configurations 2 2 1 regional climate model alaro surfex the alaro 0 used in this study is developed from the aire limitée adaptation dynamique développement international aladin model and is now one of the state of the art regional climate models termonia et al 2018 with an improved physical parameterization scheme 3mt i e the modular multiscale microphysics and transport scheme the alaro 0 was specifically designed to allow simulations between the mesoscale and the convection permitting scales the model is divided into 46 layers vertically with the lowest layer at 17 m and the highest layer extending up at 72 km hamdi et al 2012 now the alaro 0 has been adopted for numerical weather forecasting at the royal meteorological institute rmi of belgium and is also widely applied in europe africa central asia as well as china for ecological environmental and climatological studies hamdi et al 2014 he et al 2021 top et al 2021 van den hende et al 2021 surfex is a new generation of the comprehensive physical biochemical land surface platform developed by météo france masson et al 2013 surfex is designed to be coupled with atmospheric and hydrological models by providing energy mass and momentum fluxes in surfex each grid box is divided into four tiles nature urban areas sea or ocean and lake and each tile is associated with specific prognostic parameterizations for example the interactions between soil biosphere and atmospheric model isba is used for vegetated areas while the town energy balance single layer urban canopy model teb is used for urban tiles hamdi et al 2014 the fractions of each tile and associated surface parameters such as roughness length z0 m emissivity and leaf area index lai are provided by ecoclimap global database with a spatial resolution of 1 km masson et al 2003 surfex can be run either in a coupled mode in which case the atmospheric forcing is provided by the host atmospheric model or in a stand alone mode although the coupled alaro surfex has proven its high skills in regional climate simulations in europe its application in ca still faces challenges because of a lack of considering specific oasis agroecosystem management practices e g drip irrigation and the use of plastic mulch therefore the key modifications and improvements are addressed as follows 2 2 2 drip irrigation scheme to represent the actual local irrigation induced surface processes in surfex the fixed irrigation scheme was adopted in this study two irrigation parameters i e irrigation timing and irrigation amount were proposed for the drip irrigation module based on the field records the irrigation season usually lasts from mid june to the end of august and the total number of irrigation ranges from five to seven times supplementary table a 1 accordingly the irrigation module in surfex was designed to be triggered starting from 15th june with a 10 days interval each irrigation event starts at 10 00 am and lasts two hours therefore eight total irrigation times were triggered during the whole irrigation season which approximates the record range i e 5 7 times the annual mean irrigation quota varied substantially from 407 m3 ha to 1045 m3 ha during 2009 2018 the averaged value of the available six years records i e 642 m3 ha see supplementary table a 1 was calculated as the climatological mean irrigation quota since evaporation is minimal or could be negligible because of the usage of plastic mulch the irrigation water is added directly into the root zones at the top two soil layers with a total of 45 cm in surfex specifically the irrigation water was first added into the first soil layer if the first layer is saturated the rest water was added into the second layer the equations can be addressed as follows 1 s 1 ρ m θ s d 1 s 2 ρ m θ 2 d 2 a ρ m θ s θ 1 d 1 where θ s is the field capacity m 3 m 3 θ 1 and θ 2 are the actual soil volumetric content m3 m3 at the first and second soil layer in surfex respectively d 1 and d 2 are the depth of soil at the first and second soil layer m respectively ρ m is the water density kg m3 s 1 and s 2 are the soil water content kg m3 at the first and second soil layer after drip irrigation a is the irrigation quota kg the first soil layer would be saturated after the irrigation events since its depth is only 5 cm in surfex and the saturated water content is much lower than the irrigation quota 2 2 3 plastic mulch scheme following the energy balance theory the original surface energy partitioning was redistributed by using plastic mulch in particular the white transparent mulch has a higher albedo than the soil and thus the surface absorbs less radiation however its high transmittance can still enable the soil to receive a certain amount of energy meanwhile it can reduce the energy loss from the soil to the atmosphere in the form of latent heat fluxes and increase the ground heat fluxes transported to the deeper layer of the soil therefore the use of plastic mulch forms a new energy balance on the surface of the soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 the energy transfer process is shown in fig 2 the surface energy balance equation proposed in this study is based on the local practices in the northwest arid regions of china that the soil is only covered partly about 80 zhou et al 2012 which is different from previous studies where the energy balance equations were based on an ideal assumption that the soil surface is fully covered by mulch therefore the energy transfer between the land and the atmosphere is divided into two parts one portion will be covered by mulch and the other will not be covered by mulch besides two assumptions were made following previous studies ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 і no water vapor loss from plastic mulch considering the planting holes are very small іі heat storage in the plastic mulch is negligible since the plastic mulch is very thin finally the energy balance equations for the land surface soil and mulch can be expressed as follows the energy balance for the plastic mulch layer 2 r n m h m h m s 0 given the surface temperature equation for the first layer of soil having a portion δ m of ground covered by the mulch and a portion δ v of vegetation see fig 2 the energy balance for the canopy layer can be expressed as 3 c s t t s t s r n δ m h m s 1 δ m h s 1 δ m le s δ v le v g where the sign means the value is calculated at the previous time t c s is the soil heat capacity j m3 k t is the time step s of model simulations t s is the soil surface temperature k at time t t r n is the net radiation w m2 received by the soil surface which includes two parts covered and not covered by plastic mulch r n m is the net radiation w m2 received by plastic mulch h m and h m s are the sensible heat flux w m2 from plastic mulch surface and between the plastic mulch and soil respectively h s is the sensible heat flux w m2 from the soil outside the plastic mulch le s is the latent heat flux w m2 from the soil outside the plastic mulch le v is the latent heat flux w m2 from the vegetation g is the ground heat flux w m2 at the first soil layer the linearization method was used to solve the above two equations following the coding protocol of surfex detailed information on the linearization steps can be found in appendices b besides the mulch parameters involved in solving the above two equations such as short and long wave absorptance reflectance transmittance et al can be found from yang et al 2012 2 3 data site level

temperature and precipitation from january to october in 2018 were measured by an eddy covariance ec system at wulanwusu wlws agrometeorological experiment station wang et al 2013 wlws station is a typical representation of an oasis ecosystem and a long term monitoring station in northwestern china cotton is the primary crop and its growing season starts in late april and lasts until mid september the pipeline for drip irrigation and associated plastic mulch white 0 08 mm thick are normally installed in may when the cotton is sown zhou et al 2012 the irrigation season starts from mid june and last to late august and happens 5 7 times based on six years records during the whole irrigation season see supplementary table a 1 the above observed datasets from wlws have been widely used in previous studies and the equipment placement data processing and quality monitoring procedure are described in detail in bai et al 2015 four automatic meteorological stations i e s1 s4 in fig 1 b based on the bowen technique were installed at the edges of oases in nstm hourly surface 2 m air temperature t2m and relative humidity rh were measured during the summer period i e jun aug from 2015 to 2016 the rh data in 2016 at s4 were unavailable because of the broken probe therefore the t2m and rh contain eight and seven site summers respectively monthly observations from five national meteorological stations distributed in nstm fig 1 b were used to evaluate simulated averaged summer t2m and precipitation from the coupled alaro surfex model the datasets span from 2009 to 2018 and the stations are covered by multiple land cover types lcts e g cropland grassland and bareland therefore the national meteorological stations provide an opportunity to test the performance of coupled alaro surfex model comprehensively across different lcts in this study area the detailed information of wlws eddy covariance station automatic and national meteorological stations were listed in table 1 the land cover data and corresponding physical parameters such as albedo leaf area index roughness length and emissivity among other surface parameters are provided by the global ecoclimap datasets with a total of 573 ecosystem types and 1 km spatial resolution since large scale water and land exploitation grazing and intensive urbanization have occurred in this region during recent decades which leads to dramatic changes in land use and land cover lulc change the original lct dataset in ecoclimap was updated using the independent local data generated by the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences the detailed information about the updated lct data and processing programs is described by cai et al 2020 2 4 experimental design two nested domains were designed in this study fig 1 a the coarse outer domain d1 was first run at a horizontal resolution of 25 km centered at 74 64 e 47 82 n with 349 239 grid points the 0 75 0 75 global era interim reanalysis data 2009 2018 with 6 h intervals produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf are used as the initial and boundary conditions then the downscaled 25 km outputs were used to drive the alaro surfex model on fine inner domain d2 at a horizontal resolution of 4 km centered at 86 00 e 45 00 n with 500 500 grid points our main region of interest is located in the inner domain d2 which consists of the typical mountain oasis desert system in the nstm three experiments were designed in this study to assess the individual or combined climate effects of drip irrigation and plastic mulch implemented in oasis agroecosystems on a typical mountain oasis desert system the first simulation runs with switching on the drip irrigation module dri the second with switching on both drip irrigation and plastic mulch modules mulch the last with the default runs with no drip irrigation and no plastic mulch processes default the differences in simulations between dri and default and between mulch and dri were designed to assess the isolated drip irrigation or plastic mulch induced effects respectively while the differences between mulch and default were used to assess their combined effects the modelling experiments were conducted during the summer period i e june august which overlaps the time period when intense irrigation occurs to prevent abnormal simulated fluctuations one month prior to the simulations was designed as model spin up to make the natural ecosystem reach an equilibrium soil state berckmans et al 2017 the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r were used as statistical indicators to assess the agreement between simulations and observations the statistical significance level p of the differences between the model and observations was quantified by the student s t test 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 offline evaluation of modified surfex as key components of climate models by providing lower boundary conditions at the land atmosphere interface land surface schemes affect greatly the simulation accuracy of the climate models therefore the modified surfex was first verified whether it has the potential in representing relevant surface processes in oasis agroecosystems i e drip irrigation and plastic mulch in offline mode by feeding hourly observed forcing from wlws eddy covariance station compared to the default model the overestimation of mean summer soil temperature i e topsoil layer with 5 cm depth simulated by the modified model decreased from 25 74 c to 23 94 c and had a much better linear correlation with observations during the summer period fig 3 the r increased from 0 43 to 0 61 and rmse decreased from 3 58 c to 2 32 c therefore the simulated soil temperature by modified surfex matched more closely the observations drip irrigation and plastic mulch can modify surface albedo soil moisture and associated evapotranspiration which in turn alter the surface energy balance obviously compared to the default model with no irrigation the net radiation simulated by the revised surfex increased during the summer period fig 4 the increased net radiation resulted from the irrigated wetter soil with a lower albedo and absorbing more solar radiation consequently the revised model shows a better performance with the rmse value decreasing from 14 13 w m2 to 5 24 w m2 although the correlation coefficients with observations for both default and modified models are comparable default r 0 98 vs modified r 0 99 the default model underestimated latent heat fluxes evidently and overestimated sensible heat fluxes which failed to capture the oasis effect described as the sensible heat fluxes closed to zero or negative attributed to the sensible heat fluxes moving downward in oasis desert systems during the summer time li et al 2016 however the revised model reduced sensible heat fluxes and increased latent heat fluxes significantly by adding drip irrigation and plastic mulch module furthermore the oasis effect can be simulated by the revised model to some extent despite some overestimation of sensible heat fluxes that still existed from the revised model in addition the latent and sensible heat fluxes show contrasting responses to the irrigation module with latent heat fluxes increased and sensible heat fluxes decreased by comparing to observations both latent and sensible heat fluxes improved and show a reasonable and seasonal pattern in particular the rmse decreased drastically from 117 01 and 130 28 w m2 to 49 32 and 48 56 w m2 and r increased from 0 14 and 0 15 0 63 and 0 58 for latent and sensible heat fluxes respectively however a poor performance was also found in simulating ground heat fluxes by the revised model with rmse increasing from 12 88 to 25 91 w m2 the latent heat fluxes increased rapidly after the irrigation event happens which results in some extreme values in ground heat fluxes as can be seen in fig 4 the poor performance in ground heat flux simulations may also come from the observed energy closure error only 0 53 the major reason for this was that the energy stored inside the film mulching was not considered in the energy balance bai et al 2015 the ground fluxes account only for a very small part of the surface energy partitioning and fluctuate around the value of zero and thus the modified results are acceptable overall our results show that the revised model is more in agreement with observations compared to the default configuration 3 1 2 evaluation of coupled alaro surfex the modified surfex was implemented into alaro to further evaluate the accuracy of coupled model alaro surfex the 4 km outputs downscaled by alaro surfex including t2m rh as well as pre were compared with observations all four bowen stations i e automatic meteorological stations were located at the agroecosystems which can be used as a benchmark to assess the performance of alaro surfex in irrigated croplands as clearly seen from fig 5 the default model overestimated t2m at all four stations and the difference between simulations and observations was statistically significant at the level p 0 01 however the revised model reduced it and no significant difference between observations and simulations was founded p 0 05 which indicates that the lack of considering drip irrigation and plastic mulch induced surface processes contribute to the simulated bias in the coupled model in contrast the rh was underestimated by the default model at all four bowen stations and the modified model enhanced it however the difference was still significant at the level p 0 05 despite it being decreased from the significant level p 0 01 five national meteorological stations were used to further assess the performance of alaro surfex across multiple land cover types including cropland grassland and bareland table 1 particularly the default model overestimated t2m at hutu station covered by cropland which is consistent with the evaluations at bowen stations fig 6 however the simulations are comparable at other land cover types between the default and modified model which indicates that the modified model has limited impacts on other land cover types concerning the precipitation substantial uncertainties exist for both the default and modified model and the difference between observations and simulations is almost found significantly for each station the bias ranged from 45 mm summer at daba station to in excess of 221 mm summer at anim station which suggests that convection parameterization should be further improved in future model development however evaluations averaged from all the meteorological stations show that both the default and modified model have no significant difference with observations p 0 05 because of the compensational effects this result indicates that the coupled alaro surfex model has a high potential application at regional or larger scales therefore the regional climatic effects of drip irrigation and plastic mulch will be focused on for the following analyses 3 2 climatic effects of drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch 3 2 1 effects on regional temperature and precipitation as drip irrigation and plastic mulch are two kinds of independent human activities in agricultural management practices which could transform land surface thermodynamics causing local climate changes their individual and combined impacts were quantified for the first time to the knowledge of the authors in this study fig 7 shows that all the experimental scenarios by adding irrigation processes or not can clearly distinguish the temperature differences between mountains with lower temperatures and low altitude areas i e oases and desert regions with higher temperatures however the default coupled model failed to distinguish the temperature differences between oases and surrounding desert regions where both are as high as 25 c fig 7 the drip irrigation practice could reduce the climatological mean temperature of oases as much as 3 73 0 14 c in the inner areas of oases and become weak and even gradually vanish in the peripheral areas during 2009 2018 however the implementation of a mulch module will weaken such irrigated induced cooling effect marginally by about 0 2 c with a value of 3 51 0 14 c for the precipitation all the simulations showed a similar spatial pattern that precipitation increased from less than 50 mm per summer in oasis desert areas to in excess of 350 mm in mountain areas fig 8 interestingly the implementation of irrigation exerts limited influences on irrigated cropland itself and even the precipitation is reduced slightly in contrast the precipitation was enhanced at the mid mountain areas with a value of 15 mm during the summer period furthermore the implementation of plastic mulch had marginal impacts on local precipitation with 2 86 mm averaged over the study area and no clear spatial pattern was found to explore the possible causes of irrigation induced precipitation the total precipitation was further divided into large scale and convective precipitation and computed by the difference in mulch default the pattern was similar to dri default which was not shown fig 9 interestingly the large scale precipitation varied slightly with values less than 0 1 mm hour during the diurnal cycle the total precipitation was generally consistent with the convective precipitation with the peak values occurring at 1600 lt local time utc 6 and low values at night indicating that irrigation induced convective precipitation dominated the changes in local total precipitation the impacts of irrigation on wind and specific humidity at the lowest model level at 1600 lt were presented in fig 9 b the results show that the surface vapor enhanced at oasis regions supplied by the implementation of irrigation and the increased water vapor was further carried from the plain oasis to the mountain areas during the daytime by the local mountain plain circulation system which triggers orographic convective precipitation in middle tianshan mountain areas 3 2 2 effects on boundary layer properties any changes in the boundary layer properties can lead to changes in the surface energy partitioning and further reconstruction of the surface energy budget here each component of the surface energy budget i e net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes at oasis regions was quantified under different scenarios table 2 a lower value of net radiation i e 98 83 w m2 was simulated by the default model with a lack of drip irrigation underneath the plastic mulch module however the simulations were comparable between dri and mulch experiments with the values of 121 38 and 121 39 w m2 respectively and both are higher than the default model such results are consistent with the evaluations at the wlws station that more energy will be received by triggering the irrigation module compared to the default scenario latent heat fluxes increased while sensible heat fluxes decreased under the dri experiment which is similar to the mulch simulations however latent heat fluxes were reduced by the value of 0 65 w m2 and sensible heat fluxes were enhanced by the value of 0 23 w m2 under the mulch scenario furthermore the ground heat fluxes were simulated to be the largest with a value of 4 43 w m2 under the mulch scenario which is larger than both the default and dri experiments with the values of 3 93 and 4 12 w m2 respectively 4 discussion climate models serve as an advanced tool to reconstruct historical climate state and or to explore future climate change by delivering more detailed and complicated atmospheric physical processes and land surface processes which are widely applied in the climatological hydrological and ecological studies cai et al 2019 ozdogan et al 2010 however a lack of accuracy in representing human induced surface processes within a model frame like drip irrigation and the use of plastic mulch posed a key restriction on their further applications in arid semi arid regions since such agricultural practices have been commonly carrying out for oasis agroecosystems in the extensive arid regions of northwest china therefore drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was firstly incorporated into alaro surfex and their local climate effects were further explored in this study as expected most simulated low boundary layer properties by modified alaro surfex such as soil temperature t2m as well as the latent and sensible heat fluxes are improved and get closer with observations however large uncertainties still exist for some variables such as the precipitation as almost all the stations have significant differences with simulations accuracy simulation of precipitation at the station scale is a difficult task for most current climate models hamdi et al 2012 huang et al 2013 qiu et al 2017 compared to observations simulated precipitation is strongly limited and influenced by one set of complicated physical processes described in climate models such as the cloud microphysics and cumulus schemes except for drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch in this study wang et al 2020 zong et al 2019 however no significant difference was found in the simulated precipitation averaged at the regional scale indicating that spatial precipitation variance can be captured by alaro surfex furthermore the high spatial resolution of alaro surfex simulations can be used to investigate the interplay between surface process and local atmospheric circulation which cannot be achieved by observations only despite the simulated latent heat fluxes being enhanced by the revised model from 25 27 w m2 to 138 99 w m2 during the summer period the values fluctuated substantially in particular the latent heat fluxes increased rapidly when the irrigation event happens and the shapes of peak values become sharp and narrow fig 4 however the results are inconsistent with the observations that fewer fluctuations were observed from the wlws station the underlying causes for the differences may come from the lack of ecological processes that restrict evapotranspiration in surfex such as the water absorption of the roots the designed drip irrigation theme itself as well as the prescribed parameters for the soil in surfex specifically the water demand of crop transpiration depends largely on the functions of root uptake water which regulate the water supply for transpiration jing et al 2014 li et al 2013 the maximum transpiration should be limited by the water capacity provided by the root system therefore the lack of such processes in surfex possibly caused the simulated extremely peak values of latent heat fluxes additionally the proposed drip irrigation in this study describes that the irrigated water was directly added into the soil layers based on the assumption that no water vapor will be evaporated from the soil surface underneath the plastic mulch which lacks the processes of infiltration throughout the soil column this will shorten the response time of vegetation s transpiration to the soil apart from the associated ecological processes mentioned above the uncertainties in parameterization could be an important source of such inconsistency between simulated and observed latent heat fluxes for example the moisture holding capacity of soil highly depends on the physical properties of the soil and soil state variables derived from fao soil maps masson et al 2003 in surfex dy and fung 2016 have reported that the world fao soil map with a coarse resolution of 5 min is unable to describe the soil properties accurately and tends to generate wetter properties of the soil therefore more accurate representation and localized high spatial resolution of the physical properties of soil are recommended in future model studies as mentioned above drip irrigation and the usage of plastic mulch have a high potential in affecting regional climate by modifying the surface partitioning of vapor and energy our results showed that drip irrigation can reduce the climatological mean temperature of the inner areas of oases by 3 73 0 14 c during 2009 2018 and the cooling effect gradually vanished in the peripheral areas the irrigation induced cooling effect was further explained by the surface energy partitioning with increased latent heat fluxes and decreased sensible heat fluxes such conclusions of irrigation induced cooling effects are intuitively understandable and are also widely reported by previous studies based on rcms simulations yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and the amplitude of irrigation induced cooling effect is also supported and falls within the range of 0 10 c reported by lobell et al 2009 which evaluated the effect of irrigation on temperatures in irrigated regions of the world by using the community atmosphere model cam3 3 however the cooling effect of 3 73 c is incomparable and higher than the value of 0 82 c reported by zhang et al 2019 which adopted the weather research and forecasting wrf model with a drip irrigation scheme incorporated possible reasons for the difference may come from the different proposed drip irrigation schemes in particular the dynamic drip irrigation scheme that is irrigation event would be automatically triggered by predefining the lowest threshold of soil moisture was used by zhang et al 2019 however the dynamic drip irrigation theme may induce considerable variations in irrigation timing and thus the irrigation frequency as reported by yuan et al 2019 the irrigation frequency can be triggered from 3 to 57 times during one irrigation season by using a dynamic drip irrigation scheme based on sensitivity analyses this is inconsistent with the local irrigation practices that only 5 8 times are recorded at the wlws station furthermore the irrigation amount by zhang et al 2019 is calculated by the difference between simulated canopy evapotranspiration demand and soil moisture i e 475 67 m3 ha which leads to less actual irrigation quota i e 642 m3 ha according to irrigation records from wlws used during the corresponding high evaporative demand period in their study as liu et al 2021 reported that the corresponding climate effect is highly dependent on the irrigation amounts undoubtedly the different treatments of the irrigation quota also contributed to the simulated differences in climate effects apart from the effect of drip irrigation we further concluded that the use of plastic mulch will induce a climatological mean warming effect with a value of 0 2 c caused by a suppression of evapotranspiration which will have a negative effect on mitigating climate warming however under consideration of the magnitude of the irrigation induced cooling effect and the high potential benefits of mitigating water scarcity the slight warming effect of plastic mulch can be ignored therefore plastic mulch is recommended to be used along with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in northwest china as well as other similar arid semi arid regions our results show that the implementation of drip irrigation increased precipitation by about 4 76 mm summer over the whole study area however the increase of precipitation was mainly simulated over mid mountains while the irrigation has limited impacts on the oasis itself the results are supported by previous studies based on both the observations deng et al 2015 and numerical simulations cai et al 2019 reporting a wetting trend in the mid mountains over central asia moreover the underlying causes were further explored in this study the transport of increased water vapor by irrigation transports from oasis areas to the mountain where the orographic convective precipitation is easily triggered therefore we conclude that the increase in irrigation induced precipitation was dominated by convective precipitation from mid mountain areas under mods as the sustainability of the oasis is highly dependent on the runoff from mountain areas the increased precipitation will exert a positive effect on the development of the oasis however the conclusion that the irrigation induced total precipitation is controlled by a convective component should be noted and it may not be applied to other regions for example the precipitation decreased in southern china under the impact of irrigation which is caused by the large scale circulation affected by the monsoon season liu et al 2021 therefore the irrigation induced climate impacts are different under different climate regimes moreover our results show that the increase of irrigation induced precipitation was reduced by the implementation of plastic mulch by about 2 86 mm summer resulting from the suppression of water vapor loss from the soil in oasis areas fortunately compared to the magnitude of irrigation induced wetting effects the positive effects of the hydrological cycle in mountain oasis systems still exist through the usage of plastic mulch additionally the suppression of water loss by plastic mulch also benefits the sustainability of the oasis again from the perspective of the local hydrological cycle plastic mulch is recommended to be used together with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in arid regions of northwest china some uncertainties should also be noted in this study for example all the oasis areas are treated as irrigated cropland in alaro surfex which may aggravate the cooling effects of irrigation since other land covers may also co exist within oasis areas additionally according to local practices the irrigated water comes from both the human made reservoir and the groundwater kang et al 2012 liu et al 2020 however the alaro surfex did not consider the water balance in glacier snow runoff reservoir groundwater systems which may cause some uncertainties in simulated precipitation effects therefore the related hydrological processes should be developed and are expected to improve the model accuracy further this task will be the subject of subsequent work 5 conclusion the high water saving technology drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was extensively applied in oasis agroecosystems in northwestern china which reconstructed the surface energy partitioning and thus led to local climate change in this study the coupled alaro surfex model was modified to simulate drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch agricultural practices and was further used to simulate regional climate effects under mountain oasis desert systems by comparing to the observations from bowen eddy covariance as well as meteorological stations our results show that the accuracy of the modified model was substantially improved in simulating boundary layer properties although some variables like ground heat fluxes and precipitation still need to be improved the positive climate impacts of mitigating climate warming and accelerating the local hydrological cycle were found by implementing drip irrigation while such positive impacts were marginally weakened by using plastic mulch therefore plastic mulch is highly recommended to be used along with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in central asia as well as other similar arid semi arid regions

9309,drip irrigation underneath plastic film mulch was extensively applied to mitigate water scarcity in oasis agroecosystems over arid northwest china however the local climate effects induced by the agricultural practice were still not appraised clearly especially from the perspective of the mountain oasis desert system mods a basic landscape configuration widely formed in northwest china in this study a drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch scheme was developed within the land surface model surfex and the regional climate effects during summer were further explored by coupling the regional climate model alaro to the modified surfex during 2009 2018 from a comparison to the local observations the revised regional climate model was substantially improved in simulating lower boundary layer properties including sensible and latent heat fluxes surface air temperature and soil temperature though neutral impacts were found on some variables including ground heat fluxes and precipitation the drip irrigation practice could reduce the climatological mean temperature by about 3 73 0 14 c over the oasis areas while the implementation of plastic mulch weakened such irrigation induced cooling effect marginally by about 0 2 c besides irrigation had limited influences on precipitation over oasis areas but enhanced it remotely at the mid mountain areas with a value of 15 mm during summer additionally the plastic mulch had marginal impacts on precipitation with a value of 2 86 mm summer overall these results suggest a positive climate feedback for mitigating climate warming and strengthening the local hydrological cycle in mods by using drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch in northwestern china keywords mountain oasis desert system irrigation plastic mulch surfex data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tightly connected via the runoff induced by glacier snow melt and precipitation from mountains the basic and specific landscape mountain oasis desert system mods is widely formed in the extensive arid regions of northwest china luo et al 2005 restricted by local water resources the high water saving agricultural technology drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch has been widely implemented in oasis agroecosystems which exerted significant impacts on local climate in mods through water and energy exchanges forced by local atmospheric circulations hou et al 2010 yuan et al 2019 zong et al 2021 however the modified surface processes e g water cycle and energy partitioning and associated climate effects induced by such an anthropogenic activity in oases are rarely studied over the arid region of northwest china which posed a key restriction for regional weather forecasting and climate projections in arid semi arid regions a long line of studies identified the profound climate impacts of irrigation based on various observation based in situ measurements or simulations done by global regional climate models gcms rcms chen and dirmeyer 2019 liu et al 2021 pei et al 2016 in particular by reducing soil albedo and increasing evapotranspiration the cooling effects of irrigation were documented widely at both regional and continental scales such as in northwestern india chen and dirmeyer 2019 eastern china yang et al 2016 as well as north america huang and ullrich 2016 pei et al 2016 etc however the magnitude of irrigated cooling differs among regions and the cooling effect can attenuate or even offset the effect of global warming which is mainly determined by local irrigation management practices such as the irrigation frequency and or the irrigation quota lobell et al 2009 thiery et al 2017 as with precipitation the induced effects are divergent and are still debated which are location specific and highly dependent on the local topography and background climate among other things for example a significant irrigation induced decrease in summer total precipitation was detected in southern china and the central united states liu et al 2021 pei et al 2016 this decrease was attributed to the interplay between large scale meteorological conditions and the non convective component of local precipitations yang et al 2016 in contrast more convective precipitation is easily generated in the downwind areas as a result of increased convective available potential energy such as in the northwest of china zhang et al 2019 and california central valley of the united states yang et al 2017 two local circulations mountain plain circulation and oasis desert breeze circulation co exist in the mods cai et al 2020 li et al 2016 caused by the significant differences in heat and moisture fluxes within the horizontal boundary layer consequently the water and energy cycles are extensively influenced by local circulations through vapor and energy transport horizontally cai et al 2020 however how will irrigation influences local climate under such a special mods geomorphology and their underlying physical mechanisms are still unclear by the high capacity to reduce water loss from the soil surface and thus to mitigate water scarcity plastic mulch has a high potential for applications in arid regions yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2012 however the usage of plastic mulch is also expected to alter the local climate by modifying exchanges of water and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere yuan et al 2019 for example less radiation will be absorbed by the white plastic film with higher albedo while more energy will be stored inside the plastic mulch as a result of suppressing energy loss through latent heat fluxes fan et al 2015 ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 furthermore the daily soil temperature would be 2 9 c higher inside the plastic mulch than that outside the mulch based on field experiments wang et al 2009 in addition the local precipitation will decrease with a reduction of water vapor in the lower atmosphere wu et al 2020 overall previous studies identified the surface energy transfers between soil mulch vegetation systems at a site scale or simulated possible changes in some key climate variables under specific bulk assumptions but none evaluated its climate effects by coupling to drip irrigation at site specific or regional scales land surface models lsms coupled with global or regional climate models serve as advanced tools for simulating biogeochemical and biophysical mechanisms including representations of water carbon and energy processes and these lsms have been widely applied to study irrigation and or plastic mulch induced surface processes wu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 two kinds of irrigation schemes i e dynamic and fixed irrigation schemes can be roughly classified based on previous studies the difference between them is how the irrigation module is triggered in lsms yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 more specifically dynamic irrigation schemes are usually designed to be triggered under specific weather or soil moisture conditions by predefining thresholds lobell et al 2009 yang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 while the fixed irrigation schemes used a constant value of irrigation frequency or realistic irrigation amount regardless of the climatic conditions lo and famiglietti 2013 ozdogan et al 2010 sacks et al 2009 however to date none of them has been accepted universally as irrigation practices can differ markedly between regions in addition the physical processes induced by plastic mulch were also attempted to be incorporated into lsms based on surface energy balance theory ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 or by modifying some key surface variables empirically such as the albedo and soil evaporation wu et al 2020 however these studies were based on the assumption that the soil surface was fully only covered by mulch but none of them considered the real agricultural practices that the soil surface was covered partly e g 80 according to the records in northwest china zhou et al 2012 and further explored their regional climate effects as mods is generally distributed fragmentally in arid regions rcms are preferable for modeling the climate impacts at regional scales coupled with the externalized surface scheme surface externalisée surfex the regional climate model alaro allows numerical simulation at a high spatial resolution of 4 km which provides an alternative for the climate simulation at mods therefore the first object in this study is to develop a drip irrigation underneath the plastic mulch module to simulate vapor and energy fluxes within surfex and evaluate it in offline mode the second focus of this study aims to quantify the climate effects induced by the above high water saving technology on a typical mods in northwest china based on coupled alaro surfex simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tianshan mountain located deep inside the eurasian continent 39 30 45 45 n 74 10 96 15 e is the largest mountain system in central asia ca with peaks ranging from 4000 to 6000 m gheyret et al 2020 the tianshan mountain is regarded as the ca s water tower by providing the water resource for supporting human activities including industrial and agricultural water usage as well as for maintaining the stability of the ecological systems in the downstream areas the study area of interest 43 12 46 12 n 83 24 88 47 e located in the north slope of tianshan mountain nstm is the largest and one of the typical mods in ca with mountain oasis and desert accounting for 34 6 18 2 and 47 2 respectively this region is characterized by long term high temperatures and less precipitation and is strongly influenced by a continental climate with a mean annual temperature of around 6 c and an annual precipitation amount of around 220 mm cai et al 2019 stressed by water scarcity the cropland is almost covered by irrigated plants and the artificial reservoir and groundwater provide the main steady source of water for irrigation with a rapid increase in population and the associated demand for water consumption since the 21st century drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was widely applied instead of traditional flood irrigation and the irrigation quota has dropped by almost twice during the period 2000 2018 from more than 1000 mm m2 to about 500 mm m2 zhang et al 2019 2

global database with a spatial resolution of 1 km masson et al 2003 surfex can be run either in a coupled mode in which case the atmospheric forcing is provided by the host atmospheric model or in a stand alone mode although the coupled alaro surfex has proven its high skills in regional climate simulations in europe its application in ca still faces challenges because of a lack of considering specific oasis agroecosystem management practices e g drip irrigation and the use of plastic mulch therefore the key modifications and improvements are addressed as follows 2 2 2 drip irrigation scheme to represent the actual local irrigation induced surface processes in surfex the fixed irrigation scheme was adopted in this study two irrigation parameters i e irrigation timing and irrigation amount were proposed for the drip irrigation module based on the field records the irrigation season usually lasts from mid june to the end of august and the total number of irrigation ranges from five to seven times supplementary table a 1 accordingly the irrigation module in surfex was designed to be triggered starting from 15th june with a 10 days interval each irrigation event starts at 10 00 am and lasts two hours therefore eight total irrigation times were triggered during the whole irrigation season which approximates the record range i e 5 7 times the annual mean irrigation quota varied substantially from 407 m3 ha to 1045 m3 ha during 2009 2018 the averaged value of the available six years records i e 642 m3 ha see supplementary table a 1 was calculated as the climatological mean irrigation quota since evaporation is minimal or could be negligible because of the usage of plastic mulch the irrigation water is added directly into the root zones at the top two soil layers with a total of 45 cm in surfex specifically the irrigation water was first added into the first soil layer if the first layer is saturated the rest water was added into the second layer the equations can be addressed as follows 1 s 1 ρ m θ s d 1 s 2 ρ m θ 2 d 2 a ρ m θ s θ 1 d 1 where θ s is the field capacity m 3 m 3 θ 1 and θ 2 are the actual soil volumetric content m3 m3 at the first and second soil layer in surfex respectively d 1 and d 2 are the depth of soil at the first and second soil layer m respectively ρ m is the water density kg m3 s 1 and s 2 are the soil water content kg m3 at the first and second soil layer after drip irrigation a is the irrigation quota kg the first soil layer would be saturated after the irrigation events since its depth is only 5 cm in surfex and the saturated water content is much lower than the irrigation quota 2 2 3 plastic mulch scheme following the energy balance theory the original surface energy partitioning was redistributed by using plastic mulch in particular the white transparent mulch has a higher albedo than the soil and thus the surface absorbs less radiation however its high transmittance can still enable the soil to receive a certain amount of energy meanwhile it can reduce the energy loss from the soil to the atmosphere in the form of latent heat fluxes and increase the ground heat fluxes transported to the deeper layer of the soil therefore the use of plastic mulch forms a new energy balance on the surface of the soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 the energy transfer process is shown in fig 2 the surface energy balance equation proposed in this study is based on the local practices in the northwest arid regions of china that the soil is only covered partly about 80 zhou et al 2012 which is different from previous studies where the energy balance equations were based on an ideal assumption that the soil surface is fully covered by mulch therefore the energy transfer between the land and the atmosphere is divided into two parts one portion will be covered by mulch and the other will not be covered by mulch besides two assumptions were made following previous studies ham and kluitenberg 1994 yang et al 2012 і no water vapor loss from plastic mulch considering the planting holes are very small іі heat storage in the plastic mulch is negligible since the plastic mulch is very thin finally the energy balance equations for the land surface soil and mulch can be expressed as follows the energy balance for the plastic mulch layer 2 r n m h m h m s 0 given the surface temperature equation for the first layer of soil having a portion δ m of ground covered by the mulch and a portion δ v of vegetation see fig 2 the energy balance for the canopy layer can be expressed as 3 c s t t s t s r n δ m h m s 1 δ m h s 1 δ m le s δ v le v g where the sign means the value is calculated at the previous time t c s is the soil heat capacity j m3 k t is the time step s of model simulations t s is the soil surface temperature k at time t t r n is the net radiation w m2 received by the soil surface which includes two parts covered and not covered by plastic mulch r n m is the net radiation w m2 received by plastic mulch h m and h m s are the sensible heat flux w m2 from plastic mulch surface and between the plastic mulch and soil respectively h s is the sensible heat flux w m2 from the soil outside the plastic mulch le s is the latent heat flux w m2 from the soil outside the plastic mulch le v is the latent heat flux w m2 from the vegetation g is the ground heat flux w m2 at the first soil layer the linearization method was used to solve the above two equations following the coding protocol of surfex detailed information on the linearization steps can be found in appendices b besides the mulch parameters involved in solving the above two equations such as short and long wave absorptance reflectance transmittance et al can be found from yang et al 2012 2 3 data site level hourly surface fluxes i e vapor energy and co2 fluxes and corresponding hourly meteorological variables including downward long and short radiation wind speed pressure specific humidity air temperature and precipitation from january to october in 2018 were measured by an eddy covariance ec system at wulanwusu wlws agrometeorological experiment station wang et al 2013 wlws station is a typical representation of an oasis ecosystem and a long term monitoring station in northwestern china cotton is the primary crop and its growing season starts in late april and lasts until mid september the pipeline for drip irrigation and associated plastic mulch white 0 08 mm thick are normally installed in may when the cotton is sown zhou et al 2012 the irrigation season starts from mid june and last to late august and happens 5 7 times based on six years records during the whole irrigation season see supplementary table a 1 the above observed datasets from wlws have been widely used in previous studies and the equipment placement data processing and quality monitoring procedure are described in detail in bai et al 2015 four automatic meteorological stations i e s1 s4 in fig 1 b based on the bowen technique were installed at the edges of oases in nstm hourly surface 2 m air temperature t2m and relative humidity rh were measured during the summer period i e jun aug from 2015 to 2016 the rh data in 2016 at s4 were unavailable because of the broken probe therefore the t2m and rh contain eight and seven site summers respectively monthly observations from five national meteorological stations distributed in nstm fig 1 b were used to evaluate simulated averaged summer t2m and precipitation from the coupled alaro surfex model the datasets span from 2009 to 2018 and the stations are covered by multiple land cover types lcts e g cropland grassland and bareland therefore the national meteorological stations provide an opportunity to test the performance of coupled alaro surfex model comprehensively across different lcts in this study area the detailed information of wlws eddy covariance station automatic and national meteorological stations were listed in table 1 the land cover data and corresponding physical parameters such as albedo leaf area index roughness length and emissivity among other surface parameters are provided by the global ecoclimap datasets with a total of 573 ecosystem types and 1 km spatial resolution since large scale water and land exploitation grazing and intensive urbanization have occurred in this region during recent decades which leads to dramatic changes in land use and land cover lulc change the original lct dataset in ecoclimap was updated using the independent local data generated by the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences the detailed information about the updated lct data and processing programs is described by cai et al 2020 2 4 experimental design two nested domains were designed in this study fig 1 a the coarse outer domain d1 was first run at a horizontal resolution of 25 km centered at 74 64 e 47 82 n with 349 239 grid points the 0 75 0 75 global era interim reanalysis data 2009 2018 with 6 h intervals produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf are used as the initial and boundary conditions then the downscaled 25 km outputs were used to drive the alaro surfex model on fine inner domain d2 at a horizontal resolution of 4 km centered at 86 00 e 45 00 n with 500 500 grid points our main region of interest is located in the inner domain d2 which consists of the typical mountain oasis desert system in the nstm three experiments were designed in this study to assess the individual or combined climate effects of drip irrigation and plastic mulch implemented in oasis agroecosystems on a typical mountain oasis desert system the first simulation runs with switching on the drip irrigation module dri the second with switching on both drip irrigation and plastic mulch modules mulch the last with the default runs with no drip irrigation and no plastic mulch processes default the differences in simulations between dri and default and between mulch and dri were designed to assess the isolated drip irrigation or plastic mulch induced effects respectively while the differences between mulch and default were used to assess their combined effects the modelling experiments were conducted during the summer period i e june august which overlaps the time period when intense irrigation occurs to prevent abnormal simulated fluctuations one month prior to the simulations was designed as model spin up to make the natural ecosystem reach an equilibrium soil state berckmans et al 2017 the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r were used as statistical indicators to assess the agreement between simulations and observations the statistical significance level p of the differences between the model and observations was quantified by the student s t test 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 offline evaluation of modified surfex as key components of climate models by providing lower boundary conditions at the land atmosphere interface land surface schemes affect greatly the simulation accuracy of the climate models therefore the modified surfex was first verified whether it has the potential in representing relevant surface processes in oasis agroecosystems i e drip irrigation and plastic mulch in offline mode by feeding hourly observed forcing from wlws eddy covariance station compared to the default model the overestimation of mean summer soil temperature i e topsoil layer with 5 cm depth simulated by the modified model decreased from 25 74 c to 23 94 c and had a much better linear correlation with observations during the summer period fig 3 the r increased from 0 43 to 0 61 and rmse decreased from 3 58 c to 2 32 c therefore the simulated soil temperature by modified surfex matched more closely the observations drip irrigation and plastic mulch can modify surface albedo soil moisture and associated evapotranspiration which in turn alter the surface energy balance obviously compared to the default model with no irrigation the net radiation simulated by the revised surfex increased during the summer period fig 4 the increased net radiation resulted from the irrigated wetter soil with a lower albedo and absorbing more solar radiation consequently the revised model shows a better performance with the rmse value decreasing from 14 13 w m2 to 5 24 w m2 although the correlation coefficients with observations for both default and modified models are comparable default r 0 98 vs modified r 0 99 the default model underestimated latent heat fluxes evidently and overestimated sensible heat fluxes which failed to capture the oasis effect described as the sensible heat fluxes closed to zero or negative attributed to the sensible heat fluxes moving downward in oasis desert systems during the summer time li et al 2016 however the revised model reduced sensible heat fluxes and increased latent heat fluxes significantly by adding drip irrigation and plastic mulch module furthermore the oasis effect can be simulated by the revised model to some extent despite some overestimation of sensible heat fluxes that still existed from the revised model in addition the latent and sensible heat fluxes show contrasting responses to the irrigation module with latent heat fluxes increased and sensible heat fluxes decreased by comparing to observations both latent and sensible heat fluxes improved and show a reasonable and seasonal pattern in particular the rmse decreased drastically from 117 01 and 130 28 w m2 to 49 32 and 48 56 w m2 and r increased from 0 14 and 0 15 0 63 and 0 58 for latent and sensible heat fluxes respectively however a poor performance was also found in simulating ground heat fluxes by the revised model with rmse increasing from 12 88 to 25 91 w m2 the latent heat fluxes increased rapidly after the irrigation event happens which results in some extreme values in ground heat fluxes as can be seen in fig 4 the poor performance in ground heat flux simulations may also come from the observed energy closure error only 0 53 the major reason for this was that the energy stored inside the film mulching was not considered in the energy balance bai et al 2015 the ground fluxes account only for a very small part of the surface energy partitioning and fluctuate around the value of zero and thus the modified results are acceptable overall our results show that the revised model is more in agreement with observations compared to the default configuration 3 1 2 evaluation of coupled alaro surfex the modified surfex was implemented into alaro to further evaluate the accuracy of coupled model alaro surfex the 4 km outputs downscaled by alaro surfex including t2m rh as well as pre were compared with observations all four bowen stations i e automatic meteorological stations were located at the agroecosystems which can be used as a benchmark to assess the performance of alaro surfex in irrigated croplands as clearly seen from fig 5 the default model overestimated t2m at all four stations and the difference between simulations and observations was statistically significant at the level p 0 01 however the revised model reduced it and no significant difference between observations and simulations was founded p 0 05 which indicates that the lack of considering drip irrigation and plastic mulch induced surface processes contribute to the simulated bias in the coupled model in contrast the rh was underestimated by the default model at all four bowen stations and the modified model enhanced it however the difference was still significant at the level p 0 05 despite it being decreased from the significant level p 0 01 five national meteorological stations were used to further assess the performance of alaro surfex across multiple land cover types including cropland grassland and bareland table 1 particularly the default model overestimated t2m at hutu station covered by cropland which is consistent with the evaluations at bowen stations fig 6 however the simulations are comparable at other land cover types between the default and modified model which indicates that the modified model has limited impacts on other land cover types concerning the precipitation substantial uncertainties exist for both the default and modified model and the difference between observations and simulations is almost found significantly for each station the bias ranged from 45 mm summer at daba station to in excess of 221 mm summer at anim station which suggests that convection parameterization should be further improved in future model development however evaluations averaged from all the meteorological stations show that both the default and modified model have no significant difference with observations p 0 05 because of the compensational effects this result indicates that the coupled alaro surfex model has a high potential application at regional or larger scales therefore the regional climatic effects of drip irrigation and plastic mulch will be focused on for the following analyses 3 2 climatic effects of drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch 3 2 1 effects on regional temperature and precipitation as drip irrigation and plastic mulch are two kinds of independent human activities in agricultural management practices which could transform land surface thermodynamics causing local climate changes their individual and combined impacts were quantified for the first time to the knowledge of the authors in this study fig 7 shows that all the experimental scenarios by adding irrigation processes or not can clearly distinguish the temperature differences between mountains with lower temperatures and low altitude areas i e oases and desert regions with higher temperatures however the default coupled model failed to distinguish the temperature differences between oases and surrounding desert regions where both are as high as 25 c fig 7 the drip irrigation practice could reduce the climatological mean temperature of oases as much as 3 73 0 14 c in the inner areas of oases and become weak and even gradually vanish in the peripheral areas during 2009 2018 however the implementation of a mulch module will weaken such irrigated induced cooling effect marginally by about 0 2 c with a value of 3 51 0 14 c for the precipitation all the simulations showed a similar spatial pattern that precipitation increased from less than 50 mm per summer in oasis desert areas to in excess of 350 mm in mountain areas fig 8 interestingly the implementation of irrigation exerts limited influences on irrigated cropland itself and even the precipitation is reduced slightly in contrast the precipitation was enhanced at the mid mountain areas with a value of 15 mm during the summer period furthermore the implementation of plastic mulch had marginal impacts on local precipitation with 2 86 mm averaged over the study area and no clear spatial pattern was found to explore the possible causes of irrigation induced precipitation the total precipitation was further divided into large scale and convective precipitation and computed by the difference in mulch default the pattern was similar to dri default which was not shown fig 9 interestingly the large scale precipitation varied slightly with values less than 0 1 mm hour during the diurnal cycle the total precipitation was generally consistent with the convective precipitation with the peak values occurring at 1600 lt local time utc 6 and low values at night indicating that irrigation induced convective precipitation dominated the changes in local total precipitation the impacts of irrigation on wind and specific humidity at the lowest model level at 1600 lt were presented in fig 9 b the results show that the surface vapor enhanced at oasis regions supplied by the implementation of irrigation and the increased water vapor was further carried from the plain oasis to the mountain areas during the daytime by the local mountain plain circulation system which triggers orographic convective precipitation in middle tianshan mountain areas 3 2 2 effects on boundary layer properties any changes in the boundary layer properties can lead to changes in the surface energy partitioning and further reconstruction of the surface energy budget here each component of the surface energy budget i e net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes at oasis regions was quantified under different scenarios table 2 a lower value of net radiation i e 98 83 w m2 was simulated by the default model with a lack of drip irrigation underneath the plastic mulch module however the simulations were comparable between dri and mulch experiments with the values of 121 38 and 121 39 w m2 respectively and both are higher than the default model such results are consistent with the evaluations at the wlws station that more energy will be received by triggering the irrigation module compared to the default scenario latent heat fluxes increased while sensible heat fluxes decreased under the dri experiment which is similar to the mulch simulations however latent heat fluxes were reduced by the value of 0 65 w m2 and sensible heat fluxes were enhanced by the value of 0 23 w m2 under the mulch scenario furthermore the ground heat fluxes were simulated to be the largest with a value of 4 43 w m2 under the mulch scenario which is larger than both the default and dri experiments with the values of 3 93 and 4 12 w m2 respectively 4 discussion climate models serve as an advanced tool to reconstruct historical climate state and or to explore future climate change by delivering more detailed and complicated atmospheric physical processes and land surface processes which are widely applied in the climatological hydrological and ecological studies cai et al 2019 ozdogan et al 2010 however a lack of accuracy in representing human induced surface processes within a model frame like drip irrigation and the use of plastic mulch posed a key restriction on their further applications in arid semi arid regions since such agricultural practices have been commonly carrying out for oasis agroecosystems in the extensive arid regions of northwest china therefore drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was firstly incorporated into alaro surfex and their local climate effects were further explored in this study as expected most simulated low boundary layer properties by modified alaro surfex such as soil temperature t2m as well as the latent and sensible heat fluxes are improved and get closer with observations however large uncertainties still exist for some variables such as the precipitation as almost all the stations have significant differences with simulations accuracy simulation of precipitation at the station scale is a difficult task for most current climate models hamdi et al 2012 huang et al 2013 qiu et al 2017 compared to observations simulated precipitation is strongly limited and influenced by one set of complicated physical processes described in climate models such as the cloud microphysics and cumulus schemes except for drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch in this study wang et al 2020 zong et al 2019 however no significant difference was found in the simulated precipitation averaged at the regional scale indicating that spatial precipitation variance can be captured by alaro surfex furthermore the high spatial resolution of alaro surfex simulations can be used to investigate the interplay between surface process and local atmospheric circulation which cannot be achieved by observations only despite the simulated latent heat fluxes being enhanced by the revised model from 25 27 w m2 to 138 99 w m2 during the summer period the values fluctuated substantially in particular the latent heat fluxes increased rapidly when the irrigation event happens and the shapes of peak values become sharp and narrow fig 4 however the results are inconsistent with the observations that fewer fluctuations were observed from the wlws station the underlying causes for the differences may come from the lack of ecological processes that restrict evapotranspiration in surfex such as the water absorption of the roots the designed drip irrigation theme itself as well as the prescribed parameters for the soil in surfex specifically the water demand of crop transpiration depends largely on the functions of root uptake water which regulate the water supply for transpiration jing et al 2014 li et al 2013 the maximum transpiration should be limited by the water capacity provided by the root system therefore the lack of such processes in surfex possibly caused the simulated extremely peak values of latent heat fluxes additionally the proposed drip irrigation in this study describes that the irrigated water was directly added into the soil layers based on the assumption that no water vapor will be evaporated from the soil surface underneath the plastic mulch which lacks the processes of infiltration throughout the soil column this will shorten the response time of vegetation s transpiration to the soil apart from the associated ecological processes mentioned above the uncertainties in parameterization could be an important source of such inconsistency between simulated and observed latent heat fluxes for example the moisture holding capacity of soil highly depends on the physical properties of the soil and soil state variables derived from fao soil maps masson et al 2003 in surfex dy and fung 2016 have reported that the world fao soil map with a coarse resolution of 5 min is unable to describe the soil properties accurately and tends to generate wetter properties of the soil therefore more accurate representation and localized high spatial resolution of the physical properties of soil are recommended in future model studies as mentioned above drip irrigation and the usage of plastic mulch have a high potential in affecting regional climate by modifying the surface partitioning of vapor and energy our results showed that drip irrigation can reduce the climatological mean temperature of the inner areas of oases by 3 73 0 14 c during 2009 2018 and the cooling effect gradually vanished in the peripheral areas the irrigation induced cooling effect was further explained by the surface energy partitioning with increased latent heat fluxes and decreased sensible heat fluxes such conclusions of irrigation induced cooling effects are intuitively understandable and are also widely reported by previous studies based on rcms simulations yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and the amplitude of irrigation induced cooling effect is also supported and falls within the range of 0 10 c reported by lobell et al 2009 which evaluated the effect of irrigation on temperatures in irrigated regions of the world by using the community atmosphere model cam3 3 however the cooling effect of 3 73 c is incomparable and higher than the value of 0 82 c reported by zhang et al 2019 which adopted the weather research and forecasting wrf model with a drip irrigation scheme incorporated possible reasons for the difference may come from the different proposed drip irrigation schemes in particular the dynamic drip irrigation scheme that is irrigation event would be automatically triggered by predefining the lowest threshold of soil moisture was used by zhang et al 2019 however the dynamic drip irrigation theme may induce considerable variations in irrigation timing and thus the irrigation frequency as reported by yuan et al 2019 the irrigation frequency can be triggered from 3 to 57 times during one irrigation season by using a dynamic drip irrigation scheme based on sensitivity analyses this is inconsistent with the local irrigation practices that only 5 8 times are recorded at the wlws station furthermore the irrigation amount by zhang et al 2019 is calculated by the difference between simulated canopy evapotranspiration demand and soil moisture i e 475 67 m3 ha which leads to less actual irrigation quota i e 642 m3 ha according to irrigation records from wlws used during the corresponding high evaporative demand period in their study as liu et al 2021 reported that the corresponding climate effect is highly dependent on the irrigation amounts undoubtedly the different treatments of the irrigation quota also contributed to the simulated differences in climate effects apart from the effect of drip irrigation we further concluded that the use of plastic mulch will induce a climatological mean warming effect with a value of 0 2 c caused by a suppression of evapotranspiration which will have a negative effect on mitigating climate warming however under consideration of the magnitude of the irrigation induced cooling effect and the high potential benefits of mitigating water scarcity the slight warming effect of plastic mulch can be ignored therefore plastic mulch is recommended to be used along with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in northwest china as well as other similar arid semi arid regions our results show that the implementation of drip irrigation increased precipitation by about 4 76 mm summer over the whole study area however the increase of precipitation was mainly simulated over mid mountains while the irrigation has limited impacts on the oasis itself the results are supported by previous studies based on both the observations deng et al 2015 and numerical simulations cai et al 2019 reporting a wetting trend in the mid mountains over central asia moreover the underlying causes were further explored in this study the transport of increased water vapor by irrigation transports from oasis areas to the mountain where the orographic convective precipitation is easily triggered therefore we conclude that the increase in irrigation induced precipitation was dominated by convective precipitation from mid mountain areas under mods as the sustainability of the oasis is highly dependent on the runoff from mountain areas the increased precipitation will exert a positive effect on the development of the oasis however the conclusion that the irrigation induced total precipitation is controlled by a convective component should be noted and it may not be applied to other regions for example the precipitation decreased in southern china under the impact of irrigation which is caused by the large scale circulation affected by the monsoon season liu et al 2021 therefore the irrigation induced climate impacts are different under different climate regimes moreover our results show that the increase of irrigation induced precipitation was reduced by the implementation of plastic mulch by about 2 86 mm summer resulting from the suppression of water vapor loss from the soil in oasis areas fortunately compared to the magnitude of irrigation induced wetting effects the positive effects of the hydrological cycle in mountain oasis systems still exist through the usage of plastic mulch additionally the suppression of water loss by plastic mulch also benefits the sustainability of the oasis again from the perspective of the local hydrological cycle plastic mulch is recommended to be used together with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in arid regions of northwest china some uncertainties should also be noted in this study for example all the oasis areas are treated as irrigated cropland in alaro surfex which may aggravate the cooling effects of irrigation since other land covers may also co exist within oasis areas additionally according to local practices the irrigated water comes from both the human made reservoir and the groundwater kang et al 2012 liu et al 2020 however the alaro surfex did not consider the water balance in glacier snow runoff reservoir groundwater systems which may cause some uncertainties in simulated precipitation effects therefore the related hydrological processes should be developed and are expected to improve the model accuracy further this task will be the subject of subsequent work 5 conclusion the high water saving technology drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch was extensively applied in oasis agroecosystems in northwestern china which reconstructed the surface energy partitioning and thus led to local climate change in this study the coupled alaro surfex model was modified to simulate drip irrigation underneath plastic mulch agricultural practices and was further used to simulate regional climate effects under mountain oasis desert systems by comparing to the observations from bowen eddy covariance as well as meteorological stations our results show that the accuracy of the modified model was substantially improved in simulating boundary layer properties although some variables like ground heat fluxes and precipitation still need to be improved the positive climate impacts of mitigating climate warming and accelerating the local hydrological cycle were found by implementing drip irrigation while such positive impacts were marginally weakened by using plastic mulch therefore plastic mulch is highly recommended to be used along with drip irrigation in oasis agroecosystems in central asia as well as other similar arid semi arid regions
