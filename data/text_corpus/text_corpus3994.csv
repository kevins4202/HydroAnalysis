19970,drinking water is frequently recontaminated during transport and storage when water is poured into jerrycans to address this issue three strategies aiming at reducing these recontamination risks were implemented at water kiosks in eastern uganda in all three strategies water at the kiosks was chlorinated to a free residual chlorine frc concentration of 2 mg l at the tap of the kiosk in addition water was collected in different containers for drinking water transport a uncleaned jerrycans b cleaned jerrycans and c cleaned improved containers with a wide mouth and a spigot water quality in the containers was compared to that of a control group collecting unchlorinated water in uncleaned jerrycans water samples were collected at the tap of the kiosk from the containers of 135 households after they were filled at the tap and from the same containers in the households after 24 h of water storage the samples were analysed for counts of e coli total coliforms and frc household interviews and structured observations were conducted to identify confounding variables and to assess the influence of water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and practices on recontamination all three intervention strategies contributed to significantly lower e coli recontamination levels after 24 h than in the control group median mdn 9 cfu 100 ml interquartile range iqr 25 median e coli counts and mean frc consumption were higher in uncleaned jerrycans median 1 cfu 100 ml iqr 6 δfrc 1 8 mg l than in cleaned jerrycans median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 2 δfrc 1 6 mg l and the lowest in cleaned improved containers median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 0 δfrc 1 2 mg l the frc concentration at the tap of 2 mg l was too low to protect water from e coli recontamination in uncleaned jerrycans over 24 h cleaning the jerrycans was inconvenient due to their small openings therefore sand was used the cleaning with sand reduced recontamination with e coli but did not reduce the count of total coliforms improved containers with a larger opening allowed for cleaning with a brush and showed the lowest levels of recontamination for both e coli and total coliforms in addition to the intervention strategies households receiving a higher number of wash education visits within the previous year had lower recontamination levels of e coli in stored water or 0 54 p 0 003 keywords maximum 6

safe drinking water and sanitation for all by 2030 achieving sdg 6 is a global human right and supports good health and gender equality who 2015 nevertheless progress is slow and access to safe water for everyone has yet to be achieved globally at least 2 3 billion people used drinking water services that were not safely managed in 2017 who 2019 contaminated water can transmit diseases such as diarrhoea cholera dysentery typhoid and polio and is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year prüss ustün et al 2019 the establishment of water kiosks is a strategy for improving access to safe drinking water at community level in remote rural areas thompson et al 2000 mcgranahan et al 2006 opryszko et al 2009 sima and elimelech 2013 various technologies have been installed in water kiosks that mostly deliver high quality water at the tap huttinger et al 2015 peter 2015 patrick et al 2017 however keeping water safe until consumption has been a challenge opryszko et al 2013 in eastern uganda the majority of people living along the shores of lake victoria use untreated water from the lake as their drinking water source to address this issue eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology in collaboration with an ngo africa water solutions established five water kiosks with gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane gdm technology in the busia and namayingo districts an analysis revealed that the gdm system produces high quality treated water peter et al 2016 however a follow up study to check the quality of water from the kiosks in households showed that the water is often recontaminated during transport and storage in households meierhofer et al 2017 recontamination after collection is a frequently reported concern opryszko et al 2013 wright et al 2004 mellor et al 2013 previous research has identified hands utensils for fetching water and transport and storage canisters as the main sources of water deterioration trevett et al 2005 opryszko et al 2013 mellor et al 2013 an effective cost efficient and locally available method for ensuring safe storage of drinking water even under poor hygienic conditions is the addition of chlorine to the water chlorine provides protection against bacteria and viruses as long as sufficient free residual chlorine frc is present murphy et al 2016 correct dosage is crucial to ensuring safe drinking water during storage the who recommends dosing to a concentration of 2 mg l of frc for non turbid water at the point of delivery in stored water a minimum chlorine concentration of 0 2 mg l should remain to prevent recontamination who 2017 container material can influence chlorine degradation clay pots were found to consume more chlorine than plastic ones more organic materials were observed on the inner surface and these probably consumed chlorine murphy et al 2009 in addition to the material the container is made from its design has an impact on water quality containers are often kept at ground level making them easily accessible to children and animals which could be a reason for water deterioration steele et al 2008 hence it is important to cover containers with lids and to store them above floor level water often deteriorates during extraction due to contact with contaminated hands cups and ladles jagals et al 2003 hands can be prevented from entering by integrating a spout for extraction this solution was evaluated in a refugee camp in malawi roberts et al 2001 several studies have evaluated the use of containers with narrow openings that prevent hands from entering the canister and found better water quality than containers with larger openings mintz et al 1995 reed et al 2011 mellor et al 2013 levy et al 2014 found higher contamination levels in containers with openings larger than 8 cm although narrow openings impede contact with possible contamination sources they also hinder systematic cleaning with a brush the regular use of drinking water containers without proper cleaning leads to the formation of a biofilm on the container s inner walls this biofilm harbours bacterial colonies provides them with food for growth and protects them from disinfection thus increasing the risk of contaminating water that is poured into the containers harris et al 2013 budeli et al 2018 jagals et al 2003 mellor et al 2013 hence thorough cleaning of the containers may be a method for eliminating this source of recontamination methods applied to remove the biofilm from the walls of containers with a narrow opening include scouring with sand and stones and disinfection with chlorine steele et al 2008 scouring with sand and stones however entails the risk of scratching the walls of the container which would offer a niche for bacteria to grow van der merwe et al 2012 whereas disinfection with chlorine supports the prevention of recontamination when the container is filled however relying solely on disinfecting the containers with chlorine was found to be insufficient to protecting the water during transport and storage steele et al 2008 as mentioned above elements of poor household hygiene such as contaminated hands utensils and containers play a major role in recontamination pathways therefore household factors such as water handling and hygiene conditions may increase the risk of recontaminating drinking water during storage in the household a study in ghana found that increased education was not related to improved drinking water quality and attributed this to a lack of water sanitation and hygiene wash training opryszko et al 2013 a study in india failed to find any statistically significant correlation between recontamination of drinking water in households and demographics sanitation or household practices of water handling and hygiene but it detected a slight correlation between increased contamination and a higher number of household members with lower average ages eshcol et al 2008 another study in kenya linked a higher frequency of users cleaning the storage container to a higher water quality meierhofer et al 2019 however the practice of transferring water from smaller transport containers to larger storage containers was found to add another source of contamination opryszko et al 2013 the goal of this study was to evaluate whether systematic cleaning of water containers prior to filling them and the use of improved containers with a wide mouth and a spigot in addition to chlorinating water at the point of distribution can further reduce the recontamination risk while storing the water over 24 h in households the study also assessed the impact of container handling and hygiene conditions in households on water quality changes during storage 2 methods 2 1 study design the study was implemented using a quasi experimental design with the inclusion of intervention randomization at three sites where community scale water treatment systems using gdm filtration provide water to the local communities through water kiosks lugala bulundira and bumeru in eastern uganda due to the small number of only five water kiosks in the area a random selection of sites was not possible a matching approach was applied to select three sites and reduce the potential confounding due to non randomization variables defining the socio economic conditions water handling and hygiene conditions in the control and intervention sites were assessed and variables with statistically significant differences between the sites identified during analysis these potential confounders were included in the multivariate regression model to control for a potential bias details of the sites and analysis of difference are presented in table a of the supplementary materials for all three sites the water is sourced from lake victoria and pumped through pipelines to the water treatment system in the community the treated water is provided to the local schools and can be purchased by households living in the community customers collect the water purchased at the kiosk s taps in their own containers for a price of 0 026 usd per 20 l container each of the kiosks is run by a local operator who is supported by a water management committee peter varbanets et al 2017 three intervention strategies were implemented to reduce recontamination risks in stored drinking water water in the safe water tank of the kiosk was manually chlorinated each day under supervision of the research team with sodium hypochlorite to obtain a concentration of 2 mg l of frc at the tap at all sites except the control site different containers were used to collect and transport the drinking water at the intervention sites customers at the control site where water was not chlorinated used uncleaned common jerrycans at site 1 customers used the same type of uncleaned jerrycans strategy 1 while water was chlorinated at the water kiosk half of the customers at site 2 used cleaned jerrycans strategy 2 and the other half used cleaned improved containers strategy 3 at site 2 strategy 2 and 3 all containers jerrycans and improved containers used by the customers were cleaned by the kiosk operator before filling them with water at the kiosk the improved container had a larger opening to facilitate easy cleaning a tap for drawing water during storage and two handles for carrying fig 1 the jerrycans were cleaned by introducing a handful of sand and some water into the jerrycans and shaking them for about 1 min afterwards the sand was rinsed out with about 10 l of water then the jerrycans were filled with 5 l of water mixed with liquid soap shaken and rinsed again with water the improved containers were cleaned by inserting liquid soap and about 2 l of water and using a brush to remove the biofilm afterwards they were rinsed with about 5 l of water chlorinated water from the water kiosk was used for all cleaning processes there was no need to clean the improved containers with sand because the larger opening allowed for a brush to enter and remove the biofilm from the inner walls the jerrycans and improved containers were always washed by the same individuals to ensure homogenous washing practice after cleaning the improved containers were filled and the people were instructed to release water only through the tap the improved containers were purchased from the market in kampala after a market survey for containers with a large mouth and spigot was done and were distributed to households a few months prior to the start of the study improved containers were distributed to about half of the kiosk s customers in site 2 after randomly selecting the names of recipients from a lottery box containing the names of all customers households at site 3 where water was not chlorinated at the kiosk tap used uncleaned jerrycans and served as a control group the common jerrycans used in the study were reused vegetable oil canisters that are widely used in east africa for the transport and storage of drinking water vegetable oil residuals in these containers might support bacterial growth and increase recontamination jagals et al 2003 the jerrycans were of different ages and in different conditions we were not able to quantify the age of the jerrycans used and some of the containers used could have been significantly older than the improved containers which had been in use for five months to reduce the bias of comparing very old jerrycans with newer containers the containers were visibly inspected and heavily scratched soiled and damaged jerrycans were excluded from the study data were collected from november to december 2018 from a total of 135 households 46 households using an uncleaned jerrycan at site 1 23 households using cleaned jerrycans and 23 households using cleaned improved containers at site 2 and 43 households in the control group at site 3 nearly all customers of the water kiosks at the three sites were involved in the study all customers that came to the kiosk for water collection during the days of data collection were invited to participate the person mainly responsible for water handling in the household was informed about the goal purpose and methodology of the study and asked for informed consent the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of makerere university on july 18 2018 the uganda nation council for science and technology and the ethical committee of eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology on june 6 2018 during microbial water quality analysis contamination levels with e coli and total coliforms were assessed to evaluate the impact of the intervention strategies on recontamination e coli is commonly used as an indicator of faecal contamination and total coliforms served as another indicator of recontamination who 2019 who 2017 water samples were taken daily during the days of data collection in the field from the kiosk tap from the freshly filled containers of 135 participants and from the same containers after 24 h of water storage in the households before samples were taken at the kiosk tap water was left running for about 3 s after the first sample was taken the containers were marked and the participants name was documented then the participants were accompanied to their homes and instructed to leave some water in the container for the household visit the next day twenty four hours later the same households were revisited and samples were taken from the marked containers before the samples were taken the containers were shaken well for around 10 s water samples of 100 ml were poured directly from the containers into sterile nasco whirl pak thio bags and stored on ice in cooler boxes for about 6 h prior to lab analysis samples were vacuum filtered through 0 45 μm millipore cellulose membrane filters using sterilized filtration equipment and then placed on nissui pharmaceutical compact dry coli scan plates the dry plates were incubated at 35 2 c for 24 h due to occasional electricity cuts body incubation was also used instead of storing the dry plates in the incubator they were kept in a bumbag close to the body the temperature was monitored with a thermometer and was constantly kept at around 34 35 c after the incubation period e coli and total coliform colonies were counted visually up to 300 colony forming units cfus a negative control using boiled water as field blank and a duplicate sample were analysed every 16th sample in all samples collected except in those from the control group frc concentrations were measured 30 min after collection with dpd nr 1 tablets and a colorimeter from lamotte or a pooltester who 2017 during the second household visit after 24 h structured quantitative interviews were conducted with the person mainly responsible for water management to identify confounding variables and assess the influence of water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and practice on recontamination the questionnaire contained pretested questions coded in odk on tablets interviews were conducted in the local languages samia and luganda by two trained interviewers the questionnaire comprised structured questions most with categorical and likert scale answer categories on household demographics access to water water handling practice hygiene behaviour and wealth indicators in addition to questions structured observations in the household gathered information on the condition and existence of storage and transport containers hand washing and sanitation facilities and water treatment methods available in the household 2 2 data analysis the data was analysed using ibm spss version 25 differences were calculated i between water quality at the tap and water quality after filling the container and ii between water quality at the tap and water quality after 24 h of storage to obtain information about the degree of recontamination to improve visualization recontamination was log transformed and for all zero recontamination values 0 5 was added to allow logarithmic transformations descriptive statistics were calculated to assess central tendencies since the distribution of coliform counts was not normal nonparametric kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests were conducted to assess differences between intervention strategies a bonferroni correction was applied and the results are reported at a 0 0083 level of significance to aid interpretation the effect size of the mann whitney test was calculated rosenthal 1991 the difference between the frc concentration at filling and after 24 h of storage was calculated to obtain the frc degradation then t tests were applied to compare the differences between frc in uncleaned and cleaned jerrycans and between cleaned jerrycans and cleaned improved containers to investigate the impact of household factors on bacterial recontamination univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were calculated a dichotomous variable was formed by classifying counts of e coli recontamination into uncontaminated 0 cfu 100 ml 0 and contaminated 0 cfu 100 ml 1 the multivariate model n 135 was controlled for intervention assignment by forming three dummy variables a water chlorinated at the kiosk differentiating between the control site 0 and sites that had received chlorination at the kiosk 1 b the use of a normal jerrycan cleaned at the kiosk 1 versus a not cleaned jerrycan or an improved container 0 and c the use of a cleaned improved container 1 versus a not cleaned jerrycan or a cleaned jerrycan 0 water handling and hygiene factors that were significantly different between the intervention sites factors known from literature to impact water quality during handling and factors that were significant at a p value 0 2 during univariate analysis the final model was then obtained using backward selection with the same level of 0 2 associations were considered as statistically significant if p values were 05 the multivariate model included 11 predictors relying on vittinghoff s rule of thumb that the number of predictors in multiple logistic regression should not exceed a case number of 10 per predictor vittinghoff et al 2005 values of the variance inflating factor vif of all predictors were between 1 135 and 2 246 and tolerance was between 0 445 and 0 881 confirming the validity of model assumptions for multi collinearity chi square and spearman s rho were used to assess correlations between predictors included in the model a wealth index hand washing index and toilet index were calculated using principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation varimax the wealth index was compiled in accordance with previously described procedures from educational level money spent per week and possessions available in the household solar panel radio tv phone bicycle motorbike car fridge watch fuel type owning the house number of rooms wall roof and floor type of the house rutstein 2008 krishnan 2010 the hand washing index included the presence of a hand washing facility the condition of the facility and the availability of soap and water at the handwashing facility the toilet index was formed on the basis of the toilet type and the cleanliness of the toilet in the household 3 results and discussion 3 1 household demographics and water handling households across all study sites consisted on average of seven people sd 3 among them four children sd 3 of whom two were under the age of 5 sd 1 seventy percent of the respondents reported having completed primary school 16 had completed secondary school and 14 were illiterate the majority of respondents 96 lived in their own house with an average of two rooms sd 1 and they worked in agriculture 92 none of the respondents had an electricity connection in the home but 55 used solar panels for light and charging their phones the median expenditure per week and household was 15 000 ugx 4 usd iqr 20 000 ugx the average distance to the water kiosk was about 600 m sd 400 m and the average time to collect water per day including waiting time was 130 min per person sd 113 min thirty three percent of the respondents stated that they used other sources in addition to the water kiosk with the lake being the main additional source 72 the customers of the kiosk ranked the water quality at the kiosk as safe 77 and perceived the taste of the water to be good 67 this was reflected in the low number of additional household water treatment products in the households 11 and shows that people are not aware of the risks of recontamination the most commonly used method for household water treatment was filtration with a cloth 4 4 the respondents reported cleaning their water transport container every second to third day on average the majority used soap 63 and a sponge 63 fifty six percent stated that they used different containers for transport and storage the use of an additional container for water storage bears the risk of further recontamination as harris et al 2013 documented the most common storage containers in use were clay pots this study did not investigate the impact of transferring water into storage containers but only tested water quality changes if water was stored in the same container over 24 h forty percent of the households had received an educational visit in the last year providing information on wash forty five percent of households took part on average in two community meetings during the last year where wash training was provided sd 2 seventy seven percent of the respondents lacked hand washing facilities in the household and in only 32 of the households with handwashing facilities was soap present fifty six percent of the respondents owned private pit latrines and 29 shared pit latrines with neighbours twelve percent lacked sanitation facilities and practiced open defecation instead further details about the socio economic conditions water handling and hygiene at the three sites are presented in table a of the supplementary materials 3 2 the influence of the interventions on bacterial recontamination water quality tests revealed that none of the samples taken at the kiosk tap at any site including the control site contained e coli total coliforms were detected at the control site median 11 cfu 100 ml interquartile range iqr 9 cfu 100 ml the kiosk taps at the intervention sites providing chlorinated water did not contain any total coliforms the presence of chlorine protected the water in all three interventions after filling the jerrycans resulting in a median of zero e coli and total coliforms in the control group 74 4 of the containers contained e coli immediately after filling corresponding to a median of 2 cfu 100 ml iqr 10 e coli counts this was significantly different from the three intervention groups with mann whitney u 253 p 0 0083 r 0 61 for uncleaned jerrycans u 127 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned jerrycans and u 135 p 0 0083 r 0 45 for cleaned improved containers see fig 2 a similarly the control group also contained a significantly higher recontamination level of total coliforms after container filling median 169 cfu 100 ml iqr 260 than the intervention groups with mann whitney u 213 p 0 0083 r 0 56 for uncleaned jerrycans u 100 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned jerrycans and u 104 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned improved containers see fig 2b after 24 h of storage e coli was detected in 86 of the containers of the control group median 9 cfu 100 ml iqr 25 54 of the uncleaned jerrycans median 1 cfu 100 ml iqr 6 30 of the cleaned jerrycans median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 2 and 13 of the cleaned improved containers median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 0 the e coli recontamination calculated as the change in cfu 100 ml between the kiosk s tap and 24 h storage in the container in all three intervention groups differed significantly from that in the control group mann whitney u 539 p 0 0083 r 0 32 for uncleaned jerrycans mann whitney u 167 p 0 0083 r 0 39 for cleaned jerrycans and mann whitney u 100 p 0 0083 r 0 47 for improved cleaned containers see fig 3 a fewer samples recontaminated with e coli were found if the jerrycans were cleaned but the difference from uncleaned jerrycans was not statistically significant u 400 ns r 0 15 the use of cleaned improved containers reduced recontamination the most but the difference from cleaned jerrycans was not statistically significant u 215 ns r 0 13 a significant difference in recontamination with e coli was found between uncleaned jerrycans and cleaned improved containers with mann whitney u 300 p 0 0083 r 0 28 total coliform contamination after 24 h of storage was detected in 93 of the containers of the control group median 287 cfu 100 ml iqr 104 96 of the uncleaned jerrycans median 23 cfu 100 ml iqr 282 96 of the cleaned jerrycans median 26 cfu 100 ml iqr 298 and 65 of the cleaned improved containers median 1 cfu 100 ml iqr 5 recontamination with total coliforms in the control group did not significantly differ from levels in both uncleaned and cleaned jerrycans mann whitney u 686 ns r 0 22 and mann whitney u 381 ns r 0 14 respectively this may be due to the effect of cleaning jerrycans with sand as the narrow neck of the jerrycans impedes cleaning with a brush this procedure could have reintroduced total coliforms which also multiply in soil environments who 2017 into the container cleaning with sand also increases the risk of scratching the inner walls of containers and thus offering a niche for bacteria to grow van der merwe et al 2012 only the improved containers that were cleaned with brushes instead of sand had significantly lower recontamination counts with total coliforms than the control group u 109 p 0 0083 r 0 46 see fig 3b the cleaned improved containers also had significantly lower counts of total coliforms than uncleaned jerrycans and jerrycans cleaned with sand u 201 p 0 0083 r 0 0 36 and u 118 p 0 0083 r 0 0 28 in addition to enhanced cleaning of the improved container water extraction through the tap instead of pouring water out from the opening in the case of the jerrycan could also have contributed to a reduction of recontamination ninety six percent of the people who had received an improved container preferred it to a common jerrycan the following reasons were given the improved containers are easier to clean they have a good cover and tap and they can be used to fetch water from the lake the last reason does not serve the purpose of the containers because lake water samples contained e coli counts in the high risk category 100 cfu 100 ml and improved containers should not facilitate access to lake water who 2017 it was observed that after only five months of use some of the improved containers were already broken leaking taps and broken handles and lids were observed the tap with its exposed position near the bottom of the container is very vulnerable to damage and contamination during transport the study demonstrated the positive effect improved containers with an opening that facilitates proper cleaning had on reducing recontamination which suggests that a more robust container with such a design should be developed a robust design that facilitates the daily use of containers was also highlighted by reed et al 2011 3 3 the influence of container cleaning on frc degradation recontamination of e coli and total coliforms was significantly associated with the provision of chlorination at the water kiosk after membrane filtration or 0 101 p 0 001 see table 1 frc concentrations measured immediately after filling the containers were on average 1 9 mg l in uncleaned jerrycans standard deviation sd 0 3 mg l 2 mg l in cleaned jerrycans sd 0 3 mg l and 2 mg l sd 0 2 mg l in cleaned improved containers the frc degradation over 24 h in cleaned jerrycans mean of degradation 1 6 mg l sd 0 4 mg l was significantly less than in uncleaned jerrycans mean of degradation 1 8 mg l sd 0 3 mg l t 34 2 466 p 0 05 r 0 39 the lowest frc degradation values over 24 h were found in cleaned improved containers mean of degradation 1 2 mg l sd 0 3 mg l they differed significantly from cleaned jerrycans t 44 3 501 p 0 05 r 0 47 see fig 4 these results highlight that a thorough cleaning process is effective in removing organic material from the containers thus contributing to the stabilization of frc in the water that is kept in the containers after 24 h none of the uncleaned jerrycans contained frc concentrations above 0 4 mg l mean 0 2 mg l sd 0 1 mg l cleaned jerrycans contained concentrations up to 1 mg l mean 0 4 mg l sd 0 2 mg l and cleaned improved containers had frc concentrations up to 1 4 mg l mean 0 7 mg l sd 0 3 mg l water quality in all jerrycans or containers containing frc concentrations above 0 4 mg l after 24 h of storage met who guidelines zero e coli cfu 100 ml who 2017 fig 5 contrary to earlier recommendations our findings suggest that frc concentrations above 0 2 mg l may be required to ensure that water from lake victoria is safe to drink water after 24 h of storage who 2017 lantagne 2008 most of the samples in uncleaned jerrycans were recontaminated after 24 h indicating that chlorination of about 2 mg l was not sufficient to prevent recontamination in uncleaned jerrycans during 24 h of storage while most households using cleaned jerrycans and improved cleaned containers still had water free of e coli after 24 h of storage a possible solution to prevent recontamination irrespective of the container used would be a higher chlorine dosage however higher concentrations of chlorine change the taste of treated water and thus could lead to its rejection by the user crider et al 2018 a higher chlorine demand indicates higher concentrations of organic matter in the water which could increase the risk of forming carcinogenic byproducts such as trihalomethanes crittenden et al 2012 the authors recommend that chlorination be combined with another intervention strategy such as the use of properly cleaned containers to reduce the amount of organic matter in the jerrycans 3 4 factors associated with the recontamination of water univariate and multivariate logistic regressions with presence or absence of e coli recontamination in water stored for 24 h revealed that most water handling and hygiene related household factors did not significantly influence water quality the results of the regression models using e coli recontamination are presented in table 1 multivariate regression revealed that water chlorination after membrane filtration at the kiosk was significantly associated with lower e coli recontamination or 0 105 p 0 003 after 24 h cleaning of the containers by the kiosk operator before filling them significantly reduced the risk of recontamination with e coli or 0 180 p 0 009 also the use of improved containers significantly reduced the recontamination risk of e coli or 0 094 p 0 002 these results correspond with the findings in section 3 2 in addition to intervention strategies the number of wash education visits received by the household was associated with lower e coli recontamination or 0 54 p 0 003 this is interesting as the number of wash education visits received by the household was significantly correlated with the handwashing facility index rs 0 201 p 0 019 the toilet index rs 0 223 p 0 009 and with the use of sand to individually clean the containers at household level rs 0 290 p 0 001 the effects of these correlations however are all quite small and did not violate the assumption of multi collinearity in the regression model a possible explanation for the association between the number of wash education visits and recontamination in stored drinking water is that the wash training may have improved the consistency of hygiene practices a factor which is not captured in the data and may therefore have improved general household hygiene 4 conclusions recontamination of drinking water provided at the tap of a kiosk treating water from lake victoria was observed after filling the jerrycan and during transport and storage all three intervention strategies comprising of chlorinating water at the tap after treating water from lake victoria with ultrafiltration in combination with uncleaned jerrycans cleaned jerrycans or cleaned improved containers significantly reduced e coli recontamination during transport and storage over 24 h compared to the control group containers with frc residuals of at least 0 4 mg l after 24 h of storage did not exhibit recontamination with e coli an frc concentration of 2 mg l at the kiosk s tap was not sufficient to obtain more than 0 4 mg l frc in uncleaned jerrycans after 24 h of storage cleaning the conventional jerrycans reduced the recontamination risks of e coli but was inconvenient due to their having a small opening the wider opening of improved containers enabled their cleaning with a brush and soap improved containers had the lowest recontamination levels for both e coli and total coliforms after 24 h although former studies recommend small container openings to prevent recontamination levy et al 2014 this study demonstrated a reduction of recontamination risks in containers with a wide opening that facilitated proper cleaning of the container s inner walls in addition to the intervention strategies higher numbers of household visits providing wash education were associated with a lower risk of bacterial recontamination in stored drinking water indicating the importance of adequate hygiene practices during safe water storage declarations of interest none author agreement rm ng lg kw and ho designed

19970,drinking water is frequently recontaminated during transport and storage when water is poured into jerrycans to address this issue three strategies aiming at reducing these recontamination risks were implemented at water kiosks in eastern uganda in all three strategies water at the kiosks was chlorinated to a free residual chlorine frc concentration of 2 mg l at the tap of the kiosk in addition water was collected in different containers for drinking water transport a uncleaned jerrycans b cleaned jerrycans and c cleaned improved containers with a wide mouth and a spigot water quality in the containers was compared to that of a control group collecting unchlorinated water in uncleaned jerrycans water samples were collected at the tap of the kiosk from the containers of 135 households after they were filled at the tap and from the same containers in the households after 24 h of water storage the samples were analysed for counts of e coli total coliforms and frc household interviews and structured observations were conducted to identify confounding variables and to assess the influence of water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and practices on recontamination all three intervention strategies contributed to significantly lower e coli recontamination levels after 24 h than in the control group median mdn 9 cfu 100 ml interquartile range iqr 25 median e coli counts and mean frc consumption were higher in uncleaned jerrycans median 1 cfu 100 ml iqr 6 δfrc 1 8 mg l than in cleaned jerrycans median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 2 δfrc 1 6 mg l and the lowest in cleaned improved containers median 0 cfu 100 ml iqr 0 δfrc 1 2 mg l the frc concentration at the tap of 2 mg l was too low to protect water from e coli recontamination in uncleaned jerrycans over 24 h cleaning the jerrycans was inconvenient due to their small openings therefore sand was used the cleaning with sand reduced recontamination with e coli but did not reduce the count of total coliforms improved containers with a larger opening allowed for cleaning with a brush and showed the lowest levels of recontamination for both e coli and total coliforms in addition to the intervention strategies households receiving a higher number of wash education visits within the previous year had lower recontamination levels of e coli in stored water or 0 54 p 0 003 keywords maximum 6

safe drinking water and sanitation for all by 2030 achieving sdg 6 is a global human right and supports good health and gender equality who 2015 nevertheless progress is slow and access to safe water for everyone has yet to be achieved globally at least 2 3 billion people used drinking water services that were not safely managed in 2017 who 2019 contaminated water can transmit diseases such as diarrhoea cholera dysentery typhoid and polio and is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year prüss ustün et al 2019 the establishment of water kiosks is a strategy for improving access to safe drinking water at community level in remote rural areas thompson et al 2000 mcgranahan et al 2006 opryszko et al 2009 sima and elimelech 2013 various technologies have been installed in water kiosks that mostly deliver high quality water at the tap huttinger et al 2015 peter 2015 patrick et al 2017 however keeping water safe until consumption has been a challenge opryszko et al 2013 in eastern uganda the majority of people living along the shores of lake victoria use untreated water from the lake as their drinking water source to address this issue eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology in collaboration with an ngo africa water solutions established five water kiosks with gravity driven ultrafiltration membrane gdm technology in the busia and namayingo districts an analysis revealed that the gdm system produces high quality treated water peter et al 2016 however a follow up study to check the quality of water from the kiosks in households showed that the water is often recontaminated during transport and storage in households meierhofer et al 2017 recontamination after collection is a frequently reported concern opryszko et al 2013 wright et al 2004 mellor et al 2013 previous research has identified hands utensils for fetching water and transport and storage canisters as the main sources of water deterioration trevett et al 2005 opryszko et al 2013 mellor et al 2013 an effective cost efficient and locally available method for ensuring safe storage of drinking water even under poor hygienic conditions is the addition of chlorine to the water chlorine provides protection against bacteria and viruses as long as sufficient free residual chlorine frc is present murphy et al 2016 correct dosage is crucial to ensuring safe drinking water during storage the who recommends dosing to a concentration of 2 mg l of frc for non turbid water at the point of delivery in stored water a minimum chlorine concentration of 0 2 mg l should remain to prevent recontamination who 2017 container material can influence chlorine degradation clay pots were found to consume more chlorine than plastic ones more organic materials were observed on the inner surface and these probably consumed chlorine murphy et al 2009 in addition to the material the container is made from its design has an impact on water quality containers are often kept at ground level making them easily accessible to children and animals which could be a reason for water deterioration steele et al 2008 hence it is important to cover containers with lids and to store them above floor level water often deteriorates during extraction due to contact with contaminated hands cups and ladles jagals et al 2003 hands can be prevented from entering by integrating a spout for extraction this solution was evaluated in a refugee camp in malawi roberts et al 2001 several studies have evaluated the use of containers with narrow openings that prevent hands from entering the canister and found better water quality than containers with larger openings mintz et al 1995 reed et al 2011 mellor et al 2013 levy et al 2014 found higher contamination levels in containers with openings larger than 8 cm although narrow openings impede contact with possible contamination sources they also hinder systematic cleaning with a brush the regular use of drinking water containers without proper cleaning leads to the formation of a biofilm on the container s inner walls this biofilm harbours bacterial colonies provides them with food for growth and protects them from disinfection thus increasing the risk of contaminating water that is poured into the containers harris et al 2013 budeli et al 2018 jagals et al 2003 mellor et al 2013 hence thorough cleaning of the containers may be a method for eliminating this source of recontamination methods applied to remove the biofilm from the walls of containers with a narrow opening include scouring with sand and stones and disinfection with chlorine steele et al 2008 scouring with sand and stones however entails the risk of scratching the walls of the container which would offer a niche for bacteria to grow van der merwe et al 2012 whereas disinfection with chlorine supports the prevention of recontamination when the container is filled however relying solely on disinfecting the containers with chlorine was found to be insufficient to protecting the water during transport and storage steele et al 2008 as mentioned above elements of poor household hygiene such as contaminated hands utensils and containers play a major role in recontamination pathways therefore household factors such as water handling and hygiene conditions may increase the risk of recontaminating drinking water during storage in the household a study in ghana found that increased education was not related to improved drinking water quality and attributed this to a lack of water sanitation and hygiene wash training opryszko et al 2013 a study in india failed to find any statistically significant correlation between recontamination of drinking water in households and demographics sanitation or household practices of water handling and hygiene but it detected a slight correlation between increased contamination and a higher number of household members with lower average ages eshcol et al 2008 another study in kenya linked a higher frequency of users cleaning the storage container to a higher water quality meierhofer et al 2019 however the practice of transferring water from smaller transport containers to larger storage containers was found to add another source of contamination opryszko et al 2013 the goal of this study was to evaluate whether systematic cleaning of water containers prior to filling them and the use of improved containers with a wide mouth and a spigot in addition to chlorinating water at the point of distribution can further reduce the recontamination risk while storing the water over 24 h in households the study also assessed the impact of container handling and hygiene conditions in households on water quality changes during storage 2 methods 2 1 study design the study was implemented using a quasi experimental design with the inclusion of intervention randomization at three sites where community scale water treatment systems using gdm filtration provide water to the local communities through water kiosks lugala bulundira and bumeru in eastern uganda due to the small number of only five water kiosks in the area a random selection of sites was not possible a matching approach was applied to select three sites and reduce the potential confounding due to non randomization variables defining the socio economic conditions water handling and hygiene conditions in the control and intervention sites were assessed and variables with statistically significant differences between the sites identified during analysis these potential confounders were included in the multivariate regression model to control for a potential bias details of the sites and analysis of difference are presented in table a of the supplementary materials for all three sites the water is sourced from lake victoria and pumped through pipelines to the water treatment system in the community the treated water is provided to the local schools and can be purchased by households living in the community customers collect the water purchased at the kiosk s taps in their own containers for a price of 0 026 usd per 20 l container each of the kiosks is run by a local operator who is supported by a water management committee peter varbanets et al 2017 three intervention strategies were implemented to reduce recontamination risks in stored drinking water water in the safe water tank of the kiosk was manually chlorinated each day under supervision of the research team with sodium hypochlorite to obtain a concentration of 2 mg l of frc at the tap at all sites except the control site different containers were used to collect and transport the drinking water at the intervention sites customers at the control site where water was not chlorinated used uncleaned common jerrycans at site 1 customers used the same type of uncleaned jerrycans strategy 1 while water was chlorinated at the water kiosk half of the customers at site 2 used cleaned jerrycans strategy 2 and the other half used cleaned improved containers strategy 3 at site 2 strategy 2 and 3 all containers jerrycans and improved containers used by the customers were cleaned by the kiosk operator before filling them with water at the kiosk the improved container had a larger opening to facilitate easy cleaning a tap for drawing water during storage and two handles for carrying fig 1 the jerrycans were cleaned by introducing a handful of sand and some water into the jerrycans and shaking them for about 1 min afterwards the sand was rinsed out with about 10 l of water then the jerrycans were filled with 5 l of water mixed with liquid soap shaken and rinsed again with water the improved containers were cleaned by inserting liquid soap and about 2 l of water and using a brush to remove the biofilm afterwards they were rinsed with about 5 l of water chlorinated water from the water kiosk was used for all cleaning processes there was no need to clean the improved containers with sand because the larger opening allowed for a brush to enter and remove the biofilm from the inner walls the jerrycans and improved containers were always washed by the same individuals to ensure homogenous washing practice after cleaning the improved containers were filled and the people were instructed to release water only through the tap the improved containers were purchased from the market in kampala after a market survey for containers with a large mouth and spigot was done and were distributed to households a few months prior to the start of the study improved containers were distributed to about half of the kiosk s customers in site 2 after randomly selecting the names of recipients from a lottery box containing the names of all customers households at site 3 where water was not chlorinated at the kiosk tap used uncleaned jerrycans and served as a control group the common jerrycans used in the study were reused vegetable oil canisters that are widely used in east africa for the transport and storage of drinking water vegetable oil residuals in these containers might support bacterial growth and increase recontamination jagals et al 2003 the jerrycans were of different ages and in different conditions we were not able to quantify the age of the jerrycans used and some of the containers used could have been significantly older than the improved containers which had been in use for five months to reduce the bias of comparing very old jerrycans with newer containers the containers were visibly inspected and heavily scratched soiled and damaged jerrycans were excluded from the study data were collected from november to december 2018 from a total of 135 households 46 households using an uncleaned jerrycan at site 1 23 households using cleaned jerrycans and 23 households using cleaned improved containers at site 2 and 43 households in the control group at site 3 nearly all customers of the water kiosks at the three sites were involved in the study all customers that came to the kiosk for water collection during the days of data collection were invited to participate the person mainly responsible for water handling in the household was informed about the goal purpose and methodology of the study and asked for informed consent the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of makerere university on july 18 2018 the uganda nation council for science and technology and the ethical committee of eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology on june 6 2018 during microbial water quality analysis contamination levels with e coli and total coliforms were assessed to evaluate the impact of the intervention strategies on recontamination e coli is commonly used as an indicator of faecal contamination and total coliforms served as another indicator of recontamination who 2019 who 2017 water samples were taken daily during the days of data collection in the field from the kiosk tap from the freshly filled containers of 135 participants and from the same containers after 24 h of water storage in the households before samples were taken at the kiosk tap water was left running for about 3 s after the first sample was taken the containers were marked and the participants name was documented then the participants were accompanied to their homes and instructed to leave some water in the container for the household visit the next day twenty four hours later the same households were revisited and samples were taken from the marked containers before the samples were taken the containers were shaken well for around 10 s water samples of 100 ml were poured directly from the containers into sterile nasco whirl pak thio bags and stored on ice in cooler boxes for about 6 h prior to lab analysis samples were vacuum filtered through 0 45 μm millipore cellulose membrane filters using sterilized filtration equipment and then placed on nissui pharmaceutical compact dry coli scan plates the dry plates were incubated at 35 2 c for 24 h due to occasional electricity cuts body incubation was also used instead of storing the dry plates in the incubator they were kept in a bumbag close to the body the temperature was monitored with a thermometer and was constantly kept at around 34 35 c after the incubation period e coli and total coliform colonies were counted visually up to 300 colony forming units cfus a negative control using boiled water as field blank and a duplicate sample were analysed every 16th sample in all samples collected except in those from the control group frc concentrations were measured 30 min after collection with dpd nr 1 tablets and a colorimeter from lamotte or a pooltester who 2017 during the second household visit after 24 h structured quantitative interviews were conducted with the person mainly responsible for water management to identify confounding variables and assess the influence of water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and practice on recontamination the questionnaire contained pretested questions coded in odk on tablets interviews were conducted in the local languages samia and luganda by two trained interviewers the questionnaire comprised structured questions most with categorical and likert scale answer categories on household demographics access to water water handling practice hygiene behaviour and wealth indicators in addition to questions structured observations in the household gathered information on the condition and existence of storage and transport containers hand washing and sanitation facilities and water treatment methods available in the household 2 2 data analysis the data was analysed using ibm spss version 25 differences were calculated i between water quality at the tap and water quality after filling the container and ii between water quality at the tap and water quality after 24 h of storage to obtain information about the degree of recontamination to improve visualization recontamination was log transformed and for all zero recontamination values 0 5 was added to allow logarithmic transformations descriptive statistics were calculated to assess central tendencies since the distribution of coliform counts was not normal nonparametric kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests were conducted to assess differences between intervention strategies a bonferroni correction was applied and the results are reported at a 0 0083 level of significance to aid interpretation the effect size of the mann whitney test was calculated rosenthal 1991 the difference between the frc concentration at filling and after 24 h of storage was calculated to obtain the frc degradation then t tests were applied to compare the differences between frc in uncleaned and cleaned jerrycans and between cleaned jerrycans and cleaned improved containers to investigate the impact of household factors on bacterial recontamination univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were calculated a dichotomous variable was formed by classifying counts of e coli recontamination into uncontaminated 0 cfu 100 ml 0 and contaminated 0 cfu 100 ml 1 the multivariate model n 135 was controlled for intervention assignment by forming three dummy variables a water chlorinated at the kiosk differentiating between the control site 0 and sites that had received chlorination at the kiosk 1 b the use of a normal jerrycan cleaned at the kiosk 1 versus a not cleaned jerrycan or an improved container 0 and c the use of a cleaned improved container 1 versus a not cleaned jerrycan or a cleaned jerrycan 0 water handling and hygiene factors that were significantly different between the intervention sites factors known from literature to impact water quality during handling and factors that were significant at a p value 0 2 during univariate analysis the final model was then obtained using backward selection with the same level of 0 2 associations were considered as statistically significant if p values were 05 the multivariate model included 11 predictors relying on vittinghoff s rule of thumb that the number of predictors in multiple logistic regression should not exceed a case number of 10 per predictor vittinghoff et al 2005 values of the variance inflating factor vif of all predictors were between 1 135 and 2 246 and tolerance was between 0 445 and 0 881 confirming the validity of model assumptions for multi collinearity chi square and spearman s rho were used to assess correlations between predictors included in the model a wealth index hand washing index and toilet index were calculated using principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation varimax the wealth index was compiled in accordance with previously described procedures from educational level money spent per week and possessions available in the household solar panel radio tv phone bicycle motorbike car fridge watch fuel type owning the house number of rooms wall roof and floor type of the house rutstein 2008 krishnan 2010 the hand washing index included the presence of a hand washing facility the condition of the facility and the availability of soap and water at the handwashing facility the toilet index was formed on the basis of the toilet type and the cleanliness of the toilet in the household 3 results and discussion 3 1 household demographics and water handling households across all study sites consisted on average of seven people sd 3 among them four children sd 3 of whom two were under the age of 5 sd 1 seventy percent of the respondents reported having completed primary school 16 had completed secondary school and 14 were illiterate the majority of respondents 96 lived in their own house with an average of two rooms sd 1 and they worked in agriculture 92 none of the respondents had an electricity connection in the home but 55 used solar panels for light and charging their phones the median expenditure per week and household was 15 000 ugx 4 usd iqr 20 000 ugx the average distance to the water kiosk was about 600 m sd 400 m and the average time to collect water per day including waiting time was 130 min per person sd 113 min thirty three percent of the respondents stated that they used other sources in addition to the water kiosk with the lake being the main additional source 72 the customers of the kiosk ranked the water quality at the kiosk as safe 77 and perceived the taste of the water to be good 67 this was reflected in the low number of additional household water treatment products in the households 11 and shows that people are not aware of the risks of recontamination the most commonly used method for household water treatment was filtration with a cloth 4 4 the respondents reported cleaning their water transport container every second to third day on average the majority used soap 63 and a sponge 63 fifty six percent stated that they used different containers for transport and storage the use of an additional container for water storage bears the risk of further recontamination as harris et al 2013 documented the most common storage containers in use were clay pots this study did not investigate the impact of transferring water into storage containers but only tested water quality changes if water was stored in the same container over 24 h forty percent of the households had received an educational visit in the last year providing information on wash forty five percent of households took part on average in two community meetings during the last year where wash training was provided sd 2 seventy seven percent of the respondents lacked hand washing facilities in the household and in only 32 of the households with handwashing facilities was soap present fifty six percent of the respondents owned private pit latrines and 29 shared pit latrines with neighbours twelve percent lacked sanitation facilities and practiced open defecation instead further details about the socio economic conditions water handling and hygiene at the three sites are presented in table a of the supplementary materials 3 2 the influence of the interventions on bacterial recontamination water quality tests revealed that none of the samples taken at the kiosk tap at any site including the control site contained e coli total coliforms were detected at the control site median 11 cfu 100 ml interquartile range iqr 9 cfu 100 ml the kiosk taps at the intervention sites providing chlorinated water did not contain any total coliforms the presence of chlorine protected the water in all three interventions after filling the jerrycans resulting in a median of zero e coli and total coliforms in the control group 74 4 of the containers contained e coli immediately after filling corresponding to a median of 2 cfu 100 ml iqr 10 e coli counts this was significantly different from the three intervention groups with mann whitney u 253 p 0 0083 r 0 61 for uncleaned jerrycans u 127 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned jerrycans and u 135 p 0 0083 r 0 45 for cleaned improved containers see fig 2 a similarly the control group also contained a significantly higher recontamination level of total coliforms after container filling median 169 cfu 100 ml iqr 260 than the intervention groups with mann whitney u 213 p 0 0083 r 0 56 for uncleaned jerrycans u 100 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned jerrycans and u 104 p 0 0083 r 0 46 for cleaned improved containers see fig 2b after 24 h of storage e coli was detected in 86 of the containers of the control group median 9

e coli recontamination calculated as the change in cfu 100 ml between the kiosk s tap and 24 h storage in the container in all three intervention groups differed significantly from that in the control group mann whitney u 539 p 0 0083 r 0 32 for uncleaned jerrycans mann whitney u 167 p 0 0083 r 0 39 for cleaned jerrycans and mann whitney u 100 p 0 0083 r 0 47 for improved cleaned containers see fig 3 a fewer samples recontaminated with e coli were found if the jerrycans were cleaned but the difference from uncleaned jerrycans was not statistically significant u 400 ns r 0 15 the use of cleaned improved containers reduced recontamination the most but the difference from cleaned jerrycans was not statistically significant u 215 ns r 0 13 a significant difference in recontamination with e coli was found between uncleaned jerrycans and cleaned improved containers with mann whitney u 300 p 0 0083 r 0 28 total coliform contamination after 24 h of storage was detected in 93 of the containers of the control group median 287 cfu 100 ml iqr 104 96 of the uncleaned jerrycans median 23 cfu 100 ml iqr 282 96 of the cleaned jerrycans median 26 cfu 100 ml iqr 298 and 65 of the cleaned improved containers median 1 cfu 100 ml iqr 5 recontamination with total coliforms in the control group did not significantly differ from levels in both uncleaned and cleaned jerrycans mann whitney u 686 ns r 0 22 and mann whitney u 381 ns r 0 14 respectively this may be due to the effect of cleaning jerrycans with sand as the narrow neck of the jerrycans impedes cleaning with a brush this procedure could have reintroduced total coliforms which also multiply in soil environments who 2017 into the container cleaning with sand also increases the risk of scratching the inner walls of containers and thus offering a niche for bacteria to grow van der merwe et al 2012 only the improved containers that were cleaned with brushes instead of sand had significantly lower recontamination counts with total coliforms than the control group u 109 p 0 0083 r 0 46 see fig 3b the cleaned improved containers also had significantly lower counts of total coliforms than uncleaned jerrycans and jerrycans cleaned with sand u 201 p 0 0083 r 0 0 36 and u 118 p 0 0083 r 0 0 28 in addition to enhanced cleaning of the improved container water extraction through the tap instead of pouring water out from the opening in the case of the jerrycan could also have contributed to a reduction of recontamination ninety six percent of the people who had received an improved container preferred it to a common jerrycan the following reasons were given the improved containers are easier to clean they have a good cover and tap and they can be used to fetch water from the lake the last reason does not serve the purpose of the containers because lake water samples contained e coli counts in the high risk category 100 cfu 100 ml and improved containers should not facilitate access to lake water who 2017 it was observed that after only five months of use some of the improved containers were already broken leaking taps and broken handles and lids were observed the tap with its exposed position near the bottom of the container is very vulnerable to damage and contamination during transport the study demonstrated the positive effect improved containers with an opening that facilitates proper cleaning had on reducing recontamination which suggests that a more robust container with such a design should be developed a robust design that facilitates the daily use of containers was also highlighted by reed et al 2011 3 3 the influence of container cleaning on frc degradation recontamination of e coli and total coliforms was significantly associated with the provision of chlorination at the water kiosk after membrane filtration or 0 101 p 0 001 see table 1 frc concentrations measured immediately after filling the containers were on average 1 9 mg l in uncleaned jerrycans standard deviation sd 0 3 mg

significantly less than in uncleaned jerrycans mean of degradation 1 8 mg l sd 0 3 mg l t 34 2 466 p 0 05 r 0 39 the lowest frc degradation values over 24 h were found in cleaned improved containers mean of degradation 1 2 mg l sd 0 3 mg l they differed significantly from cleaned jerrycans t 44 3 501 p 0 05 r 0 47 see fig 4 these results highlight that a thorough cleaning process is effective in removing organic material from the containers thus contributing to the stabilization of frc in the water that is kept in the containers after 24 h none of the uncleaned jerrycans contained frc concentrations above 0 4 mg l mean 0 2 mg l sd 0 1 mg l cleaned jerrycans contained concentrations up to 1 mg l mean 0 4 mg l sd 0 2 mg l and cleaned improved containers had frc concentrations up to 1 4 mg l mean 0 7 mg l sd 0 3 mg l water quality in all jerrycans or containers containing frc concentrations above 0 4 mg l after 24 h of storage met who guidelines zero e coli cfu 100 ml who 2017 fig 5 contrary to earlier recommendations our findings suggest that frc concentrations above 0 2 mg l may be required to ensure that water from lake victoria is safe to drink water after 24 h of storage who 2017 lantagne 2008 most of the samples in uncleaned jerrycans were recontaminated after 24 h indicating that chlorination of about 2 mg l was not sufficient to prevent recontamination in uncleaned jerrycans during 24 h of storage while most households using cleaned jerrycans and improved cleaned containers still had water free of e coli after 24 h of storage a possible solution to prevent recontamination irrespective of the container used would be a higher chlorine dosage however higher concentrations of chlorine change the taste of treated water and thus could lead to its rejection by the user crider et al 2018 a higher chlorine demand indicates higher concentrations of organic matter in the water which could increase the risk of forming carcinogenic byproducts such as trihalomethanes crittenden et al 2012 the authors recommend that chlorination be combined with another intervention strategy such as the use of properly cleaned containers to reduce the amount of organic matter in the jerrycans 3 4 factors associated with the recontamination of water univariate and multivariate logistic regressions with presence or absence of e coli recontamination in water stored for 24 h revealed that most water handling and hygiene related household factors did not significantly influence water quality the results of the regression models using e coli recontamination are presented in table 1 multivariate regression revealed that water chlorination after membrane filtration at the kiosk was significantly associated with lower e coli recontamination or 0 105 p 0 003 after 24 h cleaning of the containers by the kiosk operator before filling them significantly reduced the risk of recontamination with e coli or 0 180 p 0 009 also the use of improved containers significantly reduced the recontamination risk of e coli or 0 094 p 0 002 these results correspond with the findings in section 3 2 in addition to intervention strategies the number of wash education visits received by the household was associated with lower e coli recontamination or 0 54 p 0 003 this is interesting as the number of wash education visits received by the household was significantly correlated with the handwashing facility index rs 0 201 p 0 019 the toilet index rs 0 223 p 0 009 and with the use of sand to individually clean the containers at household level rs 0 290 p 0 001 the effects of these correlations however are all quite small and did not violate the assumption of multi collinearity in the regression model a possible explanation for the association between the number of wash education visits and recontamination in stored drinking water is that the wash training may have improved the consistency of hygiene practices a factor which is not captured in the data and may therefore have improved general household hygiene 4 conclusions recontamination of drinking water provided at the tap of a kiosk treating water from lake victoria was observed after filling the jerrycan and during transport and storage all three intervention strategies comprising of chlorinating water at the tap after treating water from lake victoria with ultrafiltration in combination with uncleaned jerrycans cleaned jerrycans or cleaned improved containers significantly reduced e coli recontamination during transport and storage over 24 h compared to the control group containers with frc residuals of at least 0 4 mg l after 24 h of storage did not exhibit recontamination with e coli an frc concentration of 2 mg l at the kiosk s tap was not sufficient to obtain more than 0 4 mg l frc in uncleaned jerrycans after 24 h of storage cleaning the conventional jerrycans reduced the recontamination risks of e coli but was inconvenient due to their having a small opening the wider opening of improved containers enabled their cleaning with a brush and soap improved containers had the lowest recontamination levels for both e coli and total coliforms after 24 h although former studies recommend small container openings to prevent recontamination levy et al 2014 this study demonstrated a reduction of recontamination risks in containers with a wide opening that facilitated proper cleaning of the container s inner walls in addition to the intervention strategies higher numbers of household visits providing wash education were associated with a lower risk of bacterial recontamination in stored drinking water indicating the importance of adequate hygiene practices during safe water storage declarations of interest none author agreement rm ng lg kw and ho designed

fouling simulators mfss supplied with water varying in phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 and with constant biodegradable carbon concentration by applying hydraulic cleaning after a defined 140 increase in the feed channel pressure drop through increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 simulate the ro feed water without and with the addition of a phosphorus based antiscalant respectively and were chosen based on measurements at a full scale seawater ro desalination plant biomass quantification parameters performed after membrane autopsies such as total cell count adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and extracellular polymeric substances were used along with feed channel pressure drop measurements to evaluate biofilm removal efficiency the outlet water during hydraulic cleaning 1 h was collected and characterized as well optical coherence tomography images were taken before and after hydraulic cleaning for visualization of biofilm morphology biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 had an enhanced hydraulic cleanability compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 the higher detachment for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration was explained by more soluble polymers in the eps resulting in a lower biofilm cohesive and adhesive strength this study confirms that manipulating the feed water nutrient composition can engineer a biofilm that is easier to remove shifting research focus towards biofilm engineering and more sustainable cleaning strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate limitation drinking water production biofouling biofilm streamers seawater desalination 1 introduction seawater reverse osmosis swro membrane systems have emerged in recent decades to overcome the global increase in freshwater demand a fundamental issue in swro filtration processes is the fouling of the membrane membrane fouling raises the system s hydraulic resistance and increases energy requirements ansari et al 2020 one of the most challenging types of fouling is biofouling the excessive growth of a biofilm a biofilm develops through the attachment and growth of bacterial cells embedded in a produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2020 biofouling negatively impacts the system performance increasing the feed channel pressure drop decreasing the flux and salt rejection and increasing the overall water cost siebdrath et al 2019 one proposed strategy for biofouling control is limiting biodegradable organic nutrients in the feed water to reduce bacteria s potential to grow keinänen et al 2002 lehtola et al 1999 2001 2002 miettinen et al 1997 in full scale plants pretreatment processes reduce nutrient concentration and bacterial cell concentration feed water pretreatment is done by various processes arranged in different configurations such as dissolved air flotation inline coagulation biologically activated carbon filtration slow sand filtration dual media filtration and ultrafiltration abushaban et al 2019 farhat et al 2018 almost all conventional pretreatment systems used in ro plants utilize low micron range cartridge filter cf units as a final protection barrier before the high pressure pumps of the ro membranes farhat et al 2020 the types of treatment steps applied and sequence of pretreatment processes can vary between plants there is no standard pretreatment process research has focused on restricting other nutrients such as phosphorus concentration in the feed water javier et al 2020 kim et al 2014 pinel et al 2020 sevcenco et al 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 although phosphorous limitation has been shown to be effective in delaying biofilm formation and prolonging the system performance the unintentional addition of phosphorous to the feed water through the dosage of phosphorus based antiscalants is still performed antiscalants are often dosed to the ro feed water to avoid the scaling accumulation on the membrane it has been previously reported that some antiscalants increase the organic content and therefore increase bacterial growth potential vrouwenvelder et al 2000 membrane modules are cleaned to remove accumulated fouling and restore system performance usually when the overall differential pressure drop increases by more than 15 singh 2015 membrane cleaning is generally done using chemical and physical protocols chen et al 2003 recent studies focused on advanced physical cleaning methods to reduce the environmental impact and associated cost of chemical cleaning several hydraulic cleaning methods are reported in the literature such as i reverse flushing by changing the direction of the flow from the concentrate to the feed side ii reverse module operation where the elements are turned around and the brine seal moved to the other end andes et al 2013 iii forward flushing by increasing the cross flow velocity iv soaking of membranes mcdonald et al 2004 and v gas liquid two phase flow cleaning wibisono et al 2014 a previous study showed that among different hydraulic cleaning methods the reverse operation of modules achieved a higher 15 feed channel pressure drop recovery andes et al 2013 hydrodynamic conditions affect biofilm structure growth and detachment dreszer et al 2014 radu et al 2012 previous studies have reported that nutrient load in the feed water affects biofilm morphology and biofilm hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018c farhat et al 2019 biofilm morphology plays a vital role in determining the biofilm s mechanical response to hydraulic shear stress desmond et al 2018b biofilm streamers are viscoelastic filamentous structures formed by bacteria embedded in strands of eps valiei et al 2012 biofilm streamers have caused catastrophic disruption of flow independent of bacterial cell growth das and kumar 2014 drescher et al 2013 graf von der schulenburg et al 2008 drescher et al 2013 demonstrated that biofilms attached to the surfaces had little effect on flow whereas biofilm streamers caused a higher flow disruption moreover a recent study showed biofilm grown under restricted phosphorus conditions detached by sloughing and peeling off when instantaneously increasing hydraulic shear force desmond et al 2018c the biofilm detachment was explained by a weaker cohesive strength of the phosphorus limited biofilm than the non limited biofilm previously we demonstrated that biofouling control by phosphorus limitation depends on the assimilable organic carbon concentration javier et al 2020 however the removal of biofilms developed under various feed water nutrient conditions is not well understood this study analyzes the removal efficiency of biofilms grown at two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 by applying hydraulic cleaning after a 140 increase in the feed channel pressure drop through increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the same carbon concentration was used for all the experiments to analyze the impact of phosphorus conditions only on biofilm cleanability the two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 were chosen based on measurements taken at a seawater ro desalination plant figure s1 in supplementary material simulating the ro feed water without and with the addition of a phosphorus based antiscalant respectively biomass quantification parameters performed after membrane autopsies such as total cell count adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and extracellular polymeric substances were used along with feed channel pressure drop measurements to evaluate biofilm removal efficiency the outlet water during hydraulic cleaning 1 h was collected and characterized as well the biofilm structure was visualized with optical coherence tomography to the authors knowledge this is the first study that defines a hydraulic cleaning method to evaluate biomass detachment of biofilms grown at different feed water phosphorus conditions and therefore propose a more sustainable approach to improve membrane system performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the feed water used for this study was tap water produced by reverse osmosis ro desalination supplemented with nutrients table 1 to assure an extremely low phosphorus content as a baseline 0 3 μg p l 1 the tap water is produced through ro desalination at the king abdullah university of science and technology desalination plant thuwal jeddah saudi arabia and distributed to the network with residual chlorine belila et al 2016 the chlorine in the feed water was removed by an activated carbon filter filter housing model ups bb3 awf ups 3h 20b cartridge model sediment carbon ac sc 10 nl to protect the membranes water was passed through two cartridge filters pore size 4 μm to remove particles entering the feed water from the carbon filter the experiments were conducted in a lab scale setup with hydraulics water characteristics and materials representative of swro membrane systems farhat et al 2019 the setup consisted of a feed water pump a feed flow controller a pump for dosing the nutrients a flow cell called a membrane fouling simulator mfs vrouwenvelder et al 2007 a back pressure valve bronkhorst ruurlo netherlands and a differential pressure sensor delta bar pmd75 endress hauser switzerland to monitor the pressure drop over the feed channel the mfs had inlet and outlet orifices for pressure drop measurements a reverse osmosis ro polyamide membrane sheet with the dimensions of 20 cm 3 5 cm and a 34 mil 864 μm thick feed channel spacer taken from a new commercially available spiral wound membrane element tw30 4040 dow filmtec usa were placed inside the mfs the feed flow channel height is 0 864 mm equal to the feed spacer thickness 2 2 fouling monitoring by feed channel pressure drop earlier work has shown that reverse osmosis biofouling is a feed channel problem vrouwenvelder et al 2009 pressure drop measurements were recorded as an indicator of system performance of ro biofouling as feed channel pressure drop was shown to be the first and strongest impacted performance indicator siebdrath et al 2019 eight fully independent membrane fouling simulators were run simultaneously table 1 and the figures show the average and standard deviation of duplicate experiments for each scenario the average initial pressure drop registered in each mfs was 35 5 mbar for each phosphorus concentration 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 two mfss were used as a control where hydraulic cleaning was not performed these mfss were immediately stopped and sampled for biofilm analysis once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 140 53 mbar was reached the pressure drop increase chosen for the mfs simulates the biofouling condition that could be present at the inlet of the lead ro element this pressure drop increase 140 over the 0 20 m long mfs can explain a pressure drop increase of 15 over the first stage pressure vessel containing several 1 m long membrane elements is series as previously reported by vrouwenvelder et al 2009 2008 2006 hydraulic cleaning was performed for the remaining two mfss for each phosphorus condition once the same pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was achieved hydraulic cleaning was performed by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h still in the range of what is commonly applied in practice for hydraulic cleaning procedures after hydraulic cleaning the mfss were stopped for biomass characterization 2 3 operating conditions 2 3 1 operating conditions during biofilm development the feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 which is equivalent to a linear flow velocity of 0 175 m s 1 representing practical conditions at membrane filtration installations bucs et al 2016 eight fully independent mfss table 1 were run in parallel in a cross flow mode at a constant pressure of 2 bar without permeate production previous studies showed the same pressure drop increase and biofilm formation in a nanofiltration nf installation with and without permeation vrouwenvelder et al 2007a 2007b a nutrient stock solution was added to the feed water containing glucose sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate to enhance biofilm growth in the flow cell the nutrient stock solution increased the assimilable organic carbon concentration of the feed water by 125 μg c l 1 the same carbon concentration was used for all the membrane fouling simulators to only analyze the impact of different phosphorus conditions on biofilm removal the chosen carbon type glucose and concentration 125 μg c l 1 was based on a previous study by abushaban et al 2019 where they reported a bacterial growth potential bgp of 128 μg c l 1 as glucose for the ro feedwater of a desalination plant performing one cleaning in place cip per year previous studies showed that a reasonable carbon to nitrogen ratio c n to promote bacterial growth is 100 20 which was the ratio used for this study farhat et al 2019 sanawar et al 2018 the phosphorus concentration in seawater ranges from 3 to 11 μg p l 1 and after water pretreatment with processes such as coagulation it may be restricted to values below 1 μg p l 1 jacobson et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 figure s1 in supplementary material shows the phosphorous concentrations measurements taken at different stages of the seawater reverse osmosis swro plant at king abdullah university of science and technology the phosphorus concentrations for this study 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 were selected based on phosphorus measurements which are typically present in seawater s1 and the ro feed water after the addition of phosphorus based antiscalants s3 chemicals from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany were purchased in analytical grade the nutrient stock solution s ph value was set at 11 by the addition of sodium hydroxide to restrict bacterial growth the feed water flow rate was high 17 0 l h 1 compared to the dosing flow rate of the nutrient solution 0 03 l h 1 consequently the high ph value of the nutrient solution did not affect the feed water ph of 7 8 dreszer et al 2014 before nutrient dosage on day 0 the outlet water from the cross flow was collected for 1 h to measure adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and total cell count to use this data as a baseline 2 3 2 operating conditions during hydraulic cleaning two mfss for each nutrient condition were hydraulically cleaned once the mfs reached a pressure drop increase of 140 53 mbar cleaning was performed without permeate production the impact of concentration polarization during cleaning is negligible in practice cleaning is done at a much lower feed pressure compared to operation the cross flow velocity was increased from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h and then returned to the original cross flow conditions 0 18 m s 1 for an additional hour once the mfs reached a pressure drop increase of 53 mbar the outlet water from the cross flow was collected for 1 h before during and after the hydraulic cleaning for characterization purposes measurements of adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and total cell count these parameters were used to analyze and quantify the flushed biomass and compared it to what remained on the membrane and feed spacer 2 4 biomass quantification and characterization 2 4 1 total bacterial cell count at the end of the experiments the mfss were stopped and disassembled for biomass characterization total bacterial cell counts tcc in the biofilm were performed by flow cytometry following the protocol reported by neu et al 2019 coupons of 4 2 cm2 of the biofouled membrane and spacer were cut from the mfs s inlet and outlet positions the coupons were then placed in a capped tube with 40 ml ultrapure water the samples were vortexed and sonicated for 2 min to detach biomass from the membrane and spacer a sample of

collected at fl1 533 30 nm fl3 670 nm with sideward and forward scattered light intensities also obtained all data were processed with the bd accuri cflow software electronic gating was used to select sybr green labeled signals to quantify the total bacterial cell count following the procedure described by hammes and egli 2005 2 4 2 adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon membrane and feed spacer coupons of 4 4 cm2 were retrieved from the mfs inlet and outlet positions to analyze accumulated adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc the coupons were placed in a capped tube containing 40 ml of sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc quantification next the tubes were vortexed for a few seconds and placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz to detach the biomass from membranes and spacers the sonication procedure 2 min was repeated until the liquid was homogenous the water collected from the tubes was used as a sample to determine atp and toc concentrations in the biofilms samples were measured in duplicate for atp measurements a luminometer celsis advance charles river laboratories inc usa was used toc measurements were performed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan equipped with a high sensitivity catalyst high sense tc catalyst shimadzu japan a stock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate toc standard solution icc 033 5 ultra scientific usa was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain solutions with carbon concentrations between 0 and 10 mg l 1 c to prepare a calibration curve the detection limit of the method was about 0 1 mg l 1 c 2 4 3 extraction and characterization of extracellular polymeric substances eps eps was extracted from the biofouled membrane and spacer by cutting a 4 4 cm2 coupon from the mfs and placing it into tubes containing 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution pbs the tubes were vortexed for 2 min and sonicated for 5 min to separate the biomass from the membranes and feed spacers the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 in brief the water collected from the tubes was used as a sample for eps extraction a solution of 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa was added to the samples and incubated at 4 c for 1 h next 4 ml 1 n naoh was added to the samples and incubated at 4 c for 3 h followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pore sized membrane and dialyzed using a 3500 da dialysis membrane thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h samples were then lyophilized for 48 h and resuspended in 10 ml of ultrapure water these samples were used to determine the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem the feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s feem peaks were identified according to baghoth et al 2011 the feem plots presented in this study show four main regions i humic like excitation 280 nm emission 380 nm ii protein like excitation 250 280 nm emission 380 nm iii fulvic acid like excitation 220 250 nm emission 380 nm and iv tyrosine like excitation 220 250 nm emission 330 380 nm 2 5 optical coherence tomography oct in

dimensions xz two dimensional images are combined to form three dimensional 3d representations xyz in seconds six three dimensional images were taken at the inlet middle and outlet positions of each mfs for visualization purposes each 3d image consisted of 278 two dimensional images images were taken at a high resolution frequency of 36 khz with a refractive index of 1 33 the images had a length of 5 00 mm and a depth of 1 00 mm with a pixel size in the x direction of 18 00 μm and a z direction of 2 13 μm the images showed in this study were representative from all the images analyzed 3 results 3 1 membrane performance parameter feed channel pressure drop this study assessed the hydraulic cleanability of biofilms developed under two phosphorus concentrations 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h we used 140 feed channel pressure drop increase 53 mbar from the initial value as a parameter for either stopping the control membrane fouling simulators or for performing the hydraulic cleaning figure s2 biofilms grown under the 3 μg p l 1 phosphorus condition took 15 days longer to reach the defined pressure drop fig 1 a pressure drop recovery after hydraulic cleaning of only 3 was measured for biofilms grown under 6 μg p l 1 compared to 60 recovery for biofilms grown under 3 μg p l 1 fig 1b a better recovery in pressure drop was achieved for biofilms grown under a lower phosphorus concentration 3 2 biomass characterization 3 2 1 characterization of the cross flow outlet water on day 0 and on the last day of the experiment we characterized the cross flow outlet water to quantify total cell count adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon before during and after hydraulic cleaning the total cell count tcc in the cross flow outlet water was 0 24 105 cells ml 1 on day 0 an increase in the bacterial cell count in the cross flow outlet water for both the 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 was observed when a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached the collected cross flow outlet water before hydraulic cleaning had a total cell count of 0 84 105 cells ml 1 for the 3 μg p l 1 and 0 95 105 cells ml 1 for the 6 μg p l 1 condition during the hydraulic cleaning tcc increased to 9 78 and 1 89 105 cells ml 1 respectively fig 2 a the increase in the total cell count in the cross flow outlet water during hydraulic cleaning was higher for the 3 μg p l 1 condition suggesting a better biofilm removal adenosine triphosphate atp in the cross flow outlet water was 1 25 pg ml 1 on day 0 during hydraulic cleaning a higher atp concentration was released in the cross flow outlet water for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 phosphorus compared to 6 μg p l 1 for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 the atp concentration was 59 22 pg ml 1 before hydraulic cleaning and 871 41 pg ml 1 during hydraulic cleaning compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where before and during hydraulic cleaning the atp values were 34 85 and 121 74 pg ml 1 respectively fig 2b the cross flow outlet water showed a higher amount of adenosine triphosphate during hydraulic cleaning for the 3 μg p l 1 condition suggesting a better removal of active bacteria the total organic carbon toc in the cross flow outlet water was 0 57 mg l 1 on day 0 for biofilms grown at 3 and 6 μg p l 1 the toc before hydraulic cleaning was 0 89 and 1 42 mg l 1 respectively and during hydraulic cleaning the toc increased to 2 16 and 1 46 mg l 1 respectively the toc for the 6 μg p l 1 concentration did not show a significant increase in the cross flow outlet water during hydraulic cleaning fig 2c the cross flow outlet water collected after a pressure drop increase of 140 showed a clearly higher tcc atp and toc values during hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 suggesting better biomass removal 3 2 2 biomass characterization on the membrane and spacer the biomass parameters total cell count adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon for the biofouled membrane and spacer lead to the same conclusions as to the cross flow outlet water fig 3 a b shows the total cell count and adenosine triphosphate of the biofouled membranes and spacers before and after the hydraulic cleaning the control mfss where no hydraulic cleaning was performed were stopped and autopsied once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached for the control mfss the biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 showed significantly higher tcc 8 01 107 cells cm 2 and atp values 88 52 103 pg cm 2 compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 at the same biodegradable carbon concentration 2 96 107 cells cm 2 and 24 44 103 pg cm 2 respectively these results demonstrated that the lower phosphorus concentration restricted bacterial growth in the developed biofilms grown at at 3 μg p l 1 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 3c shows the toc for biofilms developed at both phosphorus concentrations 6 and 3 μg p l 1 which did not show a significant difference at the end of the experiment 0 071 and 0 067 mg c cm 2 respectively the results revealed that biofilms with lower tcc and atp values before performing hydraulic cleaning had the same pressure drop increase due to the same toc content after 1 h of hydraulic cleaning two mfss for each phosphorus concentration were autopsied for biomass characterization by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 to 0 35 m s 1 the total cell count for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 showed a 67 reduction after hydraulic cleaning the tcc went from 2 96 to 0 97 107 cells cm 2 compared with biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where the tcc value dropped 29 from 8 01 to 5 71 107 cells cm 2 fig 3a similarly fig 3b demonstrates that the atp showed the highest reduction 82 for biofilms developed at 3 μg p l 1 from 24 44 to 4 48 103 pg cm 2 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 from 88 52 to 61 07 103 pg cm 2 fig 3c shows a 55 decrease in toc for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 from 0 067 to 0 031 mg cm 2 compared to the 18 toc decrease for biofilms developed at a higher phosphorus concentration from 0 071 to 0 058 mg cm 2 in summary more biofilm biomass in terms of tcc atp and toc was removed after hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration at the end of the experiment extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted for all the biofouled membranes and spacers to determine organic composition using the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem plots fig 4 four main regions can be distinguished in the feem plot i humic like excitation 280 nm emission 380 nm ii protein like excitation 250 280 nm emission 380 nm iii fulvic acid like excitation 220 250 nm emission 380 nm and iv tyrosine like excitation 220 250 nm emission 330 380 nm fig 4a and c shows the feem plots for the biofilm developed at both phosphorus concentrations before hydraulic cleaning the eps of both biofilms 6 and 3 μg p l 1 showed similar peaks of humic acid like substances 26 290 and 24 147 counts per second microampere respectively and tyrosine like substances 203 069 and 190 120 counts per second microampere respectively biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 showed a higher peak in fulvic acid like substances 158 756 counts per second microampere compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 104 720 counts per second microampere a higher fluorescence intensity was shown for biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where a higher peak was observed for protein like substances 627 976 counts per second microampere compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 293 873 counts per second microampere fig 4e shows the reduction in fluorescence intensity after hydraulic cleaning for the biofouled membranes and spacers for both conditions after hydraulic cleaning the peak for the humic like substances of the biofilms developed at 6 and 3 μg p l 1 reduced in 16 and 8 respectively a higher reduction was observed in the fluorescence intensity of protein substances for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 69 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 50 indicating a better protein removal the removal of fulvic like substances showed a similar result where the reduction in the peak after hydraulic cleaning was 23 for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 compared with the reduction of 15 of biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 tyrosine like substances reduced in a 40 and 48 for biofilms grown at 6 and 3 μg p l 1 respectively fig 4b and d in summary before hydraulic cleaning the toc was about the same for biofilms grown at both phosphorus concentrations fig 3c however fig 4 shows that biofilms differing in eps composition varying amounts of humic acids proteins fulvic acids and tyrosine had the same pressure drop increase fig 1 3 3 biofilm structural properties the biofilm structure was visualized by optical coherence tomography three dimensional images each composed of 278 two dimensional images in the xz direction were assessed the images were taken at the inlet middle and outlet positions of each membrane fouling simulator on the last day of the experiments before and after hydraulic cleaning fig 5 fig 5e shows an oct image of a clean membrane and spacer on day 0 before hydraulic cleaning for the biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 5a the membranes looked to contain more biofilm compared to the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 fig 5c oct images confirmed biomass characterization results of the biofouled membranes and spacers where more biomass was removed after hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 5d compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 5b fig 5a and c shows the formation of biofilm streamers in both mfss these filamentous structures were significantly removed by the hydraulic cleaning for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 fig 5d compared to biofilms grown at a higher phosphorus concentration fig 5b to sum up for both phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 the biomass quantity and the biofilm streamers caused a detrimental effect on membrane performance such as pressure drop increase fig 6 shows a summary of different biomass parameters reduction after hydraulic cleaning a slight restoration of 3 in the feed channel pressure drop for biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 was accompanied by a reduction of 29 of tcc 31 of atp 18 of toc and 50 of proteins recovery of 60 in the feed channel pressure drop for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 represented a reduction of 67 of tcc 82 of atp 55 of toc and 69 of proteins the overall results indicate that the biofilms are structurally different due to different nutrient feed water phosphorus concentrations and therefore detach differently in response to changes in flow patterns under these circumstances better removal of active biomass atp tcc and proteins was achieved by biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration therefore biofilms developed under a low phosphorus concentration demonstrate an enhanced hydraulic cleanability 4 discussion 4 1 biofilms grown at a low phosphorus concentration have an enhanced hydraulic cleanability developing effective and reliable biofilm cleaning strategies requires understanding how nutrient composition in the feed water affects biofilm composition previous studies have reported various mechanisms to influence biofilm s eps composition i the material of membranes and spacers bucs et al 2017 miller et al 2012 ii the water characteristics farhat et al 2019 and operational conditions of the system farhat et al 2016 therefore different eps composition influence biofilm structural properties and thus the biofilm detachment when changes in the cross flow patterns occur desmond et al 2018a this study assessed the efficiency of hydraulic cleaning of biofilms grown under two phosphorus concentrations 6 μg p l 1 and 3 μg p l 1 by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the results showed a higher pressure drop reduction explained by an enhanced detachment of biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 1b we attribute the enhanced detachment of biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 to two main factors i the composition of eps and ii the cohesive strength of phosphorus limiting biofilms the first factor relates to the composition of the extracellular polymeric substances thus changing eps sorption and adhesiveness proteins can be involved in hydrophobic interactions resulting in an adsorptive eps lawrence et al 2007 it has been reported that the adsorptive eps gives the biofilm sorption characteristics by binding various nutrients metals and contaminants which in turn increases biofilm rigidity hobley et al 2015 neu and lawrence 2010 moreover it has been previously shown that phosphate limitation results in the loss of adhesin lapa an adhesion protein required for biofilm formation monds et al 2007 lapa has been correlated with more permanent associations with surfaces petrova and sauer 2012 in this study biofilms grown at a higher phosphorus concentration 6 μg p l 1 showed 53 higher protein production fig 4 indicating a more rigid and more sticky structure compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 an additional finding from this study is the higher amount of fulvic acids 52 present for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 4c which was reduced after hydraulic cleaning humic substances are heterogenic organic constituents found in soils and water depending on their solubility humic substances can be divided into three fractions humic acids fulvic acids and humin yee et al 2006 fulvic acids are soluble in natural waters independent of the ph on the contrary humic acids are insoluble in the water below ph 8 davies et al 1995 fulvic acids are natural amphiphilic polymers with carboxylic and phenolic oh groups forming a micelle like structure singh 2015 it has been suggested that amphiphilic polymers aid bacteria in detaching from interfaces neu and lawrence 2010 in our study when the cross flow was increased for 1 h the higher presence of fulvic acids in the biofilm grown at a lower phosphorus concentration helped solubilize and detach the biofilm from the membrane and spacer the combination of lower protein production and more soluble and amphiphilic polymers in the eps causes the enhanced cleanability of biofilms grown at lower phosphorus concentration the second factor relates to the cohesive strength of phosphorus limiting biofilms eps composition determines biofilms mechanical properties such as cohesive strength a material s ability to hold itself together under stress flemming 2016 rowlinson 2002 desmond et al 2018b showed that biofilms grown under restricted phosphorus conditions sloughed and peeled off from the membrane when increasing the shear stress from 0 to 2 bar pressure in a gravity driven membrane system they explained the biofilm detachment by performing a biofilm rheological analysis where biofilms grown under phosphorus limiting conditions showed a weaker cohesive strength we confirmed with the oct images that biofilm structures detached better at a lower phosphorus concentration when increasing the cross flow velocity fig 5 in agreement with our study the results confirmed that phosphorus limitation determines the biofilm mechanical properties such as cohesive strength and the ability of a material to hold itself together under stress 4 2 biofilm structural properties play an essential effect on pressure drop increase organic compounds in the feed water and hydrodynamic conditions influence biofilm structural properties desmond et al 2018c farhat et al 2019 some studies have reported the formation of distinct biofilm structures called streamers these filamentous structures develop in the surface on one or both ends while the rest is floating in the fluid stoodley et al 2005 valiei et al 2012 biofilm streamers cause significant disruption of the flow negatively impacting the pressure drop das and kumar 2014 graf von der schulenburg et al 2008 valiei et al 2012 in this study the higher phosphorus concentration 6 μg p l 1 resulted in biofilm attached to the surfaces and biofilm streamers on the contrary at a lower phosphorus concentration the streamers were the governing biofilm structure fig 5 both biofilms had a similar total organic carbon fig 3c however the phosphate limiting biofilm showed a substantially lower bacterial cell activity tcc and atp this result indicates that regardless of the biomass composition the biofilm structural properties play a significant role on the pressure drop increase and detachment from membranes and spacers 4 3 practical implications desalination plants usually dose phosphorus based antiscalants to control scale formation in the membrane modules increasing the phosphorus concentration in the feed water ali et al 2015 antiscalants easily avoid precipitation of soluble salts such as caco3 and caso4 however the removal of calcium phosphate is still questionable greenberg et al 2005 previous research demonstrated that increasing the concentration of phosphorus can lead to the formation of colloidal composites within a very short time of less than seconds promoting calcium phosphate scaling on the membrane dahdal et al 2016 pipich et al 2013 moreover it has been previously reported that some antiscalants can increase the assimilable organic content in the feed water and therefore increase the biofouling potential vrouwenvelder et al 2000 our study recommends a low cost optimization strategy for reverse osmosis desalination plants by lowering or avoiding the increase of the phosphorus concentration in the feed water by adding different chemicals antiscalants acids biocides to develop a biofilm with enhanced hydraulic cleanability the phosphates added to the antiscalants get concentrated in the brine and act as a nutrient for algae promoting eutrophication when brine is discharged into the sea generating environmental problems el din et al 1994 popov et al 2017 besides the environmental advantages of dosing phosphorus free antiscalants if phosphorus limitation is combined with carbon restriction after feed water pretreatment the approach could delay biofilm formation prolonging the system performance javier et al 2020 our recommendation to lower the phosphorus and carbon concentration in the feed water and periodic hydraulic cleaning anticipate a sustainable method to extend system performance while maintaining water production and therefore reducing the overall water cost 4 4 future research biofouling control strategies have focused mainly on eradicating biofilm development araújo et al 2012a kim and park 2016 this study proves that biofilm engineering e g manipulating the feed water nutrient composition would enable improved biofilm management strategies in that sense it will be possible to engineer control and manage biofilms that are easier to be cleaned by solubilization and removal this study evaluated the detachment of biofilm grown at two phosphorus concentrations after performing a hydraulic cleaning the characterization of the eps on the membrane and the biomass quantification of the outlet water when increasing the cross flow velocity could be used to determine the removal potential of biofilms grown at different nutrient conditions to changes in the cross flow pattern future research should focus on testing i different nutrient conditions and ii permeate conditions and their effect on biofilm detachment this data could be used to customize and design more effective cleaning protocols for better biofilm removal such as i the proper selection of hydraulic cleaning methods backflush forward flush bubbles gas liquid two phase flow cleaning ii the effect of hydraulic cleaning combined with chemical cleaning along with membrane and spacer modification for biofouling control araújo et al 2012b bucs et al 2017 and iii the optimization of operational parameters during cleaning procedures chen et al 2003 it has been shown that cleaning in place cip efficiency is lower for full scale ro than lab scale mfs jafari et al 2020 therefore further studies should also be performed in full scale installations by lowering the phosphorus concentration in the feed water to validate the efficiency of cleaning strategies 5 conclusions this study analyzed the effect of hydraulic cleaning by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h on biofilm grown at two phosphorus concentrations 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 with the same biodegradable organic carbon content feed channel pressure drop measurements and the characterization of the mfs cross flow outlet water and biomass on the membrane and spacer were used as an indicator to analyze system performance and hydraulic cleaning efficiency the membrane fouling simulators were hydraulically cleaned stopped and sampled for biofilm analysis tcc atp toc and eps characterization once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached 140 from its initial value the conclusions of this study can be summarized by i biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 have a higher hydraulic cleanability compared to biofilms grown a 6 μg p l 1 the higher detachment for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration is explained by fewer proteins and more soluble polymers in the eps translating in a lower biofilm cohesive and adhesive strength ii different biomass composition in terms of atp tcc and eps components can have the same detrimental effect on pressure drop increase explained by the biofilm s structural arrangement in the flow channel biofilm streamers iii the manipulation of nutrient composition in the feed water could develop biofilms that are easier to be removed by hydraulic cleaning methods iv the use of phosphorus based antiscalants increases the phosphorus concentration in the feed water thereby producing a biofilm with higher cohesive strength and subsequently reducing the biofilm hydraulic cleanability v the hydraulic cleaning technique proposed in this study could be used to analyze the detachment of biofilms grown at different nutrient composition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19971,a critical problem in seawater reverse osmosis ro filtration processes is biofilm accumulation which reduces system performance and increases energy requirements as a result membrane systems need to be periodically cleaned by combining chemical and physical protocols nutrient limitation in the feed water is a strategy to control biofilm formation lengthening stable membrane system performance however the cleanability of biofilms developed under various feed water nutrient conditions is not well understood this study analyzes the removal efficiency of biofilms grown in membrane fouling simulators mfss supplied with water varying in phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 and with constant biodegradable carbon concentration by applying hydraulic cleaning after a defined 140 increase in the feed channel pressure drop through increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 simulate the ro feed water without and with the addition of a phosphorus based antiscalant respectively and were chosen based on measurements at a full scale seawater ro desalination plant biomass quantification parameters performed after membrane autopsies such as total cell count adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and extracellular polymeric substances were used along with feed channel pressure drop measurements to evaluate biofilm removal efficiency the outlet water during hydraulic cleaning 1 h was collected and characterized as well optical coherence tomography images were taken before and after hydraulic cleaning for visualization of biofilm morphology biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 had an enhanced hydraulic cleanability compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 the higher detachment for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration was explained by more soluble polymers in the eps resulting in a lower biofilm cohesive and adhesive strength this study confirms that manipulating the feed water nutrient composition can engineer a biofilm that is easier to remove shifting research focus towards biofilm engineering and more sustainable cleaning strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate limitation drinking water production biofouling biofilm streamers seawater desalination 1 introduction seawater reverse osmosis swro membrane systems have emerged in recent decades to overcome the global increase in freshwater demand a fundamental issue in swro filtration processes is the fouling of the membrane membrane fouling raises the system s hydraulic resistance and increases energy requirements ansari et al 2020 one of the most challenging types of fouling is biofouling the excessive growth of a biofilm a biofilm develops through the attachment and growth of bacterial cells embedded in a produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2020 biofouling negatively impacts the system performance increasing the feed channel pressure drop decreasing the flux and salt rejection and increasing the overall water cost siebdrath et al 2019 one proposed strategy for biofouling control is limiting biodegradable organic nutrients in the feed water to reduce bacteria s potential to grow keinänen et al 2002 lehtola et al 1999 2001 2002 miettinen et al 1997 in full scale plants pretreatment processes reduce nutrient concentration and bacterial cell concentration feed water pretreatment is done by various processes arranged in different configurations such as dissolved air flotation inline coagulation biologically activated carbon filtration slow sand filtration dual media filtration and ultrafiltration abushaban et al 2019 farhat et al 2018 almost all conventional pretreatment systems used in ro plants utilize low micron range cartridge filter cf units as a final protection barrier before the high pressure pumps of the ro membranes farhat et al 2020 the types of treatment steps applied and sequence of pretreatment processes can vary between plants there is no standard pretreatment process research has focused on restricting other nutrients such as phosphorus concentration in the feed water javier et al 2020 kim et al 2014 pinel et al 2020 sevcenco et al 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 although phosphorous limitation has been shown to be effective in delaying biofilm formation and prolonging the system performance the unintentional addition of phosphorous to the feed water through the dosage of phosphorus based antiscalants is still performed antiscalants are often dosed to the ro feed water to avoid the scaling accumulation on the membrane it has been previously reported that some antiscalants increase the organic content and therefore increase bacterial growth potential vrouwenvelder et al 2000 membrane modules are cleaned to remove accumulated fouling and restore system performance usually when the overall differential pressure drop increases by more than 15 singh 2015 membrane cleaning is generally done using chemical and physical protocols chen et al 2003 recent studies focused on advanced physical cleaning methods to reduce the environmental impact and associated cost of chemical cleaning several hydraulic cleaning methods are reported in the literature such as i reverse flushing by changing the direction of the flow from the concentrate to the feed side ii reverse module operation where the elements are turned around and the brine seal moved to the other end andes et al 2013 iii forward flushing by increasing the cross flow velocity iv soaking of membranes mcdonald et al 2004 and v gas liquid two phase flow cleaning wibisono et al 2014 a previous study showed that among different hydraulic cleaning methods the reverse operation of modules achieved a higher 15 feed channel pressure drop recovery andes et al 2013 hydrodynamic conditions affect biofilm structure growth and detachment dreszer et al 2014 radu et al 2012 previous studies have reported that nutrient load in the feed water affects biofilm morphology and biofilm hydraulic resistance desmond et al 2018c farhat et al 2019 biofilm morphology plays a vital role in determining the biofilm s mechanical response to hydraulic shear stress desmond et al 2018b biofilm streamers are viscoelastic filamentous structures formed by bacteria embedded in strands of eps valiei et al 2012 biofilm streamers have caused catastrophic disruption of flow independent of bacterial cell growth das and kumar 2014 drescher et al 2013 graf von der schulenburg et al 2008 drescher et al 2013 demonstrated that biofilms attached to the surfaces had little effect on flow whereas biofilm streamers caused a higher flow disruption moreover a recent study showed biofilm grown under restricted phosphorus conditions detached by sloughing and peeling off when instantaneously increasing hydraulic shear force desmond et al 2018c the biofilm detachment was explained by a weaker cohesive strength of the phosphorus limited biofilm than the non limited biofilm previously we demonstrated that biofouling control by phosphorus limitation depends on the assimilable organic carbon concentration javier et al 2020 however the removal of biofilms developed under various feed water nutrient conditions is not well understood this study analyzes the removal efficiency of biofilms grown at two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 by applying hydraulic cleaning after a 140 increase in the feed channel pressure drop through increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the same carbon concentration was used for all the experiments to analyze the impact of phosphorus conditions only on biofilm cleanability the two phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 were chosen based on measurements taken at a seawater ro desalination plant figure s1 in supplementary material simulating the ro feed water without and with the addition of a phosphorus based antiscalant respectively biomass quantification parameters performed after membrane autopsies such as total cell count adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and extracellular polymeric substances were used along with feed channel pressure drop measurements to evaluate biofilm removal efficiency the outlet water during hydraulic cleaning 1 h was collected and characterized as well the biofilm structure was visualized with optical coherence tomography to the authors knowledge this is the first study that defines a hydraulic cleaning method to evaluate biomass detachment of biofilms grown at different feed water phosphorus conditions and therefore propose a more sustainable approach to improve membrane system performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the feed water used for this study was tap water produced by reverse osmosis ro desalination supplemented with nutrients table 1 to assure an extremely low phosphorus content as a baseline 0 3 μg p l 1 the tap water is produced through ro desalination at the king abdullah university of science and technology desalination plant thuwal jeddah saudi arabia and distributed to the network with residual chlorine belila et al 2016 the chlorine in the feed water was removed by an activated carbon filter filter housing model ups bb3 awf ups 3h 20b cartridge model sediment carbon ac sc 10 nl to protect the membranes water was passed through two cartridge filters pore size 4 μm to remove particles entering the feed water from the carbon filter the experiments were conducted in a lab scale setup with hydraulics water characteristics and materials representative of swro membrane systems farhat et al 2019 the setup consisted of a feed water pump a feed flow controller a pump for dosing the nutrients a flow cell called a membrane fouling simulator mfs vrouwenvelder et al 2007 a back pressure valve bronkhorst ruurlo netherlands and a differential pressure sensor delta bar pmd75 endress hauser switzerland to monitor the pressure drop over the feed channel the mfs had inlet and outlet orifices for pressure drop measurements a reverse osmosis ro polyamide membrane sheet with the dimensions of 20 cm 3 5 cm and a 34 mil 864 μm thick feed channel spacer taken from a new commercially available spiral wound membrane element tw30 4040 dow filmtec usa were placed inside the mfs the feed flow channel height is 0 864 mm equal to the feed spacer thickness 2 2 fouling monitoring by feed channel pressure drop earlier work has shown that reverse osmosis biofouling is a feed channel problem vrouwenvelder et al 2009 pressure drop measurements were recorded as an indicator of system performance of ro biofouling as feed channel pressure drop was shown to be the first and strongest impacted performance indicator siebdrath et al 2019 eight fully independent membrane fouling simulators were run simultaneously table 1 and the figures show the average and standard deviation of duplicate experiments for each scenario the average initial pressure drop registered in each mfs was 35 5 mbar for each phosphorus concentration 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 two mfss were used as a control where hydraulic cleaning was not performed these mfss were immediately stopped and sampled for biofilm analysis once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 140 53 mbar was reached the pressure drop increase chosen for the mfs simulates the biofouling condition that could be present at the inlet of the lead ro element this pressure drop increase 140 over the 0 20 m long mfs can explain a pressure drop increase of 15 over the first stage pressure vessel containing several 1 m long membrane elements is series as previously reported by vrouwenvelder et al 2009 2008 2006 hydraulic cleaning was performed for the remaining two mfss for each phosphorus condition once the same pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was achieved hydraulic cleaning was performed by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h still in the range of what is commonly applied in practice for hydraulic cleaning procedures after hydraulic cleaning the mfss were stopped for biomass characterization 2 3 operating conditions 2 3 1 operating conditions during biofilm development the feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 which is equivalent to a linear flow velocity of 0 175 m s 1 representing practical conditions at membrane filtration installations bucs et al 2016 eight fully independent mfss table 1 were run in parallel in a cross flow mode at a constant pressure of 2 bar without permeate production previous studies showed the same pressure drop increase and biofilm formation in a nanofiltration nf installation with and without permeation vrouwenvelder et al 2007a 2007b a nutrient stock solution was added to the feed water containing glucose sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate to enhance biofilm growth in the flow cell the nutrient stock solution increased the assimilable organic carbon concentration of the feed water by 125 μg c l 1 the same carbon concentration was used for all the membrane fouling simulators to only analyze the impact of different phosphorus conditions on biofilm removal the chosen carbon type glucose and concentration 125 μg c l 1 was based on a previous study by abushaban et al 2019 where they reported a bacterial growth potential bgp of 128 μg c l 1 as glucose for the ro feedwater of a desalination plant performing one cleaning in place cip per year previous studies showed that a reasonable carbon to nitrogen ratio c n to promote bacterial growth is 100 20 which was the ratio used for this study farhat et al 2019 sanawar et al 2018 the phosphorus concentration in seawater ranges from 3 to 11 μg p l 1 and after water pretreatment with processes such as coagulation it may be restricted to values below 1 μg p l 1 jacobson et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 figure s1 in supplementary material shows the phosphorous concentrations measurements taken at different stages of the seawater reverse osmosis swro plant at king abdullah university of science and technology the phosphorus concentrations for this study 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 were selected based on phosphorus measurements which are typically present in seawater s1 and the ro feed water after the addition of phosphorus based antiscalants s3 chemicals from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany were purchased in analytical grade the nutrient stock solution s ph value was set at 11 by the addition of sodium hydroxide to restrict bacterial growth the feed water flow rate was high 17 0 l h 1 compared to the dosing flow rate of the nutrient solution 0 03 l h 1 consequently the high ph value of the nutrient solution did not affect the feed water ph of 7 8 dreszer et al 2014 before nutrient dosage on day 0 the outlet water from the cross flow was collected for 1 h to measure adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and total cell count to use this data as a baseline 2 3 2 operating conditions during hydraulic cleaning two mfss for each nutrient condition were hydraulically cleaned once the mfs reached a pressure drop increase of 140 53 mbar cleaning was performed without permeate production the impact of concentration polarization during cleaning is negligible in practice cleaning is done at a much lower feed pressure compared to operation the cross flow velocity was increased from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h and then returned to the original cross flow conditions 0 18 m s 1 for an additional hour once the mfs reached a pressure drop increase of 53 mbar the outlet water from the cross flow was collected for 1 h before during and after the hydraulic cleaning for characterization purposes measurements of adenosine triphosphate total organic carbon and total cell count these parameters were used to analyze and quantify the flushed biomass and compared it to what remained on the membrane and feed spacer 2 4 biomass quantification and characterization 2 4 1 total bacterial cell count at the end of the experiments the mfss were stopped and disassembled for biomass characterization total bacterial cell counts tcc in the biofilm were performed by flow cytometry following the protocol reported by neu et al 2019 coupons of 4 2 cm2 of the biofouled membrane and spacer were cut from the mfs s inlet and outlet positions the coupons were then placed in a capped tube with 40 ml ultrapure water the samples were vortexed and sonicated for 2 min to detach biomass from the membrane and spacer a sample of

collected at fl1 533 30 nm fl3 670 nm with sideward and forward scattered light intensities also obtained all data were processed with the bd accuri cflow software electronic gating was used to select sybr green labeled signals to quantify the total bacterial cell count following the procedure described by hammes and egli 2005 2 4 2 adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon membrane and feed spacer coupons of 4 4 cm2 were retrieved from the mfs inlet and outlet positions to analyze accumulated adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc the coupons were placed in a capped tube containing 40 ml of sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc quantification next the tubes were vortexed for a few seconds and placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz to detach the biomass from membranes and spacers the sonication procedure 2 min was repeated until the liquid was homogenous the water collected from the tubes was used as a sample to determine atp and toc concentrations in the biofilms samples were measured in duplicate for atp measurements a luminometer celsis advance charles river laboratories inc usa was used toc measurements were performed with a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan equipped with a high sensitivity catalyst high sense tc catalyst shimadzu japan a stock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate toc standard solution icc 033 5 ultra scientific usa was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain solutions with carbon concentrations between 0 and 10 mg l 1 c to prepare a calibration curve the detection limit of the method was about 0 1 mg l 1 c 2 4 3 extraction and characterization of extracellular polymeric substances eps eps was extracted from the biofouled membrane and spacer by cutting a 4 4 cm2 coupon from the mfs and placing it into tubes containing 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution pbs the tubes were vortexed for 2 min and sonicated for 5 min to separate the biomass from the membranes and feed spacers the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 in brief the water collected from the tubes was used as a sample for eps extraction a solution of 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa was added to the samples and incubated at 4 c for 1 h next 4 ml 1 n naoh was added to the samples and incubated at 4 c for 3 h followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pore sized membrane and dialyzed using a 3500 da dialysis membrane thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h samples were then lyophilized for 48 h and resuspended in 10 ml of ultrapure water these samples were used to determine the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem the feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s feem peaks were identified according to baghoth et al 2011 the feem plots presented in this study show four main regions i humic like excitation 280 nm emission 380 nm ii protein like

results 3 1 membrane performance parameter feed channel pressure drop this study assessed the hydraulic cleanability of biofilms developed under two phosphorus concentrations 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h we used 140 feed channel pressure drop increase 53 mbar from the initial value as a parameter for either stopping the control membrane fouling simulators or for performing the hydraulic cleaning figure s2 biofilms grown under the 3 μg p l 1 phosphorus condition took 15 days longer to reach the defined pressure drop fig 1 a pressure drop recovery after hydraulic cleaning of only 3 was measured for biofilms grown under 6 μg p l 1 compared to 60 recovery for biofilms grown under 3 μg p l 1 fig 1b a better recovery in pressure drop was achieved for biofilms grown under a lower phosphorus concentration 3 2 biomass characterization 3 2 1 characterization of the cross flow outlet water on day 0 and on the last day of the experiment we characterized the cross flow outlet water to quantify total cell count adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon before during and after hydraulic cleaning the total cell count tcc in the cross flow outlet water was 0 24 105 cells ml 1 on day 0 an increase in the bacterial cell count in the cross flow outlet water for both the 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 was observed when a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached the collected cross flow outlet water before hydraulic cleaning had a total cell count of 0 84 105 cells ml 1 for the 3 μg p l 1 and 0 95 105 cells ml 1 for the 6 μg p l 1 condition during the hydraulic cleaning tcc increased to 9 78 and 1 89 105 cells ml 1 respectively fig 2 a the increase in the total cell count in the cross flow outlet water during hydraulic cleaning was higher for the 3 μg p l 1 condition suggesting a better biofilm removal adenosine triphosphate atp in the cross flow outlet water was 1 25 pg ml 1 on day 0 during hydraulic cleaning a higher atp concentration was released in the cross flow outlet water for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 phosphorus compared to 6 μg p l 1 for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 the atp concentration was 59 22 pg ml 1 before hydraulic cleaning and 871 41 pg ml 1 during hydraulic cleaning compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where before and during hydraulic cleaning the atp values were 34 85 and 121 74 pg ml 1 respectively fig 2b the cross flow outlet water showed a higher amount of adenosine triphosphate during hydraulic cleaning for the 3 μg p l 1 condition suggesting a better removal of active bacteria the total organic carbon toc in the cross flow outlet water was 0 57 mg l 1 on day 0 for biofilms grown at 3 and 6 μg p l 1 the toc before hydraulic cleaning was 0 89 and 1 42 mg l 1 respectively and during hydraulic cleaning the toc increased to 2 16 and 1 46 mg l 1 respectively the toc for the 6 μg p l 1 concentration did not show a significant increase in the cross flow outlet water during hydraulic cleaning fig 2c the cross flow outlet water collected after a pressure drop increase of 140 showed a clearly higher tcc atp and toc values during hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 suggesting better biomass removal 3 2 2 biomass characterization on the membrane and spacer the biomass parameters total cell count adenosine triphosphate and total organic carbon for the biofouled membrane and spacer lead to the same conclusions as to the cross flow outlet water fig 3 a b shows the total cell count and adenosine triphosphate of the biofouled membranes and spacers before and after the hydraulic cleaning the control mfss where no hydraulic cleaning was performed were stopped and autopsied once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached for the control mfss the biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 showed significantly higher tcc 8 01 107 cells cm 2 and atp values 88 52 103 pg cm 2 compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 at the same biodegradable carbon concentration 2 96 107 cells cm 2 and 24 44 103 pg cm 2 respectively these results demonstrated that the lower phosphorus concentration restricted bacterial growth in the developed biofilms grown at at 3 μg p l 1 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 3c shows the toc for biofilms developed at both phosphorus concentrations 6 and 3 μg p l 1 which did not show a significant difference at the end of the experiment 0 071 and 0 067 mg c cm 2 respectively the results revealed that biofilms with lower tcc and atp values before performing hydraulic cleaning had the same pressure drop increase due to the same toc content after 1 h of hydraulic cleaning two mfss for each phosphorus concentration were autopsied for biomass characterization by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 to 0 35 m s 1 the total cell count for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 showed a 67 reduction after hydraulic cleaning the tcc went from 2 96 to 0 97 107 cells cm 2 compared with biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where the tcc value dropped 29 from 8 01 to 5 71 107 cells cm 2 fig 3a similarly fig 3b demonstrates that the atp showed the highest reduction 82 for biofilms developed at 3 μg p l 1 from 24 44 to 4 48 103 pg cm 2 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 from 88 52 to 61 07 103 pg cm 2 fig 3c shows a 55 decrease in toc for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 from 0 067 to 0 031 mg cm 2 compared to the 18 toc decrease for biofilms developed at a higher phosphorus concentration from 0 071 to 0 058 mg cm 2 in summary more biofilm biomass in terms of tcc atp and toc was removed after hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration at the end of the experiment extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted for all the biofouled membranes and spacers to determine organic composition using the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem plots fig 4 four main regions can be distinguished in the feem plot i humic like excitation 280 nm emission 380 nm ii protein like excitation 250 280 nm emission 380 nm iii fulvic acid like excitation 220 250 nm emission 380 nm and iv tyrosine like excitation 220 250 nm emission 330 380 nm fig 4a and c shows the feem plots for the biofilm developed at both phosphorus concentrations before hydraulic cleaning the eps of both biofilms 6 and 3 μg p l 1 showed similar peaks of humic acid like substances 26 290 and 24 147 counts per second microampere respectively and tyrosine like substances 203 069 and 190 120 counts per second microampere respectively biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 showed a higher peak in fulvic acid like substances 158 756 counts per second microampere compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 104 720 counts per second microampere a higher fluorescence intensity was shown for biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 where a higher peak was observed for protein like substances 627 976 counts per second microampere compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 293 873 counts per second microampere fig 4e shows the reduction in fluorescence intensity after hydraulic cleaning for the biofouled membranes and spacers for both conditions after hydraulic cleaning the peak for the humic like substances of the biofilms developed at 6 and 3 μg p l 1 reduced in 16 and 8 respectively a higher reduction was observed in the fluorescence intensity of protein substances for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 69 compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 50 indicating a better protein removal the removal of fulvic like substances showed a similar result where the reduction in the peak after hydraulic cleaning was 23 for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 compared with the reduction of 15 of biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 tyrosine like substances reduced in a 40 and 48 for biofilms grown at 6 and 3 μg p l 1 respectively fig 4b and d in summary before hydraulic cleaning the toc was about the same for biofilms grown at both phosphorus concentrations fig 3c however fig 4 shows that biofilms differing in eps composition varying amounts of humic acids proteins fulvic acids and tyrosine had the same pressure drop increase fig 1 3 3 biofilm structural properties the biofilm structure was visualized by optical coherence tomography three dimensional images each composed of 278 two dimensional images in the xz direction were assessed the images were taken at the inlet middle and outlet positions of each membrane fouling simulator on the last day of the experiments before and after hydraulic cleaning fig 5 fig 5e shows an oct image of a clean membrane and spacer on day 0 before hydraulic cleaning for the biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 5a the membranes looked to contain more biofilm compared to the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 fig 5c oct images confirmed biomass characterization results of the biofouled membranes and spacers where more biomass was removed after hydraulic cleaning for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 5d compared to biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 fig 5b fig 5a and c shows the formation of biofilm streamers in both mfss these filamentous structures were significantly removed by the hydraulic cleaning for the biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 fig 5d compared to biofilms grown at a higher phosphorus concentration fig 5b to sum up for both phosphorus concentrations 3 and 6 μg p l 1 the biomass quantity and the biofilm streamers caused a detrimental effect on membrane performance such as pressure drop increase fig 6 shows a summary of different biomass parameters reduction after hydraulic cleaning a slight restoration of 3 in the feed channel pressure drop for biofilms grown at 6 μg p l 1 was accompanied by a reduction of 29 of tcc 31 of atp 18 of toc and 50 of proteins recovery of 60 in the feed channel pressure drop for biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 represented a reduction of 67 of tcc 82 of atp 55 of toc and 69 of proteins the overall results indicate that the biofilms are structurally different due to different nutrient feed water phosphorus concentrations and therefore detach differently in response to changes in flow patterns under these circumstances better removal of active biomass atp tcc and proteins was achieved by biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration therefore biofilms developed under a low phosphorus concentration demonstrate an enhanced hydraulic cleanability 4 discussion 4 1 biofilms grown at a low phosphorus concentration have an enhanced hydraulic cleanability developing effective and reliable biofilm cleaning strategies requires understanding how nutrient composition in the feed water affects biofilm composition previous studies have reported various mechanisms to influence biofilm s eps composition i the material of membranes and spacers bucs et al 2017 miller et al 2012 ii the water characteristics farhat et al 2019 and operational conditions of the system farhat et al 2016 therefore different eps composition influence biofilm structural properties and thus the biofilm detachment when changes in the cross flow patterns occur desmond et al 2018a this study assessed the efficiency of hydraulic cleaning of biofilms grown under two phosphorus concentrations 6 μg p l 1 and 3 μg p l 1 by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h the results showed a higher pressure drop reduction explained by an enhanced detachment of biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 1b we attribute the enhanced detachment of biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 to two main factors i the composition of eps and ii the cohesive strength of phosphorus limiting biofilms the first factor relates to the composition of the extracellular polymeric substances thus changing eps sorption and adhesiveness proteins can be involved in hydrophobic interactions resulting in an adsorptive eps lawrence et al 2007 it has been reported that the adsorptive eps gives the biofilm sorption characteristics by binding various nutrients metals and contaminants which in turn increases biofilm rigidity hobley et al 2015 neu and lawrence 2010 moreover it has been previously shown that phosphate limitation results in the loss of adhesin lapa an adhesion protein required for biofilm formation monds et al 2007 lapa has been correlated with more permanent associations with surfaces petrova and sauer 2012 in this study biofilms grown at a higher phosphorus concentration 6 μg p l 1 showed 53 higher protein production fig 4 indicating a more rigid and more sticky structure compared to biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 an additional finding from this study is the higher amount of fulvic acids 52 present for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration fig 4c which was reduced after hydraulic cleaning humic substances are heterogenic organic constituents found in soils and water depending on their solubility humic substances can be divided into three fractions humic acids fulvic acids and humin yee et al 2006 fulvic acids are soluble in natural waters independent of the ph on the contrary humic acids are insoluble in the water below ph 8 davies et al 1995 fulvic acids are natural amphiphilic polymers with carboxylic and phenolic oh groups forming a micelle like structure singh 2015 it has been suggested that amphiphilic polymers aid bacteria in detaching from interfaces neu and lawrence 2010 in our study when the cross flow was increased for 1 h the higher presence of fulvic acids in the biofilm grown at a lower phosphorus concentration helped solubilize and detach the biofilm from the membrane and spacer the combination of lower protein production and more soluble and amphiphilic polymers in the eps causes the enhanced cleanability of biofilms grown at lower phosphorus concentration the second factor relates to the cohesive strength of phosphorus limiting biofilms eps composition determines biofilms mechanical properties such as cohesive strength a material s ability to hold itself together under stress flemming 2016 rowlinson 2002 desmond et al 2018b showed that biofilms grown under restricted phosphorus conditions sloughed and peeled off from the membrane when increasing the shear stress from 0 to 2 bar pressure in a gravity driven membrane system they explained the biofilm detachment by performing a biofilm rheological analysis where biofilms grown under phosphorus limiting conditions showed a weaker cohesive strength we confirmed with the oct images that biofilm structures detached better at a lower phosphorus concentration when increasing the cross flow velocity fig 5 in agreement with our study the results confirmed that phosphorus limitation determines the biofilm mechanical properties such as cohesive strength and the ability of a material to hold itself together under stress 4 2 biofilm structural properties play an essential effect on pressure drop increase organic compounds in the feed water and hydrodynamic conditions influence biofilm structural properties desmond et al 2018c farhat et al 2019 some studies have reported the formation of distinct biofilm structures called streamers these filamentous structures develop in the surface on one or both ends while the rest is floating in the fluid stoodley et al 2005 valiei et al 2012 biofilm streamers cause significant disruption of the flow negatively impacting the pressure drop das and kumar 2014 graf von der schulenburg et al 2008 valiei et al 2012 in this study the higher phosphorus concentration 6 μg p l 1 resulted in biofilm attached to the surfaces and biofilm streamers on the contrary at a lower phosphorus concentration the streamers were the governing biofilm structure fig 5 both biofilms had a similar total organic carbon fig 3c however the phosphate limiting biofilm showed a substantially lower bacterial cell activity tcc and atp this result indicates that regardless of the biomass composition the biofilm structural properties play a significant role on the pressure drop increase and detachment from membranes and spacers 4 3 practical implications desalination plants usually dose phosphorus based antiscalants to control scale formation in the membrane modules increasing the phosphorus concentration in the feed water ali et al 2015 antiscalants easily avoid precipitation of soluble salts such as caco3 and caso4 however the removal of calcium phosphate is still questionable greenberg et al 2005 previous research demonstrated that increasing the concentration of phosphorus can lead to the formation of colloidal composites within a very short time of less than seconds promoting calcium phosphate scaling on the membrane dahdal et al 2016 pipich et al 2013 moreover it has been previously reported that some antiscalants can increase the assimilable organic content in the feed water and therefore increase the biofouling potential vrouwenvelder et al 2000 our study recommends a low cost optimization strategy for reverse osmosis desalination plants by lowering or avoiding the increase of the phosphorus concentration in the feed water by adding different chemicals antiscalants acids biocides to develop a biofilm with enhanced hydraulic cleanability the phosphates added to the antiscalants get concentrated in the brine and act as a nutrient for algae promoting eutrophication when brine is discharged into the sea generating environmental problems el din et al 1994 popov et al 2017 besides the environmental advantages of dosing phosphorus free antiscalants if phosphorus limitation is combined with carbon restriction after feed water pretreatment the approach could delay biofilm formation prolonging the system performance javier et al 2020 our recommendation to lower the phosphorus and carbon concentration in the feed water and periodic hydraulic cleaning anticipate a sustainable method to extend system performance while maintaining water production and therefore reducing the overall water cost 4 4 future research biofouling control strategies have focused mainly on eradicating biofilm development araújo et al 2012a kim and park 2016 this study proves that biofilm engineering e g manipulating the feed water nutrient composition would enable improved biofilm management strategies in that sense it will be possible to engineer control and manage biofilms that are easier to be cleaned by solubilization and removal this study evaluated the detachment of biofilm grown at two phosphorus concentrations after performing a hydraulic cleaning the characterization of the eps on the membrane and the biomass quantification of the outlet water when increasing the cross flow velocity could be used to determine the removal potential of biofilms grown at different nutrient conditions to changes in the cross flow pattern future research should focus on testing i different nutrient conditions and ii permeate conditions and their effect on biofilm detachment this data could be used to customize and design more effective cleaning protocols for better biofilm removal such as i the proper selection of hydraulic cleaning methods backflush forward flush bubbles gas liquid two phase flow cleaning ii the effect of hydraulic cleaning combined with chemical cleaning along with membrane and spacer modification for biofouling control araújo et al 2012b bucs et al 2017 and iii the optimization of operational parameters during cleaning procedures chen et al 2003 it has been shown that cleaning in place cip efficiency is lower for full scale ro than lab scale mfs jafari et al 2020 therefore further studies should also be performed in full scale installations by lowering the phosphorus concentration in the feed water to validate the efficiency of cleaning strategies 5 conclusions this study analyzed the effect of hydraulic cleaning by increasing the cross flow velocity from 0 18 m s 1 to 0 35 m s 1 for 1 h on biofilm grown at two phosphorus concentrations 3 μg p l 1 and 6 μg p l 1 with the same biodegradable organic carbon content feed channel pressure drop measurements and the characterization of the mfs cross flow outlet water and biomass on the membrane and spacer were used as an indicator to analyze system performance and hydraulic cleaning efficiency the membrane fouling simulators were hydraulically cleaned stopped and sampled for biofilm analysis tcc atp toc and eps characterization once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 53 mbar was reached 140 from its initial value the conclusions of this study can be summarized by i biofilms grown at 3 μg p l 1 have a higher hydraulic cleanability compared to biofilms grown a 6 μg p l 1 the higher detachment for biofilms grown at a lower phosphorus concentration is explained by fewer proteins and more soluble polymers in the eps translating in a lower biofilm cohesive and adhesive strength ii different biomass composition in terms of atp tcc and eps components can have the same detrimental effect on pressure drop increase explained by the biofilm s structural arrangement in the flow channel biofilm streamers iii the manipulation of nutrient composition in the feed water could develop biofilms that are easier to be removed by hydraulic cleaning methods iv the use of phosphorus based antiscalants increases the phosphorus concentration in the feed water thereby producing a biofilm with higher cohesive strength and subsequently reducing the biofilm hydraulic cleanability v the hydraulic cleaning technique proposed in this study could be used to analyze the detachment of biofilms grown at different nutrient composition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19972,rainwater harvesting systems in urban settings are increasingly relied upon to mitigate pluvial flooding on top of providing an additional water supply alternative designs have been proposed to support their dual use stormwater management performance is typically evaluated through long term averages however long term assessment is not aligned with the goal of attenuating the impacts of short duration high intensity rainfall events this paper contributes a framework for evaluating the dual use performance of design alternatives the framework incorporates a set of stormwater management metrics that provides a robust characterisation of performance during significant rainfall events to the usual long term volumetric retention metric we add 1 metrics that represent the total volume and duration above predevelopment greenfield runoff rates and 2 robust peak outflow rate and retention efficiencies based on the long term median of a representative sample of significant rainfall events our multi criteria performance visualisations of alternative dual use designs highlight the importance of carefully designing the forecast based controlled release mechanisms built into active systems this work has direct implications for design guidance standards which we discuss graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting tanks stormwater management water supply peak runoff

previous research on domestic rainwater harvesting rwh has centred primarily on the ability of systems to deliver a reliable water supply abdulla and al shareef 2009 helmreich and horn 2009 roebuck et al 2011 in recent years this focus has shifted to include stormwater management potential which is often quantified as retention the total captured volume over a given time interval burns et al 2015 campisano et al 2017 palla et al 2017 xu et al 2018 including stormwater management as a critical objective has led to a diversification of rwh system designs with examples displayed in fig 1 conventional rwh systems fig 1a are designed primarily to maximise water supply the british standards institution 2018 as such they may be full at the onset of significant events rendering them ineffective at reducing runoff alternative systems include an outlet to drain stored water which frees storage space in advance of rainfall events passive release systems fig 1b partition the tank into a water supply harvesting volume and a stormwater detention volume with a slow release discharge outlet controlled release occurs when the water level is above the passive outlet fig 1b and the rate is determined entirely by water level and the size of the orifice xu et al 2018 active systems fig 1c are remotely controlled to balance water supply and stormwater management functions they use rainfall forecasts to manage the release of water according to expected inflows and available retention volume in the tank xu et al 2018 even though water supply and stormwater management objectives are increasingly considered jointly for rwh design there has been minimal investigation into how these two traditionally conflicting water management objectives might trade off jensen et al 2010 concluded there were no trade offs in a study limited to conventional tanks where storage size was the only design variable with the emergence of more sophisticated designs involving additional passive or active release systems this conclusion needs to be revisited to assess the performance of alternative designs and understand the potential trade offs between them for this performance metrics that characterise the dual objective of rwh tanks in a more complete and nuanced way are essential while a wide range of metrics to quantify the stormwater management performance of rwh systems exist gerolin et al 2010 xu et al 2018 they typically provide long term averages for example xu et al 2018 evaluated both retention and water supply efficiency and frequency using an 11 year time series quantifying retention as the percentage of total roof runoff captured their findings indicated that active systems performed better with regards to baseflow restoration and stormwater retention with minimal adverse impact on water supply compared to the passive system these results however were limited to a single stormwater management metric retention evaluated for the total simulation period they did not consider performance during specific extreme storm events recent large scale modelling efforts such as the study of a sewer catchment in palermo by freni and liuzzo 2019 and the catchment response framework developed by jamali et al 2020 also characterise the stormwater management of rwh systems using metrics averaged on an annual or longer time scale similar to what is commonly done for water supply metrics several field studies focusing on the dual use of rwh systems exist e g debusk et al 2013 gee and hunt 2016 braga et al 2018 for rwh systems connected to high use commercial properties these studies included evaluations of conventional debusk et al 2013 passive gee and hunt 2016 and active release gee and hunt 2016 braga et al 2018 systems they quantified stormwater management performance based either on averaged per event responses e g average event overflow volume braga et al 2018 or overall volume reduction gee and hunt 2016 however these field studies found that the monitored retention provided by these systems varied dramatically between events depending on antecedent storage and rainfall patterns these results stress the importance of understanding the retention of these systems during events with a return period of a year or more these are the most likely to cause flooding and to damage river morphology and ecosystems woods ballard et al 2015 event based metrics are needed to capture the potential of rwh systems to bring about stormwater management benefits a similar approach has been applied to other green stormwater management infrastructure such as green roofs gerolin et al 2010 woods ballard et al 2015 stovin et al 2017 in extreme events the flood mitigation potential of a stormwater management device depends on its ability to control both the total volume released and the peak rate of flow woods ballard et al 2015 gee and hunt 2016 described the peak flow attenuation of both a passive and an active release rwh system during an observed event comparable to a 1 year 24 h design storm however gerolin et al 2010 highlighted the lack of robustness of this metric to antecedent storage conditions and the timing of peak rainfall intensity during a real world storm for example if the peak intensity occurs late in an event the tank may already be full and offer no peak reduction because of this event based metrics need to be based on a robust sample of storms rather than on a single extreme or design storm event both stovin et al 2017 and gerolin et al 2010 have argued that flow duration curves corresponding to the system response to long continuous rainfall time series provide a more detailed evaluation of the system s performance compared with single event detention metrics the absence of event based stormwater management performance metrics for rwh has implications for engineering design guidance and practice for instance in the uk design guidance on dual use rwh system design is provided by the sustainable drainage system suds manual woods ballard et al 2015 this guidance is based on a previous engineering guideline the british standard the british standards institution 2013 which recommended adding enough storage volume to capture a 1 100 year event to a system designed to provide water supply such guidelines could lead to oversized tanks but this conservative design approach may partly be due to the lack of performance metrics able to capture detention performance detention performance metrics need to refer to the system s ability to limit discharge to a predevelopment rate i e the flow rate before urbanisation to address this gap and its implications for engineering practice this paper develops a framework of metrics to adequately characterise the water supply and stormwater management performance of rwh systems the paper achieves this using both multi decadal time series of continuous rainfall inputs and a storm event based approach it defines multiple performance metrics for rwh systems and uses them to undertake a multi criteria visualisation of alternative designs we also disaggregate the stormwater management metrics we propose on an event by event basis to explore the relationship between individual events and long term performance in more depth 2 methodology 2 1 case study application the purpose of this case study is not to determine which rainwater harvesting rwh system design is best but to illustrate how nuanced stormwater management performance metrics may inform design decisions 2 1 1 system configurations we consider the four system configurations used in xu et al 2018 because they cover the main categories of rwh system available 1 conventional system 2 passive release system with 75 detention volume passive 1 3 passive release system with 25 detention volume passive 2 4 active system two different passive systems are chosen to examine a system where stormwater detention is prioritised 75 detention volume and one which favours water supply 25 detention volume to facilitate comparison between alternative designs tanks modelled in this study all have a capacity of 1000 l in line with the british standard the british standards institution 2018 recommendations for rwh systems that provide water supply the demand is assumed to be toilet flushing and clothes washing for an average british household of 2 4 people office for national statistics 2019 this results in daily usage of 120 l the british standards institution 2013 the roof area is 30 m2 the tanks are cylindrical with a diameter height ratio of 4 3 for stability 2 1 2 climatic data we illustrate this approach using climatic inputs which were taken from the uk climate projections as detailed in stovin et al 2017 ukcp09 http ukclimateprojections defra gov uk the data is a 30 year data set incorporating climate change projections that has been disaggregated into 5 min time steps using stormpac wrc 2009 this time series is representative of a plausible mid term future climate 2050 in sheffield uk temporal resolution is an essential consideration for the quantification of peak outflow rates although an hourly timestep is appropriate for retention studies it does not permit the modelling and interpretation of the detention performance of stormwater management devices stovin et al 2017 in this case utilising a dataset with a 5 min time step enables us to quantify both the retention and detention performance of these systems 2 2 modelling framework 2 2 1 conventional system model a model was constructed to continuously simulate the behaviour of three types of household scale rwh system fig 1 we model each system using a yield after spillage yas approach which is the most conservative method of simulating rwh system behaviour fewkes and butler 2000 the model converts rainfall to stormwater runoff tank inflow based on a roof area of 30 m2 assuming an initial loss of 0 2 mm with a 2 h antecedent period and an additional 0 2 mm day xu et al 2018 for conventional systems 1 q δ t v t 1 i δ t s 2 y δ t m i n d δ t v t 1 3 v t m i n v t 1 i δ t y δ t s y δ t where qδt is the tank outflow iδt is tank inflow dδt is the demand yδt is the yield during the timestep δt vt is the volume in store at time t and s is the tank storage capacity 2 2 2 passive system model for the passive systems controlled release occurs before yield resulting in a modified outflow qδt equation 4 q δ t m a x 0 v t 1 i δ t c δ t s where cδt is the controlled release during the timestep δt which is calculated using the orifice equation 5 c δ t cd 1 4 π d 2 2 gh t where d is the equivalent outlet diameter ht is the head m acting over the centreline of the orifice at time t cd is the orifice discharge coefficient cd 0 7 was adopted and g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s2 the passive release outlet is sized to deliver a maximum outflow of predevelopment runoff for a 1 in 30 year storm event equivalent to 5 l s ha which results in a diameter of 0 0024 m passive 1 and 0 0032 m passive 2 we acknowledge that practical issues would prohibit such small diameters and other forms of restriction would be necessary to achieve the low flow rate required for example a pressure independent dripper could be used to achieve the required flow rate xu et al 2018 this rate was calculated for the sheffield area using hr wallingford s greenfield runoff rate estimation calculator for this research a 1 in 30 year storm was specified kellagher 2013 yield is calculated using eq 2 and volume in the tank is calculated using equation 6 6 v t m i n v t 1 i δ t y δ t c δ t s y δ t c δ t 2 2 3 active system model for the active system outflow controlled release yield and volume in the tank are calculated identically to the passive system there are many potential algorithms for determining emptying timing for the active system the method used by xu et al 2018 is implemented here the controlled pre storm release volume is the predicted overflow volume which is determined by the difference between the available tank storage volume at the end of the previous day and predicted runoff volume for the following 24 h period it is delivered through a 10 mm automated valve driven by gravity xu et al 2018 the model assumes a perfect rainfall forecast the performance of active systems can be significantly affected by rainfall forecasting error the main source of uncertainty is errors in rainfall intensity which result in either over or under estimation of volume to be emptied xu et al 2020 to simulate this potential inaccuracy additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken in which a systematic bias of 10 was applied to the emptying volume for every event 2 3 performance metrics as highlighted above the stormwater management performance metrics adopted in previous studies often fail to capture all the information that may be relevant to the evaluation of these devices many have focused on long term retention rather than the event based retention and peak runoff statistics that are most relevant for flood risk mitigation hence we propose the following metrics to evaluate and compare each system s overall performance comprehensively the seven metrics chosen and their equations are presented in table 1 2 3 1 water supply two metrics have emerged as methods for determining the water supply performance of rwh systems water supply efficiency and water supply frequency xu et al 2018 water supply efficiency ews is a measure of the extent to which yield from the system meets volumetric demand water supply frequency is a measure of the proportion of time when demand is met volumetric and time based reliability are also common terms used to refer to water supply efficiency and frequency respectively mitchell et al 2008 when there is a regular water demand such as toilet flushing and clothes washing usage both metrics are almost identical 0 1 difference xu et al 2018 therefore to limit the number of metrics considered in this paper we adopt the metric water supply efficiency ews if demand is highly variable in time e g due to seasonal irrigation drainage designers should also examine water supply frequency it is acknowledged that the water supply will vary seasonally for example more water will be available in winter as rainfall is greatest then however as the water available from these systems is supplementary to a constant piped supply the overall ews enables an adequate comparison between the performance of different systems 2 3 2 stormwater management in terms of stormwater management the most popular performance metric is overall retention efficiency er this metric quantifies water that is prevented from entering the drainage network this metric combines controlled releases acceptable and uncontrolled spills potentially problematic an alternative is to quantify outflow control using the predevelopment runoff rate calculated as the peak rate of runoff due to rainfall falling on a given area of vegetated land in the uk this is defined as greenfield runoff and computed using a specific formula kellagher 2013 we propose the metric inflow control efficiency ecq which is defined as the proportion of inflow controlled to predevelopment runoff rate to quantify this behaviour the annual time above predevelopment runoff tcq in hours per year is also an important characteristic the ability of these systems to control outflow rates must also be measured on a storm event basis previous quantifications of stormwater detention by rwh systems have been limited to peak flow attenuation for specific events which as discussed in the introduction is not a robust metric instead we propose basing this metric on a sample of relevant events specifically the set of significant events in what follows the sample size of this set was selected based on the return period of interest and on time series length here we selected the 30 most significant events over a 30 year time series to have an empirical sample of events that are indicative of the 1 1 year event events with an annual return period are of interest to drainage engineers as they can cause morphological damage to the catchment woods ballard et al 2015 although suds can reduce the frequency and or severity of flooding their impact on large events may be minimal as such we chose not to develop specific metrics for events with return periods higher than one year what defines a significant event depends both on catchment characteristics and on drainage guidance and regulations we considered events with the largest 1 h 6 h and 24 h rainfall depth as alternative definitions for our significant events the characteristics of these events are contained in the supplementary data for each of these 30 significant events we determined the peak 5 min outflow rate and determined the median peak outflow sq50 to address the requirement to quantify volumetric control during these extreme events the retention and proportion of inflow controlled to predevelopment runoff rate create two further metrics median retention efficiency ser50 and median inflow control efficiency secq50 2 4 multi criteria visualisation our multi criteria visualisations aim to examine the potential trade offs between the metrics that reflect different aspects of rwh systems use for water supply and stormwater management for this we need to compute and represent all the metrics identified in section 2 3 for each of the four rwh systems we use two visualisation techniques to convey this information a parallel plot and a radar plot both are fit for representing multiple metrics concurrently by attributing one axis to each metric and having axes represented either in a parallel way parallel plot or radially radar plot in general all axes in a plot use a common convention to rank alternatives from worst performing to best performing for instance performance will increase from bottom to top in our parallel plot and from the outside towards the centre in our radar plot in this work we demonstrate both visualisations with slightly different specifications but it is important to remember that both can be used interchangeably in practice with parallel plots being particularly suited for cases where there is a large number of alternatives e g woodruff et al 2013 when a design alternative a is equal to or better than b with respect to all metrics there is no tradeoff to consider and we say that a dominates b in the pareto sense otherwise the visualizations provide drainage engineers and stakeholders alike with a transparent and at a glance way to determine trade offs between alternatives e g kasprzyk et al 2016 a possible next step once equipped with these metrics is to aggregate them through weighted sum as part of a multiattribute decision making process clemen and reilly 2013 however this work aims at providing a template for extracting and visualising the information for dual use rwh design decisions rather than prescribing how these metrics should be used to reach a design decision besides there exist well documented severe challenges to aggregating metrics in an unbiased way brill et al 1990 franssen 2005 woodruff et al 2013 especially in the type of multi alternative multi stakeholder context that corresponds to choosing and implementing rwh systems in a flood or drought prone community 2 5 sensitivity analysis the demand fraction is a dimensionless ratio given by annual demand divided by annual runoff fewkes and butler 2000 for the case presented in section 2 1 the mean annual runoff for the 30 year time series was 683 1 mm such that the modelled demand fraction was 2 14 a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of different demands on the performance metrics discussed in section 2 3 here we maintain a constant roof area and rainfall and vary the household water demand to generate a range of demand fractions from 0 to 5 0 a similar approach was used to examine the sensitivity of performance to storage volume here the dimensionless ratio storage fraction given by the storage volume divided by annual runoff fewkes and butler 2000 was varied between 0 and 0 20 to simulate a range of tank sizes between 0 and 4 1 m3 2 6 long term and significant event based stormwater management performance 2 6 1 flow duration curve as the peak outflow is determined on a 5 min basis it can be very sensitive to local fluctuations in the rainfall rate therefore we complement our analysis with a graphical approach in the form of the flow duration curve stovin et al 2017 a flow duration curve is a plot of runoff vs the proportion of time that a runoff is equalled or exceeded it is calculated by determining the exceedance probability of each of the tank outflow rates fig 2 shows an example of a flow duration curve for the long term 30 year roof runoff the largest roof runoff observed during the 30 year time series is 185 l s ha which is equivalent to 67 2 mm h a flow duration curve is typically used to show performance over the total simulation period or individual events it displays a range of information useful to drainage engineers and facilitates comparisons between different systems 2 6 2 significant event based performance in addition to the median significant event performance metrics consideration of the distribution of performance outcomes across the full set of 30 significant events may lead to additional insights in this section we examine the peak outflow er and ecq for the largest 30 events with a 1 year return period as determined in section 2 3 3 results 3 1 performance metrics and multi criteria visualisations table 2 shows the water balance per m2 of roof area and the performance metrics for each system the initial losses from the roof are 19 of the rainfall in line with mentens et al 2006 who reported 19 retention of rainfall by non greened roofs in brussels the water demand is over double the volume of roof runoff which indicates that regardless of the rainwater harvesting rwh system size the maximum water supply efficiency ews is limited to 0 46 this value is only marginally larger than the best performing systems active and conventional at 0 42 outflow and outflow above predevelopment runoff are almost identical for both the active and conventional systems for both passive systems the outflow above predevelopment runoff rate is significantly lower than total outflow illustrating their capacity to limit the high outflow rates associated with uncontrolled spills the passive 2 25 detention volume system seems to perform better of the two as it has less outflow but comparable outflow above predevelopment runoff rate to the passive 1 75 detention volume system in terms of the significant events for each of the metrics the order of performance from best to worst remains constant regardless of the time period over which the largest rainfall depth was calculated the passive systems are better at reducing peak flow and limiting flow to the predevelopment rate whereas the active and conventional system have larger retention values for all performance metrics all systems perform best during the events with the worst 1 h volume as these generally have lower durations and total volumes the suds manual woods ballard et al 2015 identifies events with the largest volume during a 6 h period as of critical importance the metrics for these events will be presented throughout the rest of this paper with the metrics for the 1 h and 24 h largest volume events available in the supplementary data the systematic bias applied to the emptying volume resulted in a negligible impact on the performance metrics with less than a 3 difference between the cases for all metrics this is due to the size of the storage volume as the large events usually necessitate large emptying volumes a 10 variation will not make a significant difference in addition as emptying is required infrequently the impact on the average water supply and retention efficiencies is minimal fig 3 presents a parallel plot and a radar plot intended to convey the conflicting rainwater harvesting objectives of water supply and stormwater management the parallel plot fig 3a shows all values with an axis normalised and constrained to the best and worst performance from both plots no system exhibits pareto dominance over the others if the objectives are ews and retention efficiency er both conventional and active systems are best if the inflow control efficiency ecq and median peak outflow sq50 are of concern the passive 1 system reduces the largest quantity of flow to below predevelopment runoff what is more all variables lead to a different ranking of alternatives this illustrates the metrics we propose provide complementary insights into system performance the radar plot fig 3b shows similar information to the parallel plot but using absolute values for the outflows yield and tcq the priorities of the drainage designer will vary so it is impossible to recommend one system type universally the passive 1 system s control of outflow rates is again highlighted both overall and during extreme events 3 2 the impact of the demand fraction on system performance a sensitivity analysis is used to examine the impact of demand variation on performance conventionally used metrics such as ews fig 4 a and er fig 4b are the most sensitive to demand for all systems for the ecq fig 4c both active and conventional systems vary more with demand than the passive systems for the sq50 fig 4e the peak flow decreases consistently with demand for the conventional and passive 2 systems for the passive 1 and active systems there is a large decrease in peak outflow at a demand fraction of approximately 1 5 the outflow rate remains almost constant after this for all demand fractions examined the passive 1 system has the lowest sq50 for both the ser50 and the ecq the active and passive 1 systems perform relatively consistently across the demands in contrast the performance of both the conventional and passive 2 systems increase steadily with increasing demand the comparative performance of the different systems is relatively insensitive to demand fraction with the passive 1 system performing consistently well for all runoff rate metrics in the range 0 0 demand fraction 5 0 the sensitivity analysis for the storage fraction is presented in the supplementary data for all systems and metrics the performance improved as the storage increased the difference in performance between systems also decreased with increasing storage volume 3 3 long term and significant event based stormwater management performance 3 3 1 flow duration curve the sq50 discussed in the multi criteria visualisation indicates stormwater detention performance yet it is still a single metric a more comprehensive evaluation of stormwater detention performance is the flow duration curve which allows a comparison to be made across all systems and storm events fig 5 fig 5 shows that roof runoff occurs for 4 of the simulation time similarly without any intervention the roof runoff would exceed predevelopment runoff rates approximately 0 8 of the simulation time higher runoff rates are exceeded for less time from the flow duration curve the active system has the lowest time above zero discharge however the emptying of these systems causes a controlled outflow greater than roof runoff for 0 01 of the simulation time it is crucial that the timing of this emptying occurs independently of storm events to ensure that the burden on drainage systems is not increased the passive 1 system has the lowest tcq only exceeding this threshold for 0 015 of the time however the passive 1 system also has the highest proportion of time above zero discharge longer even than the roof runoff the passive systems perform best at peak runoff reduction active and conventional systems perform comparably it is clear from this demonstration that the flow duration curve successfully complements other metrics in describing the year round behaviour of these systems 3 3 2 significant event based performance fig 6 shows the complete set of peak outflows er and the ecq for the 30 most significant storm events in the 30 year time series one thing that is very clear from these plots is the significant spread of individual event metrics around the median values reported in table 2 the degree of scattering reflects the influence that antecedent conditions and individual storm event characteristics have on performance during a specific event by definition median metrics do not represent the true variability of expected performance for example fig 6b highlights the fact that while the ser50 for the conventional system is 0 59 its performance in individual significant events could be anything between 0 25 and 1 0 peak outflow is shown in fig 6a as active systems can have large controlled releases as discussed in section 3 3 1 dedicated circles have been added on fig 6a to indicate occasions which are due to spill and which are due to active release the figure shows that for smaller events the passive 1 system has the lowest peak outflow however similarly to the er fig 6b as the events become larger there is little distinction between the performance of the different systems for er fig 6b shows that although all systems exhibit high er 0 5 for the majority of events there are a small minority which have er closer to zero this variability again is due to antecedent conditions for smaller events significant disparities can be observed between the performances of the different systems though there are smaller variations in performance between the system types for inflow events above 65 mm the dashed line indicates the er associated with the maximum capacity of the tank when empty assuming no losses i e no water supply during the event many points for both the conventional and active systems are on or above this line as the household water demand during the event results in extra capacity for storage for the ecq fig 6c shows that in all events the passive 1 system has the best performance again the dashed line represents the maximum capacity of the tank with no losses most of the system performances fall above this line illustrating the ability of these systems to control outflow rates especially the passive 1 system it is above this line for all events 4 discussion this paper set out to provide a set of metrics which capture both the water supply and stormwater management performance of rwh systems some of these metrics water supply efficiency ews and retention efficiency er have been well established by previous literature the existing metrics ews and er do not provide an adequate representation of the stormwater management potential of these systems for example in the illustrative case study presented in section 3 1 the conventional system has both the highest er and ews however it does not provide any additional control beyond its retention capacity as indicated by the minimal difference between the er and inflow control efficiency ecq metrics to quantify the release control capacity of these systems we examine their ability to reduce inflow to the predevelopment runoff rate via the metrics ecq and annual time above predevelopment runoff tcq the selection of stormwater management performance metrics reflects the two most common needs of receiving drainage systems either complete retention or flow control in cases where downpipe disconnection has occurred and the flow is either directed into waterways or sustainable drainage systems metrics related to predevelopment runoff would be preferred as the high flow rate due to the active release may cause morphological damage conversely where the rwh systems are connected to a combined sewer system the focus would be maximising retention during extreme events and an active system which empties reliably in advance of events would be preferable each of the above metrics is presented as a long term average over the 30 year time series it should be noted that this may hide seasonal variability for e ws as lower values are expected during summer months in the uk where rwh systems typically operate as an addition to mains water supply an average quantification is an adequate method of determining water supply capability although average values are appropriate for water supply assessment this is not the case for stormwater management as performance during extreme events is of critical importance to the application of these systems as sustainable drainage devices for example the conventional system has an overall e r of 0 91 which is significantly higher than the median retention efficiency ser50 of our sample of significant events 0 59 using the overall er metric alone may lead to an overestimation of stormwater management performance during extreme events this finding led to our identification of three further metrics based on our sample of 30 significant events median peak outflow sq50 ser50 and median inflow control efficiency secq 50 these metrics show that the passive 1 system has the lowest ser50 0 48 recall that passive 1 has a 25 percent retention capacity and 75 detention volume whereas passive 2 has 75 retention capacity and 25 detention volume and if in this instance performance during large events was of concern to drainage designers an active system ser50 of 0 65 would be optimal such an assessment would not have been possible without the inclusion of these metrics we found that although the peak outflow provides a useful metric for assessment of the detention capability of different rwh systems it is very sensitive to antecedent conditions and the shape of individual storms therefore the flow duration curve is proposed as a method to characterise the ability of these systems to limit stormwater runoff rate there are many ways that this graph can be read including the runoff rates that are exceeded for particular return periods e g 99 99th 99 9th percentile or the duration of time for which a specified runoff rate e g zero or predevelopment runoff is surpassed probabilistic approaches are used to set regulatory requirements for river water quality with set 90 and 99th percentile thresholds for biological oxygen demand levels the foundation for water research 2019 however for stormwater runoff these thresholds would be lower due to the intermittent nature of rainfall the decision as to what the key thresholds should be is expected to be dependent on the receiving catchment s hydrological response one possible option we explored is the tcq this value is of concern to drainage engineers as current guidance places a heavy emphasis on limiting runoff above this value woods ballard et al 2015 in addition to determining exceedance threshold values the flow duration curve can be used to identify the impact of different active emptying algorithms on runoff rates in this study high rates of outflow from the active system which exceed roof runoff are observed for 0 01 of the simulation time this proportion of time only equates to 1 h per year for this system but could potentially be longer for smaller tanks which would empty more often the purpose of the case study is not to determine the best system but to illustrate the ability of the proposed framework to capture all nuances of dual function rwh system behaviour our multi criteria visualisation highlights the importance of the procedure used to determine the emptying of the active system in this case every 24 h as needed it can empty during rainfall events causing an increase in peak outflow and a decrease in retention note that this algorithm proposed in xu et al 2018 assumes perfect day ahead rainfall forecasts real world active systems are even more challenging to implement using imperfect forecasts this can result in either a tank that is too full resulting in spills or too empty resulting in subsequent supply shortage before a storm although the systematic bias applied to the active system s emptying volume did not significantly alter results further strategies to improve the capacity of the active system to mitigate flood risks and control flow rate could be employed such as reducing the active release flowrate and utilising 7 day rainfall forecasts xu et al 2020 or adopting a minimum emptying time of 48 h before a storm woods ballard et al 2015 such strategies are also impacted by issues of forecast accuracy both the timing of these events and the availability of adequate forecasts are crucial as one full active emptying of the tank would result in the equivalent of a 33 mm rainfall event over the space of 110 min the methods presented in this paper could be used to examine the performance of different emptying strategies currently except for the analysis presented in fig 6 we draw no distinction between outflow attributed to spill or controlled release passive or active whereas xu et al 2018 calculated retention efficiency based on spill alone this approach results in higher values of er for the passive 1 passive 2 and active systems than observed in our study the impact that controlled releases from active and passive systems might have on the performance of the receiving drainage systems is unclear so by separately identifying spill and controlled release a fully informed assessment can be made there is potential for discharging the controlled release to sustainable drainage systems such as a swale or rain garden as was done for the active system examined by gee and hunt 2016 in many locations this type of approach may not be possible due to space limitations or underlying soil conditions or due to high flow rates caused by the active release which may damage the morphology of the receiving water body a sensitivity analysis concerning household water demand is essential as it is often assumed that householders will exclusively use rainwater for their non potable water needs when available however quinn et al 2020 showed that householders with a downstairs toilet connected to a conventional rainwater harvesting system did not use the water available to them as often as would be expected by the british standards institution 2013 in the case of the passive 1 and passive 2 systems the ecq is still high for low demands however this is not the case for active and conventional systems it is recommended that careful consideration is taken of demand during the design phase to ensure that it is accurate and its variations considered when determining stormwater management impact the metrics long term performance assessment and sensitivity analysis presented in this paper are intended for use by drainage designers current rwh stormwater management guidance for the uk considers storage volume as the only design variable with no alternatives to conventional rwh systems designed exclusively for water supply this approach leads to disproportionately large systems e g 3 m3 for 30 m2 roof space which makes rwh an unattractive option owing to space concerns this paper has illustrated the effectiveness of a 1 m3 system at providing both water supply and stormwater management although no one system exhibited pareto dominance drainage engineers can utilize the multi criteria visualisation to make informed drainage decisions that will reflect the preferences of home owners and local communities 5 conclusions the potential for rainwater harvesting systems to provide both water supply and stormwater management is increasingly recognised fostering interest in real world applications and prompting a search for alternative designs this paper supports these efforts by proposing the first set of metrics to fully quantify the stormwater management performance of rwh systems classic retention metrics have two key drawbacks firstly they tend to focus on long term volumetric performance rather than performance within specific extreme events and secondly in treating uncontrolled spill and controlled outflow in the same way we propose two metrics that measure a system s capacity to control outflow below a threshold e g runoff before urban development by quantifying annual average volumes and times above this threshold we also propose three robust metrics representing system response to severe rainfall events by extracting a set of such events from a long term time series and taking the median across events of peak flow retention efficiency and outflow control efficiency we combine these six metrics with a widely used measure of water supply efficiency to obtain a set of seven metrics five of which are novel for rwh systems comparison of four alternative rwh system designs with these seven metrics computed over a 5 min resolution thirty year time series demonstrate that they provide complementary insights into overall design performance indeed we use multi criteria visualisation as a transparent and at a glance way to show that all metrics evaluate and rank alternatives differently from the others we have also highlighted the value of a flow duration curve for capturing the system s cumulative long term performance we suggest that a threshold such as time above predevelopment rate could be further developed as a regulatory requirement this framework provides drainage designers with an easily applicable method for determining the benefits of individual rainwater harvesting systems to their catchment

19972,rainwater harvesting systems in urban settings are increasingly relied upon to mitigate pluvial flooding on top of providing an additional water supply alternative designs have been proposed to support their dual use stormwater management performance is typically evaluated through long term averages however long term assessment is not aligned with the goal of attenuating the impacts of short duration high intensity rainfall events this paper contributes a framework for evaluating the dual use performance of design alternatives the framework incorporates a set of stormwater management metrics that provides a robust characterisation of performance during significant rainfall events to the usual long term volumetric retention metric we add 1 metrics that represent the total volume and duration above predevelopment greenfield runoff rates and 2 robust peak outflow rate and retention efficiencies based on the long term median of a representative sample of significant rainfall events our multi criteria performance visualisations of alternative dual use designs highlight the importance of carefully designing the forecast based controlled release mechanisms built into active

previous research on domestic rainwater harvesting rwh has centred primarily on the ability of systems to deliver a reliable water supply abdulla and al shareef 2009 helmreich and horn 2009 roebuck et al 2011 in recent years this focus has shifted to include stormwater management potential which is often quantified as retention the total captured volume over a given time interval burns et al 2015 campisano et al 2017 palla et al 2017 xu et al 2018 including stormwater management as a critical objective has led to a diversification of rwh system designs with examples displayed in fig 1 conventional rwh systems fig 1a are designed primarily to maximise water supply the british standards institution 2018 as such they may be full at the onset of significant events rendering them ineffective at reducing runoff alternative systems include an outlet to drain stored water which frees storage space in advance of rainfall events passive release systems fig 1b partition the tank into a water supply harvesting volume and a stormwater detention volume with a slow release discharge outlet controlled release occurs when the water level is above the passive outlet fig 1b and the rate is determined entirely by water level and the size of the orifice xu et al 2018 active systems fig 1c are remotely controlled to balance water supply and stormwater management functions they use rainfall forecasts to manage the release of water according to expected inflows and available retention volume in the tank xu et al 2018 even though water supply and stormwater management objectives are increasingly considered jointly for rwh design there has been minimal investigation into how these two traditionally conflicting water management objectives might trade off jensen et al 2010 concluded there were no trade offs in a study limited to conventional tanks where storage size was the only design variable with the emergence of more sophisticated designs involving additional passive or active release systems this conclusion needs to be revisited to assess the performance of alternative designs and understand the potential trade offs between them for this performance metrics that characterise the dual objective of rwh tanks in a more complete and nuanced way are essential while a wide range of metrics to quantify the stormwater management performance of rwh systems exist gerolin et al 2010 xu et al 2018 they typically provide long term averages for example xu et al 2018 evaluated both retention and water supply efficiency and frequency using an 11 year time series quantifying retention as the percentage of total roof runoff captured their findings indicated that active systems performed better with regards to baseflow restoration and stormwater retention with minimal adverse impact on water supply compared to the passive system these results however were limited to a single stormwater management metric retention evaluated for the total simulation period they did not consider performance during specific extreme storm events recent large scale modelling efforts such as the study of a sewer catchment in palermo by freni and liuzzo 2019 and the catchment response framework developed by jamali et al 2020 also characterise the stormwater management of rwh systems using metrics averaged on an annual or longer time scale similar to what is commonly done for water supply metrics several field studies focusing on the dual use of rwh systems exist e g debusk et al 2013 gee and hunt 2016 braga et al 2018 for rwh systems connected to high use commercial properties these studies included evaluations of conventional debusk et al 2013 passive gee and hunt 2016 and active release gee and hunt 2016 braga et al 2018 systems they quantified stormwater management performance based either on averaged per event responses e g average event overflow volume braga et al 2018 or overall volume reduction gee and hunt 2016 however these field studies found that the monitored retention provided by these systems varied dramatically between events depending on antecedent storage and rainfall patterns these results stress the importance of understanding the retention of these systems during events with a return period of a year or more these are the most likely to cause flooding and to damage river morphology and ecosystems woods ballard et al 2015 event based metrics are needed to capture the potential of rwh systems to bring about stormwater management benefits a similar approach has been applied to other green stormwater management infrastructure such as green roofs gerolin et al 2010 woods ballard et al 2015 stovin et al 2017 in extreme events the flood mitigation potential of a stormwater management device depends on its ability to control both the total volume released and the peak rate of flow woods ballard et al 2015 gee and hunt 2016 described the peak flow attenuation of both a passive and an active release rwh system during an observed event comparable to a 1 year 24 h design storm however gerolin et al 2010 highlighted the lack of robustness of this metric to antecedent storage conditions and the timing of peak rainfall intensity during a real world storm for example if the peak intensity occurs late in an event the tank may already be full and offer no peak reduction because of this event based metrics need to be based on a robust sample of storms rather than on a single extreme or design storm event both stovin et al 2017 and gerolin et al 2010 have argued that flow duration curves corresponding to the system response to long continuous rainfall time series provide a more detailed evaluation of the system s performance compared with single event detention metrics the absence of event based stormwater management performance metrics for rwh has implications for engineering design guidance and practice for instance in the uk design guidance on dual use rwh system design is provided by the sustainable drainage system suds manual woods ballard et al 2015 this guidance is based on a previous engineering guideline the british standard the british standards institution 2013 which recommended adding enough storage volume to capture a 1 100 year event to a system designed to provide water supply such guidelines could lead to oversized tanks but this conservative design approach may partly be due to the lack of performance metrics able to capture detention performance detention performance metrics need to refer to the system s ability to limit discharge to a predevelopment rate i e the flow rate before urbanisation to address this gap and its implications for engineering practice this paper develops a framework of metrics to adequately characterise the water supply and stormwater management performance of rwh systems the paper achieves this using both multi decadal time series of continuous rainfall inputs and a storm event based approach it defines multiple performance metrics for rwh systems and uses them to undertake a multi criteria visualisation of alternative designs we also disaggregate the stormwater management metrics we propose on an event by event basis to explore the relationship between individual events and long term performance in more depth 2 methodology 2 1 case study application the purpose of this case study is not to determine which rainwater harvesting rwh system design is best but to illustrate how nuanced stormwater management performance metrics may inform design decisions 2 1 1 system configurations we consider the four system configurations used in xu et al 2018 because they cover the main categories of rwh system available 1 conventional system 2 passive release system with 75 detention volume passive 1 3 passive release system with 25 detention volume passive 2 4 active system two different passive systems are chosen to examine a system where stormwater detention is prioritised 75 detention volume and one which favours water supply 25 detention volume to facilitate comparison between alternative designs tanks modelled in this study all have a capacity of 1000 l in line with the british standard the british standards institution 2018 recommendations for rwh systems that provide water supply the demand is assumed to be toilet flushing and clothes washing for an average british household of 2 4 people office for national statistics 2019 this results in daily usage of 120 l the british standards institution 2013 the roof area is 30 m2 the tanks are cylindrical with a diameter height ratio of 4 3 for stability 2 1 2 climatic data we illustrate this approach using climatic inputs which were taken from the uk climate projections as detailed in stovin et al 2017 ukcp09 http ukclimateprojections defra gov uk the data is a 30 year data set incorporating climate change projections that has been disaggregated into 5 min time steps using stormpac wrc 2009 this time series is representative of a plausible mid term future climate 2050 in sheffield uk temporal resolution is an essential consideration for the quantification of peak outflow rates although an hourly timestep is appropriate for retention studies it does not permit the modelling and interpretation of the detention performance of stormwater management devices stovin et al 2017 in this case utilising a dataset with a 5 min time step enables us to quantify both the retention and detention performance of these systems 2 2 modelling framework 2 2 1 conventional system model a model was constructed to continuously simulate the behaviour of three types of household scale rwh system fig 1 we model each system using a yield after spillage yas approach which is the most conservative method of simulating rwh system behaviour fewkes and butler 2000 the model converts rainfall to stormwater runoff tank inflow based on a roof area of 30 m2 assuming an initial loss of 0 2 mm with a 2 h antecedent period and an additional 0 2 mm day xu et al 2018 for conventional systems 1 q δ t v t 1 i δ t s 2 y δ t m i n d δ t v t 1 3 v t m i n v t 1 i δ t y δ t s y δ t where qδt is the tank outflow iδt is tank inflow dδt is the demand yδt is the yield during the timestep δt vt is the volume in store at time t and s is the tank storage capacity 2 2 2 passive system model for the passive systems controlled release occurs before yield resulting in a modified outflow qδt equation 4 q δ t m a x 0 v t 1 i δ t c δ t s where cδt is the controlled release during the timestep δt which is calculated using the orifice equation 5 c δ t cd 1 4 π d 2 2 gh t where d is the equivalent outlet diameter ht is the head m acting over the centreline of the orifice at time t cd is the orifice discharge coefficient cd 0 7 was adopted and g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s2 the passive release outlet is sized to deliver a maximum outflow of predevelopment runoff for a 1 in 30 year storm event equivalent to 5 l s ha which results in a diameter of 0 0024 m passive 1 and 0 0032 m passive 2 we acknowledge that practical issues would prohibit such small diameters and other forms of restriction would be necessary to achieve the low flow rate required for example a pressure independent dripper could be used to achieve the required flow rate xu et al 2018 this rate was calculated for the sheffield area using hr wallingford s greenfield runoff rate estimation calculator for this research a 1 in 30 year storm was specified kellagher 2013 yield is calculated using eq 2 and volume in the tank is calculated using equation 6 6 v t m i n v t 1 i δ t y δ t c δ t s y δ t c δ t 2 2 3 active system model for the active system outflow controlled release yield and volume in the tank are calculated identically to the passive system there are many potential algorithms for determining emptying timing for the active system the method used by xu et al 2018 is implemented here the controlled pre storm release volume is the predicted overflow volume which is determined by the difference between the available tank storage volume at the end of the previous day and predicted runoff volume for the following 24 h period it is delivered through a 10 mm automated valve driven by gravity xu et al 2018 the model assumes a perfect rainfall forecast the performance of active systems can be significantly affected by rainfall forecasting error the main source of uncertainty is errors in rainfall intensity which result in either over or under estimation of volume to be emptied xu et al 2020 to simulate this potential inaccuracy additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken in which a systematic bias of 10 was applied to the emptying volume for every event 2 3 performance metrics as highlighted above the stormwater management performance metrics adopted in previous studies often fail to capture all the information that may be relevant to the evaluation of these devices many have focused on long term retention rather than the event based retention and peak runoff statistics that are most relevant for flood risk mitigation hence we propose the following metrics to evaluate and compare each system s overall performance comprehensively the seven metrics chosen and their equations are presented in table 1 2 3 1 water supply two metrics have emerged as methods for determining the water supply performance of rwh systems water supply efficiency and water supply frequency xu et al 2018 water supply efficiency ews is a measure of the extent to which yield from the system meets volumetric demand water supply frequency is a measure of the proportion of time when demand is met volumetric and time based reliability are also common terms used to refer to water supply efficiency and frequency respectively mitchell et al 2008 when there is a regular water demand such as toilet flushing and clothes washing usage both metrics are almost identical 0 1 difference xu et al 2018 therefore to limit the number of metrics considered in this paper we adopt the metric water supply efficiency ews if demand is highly variable in time e g due to seasonal irrigation drainage designers should also examine water supply frequency it is acknowledged that the water supply will vary seasonally for example more water will be available in winter as rainfall is greatest then however as the water available from these systems is supplementary to a constant piped supply the overall ews enables an adequate comparison between the performance of different systems 2 3 2 stormwater management in terms of stormwater management the most popular performance metric is overall retention efficiency er this metric quantifies water that is prevented from entering the drainage network this metric combines controlled releases acceptable and uncontrolled spills potentially problematic an alternative is to quantify outflow control using the predevelopment runoff rate calculated as the peak rate of runoff due to rainfall falling on a given area of vegetated land in the uk this is defined as greenfield runoff and computed using a specific formula kellagher 2013 we propose the metric inflow control efficiency ecq which is defined as the proportion of inflow controlled to predevelopment runoff rate to quantify this behaviour the annual time above predevelopment runoff tcq in hours per year is also an important characteristic the ability of these systems to control outflow rates must also be measured on a storm event basis previous quantifications of stormwater detention by rwh systems have been limited to peak flow attenuation for specific events which as discussed in the introduction is not a robust metric instead we propose basing this metric on a sample of relevant events specifically the set of significant events in what follows the sample size of this set was selected based on the return period of interest and on time series length here we selected the 30 most significant events over a 30 year time series to have an empirical sample of events that are indicative of the 1 1 year event events with an annual return period are of interest to drainage engineers as they can cause morphological damage to the catchment woods ballard et al 2015 although suds can reduce the frequency and or severity of flooding their impact on large events may be minimal as such we chose not to develop specific metrics for events with return periods higher than one year what defines a significant event depends both on catchment characteristics and on drainage guidance and regulations we considered events with the largest 1 h 6 h and 24 h rainfall depth as alternative definitions for our significant events the characteristics of these events are contained in the supplementary data for each of these 30 significant events we determined the peak 5 min outflow rate and determined the median peak outflow sq50 to address the requirement to quantify volumetric control during these extreme events the retention and proportion of inflow controlled to predevelopment runoff rate create two further metrics median retention efficiency ser50 and median inflow control efficiency secq50 2 4 multi criteria visualisation our multi criteria visualisations aim to examine the potential trade offs between the metrics that reflect different aspects of rwh systems use for water supply and stormwater management for this we need to compute and represent all the metrics identified in section 2 3 for each of the four rwh systems we use two visualisation techniques to convey this information a parallel plot and a radar plot both are fit for representing multiple metrics concurrently by attributing one axis to each metric and having axes represented either in a parallel way parallel plot or radially radar plot in general all axes in a plot use a common convention to rank alternatives from worst performing to best performing for instance performance will increase from bottom to top in our parallel plot and from the outside towards the centre in our radar plot in this work we demonstrate both visualisations with slightly different specifications but it is important to remember that both can be used interchangeably in practice with parallel plots being particularly suited for cases where there is a large number of alternatives e g woodruff et al 2013 when a design alternative a is equal to or better than b with respect to all metrics there is no tradeoff to consider and we say that a dominates b in the pareto sense otherwise the visualizations provide drainage engineers and stakeholders alike with a transparent and at a glance way to determine trade offs between alternatives e g kasprzyk et al 2016 a possible next step once equipped with these metrics is to aggregate them through weighted sum as part of a multiattribute decision making process clemen and reilly 2013 however this work aims at providing a template for extracting and visualising the information for dual use rwh design decisions rather than prescribing how these metrics should be used to reach a design decision besides there exist well documented severe challenges to aggregating metrics in an unbiased way brill et al 1990 franssen 2005 woodruff et al 2013 especially in the type of multi alternative multi stakeholder context that corresponds to choosing and implementing rwh systems in a flood or drought prone community 2 5 sensitivity analysis the demand fraction is a dimensionless ratio given by annual demand divided by annual runoff fewkes and butler 2000 for the case presented in section 2 1 the mean annual runoff for the 30 year time series was 683 1 mm such that the modelled demand fraction was 2 14 a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of different demands on the performance metrics discussed in section 2 3 here we maintain a constant roof area and rainfall and vary the household water demand to generate a range of demand fractions from 0 to 5 0 a similar approach was used to examine the sensitivity of performance to storage volume here the dimensionless ratio storage fraction given by the storage volume divided by annual runoff fewkes and butler 2000 was varied between 0 and 0 20 to simulate a range of tank sizes between 0 and 4 1 m3 2 6 long term and significant event based stormwater management performance 2 6 1 flow duration curve as the peak outflow is determined on a 5 min basis it can be very sensitive to local fluctuations in the rainfall rate therefore we complement our analysis with a graphical approach in the form of the flow duration curve stovin et al 2017 a flow duration curve is a plot of runoff vs the proportion of time that a runoff is equalled or exceeded it is calculated by determining the exceedance probability of each of the tank outflow rates fig 2 shows an example of a flow duration curve for the long term 30 year roof runoff the largest roof runoff observed during the 30 year time series is 185 l s ha which is equivalent to 67 2 mm h a flow duration curve is typically used to show performance over the total simulation period or individual events it displays a range of information useful to drainage engineers and facilitates comparisons between different systems 2 6 2 significant event based performance in addition to the median significant event performance metrics consideration of the distribution of performance outcomes across the full set of 30 significant events may lead to additional insights in this section we examine the peak outflow er and ecq for the largest 30 events with a 1 year return period as determined in section 2 3 3 results 3 1 performance metrics and multi criteria visualisations table 2 shows the water balance per m2 of roof area and the performance metrics for each system the initial losses from the roof are 19 of the rainfall in line with mentens et al 2006 who reported 19 retention of rainfall by non greened roofs in brussels the water demand is over double the volume of roof runoff which indicates that regardless of the rainwater harvesting rwh system size the maximum water supply efficiency ews is limited to 0 46 this value is only marginally larger than the best performing systems active and conventional at 0 42 outflow and outflow above predevelopment runoff are almost identical for both the active and conventional systems for both passive systems the outflow above predevelopment runoff rate is significantly lower than total outflow illustrating their capacity to limit the high outflow rates associated with uncontrolled spills the passive 2 25 detention volume system seems to perform better of the two as it has less outflow but comparable outflow above predevelopment runoff rate to the passive 1 75 detention volume system in terms of the significant events for each of the metrics the order of performance from best to worst remains constant regardless of the time period over which the largest rainfall depth was calculated the passive systems are better at reducing peak flow and limiting flow to the predevelopment rate whereas the active and conventional system have larger retention values for all performance metrics all systems perform best during the events with the worst 1 h volume as these generally have lower durations and total volumes the suds manual woods ballard et al 2015 identifies events with the largest volume during a 6 h period as of critical importance the metrics for these events will be presented throughout the rest of this paper with the metrics for the 1 h and 24 h largest volume events available in the supplementary data the systematic bias applied to the emptying volume resulted in a negligible impact on the performance metrics with less than a 3 difference between the cases for all metrics this is due to the size of the storage volume as the large events usually necessitate large emptying volumes a 10 variation will not make a significant difference in addition as emptying is required infrequently the impact on the average water supply and retention efficiencies is minimal fig 3 presents a parallel plot and a radar plot intended to convey the conflicting rainwater harvesting objectives of water supply and stormwater management the parallel plot fig 3a shows all values with an axis normalised and constrained to the best and worst performance from both plots no system exhibits pareto dominance over the others if the objectives are ews and retention efficiency er both conventional and active systems are best if the inflow control efficiency ecq and median peak outflow sq50 are of concern the passive 1 system reduces the largest quantity of flow to below predevelopment runoff what is more all variables lead to a different ranking of alternatives this illustrates the metrics we propose provide complementary insights into system performance the radar plot fig 3b shows similar information to the parallel plot but using absolute values for the outflows yield and tcq the priorities of the drainage designer will vary so it is impossible to recommend one system type universally the passive 1 system s control of outflow rates is again highlighted both overall and during extreme events 3 2 the impact of the demand fraction on system performance a sensitivity analysis is used to examine the impact of demand variation on performance conventionally used metrics such as ews fig 4 a and er fig 4b are the most sensitive to demand for all systems for the ecq fig 4c both active and conventional systems vary more with demand than the passive systems for the sq50 fig 4e the peak flow decreases consistently with demand for the conventional and passive 2 systems for the passive 1 and active systems there is a large decrease in peak outflow at a demand fraction of approximately 1 5 the outflow rate remains almost constant after this for all demand fractions examined the passive 1 system has the lowest sq50 for both the ser50 and the ecq the active and passive 1 systems perform relatively consistently across the demands in contrast the performance of both the conventional and passive 2 systems increase steadily with increasing demand the comparative performance of the different systems is relatively insensitive to demand fraction with the passive 1 system performing consistently well for all runoff rate metrics in the range 0 0 demand fraction 5 0 the sensitivity analysis for the storage fraction is presented in the supplementary data for all systems and metrics the performance improved as the storage increased the difference in performance between systems also decreased with increasing storage volume 3 3 long term and significant event based stormwater management performance 3 3 1 flow duration curve the sq50 discussed in the multi criteria visualisation indicates stormwater detention performance yet it is still a single metric a more comprehensive evaluation of stormwater detention performance is the flow duration curve which allows a comparison to be made across all systems and storm events fig 5 fig 5 shows that roof runoff occurs for 4 of the simulation time similarly without any intervention the roof runoff would exceed predevelopment runoff rates approximately 0 8 of the simulation time higher runoff rates are exceeded for less time from the flow duration curve the active system has the lowest time above zero discharge however the emptying of these systems causes a controlled outflow greater than roof runoff for 0 01 of the simulation time it is crucial that the timing of this emptying occurs independently of storm events to ensure that the burden on drainage systems is not increased the passive 1 system has the lowest tcq only exceeding this threshold for 0 015 of the time however the passive 1 system also has the highest proportion of time above zero discharge longer even than the roof runoff the passive systems perform best at peak runoff reduction active and conventional systems perform comparably it is clear from this demonstration that the flow duration curve successfully complements other metrics in describing the year round behaviour of these systems 3 3 2 significant event based performance fig 6 shows the complete set of peak outflows er and the ecq for the 30 most significant storm events in the 30 year time series one thing that is very clear from these plots is the significant spread of individual event metrics around the median values reported in table 2 the degree of scattering reflects the influence that antecedent conditions and individual storm event characteristics have on performance during a specific event by definition median metrics do not represent the true variability of expected performance for example fig 6b highlights the fact that while the ser50 for the conventional system is 0 59 its performance in individual significant events could be anything between 0 25 and 1 0 peak outflow is shown in fig 6a as active systems can have large controlled releases as discussed in section 3 3 1 dedicated circles have been added on fig 6a to indicate occasions which are due to spill and which are due to active release the figure shows that for smaller events the passive 1 system has the lowest peak outflow however similarly to the er fig 6b as the events become larger there is little distinction between the performance of the different systems for er fig 6b shows that although all systems exhibit high er 0 5 for the majority of events there are a small minority which have er closer to zero this variability again is due to antecedent conditions for smaller events significant disparities can be observed between the performances of the different systems though there are smaller variations in performance between the system types for inflow events above 65 mm the dashed line indicates the er associated with the maximum capacity of the tank when empty assuming no losses i e no water supply during the event many points for both the conventional and active systems are on or above this line as the household water demand during the event results in extra capacity for storage for the ecq fig 6c shows that in all events the passive 1 system has the best performance again the dashed line represents the maximum capacity of the tank with no losses most of the system performances fall above this line illustrating the ability of these systems to control outflow rates especially the passive 1 system it is above this line for all events 4 discussion this paper set out to provide a set of metrics which capture both the water supply and stormwater management performance of rwh systems some of these metrics water supply efficiency ews and retention efficiency er have been well established by previous literature the existing metrics ews and er do not provide an adequate representation of the stormwater management potential of these systems for example in the illustrative case study presented in section 3 1 the conventional system has both the highest er and ews however it does not provide any additional control beyond its retention capacity as indicated by the minimal difference between the er and inflow control efficiency ecq metrics to quantify the release control capacity of these systems we examine their ability to reduce inflow to the predevelopment runoff rate via the metrics ecq and annual time above predevelopment runoff tcq the selection of stormwater management performance metrics reflects the two most common needs of receiving drainage systems either complete retention or flow control in cases where downpipe disconnection has occurred and the flow is either directed into waterways or sustainable drainage systems metrics related to predevelopment runoff would be preferred as the high flow rate due to the active release may cause morphological damage conversely where the rwh systems are connected to a combined sewer system the focus would be maximising retention during extreme events and an active system which empties reliably in advance of events would be preferable each of the above metrics is presented as a long term average over the 30 year time series it should be noted that this may hide seasonal variability for e ws as lower values are expected during summer months in the uk where rwh systems typically operate as an addition to mains water supply an average quantification is an adequate method of determining water supply capability although average values are appropriate for water supply assessment this is not the case for stormwater management as performance during extreme events is of critical importance to the application of these systems as sustainable drainage devices for example the conventional system has an overall e r of 0 91 which is significantly higher than the median retention efficiency ser50 of our sample of significant events 0 59 using the overall er metric alone may lead to an overestimation of stormwater management performance during extreme events this finding led to our identification of three further metrics based on our sample of 30 significant events median peak outflow sq50 ser50 and median inflow control efficiency secq 50 these metrics show that the passive 1 system has the lowest ser50 0 48 recall that passive 1 has a 25 percent retention capacity and 75 detention volume whereas passive 2 has 75 retention capacity and 25 detention volume and if in this instance performance during large events was of concern to drainage designers an active system ser50 of 0 65 would be optimal such an assessment would not have been possible without the inclusion of these metrics we found that although the peak outflow provides a useful metric for assessment of the detention capability of different rwh systems it is very sensitive to antecedent conditions and the shape of individual storms therefore the flow duration curve is proposed as a method to characterise the ability of these systems to limit stormwater runoff rate there are many ways that this graph can be read including the runoff rates that are exceeded for particular return periods e g 99 99th 99 9th percentile or the duration of time for which a specified runoff rate e g zero or predevelopment runoff is surpassed probabilistic approaches are used to set regulatory requirements for river water quality with set 90 and 99th percentile thresholds for biological oxygen demand levels the foundation for water research 2019 however for stormwater runoff these thresholds would be lower due to the intermittent nature of rainfall the decision as to what the key thresholds should be is expected to be dependent on the receiving catchment s hydrological response one possible option we explored is the tcq this value is of concern to drainage engineers as current guidance places a heavy emphasis on limiting runoff above this value woods ballard et al 2015 in addition to determining exceedance threshold values the flow duration curve can be used to identify the impact of different active emptying algorithms on runoff rates in this study high rates of outflow from the active system which exceed roof runoff are observed for 0 01 of the simulation time this proportion of time only equates to 1 h per year for this system but could potentially be longer for smaller tanks which would empty more often the purpose of the case study is not to determine the best system but to illustrate the ability of the proposed framework to capture all nuances of dual function rwh system behaviour our multi criteria visualisation highlights the importance of the procedure used to determine the emptying of the active system in this case every 24 h as needed it can empty during rainfall events causing an increase in peak outflow and a decrease in retention note that this algorithm proposed in xu et al 2018 assumes perfect day ahead rainfall forecasts real world active systems are even more challenging to implement using imperfect forecasts this can result in either a tank that is too full resulting in spills or too empty resulting in subsequent supply shortage before a storm although the systematic bias applied to the active system s emptying volume did not significantly alter results further strategies to improve the capacity of the active system to mitigate flood risks and control flow rate could be employed such as reducing the active release flowrate and utilising 7 day rainfall forecasts xu et al 2020 or adopting a minimum emptying time of 48 h before a storm woods ballard et al 2015 such strategies are also impacted by issues of forecast accuracy both the timing of these events and the availability of adequate forecasts are crucial as one full active emptying of the tank would result in the equivalent of a 33 mm rainfall event over the space of 110 min the methods presented in this paper could be used to examine the performance of different emptying strategies currently except for the analysis presented in fig 6 we draw no distinction between outflow attributed to spill or controlled release passive or active whereas xu et al 2018 calculated retention efficiency based on spill alone this approach results in higher values of er for the passive 1 passive 2 and active systems than observed in our study the impact that controlled releases from active and passive systems might have on the performance of the receiving drainage systems is unclear so by separately identifying spill and controlled release a fully informed assessment can be made there is potential for discharging the controlled release to sustainable drainage systems such as a swale or rain garden as was done for the active system examined by gee and hunt 2016 in many locations this type of approach may not be possible due to space limitations or underlying soil conditions or due to high flow rates caused by the active release which may damage the morphology of the receiving water body a sensitivity analysis concerning household water demand is essential as it is often assumed that householders will exclusively use rainwater for their non potable water needs when available however quinn et al 2020 showed that householders with a downstairs toilet connected to a conventional rainwater harvesting system did not use the water available to them as often as would be expected by the british standards institution 2013 in the case of the passive 1 and passive 2 systems the ecq is still high for low demands however this is not the case for active and conventional systems it is recommended that careful consideration is taken of demand during the design phase to ensure that it is accurate and its variations considered when determining stormwater management impact the metrics long term performance assessment and sensitivity analysis presented in this paper are intended for use by drainage designers current rwh stormwater management guidance for the uk considers storage volume as the only design variable with no alternatives to conventional rwh systems designed exclusively for water supply this approach leads to disproportionately large systems e g 3 m3 for 30 m2 roof space which makes rwh an unattractive option owing to space concerns this paper has illustrated the effectiveness of a 1 m3 system at providing both water supply and stormwater management although no one system exhibited pareto dominance drainage engineers can utilize the multi criteria visualisation to make informed drainage decisions that will reflect the preferences of home owners and local communities 5 conclusions the potential for rainwater harvesting systems to provide both water supply and stormwater management is increasingly recognised fostering interest in real world applications and prompting a search for alternative designs this paper supports these efforts by proposing the first set of metrics to fully quantify the stormwater management performance of rwh systems classic retention metrics have two key drawbacks firstly they tend to focus on long term volumetric performance rather than performance within specific extreme events and secondly in treating uncontrolled spill and controlled outflow in the same way we propose two metrics that measure a system s capacity to control outflow below a threshold e g runoff before urban development by quantifying annual average volumes and times above this threshold we also propose three robust metrics representing system response to severe rainfall events by extracting a set of such events from a long term time series and taking the median across events of peak flow retention efficiency and outflow control efficiency we combine these six metrics with a widely used measure of water supply efficiency to obtain a set of seven metrics five of which are novel for rwh systems comparison of four alternative rwh system designs with these seven metrics computed over a 5 min resolution thirty year time series demonstrate that they provide complementary insights into overall design performance indeed we use multi criteria visualisation as a transparent and at a glance way to show that all metrics evaluate and rank alternatives differently from the others we have also highlighted the value of a flow duration curve for capturing the system s cumulative long term performance we suggest that a threshold such as time above predevelopment rate could be further developed as a regulatory requirement this framework provides drainage designers with an easily applicable method for determining the benefits of individual rainwater harvesting systems to their catchment

19973,the world health organization who classified covid 19 as a global pandemic with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy although sars cov 2 the virus responsible for covid 19 is primarily respiratory in nature multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater and wastewater associated solids sludge however the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions or are instead driven by methodological artifacts the current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods detect and quantify sars cov 2

while also raising potential concerns for the water and wastewater industries covid 19 is primarily respiratory in nature but early studies confirmed the presence of sars cov 2 genetic material in the

centralized wastewater treatment facility serving approximately 1 million people with a typical average daily flow of 105 million gallons per day mgd facility 1 2 a smaller satellite wastewater treatment facility serving approximately 60 000 people with a typical average daily flow of 5 mgd facility 2 3 the las vegas wash a tributary of lake mead that consists primarily of treated effluent discharge from four major wastewater treatment facilities 4 untreated surface water from lake mead and 5 finished drinking water from three treatment facilities for 3 through 5 weekly grab samples of 10 20 l were collected from those locations details for 1 and 2 are provided below at facility 1 routine monitoring included primary effluent grab samples collected between 10 00 a m and 11 00 a m each sampling day the average hydraulic retention time hrt of the primary clarifier at this time is approximately 5 h which suggests the grab samples corresponded with raw sewage that arrived at the facility between 5 00 a m and 6 00 a m when the flow rate is at a minimum data shown later for this sampling location approximately 3 of the flow originates from solids dewatering for routine monitoring 100 ml samples were collected over the first two weeks of march n 4 and then 10 l samples were collected one to two times per week for the remainder of the study n 21 to compare grab versus composite and influent versus primary effluent 10 composite influents and 4 composite primary effluents were also collected in tandem with the routine samples all composites were 24 hr flow

filtration and uv disinfection were collected to assess persistence of the sars cov 2 genetic signal through wastewater treatment at facility 2 routine monitoring included 24 hr flow proportional composite influent samples collected one or two times per week starting in early april n 11 these samples were collected in 10 l volumes from a refrigerated autosampler 2 2 sample processing the 10 l raw influent samples from facility 2 were pre filtered with 100 μm filter paper whatman grade 0965 ge healthcare bio sciences pa usa and coarse solids were discarded all other samples were processed without pre filtration primary concentration consisted of hollow fiber ultrafiltration hfuf rexeed 25s 30 kda asahi kasei medical co japan centrifugal ultrafiltration centricon plus 70 30 kda or 100

centrifugation at 3500 g for 60 min at 4 c discarding of supernatant and pellet resuspension in residual supernatant volume 0 5 ml preliminary experiments with peg followed by chloroform butanol extraction 1 1 v v indicated loss of sars cov 2 signal so this extraction step was omitted from the study see table s5 for additional information to maximize equivalent sample volume esv for the centricons up to three successive centrifugations 3500 g for 20 30 min at 10 c were performed each time recording and discarding the filtrate volume and then adding additional sample volume to the device more than three centrifugations sometimes resulted in apparent loss of centricon filter column integrity as indicated by unusually rapid filtrate passage and discoloration of the filtrate all samples with volumes 10 l were first processed by hfuf down to a volume of 100 200 ml followed by centrifugation of the concentrate at 3500 g for 15 30 min at 10 c for solids pelleting hfuf concentrates were either analyzed as is or further processed with secondary concentration via centricon ultrafilters up to 150 ml or peg precipitation 40 ml the resulting concentrates pellets were immediately stored at 20 c prior to nucleic acid extraction with the exception of the first four samples collected at facility 1 all routine monitoring samples were processed with the hfuf centricon approach fig 1 for the first two weeks of march 100 ml samples from facility 1 were processed by centrifugation and centricon ultrafiltration this resulted in low overall esvs of 0 2 1 ml which prompted collection of larger sample volumes processed by hfuf centricon according to papp et al 2020 and hill et al 2007 retrospectively this may not have been the optimal approach but since hfuf centricon had been used previously by our lab it ensured greater consistency in trend analysis across the study the performance of each sample processing method was evaluated based on esvs recovery of spiked vaccine strain bovine coronavirus bcov calf guard zoetis parsippany nj usa and recovery of native pepper mild mottle virus pmmov because the bcov stock was acquired after the wastewater surveillance study began recovery was evaluated in only a subset of the samples based on consistency in recovery efficiency all sars cov 2 concentrations were adjusted for average bcov recovery

cfx384 touch real time pcr detection systems bio rad laboratories using the conditions detailed in text s1 steps in determining limits of detection lods limits of quantification loqs and esvs are also described in text s1 and corresponding data are summarized in table 2 inhibition was assessed by two different methods first a known concentration of the idt n1 n2 plasmid used as an internal positive

between spiked cdna and spiked blanks i e cq 1 0 second a separate ipc quantifast pathogen pcr ic kit qiagen hilden germany was spiked according to manufacturer s instructions to assess inhibition in another subset of wastewater derived cdna samples again inhibition was assumed to be absent or indiscernible based on the cq criterion 3 0 results and discussion the following samples were non detect for sars cov 2 rna secondary n 4 and finished n 2 wastewater effluents from facility 1 no treated wastewater samples were collected from facility 2 blended wastewater effluent in the las vegas wash n 11 untreated surface water from lake mead n 11 and finished drinking water n 33 because these samples were all non detect the remainder of this study focuses on wastewater influent and primary effluent 3 1 method comparisons because of the rapid onset of covid 19 and time sensitive nature of this research it was not possible to identify optimized sample collection processing and analysis methods prior to the study therefore relatively consistent methods were employed for routine monitoring but those were supplemented with additional experiments and modeling to characterize the impacts of methodological considerations on the sars cov 2 genetic signal in wastewater the sars cov 2 genetic signal can potentially be affected by sample location sample type and time of collection for example the signal may change depending on whether the sample is collected upstream in a sewershed in the influent to a wastewater treatment facility or in the primary clarifier effluent primarily due to differing compositions dilutions and dispersion effects the signal may also depend on whether the sample is a grab versus composite the type of composite e g time proportional vs flow proportional and the time of day when it is collected ort et al 2010b particularly early in the outbreak sars cov 2 might be considered a rare constituent in contrast with more ubiquitous indicators of fecal contamination such as pmmov so its detection presence at any given time may be more susceptible to hydraulic effects ort et al 2010a showed that some rare constituents exhibit intermittent concentration peaks that might be missed with mistimed grab samples text s2 summarizes the potential effects of hydraulics on sars cov 2 concentrations with several hypothetical scenarios as shown in fig s1 non ideal reactor with dispersion primary clarifiers have the potential to disperse the signal from a rare constituent over several hours this increases the probability of capturing the signal but potentially dilutes the signal strength to compensate for the potential dilution effect larger sample volumes e g 10 l were initially assumed to be necessary it was not possible to obtain composite sample volumes greater than 1 l at facility 1 so 10 l grab samples of primary effluent were initially selected for routine monitoring in this study to test the effects of sample location sample type and potentially sample time the genetic signal from sars cov 2 was compared in composite influent centricon only composite primary effluent centricon only and grab primary effluent samples from facility 1 hfuf centricon for both sars cov 2 and pmmov the concentrations adjusted for method specific recovery were consistently higher in both composite samples table s3 which was also observed in curtis et al 2020 sars cov 2 concentrations were 1 order of magnitude higher on average and pmmov concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher as shown in fig s1 dispersion might cause primary effluent concentrations to be lower than raw influent samples for a rare constituent but with the exception of one day for pmmov concentrations of sars cov 2 and pmmov were similar between corresponding composite influents and composite primary effluents therefore the consistently higher signals in the composite samples might be attributable to time differences the grab primary effluent samples corresponded with the minimum flow for facility 1 so loadings of sars cov 2 and pmmov might increase later in the day additional testing would be needed to confirm this diurnal variation with respect to sample processing numerous approaches were evaluated throughout the duration of the study the methods were evaluated based on equivalent sample volume and recovery of spiked bcov and native pmmov for which data are summarized in table 3 it was initially assumed that secondary concentration methods would be needed to maximize esv for sars cov 2 detection hence the selection of hfuf centricon for routine monitoring of 10 l samples hill et al 2007 previously demonstrated 70 recovery of ms2 and p h i x174 using this combined approach although secondary concentration was able to increase esvs e g 0 55 0 05 ml for hfuf vs 11 2 8 ml for hfuf centricon secondary concentration resulted in a notable decrease in bcov recovery e g 54 11 for hfuf vs 2 1 0 87 for hfuf centricon furthermore spiking bcov at different stages of sample processing see text s1 confirmed that performance deteriorated during secondary concentration for example primary concentration with centricon resulted in a high yet variable bcov recovery 55 38 similar to the ms2 recovery observed in medema et al 2020 however when isolating secondary concentration bcov recovery by centricon dropped to 9 4 9 5 a similar decrease in performance was observed for peg when used for secondary concentration following hfuf with the overall hfuf peg method achieving only 0 34 recovery of bcov in contrast using peg for primary concentration resulted in higher recoveries of 11 8 4 in a small number of split samples direct extraction of the hfuf concentrate appeared to be slightly more sensitive than the overall hfuf centricon approach hfuf alone achieved a greater number of positive qpcr assays reactions in 8 of 10 split samples although concentrations corrected for esv and recovery were nearly identical between the two methods 1 5 fold difference for sars cov 2 and pmmov for all methods pmmov recovery was 1 order of magnitude lower than bcov recovery considering the higher observed concentrations in composite samples with reduced volume the lack of a clear benefit of secondary concentration and the costs associated with additional processing primary concentration with hfuf current study peg precipitation wu et al 2020b centricon ultrafilters medema et al 2020 or electronegative filtration gonzalez et al 2020 should be adequate for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 other viable options appear to be ultracentrifugation green et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 or even direct extraction from sludge peccia et al 2020 in the current study bcov concentrations were low for extracted solids from spiked samples table 3 although solids partitioning in the recovery experiments may not have accurately mimicked partitioning in actual samples samples were rocked for 10 min after spiking with bcov ye et al 2016 estimated 15 adsorption of enveloped viruses to wastewater solids under equilibrium conditions during routine monitoring only 26 and 13 of extracted solid samples from facility 1 and facility 2 respectively were positive for one or more sars cov 2 assays maximum of 2 positive assays and 2 positive reactions for a single sample peccia et al 2020 employed a nucleic acid extraction kit specifically designed for solid samples which may have improved recovery from sludge and sars cov 2 detection in that study 3 2 covid 19 case data and wastewater occurrence of sars cov 2 fig 2 summarizes the clinical case data for southern nevada from march 9th first confirmed cases through may 31st snhd 2020 the raw data from the southern nevada health district snhd correspond with the date of positive test confirmation rather than onset of symptoms so fig 2 may include a time lag nevertheless the data provide some indication of when covid 19 initially spiked and then peaked in the community at which point just over 0 007 of the population was confirmed positive each day the number of new cases generally waned after the first week of april but then increased in early may when there was an increase in testing rate the constant decrease in hospitalizations and deaths through the end of may fig s2 coupled with a higher frequency of non detects in wastewater described later suggest that the increase in new cases in early may was largely a function of increased testing following the peak the 7 day moving average fluctuated between 57 and 111 new cases per day or 0 002 0 005 of the population by the end of may there were 6719 confirmed cases of covid 19 0 29 relative prevalence 1565 related hospitalizations 23 of confirmed cases and 343 related deaths 5 of confirmed cases in southern nevada fig 3 summarizes the wastewater flow data for facilities 1 and 2 between march and may of 2019 and 2020 because of its service area facility 1 was significantly impacted by the closure of casinos and hotels along the las vegas strip in mid march facility 2 which serves primarily residential areas experienced minimal impacts from covid 19 mitigation measures although average daily flows may have increased slightly due to people spending a greater amount of time at home at both facilities peak flow shifted 2 h later in the day when comparing 2019 versus 2020 because the shift was observed in both facilities with one experiencing lower flows and the other experiencing normal higher flows the shift was presumably due to behavioral changes rather than hydraulics as noted earlier the grab primary effluent samples collected between 10 00 a m and 11 00 a m correspond with the minimum observed flow rate at facility 1 after accounting for the 5 h hydraulic retention time of the primary clarifier fig 4 summarizes the routine monitoring data for sars cov 2 rna for facilities 1 and 2 respectively n1 was detected in 64 and 9 of all samples n2 was detected in 48 and 45 e sarbeco was detected in 20 and 0 and orf1a was detected in 8 and 0 the average cqs for the samples with detections were 33 8 1 4 for n1 35 1 1 6 for n2 35 2 1 1 for e sarbeco and 33 3 1 8 for orf1a similar inconsistency in assay results has been reported by ahmed et al 2020 in australia medema et al 2020 in the netherlands and nemudryi et al 2020 in montana on the other hand wu et al 2020b observed relatively consistent detections of n1 n2 and n3 in massachusetts and green et al 2020 observed consistent detections for all quantifiable samples in upstate new york one study noted that inconsistency across assays might result from increasing prevalence of genetic variants penarrubia et al 2020 but similar to ahmed et al 2020 many positive samples in the current study were near the lods and loqs for the respective assays which may have resulted in variability between gene targets with differing sensitivities there were no detections during the first week of march but there was a detection of n1 at facility 1 on march 9th which is consistent with the first confirmed clinical case in the local community both peccia et al 2020 and medema et al 2020 detected sars cov 2 rna in wastewater prior to confirmed cases in several communities with four sars cov 2 assays and duplicate reactions for each assay there were a total of eight qpcr reactions for each sample only several samples were positive for multiple assays and many samples were positive for only one qpcr replicate for a given assay therefore the number of positive reactions was used as a semi quantitative indication of the strength of the sars cov 2 genetic signal for facility 1 the peak signal occurred on april 13th when 4 assays and 6 of 8 total reactions were positive several samples between march 30th and april 27th had at least 3 positive assays and 4 of 8 positive reactions this semi quantitative peak was somewhat consistent with the clinical peak in fig 2 facility 2 never exceeded 2 positive assays and or reactions with the peak occurring sometime between april 13th and april 27th therefore there was some temporal consistency in the data from facilities 1 and 2 and the fact that the genetic signal was seemingly stronger at facility 1 is consistent with the clinical data for each service area as of may 31st the relative prevalence in the service area for facility 2 was 0 22 based on confirmed cases while the relative prevalence in the immediate area surrounding facility 1 was 0 40 on average and as high as 0 65 in one area fig s3 snhd 2020 with respect to gene copy gc concentrations there was only one sample from facility 1 that was loq and positive for both qpcr replicates 3 6 104 gc l for n1 on april 27th and one sample from facility 2 1 2 105 gc l for n2 on april 28th multiple samples at facility 1 were quantifiable based on single qpcr replicates while only one additional sample was technically quantifiable at facility 2 in general concentrations at both facilities appeared to fluctuate between 104 and 106 gc l the average pmmov concentration was approximately 4 5 109 gc l at both facilities which is consistent with the literature symonds et al 2018 liquid phase concentrations reported in the peer reviewed ahmed et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 wu et al 2020b and currently non peer reviewed literature green et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 vary by several orders of magnitude as low as 101 gc l in australia to almost 107 gc l in france but it is currently unclear whether that is due to differences in covid 19 incidence prevalence sample processing methods data interpretation e g accounting for virus recovery and or esvs or perhaps a combination of factors the concentrations reported in wu et al 2020b were slightly lower than the current study although confirmed covid 19 prevalence in their massachusetts study area was also an order of magnitude lower at that time that study did not appear to correct for virus recovery and concentrations may have also been impacted by pasteurization prior to analysis for areas with similar clinical prevalence or death rates reported concentrations were either several orders of magnitude lower ahmed et al 2020 relatively consistent green et al 2020 or approximately one order of magnitude higher wurtzer et al 2020 than the observed data in southern nevada as noted in ahmed et al 2020 interlaboratory validation is a critical need for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 and until that is addressed and more peer reviewed studies are published it will be difficult to reliably compare data across time and location 3 3 incidence prevalence estimates approaches to estimate incidence or prevalence based on wastewater surveillance data have also varied across studies some studies have used a mass balance approach by coupling fecal shedding data from the literature sewershed characteristics and sars cov 2 rna concentrations see eq 1 ahmed et al 2020 wu et al 2020b 1 infections persons s a r s c o v 2 c o n c e n t r a t i o n g c l w a s t e w a t e r f l o w r a t e l d f e c e s p r o d u c t i o n r a t e g p e r s o n d f e c a l s h e d d i n g r a t e g c g with this approach it is important to capture the uncertainty and inherent variability of critical parameters which can be accomplished to some degree with monte carlo simulations ahmed et al 2020 feces production rate is fairly well characterized in the literature with a median of 126 250 g person d depending on location rose et al 2015 wastewater flow rate is also relatively straightforward when using average daily flow for a particular facility although there could be artifacts of sample collection e g influent vs primary effluent and grab vs composite that affect the composition of the sample and how that should be considered in the model at this time the major source of uncertainty is the fecal shedding rate and how that varies over time between individuals e g symptomatic vs asymptomatic and across other demographic factors wölfel et al 2020 provided an initial assessment demonstrating that fecal shedding rate varied by several orders of magnitude for a given person with a maximum shedding rate early in the infection period and then a steady decline over as long as 30 days fig s4 zheng et al 2020 reported similar viral loads in stool samples and a similar shedding duration but did not observe any clear trends over time assuming the wölfel et al 2020 trajectory a simple mass balance approach may not be appropriate for determining overall prevalence within a community particularly for a prolonged outbreak but may provide a reasonable indication of new cases or incidence that might dominate the sars cov 2 wastewater load using the simple mass balance approach we assumed a feces production rate of 126 g person d an initial fecal shedding rate of 108 9 gc g for new cases adapted from wölfel et al 2020 see fig s4 and average sars cov 2 rna concentrations across all assays including estimated concentrations loq from the routine monitoring samples these calculations resulted in estimates of 200 new cases per day for facility 1 and 20 new cases per day for facility 2 which equates to 0 02 0 03 daily relative incidence considering that confirmed daily relative incidence was 0 004 on average in april and may fig 2 the wastewater estimates indicate the ascertainment ratio was approximately 5 8 in southern nevada during this period this is in general agreement with wu et al 2020a which suggested the ascertainment ratio was on the order of 3 20 in the united states early in the pandemic green et al 2020 used ratios of sars cov 2 i e infected fecal load to crassphage i e total fecal load as an indirect estimate of disease prevalence while the current study focused on pmmov to estimate incidence sars cov 2 pmmov ratios in the current study suggested an average of 30 new cases per day for facility 1 across the entire study period i e 0 003 relative incidence with an apparent peak occurring between march 23rd and april 20th for facility 2 the peak ratio occurred on april 14th indicating 15 new cases per day i e 0 025 relative incidence and the remaining data suggested fewer than 2 new cases per day i e 0 003 relative incidence these ratio based estimates appear to align more closely with the confirmed clinical data for southern nevada fig 2 even without adjusting for asymptomatic infections or ascertainment ratio fig 5 illustrates an alternative framework for estimating sars cov 2 concentrations in facility 1 wastewater specifically accounting for the time dependent shedding rate of infected individuals in the underlying model see text s3 the fecal shedding rate followed the trajectory illustrated in fig s4 i e decreasing from a maximum of 108 9 gc g to 1 gc g over 25 days an adaptation of wölfel et al 2020 the number of new cases per day was based on 50 of the clinically confirmed daily cases reported for southern nevada snhd 2020 since facility 1 serves approximately half of the local population but the model also assumed an asymptomatic ratio of 50 day 2020 or an ascertainment ratio of 2 an infected individual was assumed to no longer be shedding once the shedding rate dropped below 1 gc g the sars cov 2 load from all shedding individuals on a given day was divided by the corresponding average daily flow for facility 1 considering that the model predicts concentrations of 102 103 gc l early in the outbreak i e lod for this study and that the first wastewater detection occurred during that time i e march 9th it is unlikely that the confirmed case load accurately represented covid 19 incidence prevalence in the community at that time consistent wastewater detections of sars cov 2 occurred once the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases exceeded 0 001 relative incidence and 0 01 relative prevalence respectively this corresponds with model concentrations of 104 gc l or higher which is consistent with the observed lods for the sars cov 2 assays the strongest observed wastewater signal as determined by the number of positive assays and replicate reactions see fig 4 occurred when the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases reached 0 01 relative incidence and 0 1 relative prevalence respectively which corresponds with a model concentration of nearly 105 gc l the observed wastewater concentrations were generally in agreement with the model predictions although some samples exhibited high variability between the four molecular targets the model assumes new cases with high shedding rates dominate the sars cov 2 wastewater load which is why the daily case load and modeled concentrations generally mirror each other in fig 5 based on this shedding framework wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 may be a useful leading indicator of covid 19 when the case load is increasing by orders of magnitude over a short period of time but due to inherent variability in sars cov 2 methods wastewater surveillance may not have sufficient resolution to detect small changes in daily case load for much of the study period observed and predicted wastewater concentrations fluctuated between 104 and 105 gc l because daily relative incidence also fluctuated around 0 01 from late march through the end of may finally the persistence of fecal shedding suggests that clinical data may be better suited to identify the waning portion of the covid 19 epidemiological curve although this could not be demonstrated in the current study because of the consistency in new daily cases through the end of may 4 0 conclusions the covid 19 pandemic highlighted deficiencies in rapidly deploying widespread clinical testing this subsequently raised awareness of wastewater surveillance and its value in detecting the introduction of covid 19 into a community characterizing covid 19 incidence or prevalence and potentially informing policy measures the scientific community rapidly developed methods to initiate wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 throughout the world but the resulting studies often differed in terms of sample collection processing and or analysis thereby making it difficult to compare results and draw broad conclusions this highlights the urgent need for an interlaboratory comparison of sars cov 2 methodology until that is completed the current study provides guidance on certain aspects of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance for example sars cov 2 rna appears to show a diurnal effect in wastewater that might necessitate composite sampling moreover secondary concentration methods may not be necessary and may actually be detrimental for detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in any case understanding the implications of method selection on equivalent sample volume and virus recovery is critical for accurately characterizing sars cov 2 rna concentrations this information can be used to inform future sampling design or to retrospectively compare data from early studies in addition to characterizing concentrations of sars cov 2 genetic markers in a specific community the proposed model from this study highlights the potential significance of new cases i e incidence rather than prevalence in driving wastewater loads the model also suggests that wastewater surveillance might be a valuable leading indicator of covid 19 outbreaks but may be a lagging indicator for declining infection rates due to prolonged viral shedding the value of wastewater surveillance may be partially dependent on the status of clinical testing in a given community e g extent of clinical testing lags additional studies or meta analyses are needed to confirm the methods and assumptions used when comparing wastewater surveillance data to infection incidence or prevalence in particular additional data are needed to verify the assumption in the current study of high shedding early in the infection period nevertheless this study demonstrates that wastewater surveillance can provide a valuable assessment of community health conditions particularly when clinical testing resources are

19973,the world health organization who classified covid 19 as a global pandemic with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy although sars cov 2 the virus responsible for covid 19 is primarily respiratory in nature multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater and wastewater associated solids sludge however the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions or are instead driven by methodological artifacts the current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods detect and quantify sars cov 2 genetic material in two southern nevada sewersheds from march may 2020 and better understand the potential link between covid 19 incidence prevalence and wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 rna sars cov 2 surrogate recovery 0 34 55 and equivalent sample volume 0 1 ml 1 l differed between methods and target water matrices ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a 10 fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples presumably highlighting diurnal variability

clusters of viral pneumonia of unknown origin had been identified in wuhan china lu et al 2020 and by march 2020 the world health organization who had classified covid 19 as a global pandemic bialek

in the absence of mitigation measures eisenberg 2020 the severe morbidity and mortality outcomes ultimately led to extraordinary measures to mitigate effects on public health and the global economy while also raising potential concerns for the water and wastewater industries covid 19 is primarily respiratory in nature but early studies confirmed the presence of sars cov 2 genetic material in the feces of infected individuals wölfel et al 2020 zang et al 2020 possibly due to co infection of cells within the gastrointestinal gi tract xiao et al 2020 this alternative infection route was previously hypothesized for mers zhou et al 2017 and may explain why the genetic material of sars cov 2 can be detected in feces even after it is no longer detected in oral and nasal swabs xiao et al 2020 to date isolation of infectious sars cov 2 from fecal samples has been unsuccessful in multiple studies wölfel et al 2020 zang et al 2020 although one study observed entry into vero cells using sars cov 2 isolated from a single patient zhang et al 2020 zang et al 2020 hypothesized that although sars cov 2 had the potential to infect cells within the gi tract the virus appeared to be inactivated rapidly by colonic fluids in contrast with enteric rotavirus sars cov 2 was not detected in urine in wölfel et al 2020 but infectious sars cov 1 was detected in urine in the past xu et al

applications much of the scientific community focused on the application of wastewater surveillance or wastewater based epidemiology wbe to characterize covid 19 in communities throughout the world bivins et al 2020 wastewater surveillance involves monitoring chemical or microbiological targets to gain insight into the behaviors or characteristics of a community this approach has been used to characterize opioid abuse gushgari et al 2019 to facilitate polio eradication hovi et al 2012 and as an early warning signal for the spread of viral gastroenteritis hellmér et al 2014 for sars cov 2 this tool can potentially detect the initial occurrence or reemergence of covid 19 in a local community medema et al 2020 characterize trends in incidence or prevalence and even complement case data

sewersheds and in wastewater impacted surface water and 3 better understand the potential link between clinically confirmed covid 19 case data and concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater the knowledge gained during this early phase of the pandemic is valuable for continued efforts related to covid 19 and for future implementation of wastewater surveillance to address other emerging public health challenges 2 0 methods 2 1 sample collection water wastewater samples were collected from the following five sites in southern nevada from early march 2020 to late may 2020 1 a large centralized wastewater treatment facility serving approximately 1 million people with a typical average daily flow of 105 million gallons per day mgd facility 1 2 a smaller satellite wastewater treatment facility serving approximately 60 000 people with a typical average daily flow of 5 mgd facility 2 3 the las vegas wash a tributary of lake mead that consists primarily of treated effluent discharge from four major wastewater treatment facilities 4 untreated surface water from lake mead and 5 finished drinking water from three treatment facilities for 3 through 5 weekly grab samples of 10 20 l were collected from those locations details for 1 and 2 are provided below at facility 1 routine monitoring included primary effluent grab samples collected between 10 00 a m and 11 00 a m each sampling day the average hydraulic retention time hrt of the primary clarifier at this time is approximately 5 h which suggests the grab samples corresponded with raw sewage that arrived at the facility between 5 00 a m and 6 00 a m when the flow rate is at a minimum data shown later for this sampling location approximately 3 of the flow originates from solids dewatering for routine monitoring 100 ml samples were collected over the first two weeks of march n 4 and then 10 l samples were collected one to two times per week for the remainder of the study n 21 to compare grab versus composite and influent versus primary effluent 10 composite influents and 4 composite primary effluents were also collected in tandem with the routine samples all composites were 24 hr flow

centricons up to three successive centrifugations 3500 g for 20 30 min at 10 c were performed each time recording and discarding the filtrate volume and then adding additional sample volume to the device more than three centrifugations sometimes resulted in apparent loss of centricon filter column integrity as indicated by unusually rapid filtrate passage and discoloration of the filtrate all samples with volumes 10 l were first processed by hfuf down to a volume of 100 200 ml followed by centrifugation of the concentrate at 3500 g for 15 30 min at 10 c for solids pelleting hfuf concentrates were either analyzed as is or further processed with secondary concentration via centricon ultrafilters up to 150 ml or peg precipitation 40 ml the resulting concentrates pellets were immediately stored at 20 c prior to nucleic acid extraction with the exception of the first four samples collected at facility 1 all routine monitoring samples were processed with the hfuf centricon approach fig 1 for the first two weeks of march 100 ml samples from facility 1 were processed by centrifugation and centricon ultrafiltration this resulted in low overall esvs of 0 2 1 ml which prompted collection of larger sample volumes processed by hfuf centricon according to papp et al 2020 and hill et al 2007 retrospectively this may not have been the optimal approach but since hfuf centricon had been used previously by our lab it ensured greater consistency in trend analysis across the study the performance of each sample processing method was evaluated based on esvs recovery of spiked vaccine strain bovine coronavirus bcov calf guard zoetis parsippany nj usa and recovery of native pepper mild mottle virus pmmov because the bcov stock was acquired after the wastewater surveillance study began recovery was evaluated in only a subset of the samples based on consistency in recovery efficiency all sars cov 2 concentrations were adjusted for average bcov recovery

and n2 all wastewater samples were also analyzed for pmmov using a sybr based qpcr assay hamza et al 2011 pmmov has been identified as a useful indicator of fecal pollution because of its abundance in feces and sewage rosario et al 2009 this rna virus simultaneously serves as a valuable internal control for sars cov 2 because its genetic material requires the same analysis pipeline i e rna extraction and cdna synthesis spiked recovery samples were analyzed using a probe based assay for bcov decaro et al 2008 assay details are summarized in table 1 primers probes and gblock gene fragments for e sarbeco orf1a bcov and pmmov were purchased from integrated dna technologies idt skokie il usa the n1 and n2 reagents including a plasmid based positive control were acquired as part of the 2019 ncov ruo kit from idt although n1 and n2 were quantified using a synthetic sars cov 2 rna standard from atcc vr 3276sd atcc manassas va usa see text s1 all assays were run on a cfx96 or

described in text s1 and corresponding data are summarized in table 2 inhibition was assessed by two different methods first a known concentration of the idt n1 n2 plasmid used as an internal positive

another subset of wastewater derived cdna samples again inhibition was assumed to be absent or indiscernible based on the cq criterion 3 0 results and discussion the following samples were non detect for sars cov 2 rna secondary n 4 and finished n 2 wastewater effluents from facility 1 no treated wastewater samples were collected from facility 2 blended wastewater effluent in the las vegas wash n 11 untreated surface water from lake mead n 11 and finished drinking water n 33 because these samples were all non detect the remainder of this study focuses on wastewater influent and primary effluent 3 1 method comparisons because of the rapid onset of covid 19 and time sensitive nature of this research it was not possible to identify optimized sample collection processing and analysis methods prior to the study therefore relatively consistent methods were employed for routine monitoring but those were supplemented with additional experiments and modeling to characterize the impacts of methodological considerations on the sars cov 2 genetic signal in wastewater the sars cov 2 genetic signal can potentially be affected by sample location sample type and time of collection for example the signal may change depending on whether the sample is collected upstream in a sewershed in the influent to a wastewater treatment facility or in the primary clarifier effluent primarily due to differing compositions dilutions and dispersion effects the signal may also depend on whether the sample is a grab versus composite the type of composite e g time proportional vs flow proportional and the time of day when it is collected ort et al 2010b particularly early in the outbreak sars cov 2 might be considered a rare constituent in contrast with more ubiquitous indicators of fecal contamination such as pmmov so its detection presence at any given time may be more susceptible to hydraulic effects ort et al 2010a showed that some rare constituents exhibit intermittent concentration peaks that might be missed with mistimed grab samples text s2 summarizes the potential effects of hydraulics on sars cov 2 concentrations with several hypothetical scenarios as shown in fig s1 non ideal reactor with dispersion primary clarifiers have the potential to disperse the signal from a rare constituent over several hours this increases the probability of capturing the signal but potentially dilutes the signal strength to compensate for the potential dilution effect larger sample volumes e g 10 l were initially assumed to be necessary it was not possible to obtain composite sample volumes greater than 1 l at facility 1 so 10 l grab samples of primary effluent were initially selected for routine monitoring in this study to test the effects of sample location sample type and potentially sample time the genetic signal from sars cov 2 was compared in composite influent centricon only composite primary effluent centricon only and grab primary effluent samples from facility 1 hfuf centricon for both sars cov 2 and pmmov the concentrations adjusted for method specific recovery were consistently higher in both composite samples table s3 which was also observed in curtis et al 2020 sars cov 2 concentrations were 1 order of magnitude higher on average and pmmov concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher as shown in fig s1 dispersion might cause primary effluent concentrations to be lower than raw influent samples for a rare constituent but with the exception of one day for pmmov concentrations of sars cov 2 and pmmov were similar between corresponding composite influents and composite primary effluents therefore the consistently higher signals in the composite samples might be attributable to time differences the grab primary effluent samples corresponded with the minimum flow for facility 1 so loadings of sars cov 2 and pmmov might increase later in the day additional testing would be needed to confirm this diurnal variation with respect to sample processing numerous approaches were evaluated throughout the duration of the study the methods were evaluated based on equivalent sample volume and recovery of spiked bcov and native pmmov for which data are summarized in table 3 it was initially assumed that secondary concentration methods would be needed to maximize esv for sars cov 2 detection hence the selection of hfuf centricon for routine monitoring of 10 l samples hill et al 2007 previously demonstrated 70 recovery of ms2 and p h i x174 using this combined approach although secondary concentration was able to increase esvs e g 0 55 0 05 ml for hfuf vs 11 2 8 ml for hfuf centricon secondary concentration resulted in a notable decrease in bcov recovery e g 54 11 for hfuf vs 2 1 0 87 for hfuf centricon furthermore spiking bcov at different stages of sample processing see text s1 confirmed that performance deteriorated during secondary concentration for example primary concentration with centricon resulted in a high yet variable bcov recovery 55 38 similar to the ms2 recovery observed in medema et al 2020 however when isolating secondary concentration bcov recovery by centricon dropped to 9 4 9 5 a similar decrease in performance was observed for peg when used for secondary concentration following hfuf with the overall hfuf peg method achieving only 0 34 recovery of bcov in contrast using peg for primary concentration resulted in higher recoveries of 11 8 4 in a small number of split samples direct extraction of the hfuf concentrate appeared to be slightly more sensitive than the overall hfuf centricon approach hfuf alone achieved a greater number of positive qpcr assays reactions in 8 of 10 split samples although concentrations corrected for esv and recovery were nearly identical between the two methods 1 5 fold difference for sars cov 2 and pmmov for all methods pmmov recovery was 1 order of magnitude lower than bcov recovery considering the higher observed concentrations in composite samples with reduced volume the lack of a clear benefit of secondary concentration and the costs associated with additional processing primary concentration with hfuf current study peg precipitation wu et al 2020b centricon ultrafilters medema et al 2020 or electronegative filtration gonzalez et al 2020 should be adequate for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 other viable options appear to be ultracentrifugation green et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 or even direct extraction from sludge peccia et al 2020 in the current study bcov concentrations were low for extracted solids from spiked samples table 3 although solids partitioning in the recovery experiments may not have accurately mimicked partitioning in actual samples samples were rocked for 10 min after spiking with bcov ye et al 2016 estimated 15 adsorption of enveloped viruses to wastewater solids under equilibrium conditions during routine monitoring only 26 and 13 of extracted solid samples from facility 1 and facility 2 respectively were positive for one or more sars cov 2 assays maximum of 2 positive assays and 2 positive reactions for a single sample peccia et al 2020 employed a nucleic acid extraction kit specifically designed for solid samples which may have improved recovery from sludge and sars cov 2 detection in that study 3 2 covid 19 case data and wastewater occurrence of sars cov 2 fig 2 summarizes the clinical case data for southern nevada from march 9th first confirmed cases through may 31st snhd 2020 the raw data from the southern nevada health district snhd correspond with the date of positive test confirmation rather than onset of symptoms so fig 2 may include a time lag nevertheless the data provide some indication of when covid 19 initially spiked and then peaked in the community at which point just over 0 007 of the population was confirmed positive each day the number of new cases generally waned after the first week of april but then increased in early may when there was an increase in testing rate the constant decrease in hospitalizations and deaths through the end of may fig s2 coupled with a higher frequency of non detects in wastewater described later suggest that the increase in new cases in early may was largely a function of increased testing following the peak the 7 day moving average fluctuated between 57 and 111 new cases per day or 0 002 0 005 of the population by the end of may there were 6719 confirmed cases of covid 19 0 29 relative prevalence 1565 related hospitalizations 23 of confirmed cases and 343 related deaths 5 of confirmed cases in southern nevada fig 3 summarizes the wastewater flow data for facilities 1 and 2 between march and may of 2019 and 2020 because of its service area facility 1 was significantly impacted by the closure of casinos and hotels along the las vegas strip in mid march facility 2 which serves primarily residential areas experienced minimal impacts from covid 19 mitigation measures although average daily flows may have increased slightly due to people spending a greater amount of time at home at both facilities peak flow shifted 2 h later in the day when comparing 2019 versus 2020 because the shift was observed in both facilities with one experiencing lower flows and the other experiencing normal higher flows the shift was presumably due to behavioral changes rather than hydraulics as noted earlier the grab primary effluent samples collected between 10 00 a m and 11 00 a m correspond with the minimum observed flow rate at facility 1 after accounting for the 5 h hydraulic retention time of the primary clarifier fig 4 summarizes the routine monitoring data for sars cov 2 rna for facilities 1 and 2 respectively n1 was detected in 64 and 9 of all samples n2 was detected in 48 and 45 e sarbeco was detected in 20 and 0 and orf1a was detected in 8 and 0 the average cqs for the samples with detections were 33 8 1 4 for n1 35 1 1 6 for n2 35 2 1 1 for e sarbeco and 33 3 1 8 for orf1a similar inconsistency in assay results has been reported by ahmed et al 2020 in australia medema et al 2020 in the netherlands and nemudryi et al 2020 in montana on the other hand wu et al 2020b observed relatively consistent detections of n1 n2 and n3 in massachusetts and green et al 2020 observed consistent detections for all quantifiable samples in upstate new york one study noted that inconsistency across assays might result from increasing prevalence of genetic variants penarrubia et al 2020 but similar to ahmed et al 2020 many positive samples in the current study were near the lods and loqs for the respective assays which may have resulted in variability between gene targets with differing sensitivities there were no detections during the first week of march but there was a detection of n1 at facility 1 on march 9th which is consistent with the first confirmed clinical case in the local community both peccia et al 2020 and medema et al 2020 detected sars cov 2 rna in wastewater prior to confirmed cases in several communities with four sars cov 2 assays and duplicate reactions for each assay there were a total of eight qpcr reactions for each sample only several samples were positive for multiple assays and many samples were positive for only one qpcr replicate for a given assay therefore the number of positive reactions was used as a semi quantitative indication of the strength of the sars cov 2 genetic signal for facility 1 the peak signal occurred on april 13th when 4 assays and 6 of 8 total reactions were positive several samples between march 30th and april 27th had at least 3 positive assays and 4 of 8 positive reactions this semi quantitative peak was somewhat consistent with the clinical peak in fig 2 facility 2 never exceeded 2 positive assays and or reactions with the peak occurring sometime between april 13th and april 27th therefore there was some temporal consistency in the data from facilities 1 and 2 and the fact that the genetic signal was seemingly stronger at facility 1 is consistent with the clinical data for each service area as of may 31st the relative prevalence in the service area for facility 2 was 0 22 based on confirmed cases while the relative prevalence in the immediate area surrounding facility 1 was 0 40 on average and as high as 0 65 in one area fig s3 snhd 2020 with respect to gene copy gc concentrations there was only one sample from facility 1 that was loq and positive for both qpcr replicates 3 6 104 gc l for n1 on april 27th and one sample from facility 2 1 2 105 gc l for n2 on april 28th multiple samples at facility 1 were quantifiable based on single qpcr replicates while only one additional sample was technically quantifiable at facility 2 in general concentrations at both facilities appeared to fluctuate between 104 and 106 gc l the average pmmov concentration was approximately 4 5 109 gc l at both facilities which is consistent with the literature symonds et al 2018 liquid phase concentrations reported in the peer reviewed ahmed et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 wu et al 2020b and currently non peer reviewed literature green et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 vary by several orders of magnitude as low as 101 gc l in australia to almost 107 gc l in france but it is currently unclear whether that is due to differences in covid 19 incidence prevalence sample processing methods data interpretation e g accounting for virus recovery and or esvs or perhaps a combination of factors the concentrations reported in wu et al 2020b were slightly lower than the current study although confirmed covid 19 prevalence in their massachusetts study area was also an order of magnitude lower at that time that study did not appear to correct for virus recovery and concentrations may have also been impacted by pasteurization prior to analysis for areas with similar clinical prevalence or death rates reported concentrations were either several orders of magnitude lower ahmed et al 2020 relatively consistent green et al 2020 or approximately one order of magnitude higher wurtzer et al 2020 than the observed data in southern nevada as noted in ahmed et al 2020 interlaboratory validation is a critical need for wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 and until that is addressed and more peer reviewed studies are published it will be difficult to reliably compare data across time and location 3 3 incidence prevalence estimates approaches to estimate incidence or prevalence based on wastewater surveillance data have also varied across studies some studies have used a mass balance approach by coupling fecal shedding data from the literature sewershed characteristics and sars cov 2 rna concentrations see eq 1 ahmed et al 2020 wu et al 2020b 1 infections persons s a r s c o v 2 c o n c e n t r a t i o n g c l w a s t e w a t e r f l o w r a t e l d f e c e s p r o d u c t i o n r a t e g p e r s o n d f e c a l s h e d d i n g r a t e g c g with this approach it is important to capture the uncertainty and inherent variability of critical parameters which can be accomplished to some degree with monte carlo simulations ahmed et al 2020 feces production rate is fairly well characterized in the literature with a median of 126 250 g person d depending on location rose et al 2015 wastewater flow rate is also relatively straightforward when using average daily flow for a particular facility although there could be artifacts of sample collection e g influent vs primary effluent and grab vs composite that affect the composition of the sample and how that should be considered in the model at this time the major source of uncertainty is the fecal shedding rate and how that varies over time between individuals e g symptomatic vs asymptomatic and across other demographic factors wölfel et al 2020 provided an initial assessment demonstrating that fecal shedding rate varied by several orders of magnitude for a given person with a maximum shedding rate early in the infection period and then a steady decline over as long as 30 days fig s4 zheng et al 2020 reported similar viral loads in stool samples and a similar shedding duration but did not observe any clear trends over time assuming the wölfel et al 2020 trajectory a simple mass balance approach may not be appropriate for determining overall prevalence within a community particularly for a prolonged outbreak but may provide a reasonable indication of new cases or incidence that might dominate the sars cov 2 wastewater load using the simple mass balance approach we assumed a feces production rate of 126 g person d an initial fecal shedding rate of 108 9 gc g for new cases adapted from wölfel et al 2020 see fig s4 and average sars cov 2 rna concentrations across all assays including estimated concentrations loq from the routine monitoring samples these calculations resulted in estimates of 200 new cases per day for facility 1 and 20 new cases per day for facility 2 which equates to 0 02 0 03 daily relative incidence considering that confirmed daily relative incidence was 0 004 on average in april and may fig 2 the wastewater estimates indicate the ascertainment ratio was approximately 5 8 in southern nevada during this period this is in general agreement with wu et al 2020a which suggested the ascertainment ratio was on the order of 3 20 in the united states early in the pandemic green et al 2020 used ratios of sars cov 2 i e infected fecal load to crassphage i e total fecal load as an indirect estimate of disease prevalence while the current study focused on pmmov to estimate incidence sars cov 2 pmmov ratios in the current study suggested an average of 30 new cases per day for facility 1 across the entire study period i e 0 003 relative incidence with an apparent peak occurring between march 23rd and april 20th for facility 2 the peak ratio occurred on april 14th indicating 15 new cases per day i e 0 025 relative incidence and the remaining data suggested fewer than 2 new cases per day i e 0 003 relative incidence these ratio based estimates appear to align more closely with the confirmed clinical data for southern nevada fig 2 even without adjusting for asymptomatic infections or ascertainment ratio fig 5 illustrates an alternative framework for estimating sars cov 2 concentrations in facility 1 wastewater specifically accounting for the time dependent shedding rate of infected individuals in the underlying model see text s3 the fecal shedding rate followed the trajectory illustrated in fig s4 i e decreasing from a maximum of 108 9 gc g to 1 gc g over 25 days an adaptation of wölfel et al 2020 the number of new cases per day was based on 50 of the clinically confirmed daily cases reported for southern nevada snhd 2020 since facility 1 serves approximately half of the local population but the model also assumed an asymptomatic ratio of 50 day 2020 or an ascertainment ratio of 2 an infected individual was assumed to no longer be shedding once the shedding rate dropped below 1 gc g the sars cov 2 load from all shedding individuals on a given day was divided by the corresponding average daily flow for facility 1 considering that the model predicts concentrations of 102 103 gc l early in the outbreak i e lod for this study and that the first wastewater detection occurred during that time i e march 9th it is unlikely that the confirmed case load accurately represented covid 19 incidence prevalence in the community at that time consistent wastewater detections of sars cov 2 occurred once the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases exceeded 0 001 relative incidence and 0 01 relative prevalence respectively this corresponds with model concentrations of 104 gc l or higher which is consistent with the observed lods for the sars cov 2 assays the strongest observed wastewater signal as determined by the number of positive assays and replicate reactions see fig 4 occurred when the confirmed daily case load and cumulative cases reached 0 01 relative incidence and 0 1 relative prevalence respectively which corresponds with a model concentration of nearly 105 gc l the observed wastewater concentrations were generally in agreement with the model predictions although some samples exhibited high variability between the four molecular targets the model assumes new cases with high shedding rates dominate the sars cov 2 wastewater load which is why the daily case load and modeled concentrations generally mirror each other in fig 5 based on this shedding framework wastewater concentrations of sars cov 2 may be a useful leading indicator of covid 19 when the case load is increasing by orders of magnitude over a short period of time but due to inherent variability in sars cov 2 methods wastewater surveillance may not have sufficient resolution to detect small changes in daily case load for much of the study period observed and predicted wastewater concentrations fluctuated between 104 and 105 gc l because daily relative incidence also fluctuated around 0 01 from late march through the end of may finally the persistence of fecal shedding suggests that clinical data may be better suited to identify the waning portion of the covid 19 epidemiological curve although this could not be demonstrated in the current study because of the consistency in new daily cases through the end of may 4 0 conclusions the covid 19 pandemic highlighted deficiencies in rapidly deploying widespread clinical testing this subsequently raised awareness of wastewater surveillance and its value in detecting the introduction of covid 19 into a community characterizing covid 19 incidence or prevalence and potentially informing policy measures the scientific community rapidly developed methods to initiate wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 throughout the world but the resulting studies often differed in terms of sample collection processing and or analysis thereby making it difficult to compare results and draw broad conclusions this highlights the urgent need for an interlaboratory comparison of sars cov 2 methodology until that is completed the current study provides guidance on certain aspects of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance for example sars cov 2 rna appears to show a diurnal effect in wastewater that might necessitate composite sampling moreover secondary concentration methods may not be necessary and may actually be detrimental for detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in any case understanding the implications of method selection on equivalent sample volume and virus recovery is critical for accurately characterizing sars cov 2 rna concentrations this information can be used to inform future sampling design or to retrospectively compare data from early studies in addition to characterizing concentrations of sars cov 2 genetic markers in a specific community the proposed model from this study highlights the potential significance of new cases i e incidence rather than prevalence in driving wastewater loads the model also suggests that wastewater surveillance might be a valuable leading indicator of covid 19 outbreaks but may be a lagging indicator for declining infection rates due to prolonged viral shedding the value of wastewater surveillance may be partially dependent on the status of clinical testing in a given community e g extent of clinical testing lags additional studies or meta analyses are needed to confirm the methods and assumptions used when comparing wastewater surveillance data to infection incidence or prevalence in particular additional data are needed to verify the assumption in the current study of high shedding early in the infection period nevertheless this study demonstrates that wastewater surveillance can provide a valuable assessment of community health conditions particularly when clinical testing resources are

19974,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are crucial for producing clean effluents from polluting sources such as hospitals industries and municipalities in recent decades many new organic compounds have ended up in surface waters in concentrations that while very low cause chronic toxicity to countless organisms these organic micropollutants omps are usually quite recalcitrant and not sufficiently removed during wastewater treatment microbial degradation plays a pivotal role in omp conversion microorganisms can adapt their metabolism to the use of novel molecules via mutations and rearrangements of existing genes in new clusters many catabolic genes have been found adjacent to mobile genetic elements mges which provide a stable scaffold to host new catabolic pathways and spread these genes in the microbial community these mobile systems could be engineered to enhance omp degradation in wwtps and this review aims to summarize and better understand the role that mges might play in the degradation and wastewater treatment process available data about the presence of catabolic mges in wwtps are reviewed and current methods used to identify and measure mges in environmental samples are critically evaluated finally examples of how these mges could be used to improve micropollutant degradation in wwtps are outlined in the near future advances in the use of mges will hopefully enable us to apply selective augmentation strategies to improve omp conversion in wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords mobile genetic elements plasmids organic micropollutants wastewater treatment plants biodegradation bioaugmentation 1 introduction 1 1 importance of wastewater treatment plants with emphasis on organic micropollutant removal the world health organization estimates that the global water crisis claims approximately 3 5 million lives annually these deaths are mainly caused by diarrheal diseases transmitted via feces contaminated water and could easily be prevented by installing wastewater and drinking water treatment plants in affected areas kumar and tortajada 2020 current biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps in more developed countries are quite effective at removing the main pollutants from water carbon nitrogen and phosphorous however their design is inadequate to remove the thousands of toxic organic compounds present at low concentrations that pose a risk to aquatic life and human health petrie et al 2015 rogowska et al 2020 these compounds are called organic micropollutants omps because their concentrations in water range from nano to micrograms per liter omps are constantly released into the environment from a wide range of activities industry solvents agriculture pesticides herbicides the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare drugs such as antibiotics or hormones and households personal care products the diversity of chemical structures and release sources make omp removal a great challenge for current water technology leading to widespread investment in projects assessing and improving omp removal by wwtps as well as projects developing new quantification and detection methods dopp et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 new technological innovations in wwtps are expected to contribute to reduce the impact of these pollutants and provide surface and groundwaters with minimal or preferably no omps 1 2 microbial degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants in addition to the physical and chemical techniques currently used in wwtps to remove solids and pollutants microorganisms continue to have a central role in wastewater treatment carey and migliaccio 2009 microorganisms remove excess organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous from waste streams wentzel and ekama 1997 but they have not been fully adapted and exploited to remove many omps only a few omps are completely degraded and many others are partially removed gonzalez gil et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 among all biological removal pathways in wwtps biosorption bioaccumulation etc the most promising for omps is biodegradation which takes place through the following mechanisms fig 1 i microorganisms can use omps as carbon and energy sources e g toluene woods et al 2011 and pesticides singh and walker 2006 complete omp removal from water by conversion to co2 gas or assimilation into solid biomass is the best scenario some micropollutants such as heavy metals do not contain carbon to assimilate but microorganisms can still use these molecules as electron acceptors and remove them via precipitation tebo and obraztsova 1998 ii microorganisms can reduce the toxicity of omps by modifying their chemical structures by for example hydrolysis e g antibiotics richmond and sykes 1973 it is important to mention that not all antibiotic resistance genes args encode for proteins that are able to degrade antibiotics for example many efflux pumps are able to provide resistance against toxic compounds without modifying their structures yelin and kishony 2018 iii microorganisms often transform omps in a process called co metabolism e g bisphenol pesticides pharmaceuticals etc fischer and majewsky 2014 co metabolism occurs when omps undergo small structural transformations e g hydroxylation methylation acetylation etc during the consumption of other growth substrates by microorganisms such transformations occur when promiscuous or unspecific enzymes are able to utilize more than one substrate these enzymes are not regulated to be active in the presence of the omp so in the absence of the growth substrate the omp cannot be transformed a previous study observed this in a pure culture of the ammonia oxidizing archaeon nitrososphaera gargensis the pharmaceutical miaserin was only transformed when ammonium was being oxidized men et al 2016 the exact mechanism or enzymes involved in co metabolism are oftentimes unknown although oxygenases are the main candidates under oxic conditions the transformation products formed during co metabolism can be accumulated in the extracellular medium sometimes they are toxic for the cell or be further transformed and utilized by the same or other microorganisms in a synergistic approach arp et al 2001 various enzymes encoded in microbial genomes are good molecular effectors of omp removal such as β lactamase for antibiotic breakdown and acetate kinase for co metabolism richmond and sykes 1973 gonzalez gil et al 2017 genes proteins that are involved in central metabolism are typically encoded on the chromosome while other complementary genes are located on mobile genetic elements mges which are dna sequences encoding for proteins that mediate the movement of dna within or between genomes frost et al 2005 genes encoded by mges may be useful to the organism only under transitory and occasional conditions like the presence of toxic compounds or novel carbon sources tazzyman and bonhoeffer 2014 1 3 importance of mobile genetic elements in bacterial adaptation to organic micropollutants from an evolutionary perspective omps have been recently introduced to the environment so their degrading pathways are still under evolution to make this happen genes from different bacteria are combined in modules with the help of mges van der meer et al 1992 consequently omp degrading genes are usually linked to extrachromosomal and chromosomal mges the stable integration of these genes in the chromosome will occur if omps become the main energy and carbon sources for some bacteria in environments with a constant and high omp concentration tazzyman and bonhoeffer 2014 this is not the current situation in wwtps so mges still play a crucial role in omp biodegradation mges are involved in gene movement between non related microorganisms which is called horizontal gene transfer hgt and is mediated by three main mechanisms conjugation transduction and transformation fig 2 dröge et al 1999 conjugation is performed by cell to cell contact and requires mges such as chromosomally integrated transposons or conjugative plasmids transduction is the process by which foreign dna is introduced into a microbial cell with the help of a viral vector such as a bacteriophage during transformation naturally or artificially prepared competent cells take up free dna from the environment frost et al 2005 the best studied form of hgt is conjugation and the spread of mges harboring args in wwtps and other environments has received extensive attention heuer et al 2012 guo et al 2017 jiao et al 2017 given these characteristics mges may play a relevant role in wwtps where microorganisms are in contact with omps and in close proximity to each other several catabolic mges have been discovered in wwtps and some preliminary studies have succeeded in improving the removal of contaminants by increasing hgt of genes involved in their degradation consequently mges represent a promising tool for engineering the bacterial communities in wwtps towards the biodegradation of omps before such a scenario can be implemented additional insights on the prevalence and role of catabolic mges in wwtps are needed this review summarizes the different omp transforming genes located on mges in wwtps and the tools for analyzing mges in complex environmental samples furthermore attempts to engineer and stimulate conjugation under wwtp conditions are critically reviewed in order to reveal the main limitations that need to be overcome in future treatment methods 2 catabolic mobile genetic elements in wastewater treatment plants many genes responsible for the catabolism of omps in wwtps are located on mges such as plasmids transposons and insertion sequences top and springael 2003 nojiri et al 2004 dunon et al 2018 transposons and insertion sequences can be integrated into the chromosome or jump into plasmids which are extrachromosomal dna fragments that are able to autoreplicate osborn and böltner 2002 some of these mges can be transferred to other cells during conjugation for this process mges use their own conjugative genes self transmissible or hijack the conjugative systems of other elements osborn and böltner 2002 smillie et al 2010 carraro et al 2017 mge mobility produces mutations and rearrangements of genetic material inside microbial cells as a result the associated genes can form new functional clusters and spread rapidly through the bacterial population subsequently providing their hosts with advantages such as resistance to toxic compounds or the ability to exploit alternative carbon sources mges accelerate microbial adaptation to the transformation of new chemicals top and springael 2003 so they might be actively involved in omp removal in wwtps several studies have found similar catabolic gene clusters in phylogenetically unrelated strains isolated from geographically distant soils and wwtps van der meer et al 1992 williams and sayers 1994 ouchiyama et al 1998 shintani et al 2005 for example the upper part of the carbazole degradation pathway from pseudomonas sp isolated from a wwtp in tokyo contains similar genes to other strains isolated from a different wwtp more than a 1000 km away and from farm soil on the other hand the lower part of this pathway degrading catechol is highly similar to the one present in plasmids found all around the world tol plasmid pww0 plasmid nah7 and plasmid pvi150 this shows the way degradation pathways are usually formed by combining genes coming from different microorganisms or genetic backgrounds this can also be proven by the different c g content of plasmids and chromosomes in many microorganisms furthermore a few experiments have measured correlations between mges and the presence of omps in the first part of this section we will list catabolic mges found in wwtps and discuss biases underlying these discoveries in addition studies linking mge abundance to pesticide turnover in agricultural wwtps will be examined and gaps in the knowledge of the contribution of catabolic mges to wastewater treatment will be highlighted 2 1 prevalence of catabolic mobile genetic elements in wastewater treatment plants 2 1 1 conjugation the most studied hgt route in wwtps is plasmid transfer via conjugation plasmids consist of extrachromosomal dna and are able to autoreplicate and sometimes automobilize enzymes involved in the degradation of different pollutants are often encoded on plasmids and thus all of the required genes of the degradation pathway can be transferred together in one hgt event consequently catabolic plasmids are relatively large and mostly low copy number which decreases the energy required to replicate the plasmid top and springael 2003 genes encoding enzymes for degrading man made compounds are usually located on more promiscuous plasmids meaning their host range is phylogenetically wider incompatibility group incp 1 plasmids than genes encoding enzymes that degrade naturally occurring organic compounds incompatibility group plasmids incp 2 incp 9 nojiri et al 2004 therefore incp 1 plasmids might efficiently harbor and distribute genes for the degradation of new pollutants plasmids in the same incompatibility groups are not able to coexist together in a cell because they usually compete for the same replication factors although wwtps often contain many omps a plasmid metagenomic study suggested that incp 1 plasmids occur less frequently than other plasmid types such as incf in wwtps schlüter et al 2008 moreover the majority of plasmids seemed to be non self transmissible so incp 1 plasmids might act as helping vectors by assisting the transfer of other non conjugative plasmids mges such as transposons or insertion sequences can also be found on plasmids these mges are able to shuffle genes in the chromosome and thus help create novel catabolic pathways when they are further combined with promiscuous plasmids they represent a very efficient vector to spread new catabolic capabilities ma et al 2007 bahl et al 2009 is1071 and is6100 are the most frequent insertion sequences associated with omp degradation kato et al 1994 sota et al 2006 gai et al 2010 takeo et al 2012 dunon et al 2013 martini et al 2015 these insertion sequences are found in many catabolic plasmids such as ptsa and pcnb1 flanking degradation genes and form transposon modules in which the whole dna sequence included between the insertion sequences is transferred as a unit thus insertion sequences provide a solid structure for efficient recruitment of catabolic genes to plasmids and dissemination of these genes among bacteria table 1 lists several catabolic plasmids found in wwtps across the world these plasmids mostly belong to the incp 1β incompatibility group are conjugative and are approximately 60 100 kb although incp 1 plasmids appear to be the most abundant plasmids containing omp degrading genes in wwtps they are overall less abundant than other plasmid types based on a previous metagenome analysis schlüter et al 2008 most bacteria containing incp 1 plasmids are affiliated with the order burkholderiales of the class betaproteobacteria a metabolically highly diverse group that plays a significant role in nitrogen and carbon removal in wwtps due to their capability of heterotrophic denitrification zielińska et al 2016 fan et al 2017 burkholderiales are also known to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds because of the large variety of oxygenase enzymes they encode perez pantoja et al 2012 pereira et al 2014 furthermore some members of this order are opportunistic pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics bilgin et al 2015 this creates controversy when using omp degrading microorganisms in bioaugmentation strategies each catabolic plasmid confers novel degradation properties to its host many are able to use different halogenated and aromatic compounds as carbon and energy sources several transposons and insertion sequences have been linked to these catabolic genes but by far the most abundant in culture based studies is is1071 one drawback of the data in table 1 is that most of it comes from culture dependent methods thus the results might not represent the actual situation in wwtps due to the great plate count anomaly in which only a fraction of the true microbial diversity can be captured harwani 2013 culture independent methods provide a more comprehensive characterization of the catabolic mges diversity in wwtps however culture dependent methods cannot be totally substituted since they are necessary to study the function of the highly abundant unannotated genes linked to mges the last three plasmids in table 1 were found in a metagenomic study however wwtps samples in that study were first cultivated with several antibiotics and then all plasmids the plasmidome from the resistant community were sequenced plasmid replication proteins of catabolic plasmids patc58 and pl6 5 were identified the transposon tnpab previously associated with pcar1 was also observed schlüter et al 2008 another metagenomic analysis performed on activated sludge from two wwtps in hong kong identified genes for several omp degrading enzymes fang et al 2013 up to 40 of these genes were encoded on plasmids in that study activated sludge samples were not precultured thus providing a more realistic picture of catabolic mges in wwtps biased only by dna extraction and bioinformatic methods several metagenome analyses of wwtps have specifically looked for mges transferring args due to the emergent risk they pose to human health li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 che et al 2019 pazda et al 2019 however the link between mges and genes encoding omp degrading enzymes in metagenomes has not attracted the same attention and only few studies investigated this see previous paragraph fang et al 2013 this might be due to the incompleteness of the respective gene databases eawag bbd http eawag bbd ethz ch is the most up to date database to study microbial degradation of omps ellis and wackett 2012 but many genes encoding omp degrading enzymes are still not known or may not even have evolved yet furthermore identifying mges and the genes associated with them in environmental samples is still a challenge as will be further discussed in the methods section 2 1 2 transduction transduction is often considered the most efficient way of hgt between different biomes it does not require physical contact between bacteria in contrast to conjugation and phage particles protect the dna from degradation in contrast to transformation furthermore transduction occurs in a wide range of bacteria at higher frequencies than previously thought any kind of bacterial dna can be packed inside a bacteriophage capsid including chromosomal fragments and mges such as plasmids transposons or insertion sequences fig 2 muniesa et al 2011 this can happen by two different mechanisms generalized and specialized transduction during the first one the virus hydrolyses the host cell dna and any fragment is able to be incorporated into the virus capsid when the virus infects a different cell the non viral dna undergoes homologous recombination forming a recombinant cell in specialized transduction the viral genome gets integrated into the host cell genome during excision it sometimes takes the cell s genes flanking the virus integrated site thus only those genes adjacent to the integration site are able to be transferred to a different cell the size of dna fragments that can be packed inside a bacteriophage particle is limited by the capsid size with an average size of 50 kb and maximum size of 100 kb muniesa et al 2013 the study of viral communities in wwtps has been limited due to the low percentage of host bacteria that can be cultured in the laboratory however recent advances in high throughput sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to sequence the whole viral metagenome in several samples edwards and rohwer 2005 pérez losada et al 2020 genes identified in the phage metagenomes of several wwtps and other environments such as the mouse gut include args and 16s rrna genes from firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria parsley et al 2010a b del casale et al 2011 modi et al 2013 interestingly nitrospira and planctomycetes genes were not found in the clones of a wwtp phage metagenome suggesting that these phyla are not highly involved in transduction del casale et al 2011 omp degrading genes have not been extensively explored in bacteriophage communities in soil with prior pesticide exposure a chlorohydrolase gene responsible for the dehalogenation of atrazine was found in the viral metagenome ghosh et al 2008 in addition the phage metagenome from an activated sludge sample was sequenced and subsequently analyzed to determine the functions of the different open reading frames orfs or protein coding genes parsley et al 2010b the most abundant subsystem was related to the metabolism of macromolecules such as carbohydrates proteins and amino acids and lipids furthermore 5 of the orfs were related to aromatic compound metabolism approaches similar to those used to identify args inside viral particles in wwtps parsley et al 2010a b muniesa et al 2011 could be adopted to find specific omp degrading functions in future work 2 1 3 transformation naturally competent bacterial cells can gain new functions by taking up extracellular dna exdna this kind of dna is released to the environment via two main mechanisms bacterial cell lysis and active secretion cell lysis can be the result of a bacteriophage infection autolysins or reactive oxygen species active secretion of dna is usually performed by the type iv secretion apparatus although vesicle mediated exdna delivery has also been demonstrated in some microorganisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae sarkar 2020 wang et al 2020a apart from its role in hgt exdna has a structural function in microbial aggregates such as biofilms and small sized aerobic granular sludge this has been proven by adding exogenous dnases and observing bacterial detachment and disruption of biofilms and small aerobic granules jakubovics et al 2013 wang et al 2020b furthermore adsorbed dna is transformed at higher rates than free dna making bacterial aggregates a good spot for transformation due to the high amounts of extracellular material where dna can be attached dong et al 2019 several studies of exdna in wwtps have shown the high abundance of extracellular mges 65 of the exdna calderón franco et al 2020 and the presence of several args dong et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 however nothing is currently known about the omp degrading genes present in exdna in wwtps natural transformation is known to be a driving force of evolution and it is logical to think that it plays a role in the creation of novel degradative pathways for that reason new studies looking for omp degrading genes in exdna from wwtps are needed 2 2 correlation between mobile genetic elements and organic micropollutants abundance only a few studies have attempted to elucidate the direct contribution of catabolic mges to omp removal during wastewater treatment these studies have been performed in on farm biopurification systems bpss installations that treat pesticide contaminated wastewater on farms one study compared pesticide treated and non treated soils and bpss by measuring the abundance of incp 1 plasmids and is1071 insertion sequences dunon et al 2013 the authors subsequently sequenced the accessory genes between two is1071 sequences dunon et al 2018 interestingly they observed a correlation between pesticide exposure and incp 1 is1071 abundance and were able to identify several biodegradation genes flanked by is1071 sequences this demonstrates the importance of incp 1 plasmids and is1071 in bacterial community adaptation to pesticides a different study monitored the abundance of different types of mges and the concentrations of different pesticides in a bps for an entire year dealtry et al 2014 they observed a correlation between the presence of the analyzed omps and the abundance of incp 1β plasmids and inti2 elements another kind of mge able to capture express and spread genes these results also point towards a role of specific mges in microbial adaptation and subsequent pesticide degradation in bpss these catabolic mges might also have the potential to facilitate omp degradation in urban wwtps but new studies of catabolic mge function and dynamics in wwtps are needed 3 methods for mobile genetic elements analysis in environmental samples studies providing an overview of catabolic mges in wwtps are scarce most likely due to the lack of knowledge in current degradative gene databases and technical limitations wwtp samples consist of complex microbial communities and a large variety of organic matter which can interfere with protocols for analyzing mges various strategies can be applied to obtain information about mges together with their associated genes in wwtps fig 3 table 2 and the choice mainly depends on the study goals each method has different biases in terms of plasmid sizes traits or hosts and knowing the advantages and limitations of each method is of great importance for achieving the specific research goal table 2 box 1 the majority of studies investigating catabolic plasmids in wwtps have used culture dependent methods targeting the degradation of a specific compound table 1 this approach consists of plating an environmental sample onto a selective medium to isolate cells and or mges with desired characteristics e g antibiotic resistance or crystal violet degradation schlüter et al 2007 2008 plasmids or other mges present in the genomes of the cultured community members can subsequently be analyzed by different molecular techniques pcr hybridization sequencing and linked to specific bacterial strains or associated genes however if the aim is to obtain a representation of all catabolic mges present in the wwtp this approach would not be ideal because only a small proportion of the wwtp microbial community can be cultured harwani 2013 to obtain a more representative overview of mge abundance and omp degradation in wwtps culture independent methods might be more appropriate exogenous plasmid isolation permits the identification of transferable plasmids in a sample without cultivation of the original plasmid host dröge et al 1999 smalla et al 2015 in this method bacterial communities in the sample are mixed with recipient cells to allow dna transfer the mixture of cells is then resuspended on selective media to isolate the recipient cells that have obtained the target capacity the cells can also be plated on rich media to identify all transferred plasmids in this approach only mobilizable plasmids compatible with the selected recipient are characterized one shortcoming is that it is not possible to identify the original plasmid host a less biased approach consists of total dna isolation from a sample and direct sequencing of the isolated dna however mges such as plasmids and viruses are very difficult to reconstruct and identify in metagenomic analyses because they possess long repetitive zones especially large plasmids arredondo alonso et al 2017 many bioinformatic tools have been recently developed to overcome this challenge in short read sequencing examples of them are plasmidfinder cbar placnet meta plasmidspades recycler plasflow mob suite mlplasmids plascope gplas plasclass plasgun scapp metaviralspades zhou and xu 2010 carattoli et al 2014 rozov et al 2017 vielva et al 2017 arredondo alonso et al 2018 arredondo alonso et al 2020 krawczyk et al 2018 robertson and nash 2018 royer et al 2018 antipov et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2020 pellow et al 2020a b pellow et al 2020 2020 these tools identify plasmids and viruses in metagenomic samples or bacterial isolates in a variety of ways ranging from the simpler approach of blasting against a plasmid database plasmidfinder mob suite to the use of more complex deep neural networks cbar plasflow moreover algorithms such as recycler metaplasmidspades metaviralspades and scapp use the assembly graphs to identify regions of different coverage which are the mges another option to further improve plasmid identification is long read sequencing technologies such as oxford nanopore or pacbio technologies rhoads and au 2015 jain et al 2016 however short read sequencing is still used in combination with long read sequencing in order to correct the sequence errors of the latter technique amarasinghe et al 2020 sequencing has also been used in combination to other methods in order to overcome the assembly challenge of long repetitive dna areas linked reads optical mapping and proximity ligation technologies the linked read strategy barcodes all small sequences coming from the same long sequence and then accurate short read sequencing is performed ott et al 2018 in optical mapping long dna molecules are fluorescently labelled at specific sequences and stretched in order to determine the distances between labels with a fluorescence microscope it has low resolution so it is better used in combination with short read sequencing too michaeli and ebenstein 2012 finally proximity ligation technologies such as hi c use the information of physical dna interactions inside the cell to help assemble mges van berkum et al 2010 instead of sequencing total dna many studies have tried to enrich plasmids or viral particles before sequencing all plasmids in a microbial community sample can be separated from chromosomal dna by alkaline lysis followed by size dependent dna separation methods such as ultracentrifugation e g cscl or column based binding assays commercial kit sentchilo et al 2013 smalla et al 2015 plasmid safe dnase treatment can also be used to further purify circular plasmids the purified dna can then be directly sequenced or first amplified to ensure sufficient plasmid dna for sequencing the most common method to amplify plasmids is multiple displacement amplification mda which uses ϕ29 dna polymerase an enzyme that amplifies unspecific dna fragments greater than 70 kb and possesses high fidelity and proofreading activity blanco et al 1989 an alternative is the transposon aided capture traca method which consists of tagging the previously isolated plasmids with a transposon that contains a selectable marker kanamycin resistance and the escherichia coli origin of replication oriv subsequent transformation of e coli with these tagged plasmids permits amplification and sequencing jones and marchesi 2007 viral particles can also be separated from bacterial cells by cscl gradient centrifugation although previous steps such as filtration or precipitation might be necessary to enrich the viral particles in the sample dna or rna is then extracted amplified if necessary and sequenced thurber et al 2009 all of these culture independent methods have a common disadvantage the in situ bacterial host of the plasmid remains unknown several technologies have recently been developed to attempt to solve this problem i epic pcr can link functional genes e g a plasmid replicase with phylogenetic markers in uncultured single cells spencer et al 2016 ii single cell genomic sequencing sic seq captures the whole genome information of a single cell including plasmids and associated viruses doud and woyke 2017 this method can use droplet microfluidics optical tweezers or flow sorting to obtain single cells zhang and liu 2008 rinke et al 2014 lan et al 2017 iii hi c technology analyses the 3d folding of genomes cells are first fixed with formaldehyde to attach interacting loci by covalent dna protein bonds including interactions of a plasmid with specific parts of the chromosome the modified dna is then fragmented by a restriction enzyme and sequenced after other intermediate steps van berkum et al 2010 as a result all the chromosomal reads from a specific taxonomic group are binned together including the plasmids attached to those chromosomal fragments burton et al 2014 stalder et al 2019 vi single molecule real time smrt sequencing from pacbio technologies not only determines the sequence of nucleotides but also predicts the methylation of nucleotides this information is later used to perform a more accurate binning or clustering of contigs belonging to the same taxon furthermore it can link plasmids and other mges to their host beaulaurier et al 2018 v identifying mges integrated inside bacterial genomes can also help linking them to specific taxa in the binning process during metagenomic analysis when a mge enters a bacterial cell fragments of it are integrated into the genome as spacers of repetitive sequences called clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats crispr thus it is possible to derive the viruses that have infected a specific host shkoporov et al 2019 obtaining high quality and high yields of exdna is challenging due to its low concentration in wastewater furthermore avoiding cell lysis during exdna isolation protocols is often unchecked and difficult to achieve however throughout the past years new methods have been developed for exdna analysis from water and soil samples nagler et al 2018 the most recent techniques applied to wastewater are the use of magnetic beads and chromatography to purify exdna after filtration of the sample yuan et al 2019 calderón franco et al 2020 the first method added magnetic beads to 5 ml of sample filtrate to bind the exdna after washing the beads to remove impurities exdna was eluted for further analysis this method gave better exdna yields per sample volume and quality than previous methods such as alcohol precipitation surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab precipitation and dna extraction kits however the authors did not check for cell lysis during the protocol even though sample vortexing was applied the second method used higher amounts of sample 1000 ml and passed it through an anion exchange chromatography column the eluted exdna was tracked with a uv vis absorbance detector and further precipitated and treated with proteinase k the exdna yield per volume sample was lower compared to the magnetic beads method but still good for further molecular and sequencing analysis cell lysis was monitored by live dead staining and flow cytometry analysis fortunately no cell disruption was observed after centrifugation or filtration a recent review described in detail many of the above methods for de novo mge identification carr et al 2020 in addition another study compared some of the above culture dependent and culture independent techniques in the analysis of broiler cecal samples delaney et al 2018 to determine which method provided the largest variety of antibiotic resistance plasmids capable of expression in a human pathogenic strain of escherichia coli the results showed that single commercial kits or alkaline lysis were not effective at obtaining intact plasmids using the traca method only a few plasmids were extracted although mda gave the best results this technique was not as consistent as exogenous plasmid isolation thus the authors recommended using this last technique in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of antibiotic resistance plasmids from a complex sample this study lacked many of the novel methods described in this review for that reason a detailed description of advantages and disadvantages of each method is written in box 1 and table 2 if the objective is to study the function of specific mges culture based methods are needed in order to grow the bacterial cells in the laboratory however if the objective is to identify new mges or study the full diversity of mges in a specific environment culture independent methods are needed the best approach would be the combination of short read sequencing for accuracy and other technologies such as smrt or hi c for a correct mge assembly and linkage to host cells single cell sequencing can provide further resolution by distinguishing very closely related bacteria however obtaining single cells from biofilms granules or flocs requires extra optimization of the technique 4 transfer of catabolic genes as a bioaugmentation strategy in wastewater treatment plants traditional bioaugmentation consists of adding omp degrading microorganisms to contaminated sites where the indigenous microorganisms do not possess or express the ability to degrade the pollutants singer et al 2005 although this method has shown success repeated addition of microorganisms is often needed due to the poor survival and activity of the inoculum gilbert and crowley 1998 a promising alternative to relying on the survival and activity of the inoculum is to spread degradative genes among the indigenous community as mges are natural vehicles for the rapid dissemination of genes among complex microbial communities they have been used to accelerate the bioremediation of toxic compounds in various environments such as polluted soils and waters top et al 2002 catabolic mges have been successfully introduced into different wwtp systems in order to enhance the biodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds see references in table 3 however ensuring the spread and persistence of these degradative genes is usually a great challenge in the following sections different a biotic factors contributing to mge transfer and persistence in wwtps will be examined moreover several mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies in wwtps will be explained and their limitations and risks will be discussed 4 1 conditions affecting conjugative gene bioaugmentation in wastewater treatment plants selecting a successful gene augmentation strategy in complex microbial ecosystems such as wwtps depends on finding a proper match among the bacterial donor strain competent environmental recipients the mge carrying the gene s of interest and the a biotic conditions in the wwtp reactors only conjugative gene transfer has been reported to be effective thus far conjugation occurs more efficiently when high numbers of donor and recipient strains are in close contact through mating aggregates ravatn et al 1998 these aggregates are structures that contain physically bound cells exchanging dna material in wwtps mating aggregates can be granules or colonizable surfaces where microorganisms can form biofilms the suitability of flocs for mating is questionable due to their porous nature as the biomass density in water increases so does the probability of conjugation events no study has attempted to introduce genes into the environment using viral vectors as in human gene therapy bramson et al 1995 one reason is the presumed high specificity of bacteriophages for bacterial infection which might reduce the usefulness of transduction for gene exchange among distantly related bacteria dröge et al 1999 however recent studies suggest that phages with broad host ranges are very common in nature de jonge et al 2019 supporting the potential of bacteriophages for developing new gene augmentation strategies in wwtps one factor determining the effectiveness of conjugative gene transfer is the initial stability and growth of the donor strain the establishment of the donor strain in the wwtp microbial community is not a requirement for transfer of the catabolic mge but high initial numbers of donor bacteria increase the chances of gene transfer ravatn et al 1998 the best approach is to select indigenous bacteria as donor cells because they are already adapted to the physical chemical and biological conditions of the polluted environment mcclure et al 1991 however this might be a challenge as environmental bacteria are often difficult to genetically modify or grow in the lab moreover for obvious reasons donor strains should not be pathogenic the suitability of the donor bacteria also depends on the a biotic conditions in the wwtps donor cells must be able to survive at the temperature oxygen concentration ph and other parameters present in the activated sludge basins merlin et al 2011 furthermore they must successfully compete with indigenous microorganisms and avoid predation by protozoa and bacteriophages dröge et al 1999 mrozik and piotrowska seget 2010 fulfilling these criteria will guarantee the initial stable cell number necessary to achieve effective gene transfer once the donor cells are stably introduced the transfer of catabolic genes to other recipient bacteria can be initiated many biotic and abiotic variables have an effect on conjugation efficiency and should be considered when designing mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies dröge et al 1999 one important factor is the type of mge chosen for catabolic gene dissemination in aqueous environments dna transfer through plasmids encoding flexible pili is more effective furthermore broad spectrum plasmids are better vectors for spreading the associated genes among the microbial community even to distantly related bacteria environmental or abiotic factors such as temperature and the presence of toxic compounds also affect conjugation dröge et al 1999 in fact subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics heavy metals disinfectants or other organic compounds can stimulate the transfer of args via several mges including transformation merlin et al 2011 jiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020c when genes for the degradation of toxic compounds are horizontally transferred the metabolic reactions they encode must function in biochemical and regulatory environments that they did not coevolve with consequently post transfer genetic refinement of the recipient cell may be necessary in a previous study researchers introduced the gene for dichloromethane dcm degradation in methylobacterium strains that had not been previously exposed to the contaminant they observed that the new recombinant strains had difficulty growing on dcm and they hypothesized that the toxic by products generated from dcm breakdown were responsible michener et al 2014a b in a subsequent experiment they proved that adaptation to growth on dcm involved mutations that increased chloride excretion from the cell furthermore they constructed a new mge containing both a dcm degradation pathway and a chloride exporter and achieved successful dcm degradation in recombinant bacteria michener et al 2014a b these results demonstrate the importance of understanding microbial adaptation to omp degradation in order to design a proper catabolic mge de lorenzo et al 2015 once the desired genes are successfully spread among indigenous bacteria and are functional the ultimate goal is to make these genes persist in wwtps and thus achieve a constant omp degradation rate selective pressure such as omp presence is the key factor controlling the persistence of plasmid bearing bacteria as long as the plasmid bearing bacteria have a fitness advantage compared to plasmid free bacteria the catabolic mges will persist one example of a clear advantage for donors and plasmid bearing bacteria is when all carbon and nitrogen have been removed and omps prevail in wwtp settling tanks a previous study demonstrated that the selection and growth of donor and transconjugant cells were dependent on the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of the specific substrate ravatn et al 1998 to predict the long term dynamics of catabolic plasmids in a polluted environment a mathematical model was developed that considered the negative feedback between plasmid spread and selective advantage when catabolic genes are highly spread the omp concentration will decrease faster thereby lowering the selective advantage of plasmid bearing bacteria miki et al 2007 thus in order to achieve long term omp degradation it is necessary to find the right plasmid spread efficiency in order to maintain constant low pollutant concentrations as the degrading microbial community remains more stable when omp degradation occurs slowly 4 2 cases of gene bioaugmentation under wastewater treatment plants conditions the increasing sensitivity of mass spectrometry detection methods is constantly revealing new emerging contaminants in wwtps although catabolic mges are known to play a relevant role in adaptation to such new toxic compounds few studies have successfully used mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies to increase their biodegradation in wwtps table 3 in this section past attempts using conjugation to spread degradative genes under wwtp settings are evaluated and their limitations and risks are discussed the pollutants used in these experiments table 3 were industrial compounds such as chlorobenzoic acid the herbicide 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d and pesticides all were investigated at concentrations of mg l although they often appear in the range of ng l to μg l except for industrial wwtps where concentrations can be higher this suggests an important question do these low concentrations elicit sufficient selective pressure to achieve successful gene augmentation solutions in urban wwtps furthermore many experiments were performed using the pollutant as the sole carbon source one study observed that biodegradation of 2 4 d was higher when it was the only carbon source than when other more easily degradable carbon sources were present probably because of catabolite repression quan et al 2011 these experimental designs outline the need for more realistic pollutant concentrations and influent compositions in test bioreactors the most commonly used donor strain was pseudomonas putida table 3 probably due to the availability of molecular tools for genetic engineering of this microorganism and its presence as an environmental bacterium in wwtps and soils around the globe nikel et al 2016 in more recent studies comamonas testosteroni escherichia coli and rhodococcus sp were also applied bathe et al 2009 tsutsui et al 2010 ren et al 2018 different mges were used mainly plasmids most were self transmissible and had broad host ranges thus resulting in successful transfer of catabolic genes among the studied community usually in activated sludge in some cases the donor strain disappeared within a few days after application however this did not hamper the success of the bioaugmentation because the catabolic mge had successfully been transferred to indigenous bacteria persisting in the environment in many of the studies in table 3 fluorescent proteins were used to label the donor strain and the mge with different colors green fluorescent protein and dsred the use of these genetic markers with confocal laser scanning microscopy provides an effective and rapid way to visually determine if gene transfer to indigenous bacteria has occurred and if donor bacteria are still present nancharaiah et al 2008 venkata mohan et al 2009 quan et al 2010 2011 many of the studies in table 3 were successful in improving pollutant degradation by gene augmentation according to three criteria i increased degradation of the compound compared to non bioaugmented microcosms or bioreactors ii transfer of the catabolic mge to indigenous bacteria and iii decreased donor strain abundance after some time this success clearly supports the potential of gene augmentation to overcome the donor strain survival problem of traditional bioaugmentation all of the experiments in table 3 with promising results were performed in lab scale reactors or microcosms mimicking activated sludge conditions the only gene augmentation trial in a pilot reactor failed venkata mohan et al 2009 which indicates that unknown challenges in the scale up of gene bioaugmentation strategies remain and suggests the need for more experiments in on site reactors at wwtps nzila et al 2016 in order to choose the right donor and mge more knowledge is needed about which catabolic mges are being transferred in wwtps and which bacteria are involved in the process furthermore whether concentrations in the range of ng l and ug l are sufficient to create a selection pressure for omp degrading bacteria needs to be tested new contaminants such as diclofenac have been included in watch lists all around the world carvalho et al 2015 so bioaugmentation experiments with these compounds are also needed in general more settings that realistically mimic wwtps are required to optimize conjugation as a realistic solution furthermore new technologies such as viral transfer also hold promise the application and generation of genetically engineered microorganisms gems in open contaminated sites such as soils or wwtps remains controversial the societal concerns towards gene bioaugmentation strategies are related to the unknown consequences of microorganisms with new functions in an open environment trump et al 2020 first these microorganisms can be spread to other environments with unforeseeable effects second the enhanced transfer of catabolic genes can also increase the mobilization of args a careful assessment of the risk benefit ratio is essential to coherent decision making on the one hand a clear benefit decreasing omp discharge and thus decreasing ecotoxicity in superficial and ground waters can be obtained on the other hand new studies assessing gene bioaugmentation risks such as the transfer of args have to be performed since self transferable mges are preferred in gene augmentation strategies they might act as mobilizing agents of other mges containing args past bioremediation strategies in contaminated waters or soils tried to control gems by inserting suicidal genes that kill them after the contaminant disappeared molin 1993 however this is contrary to bioaugmentation in wwtps since the contaminant concentrations fluctuates and the objective is to keep the transformed community stable other genetic safeguards restrict the gems to defined environments or prevent hgt to environmental bacteria asin garcia et al 2020 since gene augmentation strategies rely on hgt the only option is to contain gems in the wwtps bioreactors however it seems quite difficult to find a way of containing all new transformants inside the wwtp in conclusion risk assessment studies are necessary in order to identify associated spreading of genes such as args and to detect gems esscaping from wwtps in this way new safeguards strategies can be added to diminish the specific risks 5 concluding remarks microorganisms have been in contact with omps for a relatively short period on an evolutionary time scale so the metabolic pathways are still being developed during the adaptation process mges provide reliable scaffolds for clustering the genes responsible for omp degradation and spreading them among bacterial communities consequently omp degradation genes are often linked to mges in this review we assessed the prevalence detection methods and bioremediation uses of catabolic mges in wwtps 1 the majority of catabolic mges found in wwtps are conjugative incp 1 plasmids and is1071 insertion sequences affiliated with burkholderiales bacteria however this information is biased because many of these studies used culture based methods to obtain a realistic overview of the catabolic mges with the greatest ecological relevance in wwtps it is necessary to move towards cultivation independent methods with the potential for sequencing all mges and associated genes present in environmental samples 2 there are three main challenges for a thorough study of mobile degradative genes via cultivation independent methods i the complexity of mges assembly from a metagenomic sample because of the long repetitive sequences ii the lack of knowledge of genes encoding enzymes for omp biodegradation and iii the difficulty in identifying the host microorganisms so far the combination of short read sequencing for high sequence accuracy and smrt or hi c for better assembly and host cell prediction provides the best option to get a comprehensive representation of mges in environmental samples in addition more functional analyses are needed to discover new biodegradation genes 3 mges can be used to spread degradative capabilities in wwtps thus overcoming the main limitation of traditional cell bioaugmentation the low survival of the inoculum several studies have successfully implemented this technique in lab scale reactors and activated sludge microcosms however gene augmentation failed when scaling up to a pilot reactor furthermore the omp concentration in these experiments was mg l whereas concentrations of ng l and ug l are typically found in the influent of urban wwtps for these reasons further research is needed using more realistic scenarios including pilot wwtp reactors and lower concentrations of omps risk assessment studies looking at the fate of transformants and the spread of args are also necessary hopefully solving these issues will lead to a safe cost effective and eco friendly technology that enhances omp removal in wwtps

19974,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are crucial for producing clean effluents from polluting sources such as hospitals industries and municipalities in recent decades many new organic compounds have ended up in surface waters in concentrations that while very low cause chronic toxicity to countless organisms these organic micropollutants omps are usually quite recalcitrant and not sufficiently removed during wastewater treatment microbial degradation plays a pivotal role in omp conversion microorganisms can adapt their metabolism to the use of novel molecules via mutations and rearrangements of existing genes in new clusters many catabolic genes have been found adjacent to mobile genetic elements mges which provide a stable scaffold to host new catabolic pathways and spread these genes in the microbial community these mobile systems could be engineered to enhance omp degradation in wwtps and this review aims to summarize and better understand the role that mges might play in the degradation and wastewater treatment process available data about the presence of catabolic mges in wwtps are reviewed and current methods used to identify and measure mges in environmental samples are critically evaluated finally examples of how these mges could be used to improve micropollutant degradation in wwtps are outlined in the near future advances in the use of mges will hopefully enable us to apply selective augmentation strategies to improve omp conversion in wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords mobile genetic elements plasmids organic micropollutants wastewater treatment plants biodegradation bioaugmentation 1 introduction 1 1 importance of wastewater treatment plants with emphasis on organic micropollutant removal the world health organization estimates that the global water crisis claims approximately 3 5 million lives annually these deaths are mainly caused by diarrheal diseases transmitted via feces contaminated water and could easily be prevented by installing wastewater and drinking water treatment plants in affected areas kumar and tortajada 2020 current biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps in more developed countries are quite effective at removing the main pollutants from water carbon nitrogen and phosphorous however their design is inadequate to remove the thousands of toxic organic compounds present at low concentrations that pose a risk to aquatic life and human health petrie et al 2015 rogowska et al 2020 these compounds are called organic micropollutants omps because their concentrations in water range from nano to micrograms per liter omps are constantly released into the environment from a wide range of activities industry solvents agriculture pesticides herbicides the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare drugs such as antibiotics or hormones and households personal care products the diversity of chemical structures and release sources make omp removal a great challenge for current water technology leading to widespread investment in projects assessing and improving omp removal by wwtps as well as projects developing new quantification and detection methods dopp et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 new technological innovations in wwtps are expected to contribute to reduce the impact of these pollutants and provide surface and groundwaters with minimal or preferably no omps 1 2 microbial degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants in addition to the physical and chemical techniques currently used in wwtps to remove solids and pollutants microorganisms continue to have a central role in wastewater treatment carey and migliaccio 2009 microorganisms remove excess organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous from waste streams wentzel and ekama 1997 but they have not been fully adapted and exploited to remove many omps only a few omps are completely degraded and many others are partially removed gonzalez gil et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 among all biological removal pathways in wwtps biosorption bioaccumulation etc the most promising for omps is biodegradation which takes place through the following mechanisms fig 1 i microorganisms can use omps as carbon and energy sources e g toluene woods et al 2011 and pesticides singh and walker 2006 complete omp removal from water by conversion to co2 gas or assimilation into solid biomass is the best scenario some micropollutants such as heavy metals do not contain carbon to assimilate but microorganisms can still use these molecules as electron acceptors and remove them via precipitation tebo and obraztsova 1998 ii microorganisms can reduce the toxicity of omps by modifying their chemical structures by for example hydrolysis e g antibiotics richmond and sykes 1973 it is important to mention that not all antibiotic resistance genes args encode for proteins that are able to degrade antibiotics for example many efflux pumps are able to provide resistance against toxic compounds without modifying their structures yelin and kishony 2018 iii microorganisms often transform omps in a process called co metabolism e g bisphenol pesticides pharmaceuticals etc fischer and majewsky 2014 co metabolism occurs when omps undergo small structural transformations e g hydroxylation methylation acetylation etc during the consumption of other growth substrates by microorganisms such transformations occur when promiscuous or unspecific enzymes are able to utilize more than one substrate these enzymes are not regulated to be active in the presence of the omp so in the absence of the growth substrate the omp cannot be transformed a previous study observed this in a pure culture of the ammonia oxidizing archaeon nitrososphaera gargensis the pharmaceutical miaserin was only transformed when ammonium was being oxidized men et al 2016 the exact mechanism or enzymes involved in co metabolism are oftentimes unknown although oxygenases are the main candidates under oxic conditions the transformation products formed during co metabolism can be accumulated in the extracellular medium sometimes they are toxic for the cell or be further transformed and utilized by the same or other microorganisms in a synergistic approach arp et al 2001 various enzymes encoded in microbial genomes are good molecular effectors of omp removal such as β lactamase for antibiotic breakdown and acetate kinase for co metabolism richmond and sykes 1973 gonzalez gil et al 2017 genes proteins that are involved in central metabolism are typically encoded on the chromosome while other complementary genes are located on mobile genetic elements mges which are dna sequences encoding for proteins that mediate the movement of dna within or between genomes frost et al 2005 genes encoded by mges may be useful to the organism only under transitory and occasional conditions like the presence of toxic compounds or novel carbon sources tazzyman and bonhoeffer 2014 1 3 importance of mobile genetic elements in bacterial adaptation to organic micropollutants from an evolutionary perspective omps have been recently introduced to the environment so their degrading pathways are still under evolution to make this happen genes from different bacteria are combined in modules with the help of mges van der meer et al 1992 consequently omp degrading genes are usually linked to extrachromosomal and chromosomal mges the stable integration of these genes in the chromosome will occur if omps become the main energy and carbon sources for some bacteria in environments with a constant and high omp concentration tazzyman and bonhoeffer 2014 this is not the current situation in wwtps so mges still play a crucial role in omp biodegradation mges are involved in gene movement between non related microorganisms which is called horizontal gene transfer hgt and is mediated by three main mechanisms conjugation transduction and transformation fig 2 dröge et al 1999 conjugation is performed by cell to cell contact and requires mges such as chromosomally integrated transposons or conjugative plasmids transduction is the process by which foreign dna is introduced into a microbial cell with the help of a viral vector such as a bacteriophage during transformation naturally or artificially prepared competent cells take up free dna from the environment frost et al 2005 the best studied form of hgt is conjugation and the spread of mges harboring args in wwtps and other environments has received extensive attention heuer et al 2012 guo et al 2017 jiao et al 2017 given these characteristics mges may play a relevant role in wwtps where microorganisms are in contact with omps and in close proximity to each other several catabolic mges have been discovered in wwtps and some preliminary studies have succeeded in improving the removal of contaminants by increasing hgt of genes involved in their degradation consequently mges represent a promising tool for engineering the bacterial communities in wwtps towards the biodegradation of omps before such a scenario can be implemented additional insights on the prevalence and role of catabolic mges in wwtps are needed this review summarizes the different omp transforming genes located on mges in wwtps and the tools for analyzing mges in complex environmental samples furthermore attempts to engineer and stimulate conjugation under wwtp conditions are critically reviewed in order to reveal the main limitations that need to be overcome in future treatment methods 2 catabolic mobile genetic elements in wastewater treatment plants many genes responsible for the catabolism of omps in wwtps are located on mges such as plasmids transposons and insertion sequences top and springael 2003 nojiri et al 2004 dunon et al 2018 transposons and insertion sequences can be integrated into the chromosome or jump into plasmids which are extrachromosomal dna fragments that are able to autoreplicate osborn and böltner 2002 some of these mges can be transferred to other cells during conjugation for this process mges use their own conjugative genes self transmissible or hijack the conjugative systems of other elements osborn and böltner 2002 smillie et al 2010 carraro et al 2017 mge mobility produces mutations and rearrangements of genetic material inside microbial cells as a result the associated genes can form new functional clusters and spread rapidly through the bacterial population subsequently providing their hosts with advantages such as resistance to toxic compounds or the ability to exploit alternative carbon sources mges accelerate microbial adaptation to the transformation of new chemicals top and springael 2003 so they might be actively involved in omp removal in wwtps several studies have found similar catabolic gene clusters in phylogenetically unrelated strains isolated from geographically distant soils and wwtps van der meer et al 1992 williams and sayers 1994 ouchiyama et al 1998 shintani et al 2005 for example the upper part of the carbazole degradation pathway from pseudomonas sp isolated from a wwtp in tokyo contains similar genes to other strains isolated from a different wwtp more than a 1000 km away and from farm soil on the other hand the lower part of this pathway degrading catechol is highly similar to the one present in plasmids found all around the world tol plasmid pww0 plasmid nah7 and plasmid pvi150 this shows the way degradation pathways are usually formed by combining genes coming from different microorganisms or genetic backgrounds this can also be proven by the different c g content of plasmids and chromosomes in many microorganisms furthermore a few experiments have measured correlations between mges and the presence of omps in the first part of this section we will list catabolic mges found in wwtps and discuss biases underlying these discoveries in addition studies linking mge abundance to pesticide turnover in agricultural wwtps will be examined and gaps in the knowledge of the contribution of catabolic mges to wastewater treatment will be highlighted 2 1 prevalence of catabolic mobile genetic elements in wastewater treatment plants 2 1 1 conjugation the most studied hgt route in wwtps is plasmid transfer via conjugation plasmids consist of extrachromosomal dna and are able to autoreplicate and sometimes automobilize enzymes involved in the degradation of different pollutants are often encoded on plasmids and thus all of the required genes of the degradation pathway can be transferred together in one hgt event consequently catabolic plasmids are relatively large and mostly low copy number which decreases the energy required to replicate the plasmid top and springael 2003 genes encoding enzymes for degrading man made compounds are usually located on more promiscuous plasmids meaning their host range is phylogenetically wider incompatibility group incp 1 plasmids than genes encoding enzymes that degrade naturally occurring organic compounds incompatibility group plasmids incp 2 incp 9 nojiri et al 2004 therefore incp 1 plasmids might efficiently harbor and distribute genes for the degradation of new pollutants plasmids in the same incompatibility groups are not able to coexist together in a cell because they usually compete for the same replication factors although wwtps often contain many omps a plasmid metagenomic study suggested that incp 1 plasmids occur less frequently than other plasmid types such as incf in wwtps schlüter et al 2008 moreover the majority of plasmids seemed to be non self transmissible so incp 1 plasmids might act as helping vectors by assisting the transfer of other non conjugative plasmids mges such as transposons or insertion sequences can also be found on plasmids these mges are able to shuffle genes in the chromosome and thus help create novel catabolic pathways when they are further combined with promiscuous plasmids they represent a very efficient vector to spread new catabolic capabilities ma et al 2007 bahl et al 2009 is1071 and is6100 are the most frequent insertion sequences associated with omp degradation kato et al 1994 sota et al 2006 gai et al 2010 takeo et al 2012 dunon et al 2013 martini et al 2015 these insertion sequences are found in many catabolic plasmids such as ptsa and pcnb1 flanking degradation genes and form transposon modules in which the whole dna sequence included between the insertion sequences is transferred as a unit thus insertion sequences provide a solid structure for efficient recruitment of catabolic genes to plasmids and dissemination of these genes among bacteria table 1 lists several catabolic plasmids found in wwtps across the world these plasmids mostly belong to the incp 1β incompatibility group are conjugative and are approximately 60 100 kb although incp 1 plasmids appear to be the most abundant plasmids containing omp degrading genes in wwtps they are overall less abundant than other plasmid types based on a previous metagenome analysis schlüter et al 2008 most bacteria containing incp 1 plasmids are affiliated with the order burkholderiales of the class betaproteobacteria a metabolically highly diverse group that plays a significant role in nitrogen and carbon removal in wwtps due to their capability of heterotrophic denitrification zielińska et al 2016 fan et al 2017 burkholderiales are also known to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds because of the large variety of oxygenase enzymes they encode perez pantoja et al 2012 pereira et al 2014 furthermore some members of this order are opportunistic pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics bilgin et al 2015 this creates controversy when using omp degrading microorganisms in bioaugmentation strategies each catabolic plasmid confers novel degradation properties to its host many are able to use different halogenated and aromatic compounds as carbon and energy sources several transposons and insertion sequences have been linked to these catabolic genes but by far the most abundant in culture based studies is is1071 one drawback of the data in table 1 is that most of it comes from culture dependent methods thus the results might not represent the actual situation in wwtps due to the great plate count anomaly in which only a fraction of the true microbial diversity can be captured harwani 2013 culture independent methods provide a more comprehensive characterization of the catabolic mges diversity in wwtps however culture dependent methods cannot be totally substituted since they are necessary to study the function of the highly abundant unannotated genes linked to mges the last three plasmids in table 1 were found in a metagenomic study however wwtps samples in that study were first cultivated with several antibiotics and then all plasmids the plasmidome from the resistant community were sequenced plasmid replication proteins of catabolic plasmids patc58 and pl6 5 were identified the transposon tnpab previously associated with pcar1 was also observed schlüter et al 2008 another metagenomic analysis performed on activated sludge from two wwtps in hong kong identified genes for several omp degrading enzymes fang et al 2013 up to 40 of these genes were encoded on plasmids in that study activated sludge samples were not precultured thus providing a more realistic picture of catabolic mges in wwtps biased only by dna extraction and bioinformatic methods several metagenome analyses of wwtps have specifically looked for mges transferring args due to the emergent risk they pose to human health li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 che et al 2019 pazda et al 2019 however the link between mges and genes encoding omp degrading enzymes in metagenomes has not attracted the same attention and only few studies investigated this see previous paragraph fang et al 2013 this might be due to the incompleteness of the respective gene databases eawag bbd http eawag bbd ethz ch is the most up to date database to study microbial degradation of omps ellis and wackett 2012 but many genes encoding omp degrading enzymes are still not known or may not even have evolved yet furthermore identifying mges and the genes associated with them in environmental samples is still a challenge as will be further discussed in the methods section 2 1 2 transduction transduction is often considered the most efficient way of hgt between different biomes it does not require physical contact between bacteria in contrast to conjugation and phage particles protect the dna from degradation in contrast to transformation furthermore transduction occurs in a wide range of bacteria at higher frequencies than previously thought any kind of bacterial dna can be packed inside a bacteriophage capsid including chromosomal fragments and mges such as plasmids transposons or insertion sequences fig 2 muniesa et al 2011 this can happen by two different mechanisms generalized and specialized transduction during the first one the virus hydrolyses the host cell dna and any fragment is able to be incorporated into the virus capsid when the virus infects a different cell the non viral dna undergoes homologous recombination forming a recombinant cell in specialized transduction the viral genome gets integrated into the host cell genome during excision it sometimes takes the cell s genes flanking the virus integrated site thus only those genes adjacent to the integration site are able to be transferred to a different cell the size of dna fragments that can be packed inside a bacteriophage particle is limited by the capsid size with an average size of 50 kb and maximum size of 100 kb muniesa et al 2013 the study of viral communities in wwtps has been limited due to the low percentage of host bacteria that can be cultured in the laboratory however recent advances in high throughput sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to sequence the whole viral metagenome in several samples edwards and rohwer 2005 pérez losada et al 2020 genes identified in the phage metagenomes of several wwtps and other environments such as the mouse gut include args and 16s rrna genes from firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria parsley et al 2010a b del casale et al 2011 modi et al 2013 interestingly nitrospira and planctomycetes genes were not found in the clones of a wwtp phage metagenome suggesting that these phyla are not highly involved in transduction del casale et al 2011 omp degrading genes have not been extensively explored in bacteriophage communities in soil with prior pesticide exposure a chlorohydrolase gene responsible for the dehalogenation of atrazine was found in the viral metagenome ghosh et al 2008 in addition the phage metagenome from an activated sludge sample was sequenced and subsequently analyzed to determine the functions of the different open reading frames orfs or protein coding genes parsley et al 2010b the most abundant subsystem was related to the metabolism of macromolecules such as carbohydrates proteins and amino acids and lipids furthermore 5 of the orfs were related to aromatic compound metabolism approaches similar to those used to identify args inside viral particles in wwtps parsley et al 2010a b muniesa et al 2011 could be adopted to find specific omp degrading functions in future work 2 1 3 transformation naturally competent bacterial cells can gain new functions by taking up extracellular dna exdna this kind of dna is released to the environment via two main mechanisms bacterial cell lysis and active secretion cell lysis can be the result of a bacteriophage infection autolysins or reactive oxygen species active secretion of dna is usually performed by the type iv secretion apparatus although vesicle mediated exdna delivery has also been demonstrated in some microorganisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae sarkar 2020 wang et al 2020a apart from its role in hgt exdna has a structural function in microbial aggregates such as biofilms and small sized aerobic granular sludge this has been proven by adding exogenous dnases and observing bacterial detachment and disruption of biofilms and small aerobic granules jakubovics et al 2013 wang et al 2020b furthermore adsorbed dna is transformed at higher rates than free dna making bacterial aggregates a good spot for transformation due to the high amounts of extracellular material where dna can be attached dong et al 2019 several studies of exdna in wwtps have shown the high abundance of extracellular mges 65 of the exdna calderón franco et al 2020 and the presence of several args dong et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 however nothing is currently known about the omp degrading genes present in exdna in wwtps natural transformation is known to be a driving force of evolution and it is logical to think that it plays a role in the creation of novel degradative pathways for that reason new studies looking for omp degrading genes in exdna from wwtps are needed 2 2 correlation between mobile genetic elements and organic micropollutants abundance only a few studies have attempted to elucidate the direct contribution of catabolic mges to omp removal during wastewater treatment these studies have been performed in on farm biopurification systems bpss installations that treat pesticide contaminated wastewater on farms one study compared pesticide treated and non treated soils and bpss by measuring the abundance of incp 1 plasmids and is1071 insertion sequences dunon et al 2013 the authors subsequently sequenced the accessory genes between two is1071 sequences dunon et al 2018 interestingly they observed a correlation between pesticide exposure and incp 1 is1071 abundance and were able to identify several biodegradation genes flanked by is1071 sequences this demonstrates the importance of incp 1 plasmids and is1071 in bacterial community adaptation to pesticides a different study monitored the abundance of different types of mges and the concentrations of different pesticides in a bps for an entire year dealtry et al 2014 they observed a correlation between the presence of the analyzed omps and the abundance of incp 1β plasmids and inti2 elements another kind of mge able to capture express and spread genes these results also point towards a role of specific mges in microbial adaptation and subsequent pesticide degradation in bpss these catabolic mges might also have the potential to facilitate omp degradation in urban wwtps but new studies of catabolic mge function and dynamics in wwtps are needed 3 methods for mobile genetic elements analysis in environmental samples studies providing an overview of catabolic mges in wwtps are scarce most likely due to the lack of knowledge in current degradative gene databases and technical limitations wwtp samples consist of complex microbial communities and a large variety of organic matter which can interfere with protocols for analyzing mges various strategies can be applied to obtain information about mges together with their associated genes in wwtps fig 3 table 2 and the choice mainly depends on the study goals each method has different biases in terms of plasmid sizes traits or hosts and knowing the advantages and limitations of each method is of great importance for achieving the specific research goal table 2 box 1 the majority of studies investigating catabolic plasmids in wwtps have used culture dependent methods targeting the degradation of a specific compound table 1 this approach consists of plating an environmental sample onto a selective medium to isolate cells and or mges with desired characteristics e g antibiotic resistance or crystal violet degradation schlüter et al 2007 2008 plasmids or other mges present in the genomes of the cultured community members can subsequently be analyzed by different molecular techniques pcr hybridization sequencing and linked to specific bacterial strains or associated genes however if the aim is to obtain a representation of all catabolic mges present in the wwtp this approach would not be ideal because only a small proportion of the wwtp microbial community can be cultured harwani 2013 to obtain a more representative overview of mge abundance and omp degradation in wwtps culture independent methods might be more appropriate exogenous plasmid isolation permits the identification of transferable plasmids in a sample without cultivation of the original plasmid host dröge et al 1999 smalla et al 2015 in this method bacterial communities in the sample are mixed with recipient cells to allow dna transfer the mixture of cells is then resuspended on selective media to isolate the recipient cells that have obtained the target capacity the cells can also be plated on rich media to identify all transferred plasmids in this approach only mobilizable plasmids compatible with the selected recipient are characterized one shortcoming is that it is not possible to identify the original plasmid host a less biased approach consists of total dna isolation from a sample and direct sequencing of the isolated dna however mges such as plasmids and viruses are very difficult to reconstruct and identify in metagenomic analyses because they possess long repetitive zones especially large plasmids arredondo alonso et al 2017 many bioinformatic tools have been recently developed to overcome this challenge in short read sequencing examples of them are plasmidfinder cbar placnet meta plasmidspades recycler plasflow mob suite mlplasmids plascope gplas plasclass plasgun scapp metaviralspades zhou and xu 2010 carattoli et al 2014 rozov et al 2017 vielva et al 2017 arredondo alonso et al 2018 arredondo alonso et al 2020 krawczyk et al 2018 robertson and nash 2018 royer et al 2018 antipov et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2020 pellow et al 2020a b pellow et al 2020 2020 these tools identify plasmids and viruses in metagenomic samples or bacterial isolates in a variety of ways ranging from the simpler approach of blasting against a plasmid database plasmidfinder mob suite to the use of more complex deep neural networks cbar plasflow moreover algorithms such as recycler metaplasmidspades metaviralspades and scapp use the assembly graphs to identify regions of different coverage which are the mges another option to further improve plasmid identification is long read sequencing technologies such as oxford nanopore or pacbio technologies rhoads and au 2015 jain et al 2016 however short read sequencing is still used in combination with long read sequencing in order to correct the sequence errors of the latter technique amarasinghe et al 2020 sequencing has also been used in combination to other methods in order to overcome the assembly challenge of long repetitive dna areas linked reads optical mapping and proximity ligation technologies the linked read strategy barcodes all small sequences coming from the same long sequence and then accurate short read sequencing is performed ott et al 2018 in optical mapping long dna molecules are fluorescently labelled at specific sequences and stretched in order to determine the distances between labels with a fluorescence microscope it has low resolution so it is better used in combination with short read sequencing too michaeli and ebenstein 2012 finally proximity ligation technologies such as hi c use the information of physical dna interactions inside the cell to help assemble mges van berkum et al 2010 instead of sequencing total dna many studies have tried to enrich plasmids or viral particles before sequencing all plasmids in a microbial community sample can be separated from chromosomal dna by alkaline lysis followed by size dependent dna separation methods such as ultracentrifugation e g cscl or column based binding assays commercial kit sentchilo et al 2013 smalla et al 2015 plasmid safe dnase treatment can also be used to further purify circular plasmids the purified dna can then be directly sequenced or first amplified to ensure sufficient plasmid dna for sequencing the most common method to amplify plasmids is multiple displacement amplification mda which uses ϕ29 dna polymerase an enzyme that amplifies unspecific dna fragments greater than 70 kb and possesses high fidelity and proofreading activity blanco et al 1989 an alternative is the transposon aided capture traca method which consists of tagging the previously isolated plasmids with a transposon that contains a selectable marker kanamycin resistance and the escherichia coli origin of replication oriv subsequent transformation of e coli with these tagged plasmids permits amplification and sequencing jones and marchesi 2007 viral particles can also be separated from bacterial cells by cscl gradient centrifugation although previous steps such as filtration or precipitation might be necessary to enrich the viral particles in the sample dna or rna is then extracted amplified if necessary and sequenced thurber et al 2009 all of these culture independent methods have a common disadvantage the in situ bacterial host of the plasmid remains unknown several technologies have recently been developed to attempt to solve this problem i epic pcr can link functional genes e g a plasmid replicase with phylogenetic markers in uncultured single cells spencer et al 2016 ii single cell genomic sequencing sic seq captures the whole genome information of a single cell including plasmids and associated viruses doud and woyke 2017 this method can use droplet microfluidics optical tweezers or flow sorting to obtain single cells zhang and liu 2008 rinke et al 2014 lan et al 2017 iii hi c technology analyses the 3d folding of genomes cells are first fixed with formaldehyde to attach interacting loci by covalent dna protein bonds including interactions of a plasmid with specific parts of the chromosome the modified dna is then fragmented by a restriction enzyme and sequenced after other intermediate steps van berkum et al 2010 as a result all the chromosomal reads from a specific taxonomic group are binned together including the plasmids attached to those chromosomal fragments burton et al 2014 stalder et al 2019 vi single molecule real time smrt sequencing from pacbio technologies not only determines the sequence of nucleotides but also predicts the methylation of nucleotides this information is later used to perform a more accurate binning or clustering of contigs belonging to the same taxon furthermore it can link plasmids and other mges to their host beaulaurier et al 2018 v identifying mges integrated inside bacterial genomes can also help linking them to specific taxa in the binning process during metagenomic analysis when a mge enters a bacterial cell fragments of it are integrated into the genome as spacers of repetitive sequences called clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats crispr thus it is possible to derive the viruses that have infected a specific host shkoporov et al 2019 obtaining high quality and high yields of exdna is challenging due to its low concentration in wastewater furthermore avoiding cell lysis during exdna isolation protocols is often unchecked and difficult to achieve however throughout the past years new methods have been developed for exdna analysis from water and soil samples nagler et al 2018 the most recent techniques applied to wastewater are the use of magnetic beads and chromatography to purify exdna after filtration of the sample yuan et al 2019 calderón franco et al 2020 the first method added magnetic beads to 5 ml of sample filtrate to bind the exdna after washing the beads to remove impurities exdna was eluted for further analysis this method gave better exdna yields per sample volume and quality than previous methods such as alcohol precipitation surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab precipitation and dna extraction kits however the authors did not check for cell lysis during the protocol even though sample vortexing was applied the second method used higher amounts of sample 1000 ml and passed it through an anion exchange chromatography column the eluted exdna was tracked with a uv vis absorbance detector and further precipitated and treated with proteinase k the exdna yield per volume sample was lower compared to the magnetic beads method but still good for further molecular and sequencing analysis cell lysis was monitored by live dead staining and flow cytometry analysis fortunately no cell disruption was observed after centrifugation or filtration a recent review described in detail many of the above methods for de novo mge identification carr et al 2020 in addition another study compared some of the above culture dependent and culture independent techniques in the analysis of broiler cecal samples delaney et al 2018 to determine which method provided the largest variety of antibiotic resistance plasmids capable of expression in a human pathogenic strain of escherichia coli the results showed that single commercial kits or alkaline lysis were not effective at obtaining intact plasmids using the traca method only a few plasmids were extracted although mda gave the best results this technique was not as consistent as exogenous plasmid isolation thus the authors recommended using this last technique in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of antibiotic resistance plasmids from a complex sample this study lacked many of the novel methods described in this review for that reason a detailed description of advantages and disadvantages of each method is written in box 1 and table 2 if the objective is to study the function of specific mges culture based methods are needed in order to grow the bacterial cells in the laboratory however if the objective is to identify new mges or study the full diversity of mges in a specific environment culture independent methods are needed the best approach would be the combination of short read sequencing for accuracy and other technologies such as smrt or hi c for a correct mge assembly and linkage to host cells single cell sequencing can provide further resolution by distinguishing very closely related bacteria however obtaining single cells from biofilms granules or flocs requires extra optimization of the technique 4 transfer of catabolic genes as a bioaugmentation strategy in wastewater treatment plants traditional bioaugmentation consists of adding omp degrading microorganisms to contaminated sites where the indigenous microorganisms do not possess or express the ability to degrade the pollutants singer et al 2005 although this method has shown success repeated addition of microorganisms is often needed due to the poor survival and activity of the inoculum gilbert and crowley 1998 a promising alternative to relying on the survival and activity of the inoculum is to spread degradative genes among the indigenous community as mges are natural vehicles for the rapid dissemination of genes among complex microbial communities they have been used to accelerate the bioremediation of toxic compounds in various environments such as polluted soils and waters top et al 2002 catabolic mges have been successfully introduced into different wwtp systems in order to enhance the biodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds see references in table 3 however ensuring the spread and persistence of these degradative genes is usually a great challenge in the following sections different a biotic factors contributing to mge transfer and persistence in wwtps will be examined moreover several mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies in wwtps will be explained and their limitations and risks will be discussed 4 1 conditions affecting conjugative gene bioaugmentation in wastewater treatment plants selecting a successful gene augmentation strategy in complex microbial ecosystems such as wwtps depends on finding a proper match among the bacterial donor strain competent environmental recipients the mge carrying the gene s of interest and the a biotic conditions in the wwtp reactors only conjugative gene transfer has been reported to be effective thus far conjugation occurs more efficiently when high numbers of donor and recipient strains are in close contact through mating aggregates ravatn et al 1998 these aggregates are structures that contain physically bound cells exchanging dna material in wwtps mating aggregates can be granules or colonizable surfaces where microorganisms can form biofilms the suitability of flocs for mating is questionable due to their porous nature as the biomass density in water increases so does the probability of conjugation events no study has attempted to introduce genes into the environment using viral vectors as in human gene therapy bramson et al 1995 one reason is the presumed high specificity of bacteriophages for bacterial infection which might reduce the usefulness of transduction for gene exchange among distantly related bacteria dröge et al 1999 however recent studies suggest that phages with broad host ranges are very common in nature de jonge et al 2019 supporting the potential of bacteriophages for developing new gene augmentation strategies in wwtps one factor determining the effectiveness of conjugative gene transfer is the initial stability and growth of the donor strain the establishment of the donor strain in the wwtp microbial community is not a requirement for transfer of the catabolic mge but high initial numbers of donor bacteria increase the chances of gene transfer ravatn et al 1998 the best approach is to select indigenous bacteria as donor cells because they are already adapted to the physical chemical and biological conditions of the polluted environment mcclure et al 1991 however this might be a challenge as environmental bacteria are often difficult to genetically modify or grow in the lab moreover for obvious reasons donor strains should not be pathogenic the suitability of the donor bacteria also depends on the a biotic conditions in the wwtps donor cells must be able to survive at the temperature oxygen concentration ph and other parameters present in the activated sludge basins merlin et al 2011 furthermore they must successfully compete with indigenous microorganisms and avoid predation by protozoa and bacteriophages dröge et al 1999 mrozik and piotrowska seget 2010 fulfilling these criteria will guarantee the initial stable cell number necessary to achieve effective gene transfer once the donor cells are stably introduced the transfer of catabolic genes to other recipient bacteria can be initiated many biotic and abiotic variables have an effect on conjugation efficiency and should be considered when designing mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies dröge et al 1999 one important factor is the type of mge chosen for catabolic gene dissemination in aqueous environments dna transfer through plasmids encoding flexible pili is more effective furthermore broad spectrum plasmids are better vectors for spreading the associated genes among the microbial community even to distantly related bacteria environmental or abiotic factors such as temperature and the presence of toxic compounds also affect conjugation dröge et al 1999 in fact subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics heavy metals disinfectants or other organic compounds can stimulate the transfer of args via several mges including transformation merlin et al 2011 jiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2020c when genes for the degradation of toxic compounds are horizontally transferred the metabolic reactions they encode must function in biochemical and regulatory environments that they did not coevolve with consequently post transfer genetic refinement of the recipient cell may be necessary in a previous study researchers introduced the gene for dichloromethane dcm degradation in methylobacterium strains that had not been previously exposed to the contaminant they observed that the new recombinant strains had difficulty growing on dcm and they hypothesized that the toxic by products generated from dcm breakdown were responsible michener et al 2014a b in a subsequent experiment they proved that adaptation to growth on dcm involved mutations that increased chloride excretion from the cell furthermore they constructed a new mge containing both a dcm degradation pathway and a chloride exporter and achieved successful dcm degradation in recombinant bacteria michener et al 2014a b these results demonstrate the importance of understanding microbial adaptation to omp degradation in order to design a proper catabolic mge de lorenzo et al 2015 once the desired genes are successfully spread among indigenous bacteria and are functional the ultimate goal is to make these genes persist in wwtps and thus achieve a constant omp degradation rate selective pressure such as omp presence is the key factor controlling the persistence of plasmid bearing bacteria as long as the plasmid bearing bacteria have a fitness advantage compared to plasmid free bacteria the catabolic mges will persist one example of a clear advantage for donors and plasmid bearing bacteria is when all carbon and nitrogen have been removed and omps prevail in wwtp settling tanks a previous study demonstrated that the selection and growth of donor and transconjugant cells were dependent on the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of the specific substrate ravatn et al 1998 to predict the long term dynamics of catabolic plasmids in a polluted environment a mathematical model was developed that considered the negative feedback between plasmid spread and selective advantage when catabolic genes are highly spread the omp concentration will decrease faster thereby lowering the selective advantage of plasmid bearing bacteria miki et al 2007 thus in order to achieve long term omp degradation it is necessary to find the right plasmid spread efficiency in order to maintain constant low pollutant concentrations as the degrading microbial community remains more stable when omp degradation occurs slowly 4 2 cases of gene bioaugmentation under wastewater treatment plants conditions the increasing sensitivity of mass spectrometry detection methods is constantly revealing new emerging contaminants in wwtps although catabolic mges are known to play a relevant role in adaptation to such new toxic compounds few studies have successfully used mge mediated bioaugmentation strategies to increase their biodegradation in wwtps table 3 in this section past attempts using conjugation to spread degradative genes under wwtp settings are evaluated and their limitations and risks are discussed the pollutants used in these experiments table 3 were industrial compounds such as chlorobenzoic acid the herbicide 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d and pesticides all were investigated at concentrations of mg l although they often appear in the range of ng l to μg l except for industrial wwtps where concentrations can be higher this suggests an important question do these low concentrations elicit sufficient selective pressure to achieve successful gene augmentation solutions in urban wwtps furthermore many experiments were performed using the pollutant as the sole carbon source one study observed that biodegradation of 2 4 d was higher when it was the only carbon source than when other more easily degradable carbon sources were present probably because of catabolite repression quan et al 2011 these experimental designs outline the need for more realistic pollutant concentrations and influent compositions in test bioreactors the most commonly used donor strain was pseudomonas putida table 3 probably due to the availability of molecular tools for genetic engineering of this microorganism and its presence as an environmental bacterium in wwtps and soils around the globe nikel et al 2016 in more recent studies comamonas testosteroni escherichia coli and rhodococcus sp were also applied bathe et al 2009 tsutsui et al 2010 ren et al 2018 different mges were used mainly plasmids most were self transmissible and had broad host ranges thus resulting in successful transfer of catabolic genes among the studied community usually in activated sludge in some cases the donor strain disappeared within a few days after application however this did not hamper the success of the bioaugmentation because the catabolic mge had successfully been transferred to indigenous bacteria persisting in the environment in many of the studies in table 3 fluorescent proteins were used to label the donor strain and the mge with different colors green fluorescent protein and dsred the use of these genetic markers with confocal laser scanning microscopy provides an effective and rapid way to visually determine if gene transfer to indigenous bacteria has occurred and if donor bacteria are still present nancharaiah et al 2008 venkata mohan et al 2009 quan et al 2010 2011 many of the studies in table 3 were successful in improving pollutant degradation by gene augmentation according to three criteria i increased degradation of the compound compared to non bioaugmented microcosms or bioreactors ii transfer of the catabolic mge to indigenous bacteria and iii decreased donor strain abundance after some time this success clearly supports the potential of gene augmentation to overcome the donor strain survival problem of traditional bioaugmentation all of the experiments in table 3 with promising results were performed in lab scale reactors or microcosms mimicking activated sludge conditions the only gene augmentation trial in a pilot reactor failed venkata mohan et al 2009 which indicates that unknown challenges in the scale up of gene bioaugmentation strategies remain and suggests the need for more experiments in on site reactors at wwtps nzila et al 2016 in order to choose the right donor and mge more knowledge is needed about which catabolic mges are being transferred in wwtps and which bacteria are involved in the process furthermore whether concentrations in the range of ng l and ug l are sufficient to create a selection pressure for omp degrading bacteria needs to be tested new contaminants such as diclofenac have been included in watch lists all around the world carvalho et al 2015 so bioaugmentation experiments with these compounds are also needed in general more settings that realistically mimic wwtps are required to optimize conjugation as a realistic solution furthermore new technologies such as viral transfer also hold promise the application and generation of genetically engineered microorganisms gems in open contaminated sites such as soils or wwtps remains controversial the societal concerns towards gene bioaugmentation strategies are related to the unknown consequences of microorganisms with new functions in an open environment trump et al 2020 first these microorganisms can be spread to other environments with unforeseeable effects second the enhanced transfer of catabolic genes can also increase the mobilization of args a careful assessment of the risk benefit ratio is essential to coherent decision making on the one hand a clear benefit decreasing omp discharge and thus decreasing ecotoxicity in superficial and ground waters can be obtained on the other hand new studies assessing gene bioaugmentation risks such as the transfer of args have to be performed since self transferable mges are preferred in gene augmentation strategies they might act as mobilizing agents of other mges containing args past bioremediation strategies in contaminated waters or soils tried to control gems by inserting suicidal genes that kill them after the contaminant disappeared molin 1993 however this is contrary to bioaugmentation in wwtps since the contaminant concentrations fluctuates and the objective is to keep the transformed community stable other genetic safeguards restrict the gems to defined environments or prevent hgt to environmental bacteria asin garcia et al 2020 since gene augmentation strategies rely on hgt the only option is to contain gems in the wwtps bioreactors however it seems quite difficult to find a way of containing all new transformants inside the wwtp in conclusion risk assessment studies are necessary in order to identify associated spreading of genes such as args and to detect gems esscaping from wwtps in this way new safeguards strategies can be added to diminish the specific risks 5 concluding remarks microorganisms have been in contact with omps for a relatively short period on an evolutionary time scale so the metabolic pathways are still being developed during the adaptation process mges provide reliable scaffolds for clustering the genes responsible for omp degradation and spreading them among bacterial communities consequently omp degradation genes are often linked to mges in this review we assessed the prevalence detection methods and bioremediation uses of catabolic mges in wwtps 1 the majority of catabolic mges found in wwtps are conjugative incp 1 plasmids and is1071 insertion sequences affiliated with burkholderiales bacteria however this information is biased because many of these studies used culture based methods to obtain a realistic overview of the catabolic mges with the greatest ecological relevance in wwtps it is necessary to move towards cultivation independent methods with the potential for sequencing all mges and associated genes present in environmental samples 2 there are three main challenges for a thorough study of mobile degradative genes via cultivation independent methods i the complexity of mges assembly from a metagenomic sample because of the long repetitive sequences ii the lack of knowledge of genes encoding enzymes for omp biodegradation and iii the difficulty in identifying the host microorganisms so far the combination of short read sequencing for high sequence accuracy and smrt or hi c for better assembly and host cell prediction provides the best option to get a comprehensive representation of mges in environmental samples in addition more functional analyses are needed to discover new biodegradation genes 3 mges can be used to spread degradative capabilities in wwtps thus overcoming the main limitation of traditional cell bioaugmentation the low survival of the inoculum several studies have successfully implemented this technique in lab scale reactors and activated sludge microcosms however gene augmentation failed when scaling up to a pilot reactor furthermore the omp concentration in these experiments was mg l whereas concentrations of ng l and ug l are typically found in the influent of urban wwtps for these reasons further research is needed using more realistic scenarios including pilot wwtp reactors and lower concentrations of omps risk assessment studies looking at the fate of transformants and the spread of args are also necessary hopefully solving these issues will lead to a safe cost effective and eco friendly technology that enhances omp removal in wwtps
