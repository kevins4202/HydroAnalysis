castro muñoz 2020 the discharge of industrial wastewater brings about large quantities of heavy metals and synthetic pollutants leading to the continuous deterioration of water quality in order to deter the environmental risk of contaminated water various conventional and advanced treatment methods have been applied for water purification hayat et al 2017 jiao et al 2017 pintor et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 among these approaches membrane based technologies have been considered as one of the most promising ways owing to the advantages of versatile efficient economical low energy intensive and easy for operation goh and ismail 2015 koros and zhang 2017 most importantly besides water treatment membrane processes provide a sustainable way to augment the water supply by combining with the technologies of new energy generation so far membrane filtration systems such as pressure driven seawater and brackish water reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro have been widely employed in drinking water production desalination water reuse and wastewater treatment ali et al 2020 anand et al 2018 meng et al 2020 qasim et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 emerging electrically driven membrane processes represented by electrodialysis and electrophoresis further promote the application of membrane technology in combating water issues zhu and jassby 2019 essentially the performance of water treatment membranes is strongly related to the physicochemical characteristics of membrane materials therefore the core task of membrane technology is exploring appropriate materials for membrane fabrication wei et al 2018 by far various of polymeric and ceramic materials have been used to fabricate water treatment membranes because of the rich resources low price and tailorable structures macromolecule polymers predominate raw materials for membrane construction after all polymer membranes are currently the most mature commercial system in the forefront of desalination and wastewater treatment hendrik 2012 samaei mohsen et al 2018 zakrzewska trznadel 2013 compared to organic polymers inorganic ceramic materials possess obvious advantages such as good chemical stability mechanical strength and fouling resistance thus ceramic membranes are more suitable for challenging water purification processes such as oil water separation pharmaceutical wastewater and liquid radioactive waste treatment chen et al 2020b despite great progresses have been achieved either polymeric or ceramic materials are confronted with inherent shortages for industrial applications for example organic polymeric materials have deficient resistance to heat and long term ageing while inorganic materials suffer from poor corrosion resistance and high production cost this has brought about technical dilemmas of membranes for practical water purification such as the unavoidable membrane fouling and the trade off between separation efficiency and water permeability goh and ismail 2017 currently many efforts are being pursued in alleviating the above difficulties such as the construction of thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes and mixed matrix membranes mmms by combining the unique properties of polymer substrates and inorganic fillers to enhance the sustainable application of polymer membranes kumar et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the preparation of low cost ceramic membranes with cheap clay and organic pore making agents to promote the prevalence of ceramic membranes hamdi et al 2016 hubadillah et al 2017 nevertheless it is still a huge challenge to obtain a kind of membrane with satisfactory cost high selectivity high permeability superior stability and antifouling ability advances in nanotechnology brings about new opportunities for the development of membrane science and technology in recent years numerous nanostructured materials have been explored for membrane synthesis such as gold nanocrystal he et al 2015 carbon nanotubes cnts li et al 2019b graphene derivatives anand et al 2018 wei et al 2018 mxenes al hamadani et al 2020 metal organic frameworks mofs wang et al 2019a and zeolites dong et al 2016 the multifunction of nanomaterials endows as developed membranes modified by these nanomaterials with improved surface hydrophilicity unique surface charge as well as anti scaling and antibacterial properties liu et al 2019a with earth abundant and environmental friendly components carbon based materials shows remarkable advantages over other types of nanomaterials for high separation efficiency via different permeation mechanisms anand et al 2018 taken the mostly focused graphene as an example it has been reported that water molecules could flow through the two dimensional 2d channels with nearly zero friction joshi et al 2014 nair et al 2012 however the high cost of materials the technological challenge in large scale membranes manufacturing as well as the limited structure stability have become the main significant barriers to slow down the adoption of graphene based membranes cheng et al 2020 cohen tanugi and grossman 2014 goh et al 2016 therefore new type of carbonaceous nanomaterials are highly desirable for the development of high performance water treatment membranes due to the facile and inexpensive synthesis procedures outstanding physicochemical stability and unique catalytic properties polymeric g c3n4 with a graphene like structure is attracting more and more attention in environmental remediation and energy conversion kessler et al 2017 liu et al 2019b g c3n4 is composed of 2d layered structure and the neighboring layers are held together by weak van der waals interactions triazine c3n3 and tri s triazine c6n7 are the two fundamental tectonic units for establishing g c3n4 fig 1 ong et al 2016 wang et al 2012b in which tri s triazine based g c3n4 is deemed as the most stable g c3n4 form with regularly distributed triangular nanopores 3 11 å throughout the entire laminar structure both the laminar structure and triangular nanopores contribute to the fast permeation of small molecules h2o h2 and so on and the effective retention of larger molecules tian et al 2016 zou et al 2019 furthermore g c3n4 generally possesses a defect rich structure that is generated by thermal condensation these defects with the size of 3 1 3 4 å can shorten the transmission path and endow g c3n4 to be more water permeable lotsch et al 2007 in contrast to the conjugated double bonds in the tri s triazine units the weaker single bond of tertiary amino n c 3 makes it easy to eliminate the tri s triazine units in g c3n4 so that the nanostructure of g c3n4 and transport path of different molecules can be further optimized wang et al 2017c moreover with the combination of inorganic and organic characteristics g c3n4 is wildly considered as an ideal material for photocatalytic membrane preparation the relatively narrow bandgap 2 7 ev and maximum absorption wavelength at about 460 nm fully improve the utilization of g c3n4 for visible light its capability of light energy conversion makes it possible to in situ degrade retained contaminants or generate new energy undoubtedly g c3n4 can provide an opportunity for the construction of next generation water treatment membranes with high separation efficiency and self cleaning ability although the applications of g c3n4 for environment catalysis have been well summarized by several groups comprehensive assess of the latest progress of g c3n4 based water purification membranes is rare in this critical review we begin with the fabrication and modification methods of g c3n4 based self supporting film and composite membranes we emphasized the material strategies used to regulate the structure of bulk g c3n4 for membrane fabrication the applications of g c3n4 based membranes in typical water purification processes have been elaborated finally some concluding remarks and perspective on the future development of g c3n4 based membranes are discussed 2 regulation strategies of g c3n4 molecule structures thermal polymerization of various of nitrogen contained precursors such as melamine urea and dicyanodiamide can be readily used to fabricate bulk g c3n4 however the large lateral size and low surface area ca 10 m2 g 1 with deficient surface functional groups of bulk g c3n4 result in its poor dispersibility in most solvent which in turn causes the difficulty in membrane preparation and the degradation of membrane performance kumru et al 2018 therefore from the perspective of membrane preparation structure tailoring of bulk g c3n4 is highly desirable to improve its dispersibility and stability in special solvents based on this idea g c3n4 nanosheets with ultrathin 2d nanostructures are wildly accepted as the most suitable candidate materials for membranes preparation two approaches have been developed to prepare g c3n4 nanosheets one is top down exfoliation treatment that is stripping layered g c3n4 solids into free standing nanosheets and other is bottom up template assisted synthesis in which organic molecules are anisotropic assembled into g c3n4 in a 2d manner in addition modification and functionalization are also effective strategies for structure regulation of g c3n4 which can further improve its inherent shortcomings of limited visible light absorption and high recombination rate of photo generated carriers thereby improving the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 and giving fully play the multifunctionality of g c3n4 based membranes 2 1 exfoliation treatment owing to the typical layered structural features of g c3n4 three commonly used exfoliation approaches including thermal oxidation etching ultrasonication assisted liquid exfoliation and chemical exfoliation have been applicated to stripping bulk g c3n4 solid into 2d nanosheets with significant reduced dimension 2 1 1 thermal oxidation etching the research on the structure of g c3n4 by lotsch et al have convincingly confirmed that there are not only strong c n covalent bonds in each layer of g c3n4 but also hydrogen bonding between strands of polymeric melon units with nh nh2 groups and these medium strong planar hydrogen bonding could be easily broken by oxidation lotsch et al 2007 based on the principle niu et al prepared g c3n4 nanosheets by the direct thermal oxidation etching of bulk g c3n4 solids in air niu et al 2012 the holding time of thermal treatment played an important role in the delamination and the layer thickness of g c3n4 layers could be reduced to a desired nanoscale by the layer by layer thermal etching process fig 2 a shows a typical g c3n4 nanosheet after thermal etching at 500 c for 2 h the thickness of 2 nm corresponds to 6 7 layers of g c3n4 monolayers using this strategy cao et al synthesized a new type of g c3n4 filler to fabricate polymeric nanocomposite membranes cao et al 2015 chen et al 2016 easy operation low cost and environmental friendliness are the outstanding merits of this thermal etching method however this vapor based route suffers from the low yield 6 of exfoliated products moreover the generation of structural defects during thermal exfoliation might cause the deceleration of membrane performance 2 1 2 ultrasonication assisted liquid exfoliation inspired by the synthesis of graphene oxide liquid exfoliation routes have been intensively adopted to fabricate ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets zhang et al firstly reported that bulk g c3n4 can be effectively delaminated into 2d nanosheets in some solvents with the help of continuous ultrasonication fig 2 b zhang et al 2013 yang et al confirmed that isopropanol ipa and acetone could be used as liquid medium to strip g c3n4 layers into nanosheet with a lateral dimension of microscale and a thickness of 2 nm yang et al 2013 owing to the absence of any high temperature treatment or oxidation process the resultant g c3n4 nanosheets can retain the original structure and chemical stoichiometric ratio to further improve the quality of exfoliated nanosheets water based mixed solvents such as ipa h2o ethanol h2o dimethyl formamide h2o and tetrahydrofuran h2o have been used as the liquid mediums through adjusting the volume ratio of solvents the thickness of 2d g c3n4 nanosheets can be further reduced to 0 38 nm thus yielded high quality g c3n4 suspension with excellent stability for membrane fabrication lin et al 2015 with respect to this strategy increasing the yield of g c3n4 nanosheets and shortening the treatment time is essential for the large scale applications 2 1 3 chemical exfoliation acid etching is an efficient technique to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets with good dispersibility mineral acids such as hcl and h2so4 are commonly used to protonate bulk g c3n4 solids the stranded nitrogen atoms can act as receptor sites to promote the insertion of acids making polymeric matrix expanded and stratified ma et al 2014 xu et al 2013 for instance g c3n4 nanosheets with a lateral size of several micrometers and a single atomic thickness of 0 4 nm were fabricated by h2so4 treatment xu et al 2013 the protonation of g c3n4 by hcl was further combined with the ultrasonic stripping process forming ultrathin nanosheets with large specific surface area 305 m2 g 1 and excellent stability of water dispersion ma et al 2014 this protonation process can not only shorten the ultrasonication time from 10 h to 2 h but also significantly improve the yield of the product 25 30 du et al developed an efficient method for the large scale fabrication of acidified g c3n4 they found that strong acid high temperature and anhydrous environment were the three key factors for the exfoliation and acidification of g c3n4 du et al 2015 after the successive treatment by anhydrous h2so4 and hcl fig 2 c acidified g c3n4 exhibited the characteristics of a poly ammonium salt and could be dissolved in several solvents with good dissolution recrystallization reversible equilibrium besides the ph value and temperature dependent solubility of the acidified g c3n4 make it possible to recycle these nanosheets through low temperature crystallization followed by filtration besides acid assisted route bulk g c3n4 can also be exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets under suitable alkaline conditions li et al 2019d when mixed with alkaline solution such as koh naoh and nh3 h2o the weak van der waals interactions between the layers of bulk g c3n4 could be easily destroyed by the inserted oh thus caused the complete delamination zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 at the same time partial nh2 groups connected with heterocyclic carbon atoms are replaced by oh due to the electrophilic substitution between oh and heterocyclic carbon atoms leading to the originally neutral g c3n4 nanosheets would become somewhat negatively charged as reported the hydrophilic and negatively charged oxygen related functional groups are favorable for the dispersion of g c3n4 in water or some special solvents without aggregation based on this mechanism li et al 2017b obtained a transparent colloidal solution of g c3n4 nanosheets by the continuous treatment of bulk g c3n4 with koh aqueous solution 5 0 m at 80 c for 24 h as shown in fig 2 d the interactions between oh and terminal or bridged nh2 groups of the triazine units in bulk g c3n4 decreased the bonding energy between different layers and promoted the delamination this led to the formation of nanosheets with a large lateral size of hundred nanometers and a thickness of 0 4 nm interestingly after the neutralization of hcl electrolyte solution g c3n4 nanosheets could be re assembled into multilayered structure with recovered crystallinity and chemical features this further demonstrated the amphiphilicity of g c3n4 nanosheets fabricated by chemical exfoliation interestingly chemical exfoliation process can introduce specific functional groups at the edges of the g c3n4 nanosheets such as cooh and oh the functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets with hydrophilic groups should play an irreplaceable role in improving the membrane flux and preventing membrane fouling in conclusion exfoliation treatment can not only decrease the material size to nanoscale and even sub nanometer scale but also endow them with high specific surface and reactive sites which is widely accepted as a facile controlled pathway to obtain well defined g c3n4 nanosheets with improved dispersibility for membrane fabrication among the various exfoliation strategies mentioned above chemical exfoliation is usually regarded as a sol processing of bulk g c3n4 and the g c3n4 colloidal dispersion obtained by acid or alkali treatment usually exhibited more satisfactory flexibility and compatibility moreover the introduction of specific functional groups after chemical exfoliation endows g c3n4 nanosheets with more possibilities for compounding with other materials zhang et al 2015b therefore in comparison with other exfoliation strategies chemical exfoliation has more prominent advantages in the preparation of g c3n4 based membranes 2 2 template assisted assembly different from the above exfoliation strategies anisotropic assembly of building molecules into a quasi 2d structure provides an appealing way for the large scale synthesis of g c3n4 nanosheets zhang et al 2015a generally either hard or soft templates could be used for this bottom up assembly of g c3n4 yang et al synthesized of g c3n4 nanosheets fig 3 a using go derived porous silica nanosheets as hard templates and ethylenediamine and carbon tetrachloride as precursors for g c3n4 formation yang et al 2011a in that method the polymerization of ethylenediamine and carbon tetrachloride was nano confined by the nanosheet templates as a result the resulting g c3n4 nanosheets not only possessed a high nitrogen content thin thicknesses high surface areas and large aspect ratios but also exhibited enhanced electrical conductivity other than silica nanosheets layered clays have also been employed as hard templates for the fabrication of g c3n4 nanosheets jiang et al 2010 recently liu et al reported the fabrication of g c3n4 nanosheets via the controlled polycondensation of cyanamide on a diatom substrate liu et al 2013 different from the hard template method this soft template approach was more environmentally friendly since the avoidance of harmful chemicals to remove the hard templates similarly lu et al report a facile one step method to synthesize high quality g c3n4 nanosheets by heating the mixture of dicyandiamide and nh4cl at 550 c for 4 h the fast pyrolysis of nh4cl released numerous large bubbles which could act as dynamic gas template to mediate the solid state reactions during the formation of ultrathin nanosheets fig 3 b lu et al 2014 as obtained g c3n4 nanosheets with 3 1 nm thickness possessed superior photocatalytic activity than that of bulk g c3n4 in short the template assisted synthesis as a facile and scalable synthetic approach should be given priority when it is necessary to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets with quasi 2d morphology in bulk to meet the requirements of large scale membrane fabrication 2 3 modification and functionalization thanks to the intrinsic π conjugated polymer function of g c3n4 and the abundant nh2 nh functional groups in its molecular structure some organic polymers containing specific groups and inorganic nanomaterials e g carbon based materials ag ago2 tio2 fe3o4 mn3o4 can be easily introduced into g c3n4 interlayer or anchored onto g c3n4 surface through hydrogen bonding acid base interactions electrostatic interactions and to realize the modification and functionalization of g c3n4 for instance ran et al modified g c3n4 with organics containing sulfonic acid groups so3h such as methyl blue mb evans blue eb and sulfonated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide sppo ran et al 2019 as an intercalation molecule so3h combine with the strand nitrogen atoms and nh2 nh groups in g c3n4 nanosheets via brønsted acid alkaline interaction fig 4 a which is beneficial for the opening of tightly packed layers and the constructing of highly stable 2d channels to sustain high pressure and harsh chemical environments the resulting g c3n4 based membranes embedded with so3h containing molecules exhibit two orders of magnitude improvements for water permeance 8867 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in contrast with original g c3n4 membranes the highly opened two dimensional morphology with enlarged surface area enables g c3n4 nanosheets to be an ideal host platform for the construction of nanocomposites zhang et al 2015a combining with other functional components to form heterojunction can further optimize the structural characteristics of g c3n4 and enable the obtained composite possesses the advantages of multiple components at the same time for example taking advantage of the difference in fermi level between p type ago2 and n type g c3n4 shen et al prepared g c3n4 ag ago2 composite with p n semiconductor heterojunction shen et al 2019 the modification of ag and ago2 significantly increase the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs and the responsiveness of g c3n4 in vis nir light thereby endowing g c3n4 ag ag2o composite with enhanced photocatalytic performance for the degradation of contamination under full spectrum light irradiation fig 4 b in addition carbon based materials such as graphene and its derivatives cnt usually have the same sp2 bonded π conjugated structure as g c3n4 nanosheet which enables g c3n4 carbon composite to be endowed intimate interfacial contact and compatible nanostructures which is conducive to the separation of electron hole pairs across the contacting interface for enhanced activity as shown in fig 4 c li et al 2017a constructed 2d 2d heterojunction between reduced graphene oxide rgo and g c3n4 with pda modifiers the superior electron transport property of rgo and outstanding hydrophilicity of pda endowed the rgo pda g c3n4 composite membranes with high photocatalytic retention efficiency and permeability in a word the targeted regulation and modification of the g c3n4 structure is not only conducive to the reasonable design of the g c3n4 based membranes but also enables the membranes to exert the best performance during the application 3 preparation methods of g c3n4 based membranes with a unique graphite like laminar structure flexibly adjustable interlayer spacing and pore structure as well as facilely tailored functionality polymeric g c3n4 has been considered as a strong candidate for the construction of next generation membranes so far a variety of technologies have been developed to prepare g c3n4 based membranes with excellent selectivity and permeability according to the latest research on this field g c3n4 could not only be made into self supporting membrane but also be assembled into a lamellar membrane through integrating with supporting substrates or embedded as nanofillers into organic polymer matrix to obtain hybrid membrane this section will introduce the common methods used to fabricate g c3n4 based membranes in detail 3 1 preparation of self supporting g c3n4 membranes the pioneering success of graphene based water treatment membranes have stimulated broad interests for the construction of self supporting g c3n4 membranes physical processes such as vapor deposition polymerization vdp and chemical vapor deposition cvd can be used to synthesize self supporting g c3n4 membranes for example the transformation of solid precursors into vapor precursors could facilitate the deposition of g c3n4 membranes on substrates wang et al 2019b fig 5 a illustrates the fabrication procedures of free standing and crack free g c3n4 membranes with a thickness of several hundred nanometers through the vdp method xiao et al 2018 using melamine as solid precursors the in situ thermal polymerization generated a yellowish transparent membrane on the glass surface which could be easily delaminated from the glass substrate without damage by soaking with water as shown in fig 5 b the membrane possessed a transparent and smooth surface with highly oriented layer structure parallel to the surface which could be used to manipulate the ions transportation and salinity gradient for energy conversion in another work liu et al used a novel template assisted method which was named as microcontact printing assisted access to prepared self supporting g c3n4 films liu et al 2015 in this strategy anodic aluminum oxide aao aqueous cyanamide solution and two pieces of fto or glass slide glass were used as the template precursor and substrates respectively typically aao membrane were placed between two substrates after impregnated with aqueous cyanamide solution the cyanamide vapor diffused along the template at the high temperature of 550 c and finally reached the substrates where they polymerize into g c3n4 film fig 5 c the free standing g c3n4 film with controlled thickness and microstructure could be easily obtained upon the removal of aao substrates fig 5 d e in short in order to reduce the mass transfer resistance and enhance the permeation flux the above mentioned vapor deposition and novel microcontact printing assisted access method are effective strategies to synthesize ultra thin self supporting g c3n4 membrane however current self supporting membranes generally have some problems such as weak chemical stability low mechanical strength and complex fabrication process therefore optimizing the existing preparation technology to obtain self supporting g c3n4 membranes with strong stability to satisfy the requirements of practical applications is a direction worthy of exploration in the future 3 2 preparation of g c3n4 lamellar membranes with supporting substrates integrating g c3n4 lamellar films with supporting substrates provides a promising way to improve the mechanical strength and stability of g c3n4 based membranes inorganic aao membranes wang et al 2017c wang et al 2018b and several polymer membranes such as polyacrylonitrile pan membranes li et al 2019c polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes ran et al 2019 shi et al 2019 polycarbonate pc membranes wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018c and mixed cellulose ester mce membranes cai et al 2020 liu et al 2018 have been used as supporting substrates to prepare g c3n4 based membranes the porous skeleton of these membranes can not only facilitate the formation of consecutive g c3n4 lamellar membrane but also play a synergistic role for optimizing the membrane performance through the facile vacuum or pressure assisted filtration processes g c3n4 nanosheets dispersed in water or some special solvents can be deposited onto different base membranes to form well ordered g c3n4 coating in this strategy the thickness of composite membranes can be easily adjusted by changing the volume or concentration of membrane fabrication solutions therefore it is one of the most frequently used methods for the construction of g c3n4 membranes for example zhou et al prepared an ultrathin g c3n4 membrane by vacuum filtration of g c3n4 nanosheets suspension on anodized alumina oxide support the obtained membrane gave full play to the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 which possessed good removal effect on a variety of organic dyes zhou et al 2016 hydrogen bonding are the primary binding force between membrane substrate and g c3n4 coating layers formed by vacuum filtration which is relatively weak and easy to fracture to solve this problem li et al 2019c vacuum filtered the g c3n4 dispersion onto porous pan substrates and then formed a stable coating on g c3n4 membrane surface through a cross linking reaction of polyvinyl alcohol pva and glutaraldehyde ga fig 6 a the existence of cross linking layer not only enhances the mechanical strength of g c3n4 layer but also resist the adsorption of pollutants on the membrane soft self assembly routes exhibit unique advantages for the large scale assembly fabrication of functional membranes because of the spontaneous organization of molecules into well defined aggregates with a significant order parameter under equilibrium conditions liu et al 2018 tevis et al 2011 yang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016b our groups recently constructed a novel g c3n4 membrane with photo fenton activity and self cleaning ability by filtering the mixture of hydrolyzed g c3n4 sol solution and fe containing polyoxometalates fe poms solution onto pc membrane lan et al 2019 intermolecular hydrogen bonding between g c3n4 nanofibers played an important role for the repolymerization of hydrolyzed molecules into dense and solid membranes and the intercalated fe poms not only acted as molecular linkers to facilitate connections of g c3n4 nanofibers but also provided new opportunities for the catalytic functionality of g c3n4 based hybrid membrane in addition vacuum filtration also provides a new idea for the assembly of 0d nanoparticles membranes for example wang et al fabricated a novel 0d 2d composite membrane by filtrating 2d g c3n4 nanosheet solution onto aao support under vacuum followed by the vacuum deposition of 0d fe oh 3 nanoparticles fig 4 b wang et al 2018b due to the electrostatic interactions between fe oh 3 and g c3n4 porous g c3n4 layer acted as an ideal interlayer medium for the uniform distribution immobilization of fe oh 3 nanoparticle the resulting fe oh 3 g c3n4 composite membrane prepared by this approach displayed outstanding separation performance for dye removal because of the g c3n4 layer with high water permeance and uniform pores formed between nanoparticles in conclusion vacuum pressure assisted filtration is a facile and fast approach to prepare highly ordered and uniform g c3n4 layered membranes on the supporting substrate however a large amount of diluted g c3n4 suspension is generally required in this method which might hinder the large scale fabrication of g c3n4 based membranes in addition further efforts should be devoted to improve the bonding force between g c3n4 layer and base as well as the swelling resistance of the lamellar membrane in different solvents 3 3 preparation of g c3n4 hybrided membranes due to its potential to synergistically combine the easy processability of polymers and the unique structure features and catalytic activity of g c3n4 the preparation of g c3n4 hybrided membranes through incorporating g c3n4 and its composites into traditional polymer membranes materials are attracting increasingly attraction unlike g c3n4 layered membranes prepared by vacuum filtration g c3n4 hybrided membranes fabricated by immobilizing g c3n4 in the matrix of organic polymers commonly exhibited relatively high mechanical strength and swelling resistance due to the strong interfacial interactions between g c3n4 and polymer bulk the family of g c3n4 hybridized membranes has grown rapidly in recent years the methods used for membrane fabrication can be summarized as follows 3 3 1 blending blending is an important class of design strategies for g c3n4 based membranes especially for g c3n4 based mixed matrix membranes mmms simple operation and easily scale up application are the typical advantages of this method moreover in contrast to the lamellar membranes with bare g c3n4 layer g c3n4 surrounded by polymers probably be much more stable which confer the long term stability to such g c3n4 based membranes two methods have been developed to design g c3n4 based mmms one is substrate based blending and the other is substrate free blending substrate based blending was widely used to prepare g c3n4 based mmms for liquid separation especially for pervaporation some porous membranes such pan membranes and pes membranes are commonly applied as support of obtained hybrid membranes to improve their strength and stability the implementation of this method usually involves three steps a mixing g c3n4 with polymer dopes to obtain uniform casting solution b casting the solution onto the porous support by spin coating to form a thin film c removing the solution through drying or curing treatment li et al 2017c after these processes thin g c3n4 based mmms could be formed on the surface of porous supports it is worth noting that the mixing ratio of g c3n4 to polymer usually affects the structure and properties of as obtained mmms for example cao et al firstly prepared g c3n4 based mmms with excellent water permeability and separation properties for water ethanol mixture separation by introducing g c3n4 nanosheets into hydrophilic polymeric sodium alginate sa matrix cao et al 2015 in the hybrid membranes oh and cooh groups of sa interacted weakly with nh2 and nh groups of g c3n4 through intramolecular hydrogen bonds li et al 2013 as the content of g c3n4 nanosheets increased the cross section of sa g c3n4 hybrid membranes demonstrated a well aligned lamellar structure due to the restack of adjacent nanosheets caused by surface activation energy but excessive concentration will cause the local disordered of nanosheet alignments fig 7 referring to this method wang et al used 2d g c3n4 nanosheets as inorganic fillers pva as polymer matrix and succinic acid as crosslinking agent to fabricate cpva g c3n4 pervaporation membranes on the surface of pan and pes ultrafiltration membranes by the solution blending and coating process wang et al 2017b the resulting cpva g c3n4 hybrid membrane with the average thickness of 50 μm showed both high swelling resistance and mechanical stability due to the interfacial interactions among g c3n4 succinic acid and pva matrix in order to further improve the compatibility of g c3n4 with polymer matrix wang et al combined polydopamine modified g c3n4 pda o g c3n4 nanosheets with pva polymer matrix to construct novel hybrid pervaporation membranes wang et al 2018a the existence of flexible chemical bonds between pva polymer and pda o g c3n4 nanosheets could effectively increase the number of water selective channels in the hybrid membrane and adjust the hydrophilic hydrophobic balance of polymeric membranes thereby enhanced its permeability and selectivity substrate free blending usually show more flexible applications in designing g c3n4 based mmms because it is not limited by the material of porous support in the actual water purification process different from the substrate based blending method the casting solution is cast onto nonporous supports e g glass plates and stainless steel plates to ensure that the membrane can be peeled off from the substrate after phase conversion gang et al mixed g c3n4 with sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek casting solution and cast the mixed solution onto glass plates gang et al 2016 after a series of vacuum drying and cooling processes the free standing g c3n4 speek nanocomposite membrane was obtained by peeled off from the plate it is worth mentioning that in the blending process the phase change can not only be caused by the solvent evaporation but also can be induced by the non solvent guillen et al 2011 for example wang et al used reduced graphene oxide rgo modified g c3n4 nanosheets cn rgo as a modifier to prepared pes cn rgo membranes by non solvent induced phase inversion wang et al 2015 the casting solution was obtained by added cn rgo into a mixed solvent containing pes after casting the resulting solution on a glass pane with a casting knife and partial evaporation of the solvent for 20 s the membrane was immersed into deionized water non solvents to induce phase inversion appropriate amount of cn rgo could increase the exchange rate of solvent nonsolvent and thus favor the pore formation however the conventional method of blending fillers with polymer solution and then phase conversion will inevitably lead to the maldistribution of nano fillers and the possible blocking of membrane channels to overcome this problem li et al 2019a developed a novel magnetically induced freezing casting method to assist the preparation of g c3n4 based mmms the preparation process of the membrane is shown in fig 8 firstly magnetic fe3o4 particles were in situ precipitated on g c3n4 surface and thus was employed to induce g c3n4 moving to the membrane surface under magnetic field subsequently fe3o4 g c3n4 pvdf membranes fcms were obtained by a directional freezing casting technique combined with phase inversion the orderly latticed macroporous structure significantly facilitated the light absorption performance of g c3n4 and the interfacial affinity for pollutant rejection overall blending method have been demonstrated to be an effective and straightforward strategy to prepare g c3n4 based mmms duo to its merits of simple highly reproducibility and easy to scale up through three steps of mixing with polymer casting solution solution casting and phase inversion g c3n4 and its composites can be easily introduced into polymer matrix which allows the fabrication and modification of polymer membranes to proceed simultaneously it should be noted that nanosized g c3n4 particles may be released from embedded hybrid membranes leading to a decrease in the performance of membranes and causing harmful effects to the environment therefore reducing or avoiding the leaching of g c3n4 materials from polymeric membranes is the focus of blending methods that need to be improved in the future 3 3 2 interfacial polymerization interfacial polymerization ip process is a classical method to generate ultrathin active polyamide pa layer through making two monomers react on the surface of polymer substrate introducing highly hydrophilic g c3n4 into the pa layer of tfc is one of the effective means to form high performance tfn membranes due to the nanoscale particle sizes along with porous structure of g c3n4 the properties of pa layer in terms of morphology tortuosity and thickness can be remarkably affected upon g c3n4 incorporation besides the embedded g c3n4 can provide more channels for transportation while selectively intercept hydrated cations thereby endowing the hybrid membrane with a high permeability without compromising the selectivity for example gao et al dispersed acidified g c3n4 nanosheets acn into m phenylenediamine mpd aqueous solution which was used to fabricate acn incorporated pa layer by interfacial polymerization between mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc gao et al 2017 the acn embedded tfn membranes exhibited excellent water permeability and antifouling capability however the incompatibility between the nanoparticles and polymers will lead to the aggregation of g c3n4 in pa layer this phenomenon would hinder the reaction between monomers during interfacial polymerization forming a defective pa layer which resulting in the degraded performance of tfn membranes to further improve the dispersion of g c3n4 nanosheets in the pa layer and enhance the interfacial interactions interfacial polymerization between piperazine pip and tmc was adopted to fabricate tfn membranes by incorporating surface modified g c3n4 nanosheets with different types of functional groups such as cooh so3h and oh into pa active layer shahabi et al 2020 among them the modified membranes with cooh functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited optimal water permeation and salt rejection performance atomic force microscope afm fig 9 and contract angle characterizations proved that functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets could significantly reduce the surface roughness and increase the hydrophilicity of membranes thus improved the permeation performance of membranes in fact introducing g c3n4 or functionalized g c3n4 into pa active layer via ip process have been widely accepted as an effective way to improve the performance of tfc membranes by combining the benefits of g c3n4 nanoarchitectures with tfc membranes the g c3n4 modified tfn membranes usually exhibited dramatically increased permeance and salt rejection compared with unmodified membranes however the easy aggregation of g c3n4 nanoparticles in the pa layers and the weak bonding force between g c3n4 and pa matrix will potentially impair the selectivity and stability of membranes which are the main challenge for the preparation of tfn membranes thus future research should focus on rationally tuning the size and morphology of g c3n4 particles and optimizing its distribution within polymer matrix as well as enhancing the structural stability of g c3n4 based tfn membranes 3 4 other preparation methods for g c3n4 based membrane the performance of g c3n4 based membranes is closely related to the development of preparation technologies which can significantly influence the physicochemical properties including structure and mechanical strength operational stability and actual separation efficiency in addition to the above mentioned relatively mature membrane preparation strategies some emerging preparation methods have been utilized to prepare g c3n4 based composite membranes for instance zhang et al assembled g c3n4 quantum dots into tio2 nanotube array tna via a potentiostatic anodization method achieving the g c3n4 tna membranes with visible light driven photocatalytic activity attributed to the straight channels and highly self ordered arrangements as well as the high porosity of 72 as obtained g c3n4 tna membranes exhibited an enhanced anti fouling ability and permeate flux during filtering water containing escherichia coli under visible light irradiation zhang et al 2017b electrospinning technique is a classical method to synthesize nanofibers from a viscous polymeric solution and recently this method has been successfully utilized to fabricate g c3n4 incorporated nanofibrous membrane for instance alias et al fabricated a novel g c3n4 nanofiber coated al2o3 hollow fiber membrane nf nsgcn al2o3 membranes by coating g c3n4 nanosheet embedded pan nanofiber on top of al2o3 hollow fiber membrane through an electrospinning process followed by thermal treatment alias et al 2019 the distinctive characteristics including sparse mesh structure high water affinity and smooth nanofiber morphology endowed the as obtained hollow fiber membrane with high permeability and rejection fouling resistance and self cleaning performance for oilfield produced water treatment 4 molecular dynamic simulation of g c3n4 based membrane in recent year molecular dynamics md simulations have been widely used to optimize the structure of g c3n4 based membranes as well as explain and predict their separation performance based on the md simulations analysis zou et al found that hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and g c3n4 nanosheets affected the diffusion of water molecules in the channels of g c3n4 membranes zou et al 2019 thus benzene doped g c3n4 membranes were developed to facilitate the water permeation because the hydrogen bond between water molecules in it had a shorter lifetime than original g c3n4 membranes fig 10 a for the pervaporation process the separation performance largely depends on the preferential adsorption and diffusion of water molecules through the membrane md simulations calculated that the diffusion coefficients of water and ethanol through g c3n4 lamellar were 2 24 10 5 cm2 s 1 and 1 04 10 5 cm2 s 1 respectively which reasonably confirmed that the lamellar structures of g c3n4 nanosheets were efficient in the separation of ethanol and water zou et al 2019 in another research by comparing the md simulation results of water and n hexane through g c3n4 nanosheets with artificial nanopores wang et al confirmed the ultra low friction of water passing through g c3n4 membrane duo to the faster velocities of water molecules through two layered g c3n4 nanosheets than that of n hexane molecules fig 10 b e wang et al 2017c this finding also provides a new understanding of fluidics in nanochannels 5 application of g c3n4 based membranes as an emerging material for energy conversion and environmental restoration g c3n4 has displayed vast application potentials for the development of high performance membranes many efforts have been made to explore g c3n4 based membranes for water purification as summarized in table 1 3 benefitted from the tailorable structure of g c3n4 nanosheets the performances of g c3n4 hybridized membranes in some aspects have exceeded that of conventional membranes in particular with inherent catalytic property the introduction of g c3n4 could endow the water treatment membranes with multi functions properties such as the in situ catalytic degradation of pollutants and anti fouling performance from this viewpoint it even has some advantages over the graphene based water purification membranes 5 1 pervaporation pervaporation is an effective molecular scale process for liquid separation due to the similarities in size and other physical properties of separated molecules the fabrication of pervaporation membranes with both high permeability and high selectivity remains a big challenge especially for the dense polymeric membranes bolto et al 2011 geise et al 2011 recent studies have evidenced that embedding g c3n4 into hydrophilic polymer matrix could significantly improve the separation performance of pervaporation membranes and most of g c3n4 pervaporation membranes are employed in ethanol dehydration cao et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2017b for example cao et al reported the preparation and application of highly water selective sa cns pan membranes whose separation and permeation performance for ethanol dehydration was superior to the sa based membranes reported in the other literatures cao et al 2014 gao et al 2014a magalad et al 2010 yeom et al 1996 yeom and lee 1998a yeom and lee 1998b zhao et al 2014 for the membranes with 3 wt g c3n4 the permeation flux could reach 2469 g m 2 h 1 while the separation factor was up to1653 for 90 wt ethanol water mixtures at 75 c besides due to the contribution of g c3n4 to the thermal stability and mechanical property of sa such g c3n4 hybridized membranes showed strong thermal stability at 215 c and the tensile strength reached up to 120 mpa shi et al 2014 in wang et al s research cpva g c3n4 pan membrane with the g c3n4 content of 0 2 g exhibited an outstanding pervaporation performance with a permeation flux of 6632 g m 2 h 1 and a separation factor of 30 7 for the dehydration of 90 wt ethanol aqueous at 75 c wang et al 2017b in another study researchers further improved the separation factor of hybrid membranes from 32 4 to 57 9 by changing the binding force between polymer inorganic interface from hydrogen bonds cpva g c3n4 to flexible chemical bonds cpva pda o g c3n4 while the total flux still maintained at a high level of 2328 g m 2 h 1 fundamentally there are several reasons for the outstanding water selective performance of dense polymeric membranes modified by g c3n4 nanosheets or functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets in pervaporation firstly as revealed in fig 11 g c3n4 nanosheets formed horizontal and orderly queued alignment in the hybrid membranes constructing ordered channels for water transportation due to their ultrathin 2d morphology and the high aspect ratio secondly the nanoporous structure of g c3n4 nanosheets led to the molecular sieving effect the preferential permeation of water molecules over ethanol molecules led to the high selectivity thirdly interfacial interactions arisen from the hydrogen bonds between residual nh nh2 groups of g c3n4 nanosheets and oh cooh groups of hydrophilic polymers decreased the crystallinity of polymer matrix and enhanced the permeation flux cao et al 2015 wang et al 2017b that is g c3n4 hybrided membranes are candidates with promising applications in the ethanol dehydration 5 2 desalination desalination has been considered as one of the most effective ways to cope with the increasingly serious water pollution and the shortage of fresh water resources guan et al 2020 the integration of g c3n4 with ultra thin separation layer or porous substrate layer of tfc membranes could effectively improve the desalination performance during nf ro and fo operations chen et al firstly reported the application of tfn nf membranes modified by g c3n4 nanosheets for desalination in their work g c3n4 nanosheets was introduced into the pip aqueous solution and incorporated into the pa layer through the interfacial polymerization reaction between pip and tmc compared to the unmodified membranes tfn membranes containing 0 0025 wt g c3n4 nanosheets presented a distinct increased water flux from 20 9 l m 2 h 1 to 37 6 l m 2 h 1 at 2 bar while the rejection of na2so4 was maintained above 84 0 chen et al 2016 besides the antifouling property of pa g c3n4 hybrid membranes was much better than that of unmodified pa membranes this improvement was ascribed to the uniform distribution of g c3n4 nanosheets on the membrane surface which significantly improved the hydrophilicity roughness density of negative charges and thermal stability of membranes beyond that gao et al found that tfn membranes embedded with g c3n4 tfn acn possessed supreme ro performance compared with the unmodified tfc membranes gao et al 2017 with the increase of acn concentration from 0 to 50 mg l 1 water flux of tfn membranes increased from 25 1 to 45 0 l m 2 h 1 under the operating pressure of 16 bar while the nacl rejection was still maintained at a high level 98 6 the increased permeation flux of tfn acn50 membranes was mainly attributed to the excellent dispersion of acn with defect rich topological structure which significantly improved the surface hydrophilicity of hybrid membranes and offered additional nanochannels between acn and polymer interface for water permeation mahdavi et al 2017 yu et al 2006 in addition the ro performance of membrane can be further improved by introduced functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets due to their high hydrophilicity and good compatibility for example shahabi et al fabricated tfn ro membranes by adding g c3n4 nanosheets with different hydrophilic groups into the pa separation layer shahabi et al 2020 tfn membrane embedded with cooh modified g c3n4 nanosheets showed the maximum pure water flux of 91 84 l m 2 h 1 and a relatively high saline solution flux of 60 0 l m 2 h 1 as well as satisfactory nacl rejection of 98 1 the addition of functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets introduced more negative charges on the surface which led to the enhanced antifouling capacity against bovine serum albumin bsa and natural organic foulants the ro performance of as prepared tfn ro membranes modified with functionalized g c3n4 are superior to the tfn ro membranes modified with other nanomaterials farahbakhsh et al 2017 hegab et al 2015 kim et al 2014 zhao and ho 2014 fo has long been considered as an effective technology with low cost and high water recovery for water treatment and desalination to further improve the quality of purified water great efforts have also been devoted to exploring g c3n4 hybridized fo membranes rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 2018 wei et al 2011 rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 2018 proved that the modification of pa selective layer by g c3n4 could effectively enhance the performance of typical fo membranes in their work the introduction of g c3n4 nanoparticles into the pa layer led to the formation of nearly super hydrophilic surface which significantly improved the fo water flux to 18 88 l m 2 h 1 without increasing reverse solute flux besides a selective layer with high rejection of dissolved solutes the optimization of substrate materials is also critically important for fo membranes ma et al 2013 sotto et al 2012 tiraferri et al 2011 wang et al 2012a hence wang et al used cn rgo to modify the pes substrate for the construction of novel tfc membranes wang et al 2015 compared to the control membranes without modification tfc membranes with 0 5 wt cn rgo in the substrate showed significant improvement in the osmotic water flux 41 4 l m 2 h 1 which could be attributed to the modified structure of the porous substrates and the enhanced wettability specifically the addition of appropriate concentration of cn rgo alleviated the internal concentration polarization icp thus led to the high water flux su and chung 2011 through these studies we can reasonably believe that in order to improve the performance of the fo membrane pa layer should be reasonably designed and functionalized and distinct modification routes should also be explored to better enhance the compatibility of g c3n4 and polymers 5 3 oil water separation the oil pollution resulted from petrochemical metallurgical food textile and leather processing has caused the great harm to water environment membrane filtration is thought to be a potential strategy to achieve the oil in water separation owing to its lower energy cost and high oil removal efficiency tanudjaja et al 2019 with large surface area and super hydrophilic characteristic graphene oxide go is usually considered as a promising 2d material for the construction of oil water separation membranes huang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 however the conventional go based membranes suffer from serious fouling caused by the adsorption and deposition of foulants on the surface of membrane leading to the high mass transfer resistance and performance degradation chen et al 2017 gao et al 2014b yu et al 2015 recent studies indicated that the integration of g c3n4 with oil water separation membranes could not only effectively alleviate the above problems but also endow them self cleaning property with the assistance of sunlight cai et al 2020 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2019 this is because that g c3n4 incorporated into the membranes can play the role of photocatalyst to effectively degrade oil contaminants accumulated on the membrane surfaces thus recovered the underwater superoleophobicity of membranes for example shi et al developed a novel membrane by filtrating the mixture of go nanosheets and mcu c3n4 onto pvdf support membranes using ga as crosslinker shi et al 2019 the increased permeation flux and enhanced separation performance of go mcu c3n4 pvdf composite membranes for oil in water separation could be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing of go nanosheets by adding mcu c3n4 and the promoted underwater superhydrophilicity of the water membrane interface zhan et al 2018 under visible light irradiation h and active radicals such as o2 and oh generated by the excitation of go mcu c3n4 composite could effectively degrade the oil pollutants on the surface membranes into small molecule without pollution and the degraded products could easily self detached from the membrane surfaces thus mitigating the problem of permeate flux reduction caused by the pollution of membranes cai et al 2020 when the ratio of go to muc c3n4 was 2 1 the composite membranes possessed much higher frr 92 36 and lower irreversible fouling resistance rir ratio 8 under visible light irradiation compared to go pvdf membranes in another work liu et al fabricated go g c3n4 tio2 membranes through intercalating g c3n4 tio2 0d 2d heterostructures into adjacent go nanosheets fig 12 a liu et al 2018 the increased interlayer distance of go nanosheets from 0 81 to 5 62 nm promoted the permeation flux of go g c3n4 tio2 membranes to a higher lever 4536 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the hydrophilicity of hierarchically assembled go nanosheets and the photocatalysis capability of g c3n4 tio2 endowed the composite membranes with superoleophobicity underwater and outstanding self cleaning property frr 95 after ten cycles fig 12 b c similarly graphene oxide palyorskite graphene carbon nitride bismuth oxycarbonate go pg cn boc 2d heterostructure membranes were fabricated by cai et al which displayed high flux 4600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and efficiency 99 9 for the separation of oil water emulsions cai et al 2020 all these results demonstrated that the integration of photoactive g c3n4 with 2d go offers a promising approach to construct high performance membranes for oil water separation 5 4 dye removal the textile dyeing wastewater is one of the most challenging industrial wastewater which contains a mass of toxic azo dyes and inorganic salts such as nacl and na2so4 tremendous effort has been directed to synthesizing g c3n4 based membranes for removing harmful dyes from textile wastewater wang et al fabricated a membrane with artificial nanopores and self supporting spacers by assembling 2d g c3n4 nanosheets in a stack with elaborate structure fig 13 a wang et al 2017c the membrane exhibited considerable separation performance with a water permeance of 29 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection rate of 87 for 3 nm eb molecules permeation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the artificial nanopores in the g c3n4 nanosheets and the spacers between the partially exfoliated g c3n4 nanosheets provided nanochannels for water transport with ultralow friction more importantly the self supporting nanochannels in the g c3n4 membranes are very stable and rigid enough to resist changes in ph and pressure conditions the interlayer insertion of some special molecules or ions can effectively adjust the width of the nanochannels between 2d g c3n4 nanosheets thereby improving the water flux of membranes for example wang et al used cheap commercial polymer polyacrylic acid paa to tune the nanochannels formed between the g c3n4 nanosheets the abundant carboxyl groups of paa bonded with the nh groups of the g c3n4 nanosheets through hydrogen bonds in the g c3n4 paa hybrid membranes fig 13 b wang et al 2018c when the mass ratio of paa and g c3n4 nanosheets was 0 1 the water flux and rejection for eb molecules were determined to 117 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 83 respectively compared with the pure g c3n4 the water flux of g c3n4 paa hybrid membrane was enhanced by 147 without considerably sacrificing the rejection rate and antifouling properties in addition to the effect of pore size screening the charge interaction between dye molecules and membranes is also an important factor affecting the separation performance for g c3n4 based composite membranes the water flux in the treatment of dye wastewater is closely related to the charging characteristics of dye molecules as reported by wang et al fe oh 3 g c3n4 composite membranes demonstrated a pure water permeance of 48 l m 2 h 1 bar 1and a molecular weight cut off mwco of 800 da wang et al 2018b the permeance maintained nearly 90 when filtrating positively charged rhodamine b rhb and methylene blue meb molecules while the permeance is only 50 of the pure water permeance when filtrating negatively charged eb and mb molecules the decreased water permeance was ascribed to partial obstruction of pores on positively charged fe oh 3 layer by negatively charged molecules huang et al 2013 interestingly g c3n4 hybirdized membranes have also demonstrated great application potential for the desalination of textile dyeing wastewater ye et al described the fabrication of high flux nf membranes through the bio inspired co deposition of hydrophilic g c3n4 nanosheets and polydopamine polyethylenimine pda pei layer onto porous ultrafiltration substrates fig 13 c ye et al 2019 the optimized membranes exhibited high permeability 28 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ultrahigh retention of dyes 610 630 da 99 3 and salt rejection 2 9 for nacl and 7 6 for na2so4 these results can be attributed to the incorporation of g c3n4 nanosheets effectively accelerates the polymerization behavior of pda and pei thereby changing the structure of the membrane surface and finally breaking through the permeability selectivity trade off effect therefore the bio inspired membranes provided competitive and practical alternatives for the purification of high salt textile wastewater 5 5 g c3n4 based catalytic membranes membranes fabricated with catalytic materials afford membranes with multiple functions such as degradation of pollutants and self cleaning li et al 2020 however conventional commercial polymers have no catalytic property and some of them polymers are vulnerable to oxidation by oh radical attacks on the contrary robust g c3n4 with inherent photocatalytic activity and chemical resistance property provides a new opportunity for the construction of catalytic membranes zeng et al 2020 benefitted from the visible light response of g c3n4 the integration of membrane separation and photocatalysis has become the most representative application of g c3n4 based membranes chi et al 2019 li et al 2017a shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016a in this process g c3n4 based photocatalytic membranes reject pollutants through membrane filtration and degrade them by photocatalysis at the same time the reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidation such as oh and o2 generated by g c3n4 and its composite photocatalysts under visible light play the key role in the degradation of organics taking advantage of the strong and broad light absorption of c3n4 ag ag2o heterojunctions shen et al developed a novel cf c3n4 ag ag2o filtration cloth the filter membrane shaped photocatalysts could photodegrade 97 of acid orange ao7 after eight grade reactors shen et al 2019 it is worth mentioned that the porous structure of membranes usually has a positive contribution to the photocatalytic activity because of the large specific surface area and high light absorption ability the enhanced mass transfer of contaminant molecules in the porous structure also facilitates the photodegradation zhang et al 2018a based on this principle li et al 2019a fabricated a novel fe3o4 g c3n4 pvdf blending membrane with ordered macroporous structure and extremely high porosity 88 5 as developed membranes exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity 97 8 removal efficiency of rhb high water flux 15835 2 l m 2 h 1 under 0 1mpa and satisfactory anti fouling performance 2 38 bsa adsorption the application of g c3n4 based membranes for the treating of water contaminated by multiple pollutants has also been attempted for instance li et al 2017a preparedsss rgo pda g c3n4 composite membranes for the treatment of dye contaminated oily water the nearly 100 rejection of soluble organic dyes and the in situ degradation by photocatalysis resulted in the continuous and simultaneous flow through separation of oil water emulsion and water purification in one device membrane fouling seriously restricts the application of membrane technology in water treatment biofouling is one of the most serious obstacles for the maintenance of membrane performance during the filtration process under light irradiation the antibacterial ability of g c3n4 plays an important role in alleviating or even eliminating the biofouling on the membrane surface li et al 2019c found that the pan membranes functionalized by g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited nearly 100 disinfection efficiency for escherichia coli e coli ros such as h2o2 and photogenerated o2 and oh generated from g c3n4 nanosheets under visible light is responsible for the bacterium cell inactivation fig 14 a since the higher charge carrier separation is conducive to produce more ros heterostructured photocatalysts should exhibit stronger bactericidal activity therefore in the research of zhao et al the g c3n4 ns rgo ca membranes effectively removed more than six log units of e coli zhao et al 2016a in addition to biofouling organic fouling caused by the deposition of natural organic matter nom on the membrane surface during filtration process could also severely weaken the membrane performance truong et al have confirmed that the c3n4 wo3 nano sheet composite nscw21 could be applied as a visible light active photocatalyst to degrade nom and this photocatalyst exhibited high adsorption and degradation performance for the typical humus components in nom truong et al 2020 when combining with ultrafiltration the removal of nom in the overall system would be significantly improved to 91 and an alleviation in membrane fouling were achieved fig 14 c all these research results provide strong support for the g c3n4 based photocatalytic membrane as a multifunctional membrane with excellent anti fouling performance for practical applications fast degradation efficiency is of great importance for the industrial application of g c3n4 based catalytic membranes besides photocatalysis the combination of physical separation and other advanced oxidation processes such as peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation h2o2 and fenton reactions as well as electrochemical oxidation provide vast potentials for developing high performance catalytic membranes as presented in table 2 these attempts resulted in the synergistic improvements for the degradation of organic pollutant membrane fouling mitigation disinfection and the inhibition of disinfection by products the addition of carbonaceous materials into g c3n4 based membranes can not only improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes but also provides new opportunities for electrochemical degradation of pollutants for this purpose wang et al prepared g c3n4 cnts al2o3 membranes through sequentially coating cnts layer and g c3n4 layer onto al2o3 support membranes wang et al 2017d the composite membranes doped with 0 5 mg ml 1 cnt was used for the electrochemically enhanced removal of phenol as presented in fig 15 a a positive voltage could effectively extract the photogenerated electrons from irradiated g c3n4 layer thus obviously improved the performance of g c3n4 based membranes for pollutant removal with a voltage of 1 0 v the removal rate of phenol over electrochemical enhanced photocatalytic membranes was 2 7 times and 10 1 times higher than those of photocatalytic filtration membranes and physical filtration alone respectively in our recent work the synergistic contribution of photocatalytic degradation and fenton like oxidation to the catalytic performance of self assembled g c3n4 based membranes has been investigated the uniform intercalation of fe containing polyoxometalates fe pom clusters into g c3n4 membranes not only improved the separation of photo induced charge carriers but also brought about versatile fenton like activity for the activation of h2o2 wang et al 2018a our photo fenton like membranes exhibited excellent pollutant rejection performance 99 97 8 removal efficiency of cr high water permeation flux 80 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and self catalytic ability for degrading intercepted pollutants fig 15 b as a consequence of light irradiation and h2o2 addition such photo fenton like membranes presented steady water flux and good rejection ability during the continuous operation activation of pms has been considered as one of the most effective methods for removing organic pollutants from water because of the generation of highly oxidizing active species chen et al 2020a oh and lim 2019 zhao et al 2017 the integration of contaminant interception and pms evolved oxidation over g c3n4 based membranes has been reported for example mn3o4 cnns ptfe catalytic membranes with 150 mg g c3n4 nanosheets cnns could remove 90 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp bpa and rhb after 60 min with the addition of 1mm pms while only 10 of 4 cp could be removed over the same period by polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes via physical adsorption chen et al 2020a as illustrated in fig 15 c the redox cycles of mn iv mn iii mn ii on the mn3o4 surface was the main reason for the activation of pms it is worth mentioned that the activity of this membrane could be easily restored by the solve thermal treatment in ethanol suggesting the good potential of mn3o4 cnns 150 ptfe membranes for treatment of actual wastewater 5 6 energy production in recent years the energy water nexus of the water supply has become a focus of the water treatment research in fact water could be considered a source of power since contaminated water contains plentiful organic matters membrane based systems could effectively capture energy from natural and wastewaters thus provides a new opportunity for the sustainable water treatment g c3n4 has emerged as a promising material for the development of new energy conversion systems proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs represented by direct methanol fuel cell dmfc and vanadium redox flow battery vrb have attracted an increasing attention due to their high efficiency and environmental benign nature as the core component of pemfcs proton exchange membranes pems should have high proton conductivity good mechanical and thermal stability and low fuel crossover wang et al 2017a niu et al 2017 however the commonly used nafion membranes and some sulfonated aromatic polymers membranes such as sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek and sulfonated poly aryl ether sulfone spaes are far from satisfactory due to their high fuel permeability short duration and poor mechanical strength dong et al 2017 introducing g c3n4 or modified g c3n4 into polymer matrix is an effective strategy to reduce the membrane fuel permeability and improve its mechanical strength for instance velayutham et al used surface functionalized g c3n4 s gcn as an effective filler to modify the nafion membrane for dmfcs application velayutham and sahu 2018 the proton transfer in the nafion s gcn hybrid membranes was enhanced by the acid base interactions between nh2 groups of s gcn and so3h groups of hybrid membranes fig 16 a the nafion s gcn hybrid membrane with an optimized filler content exhibited a proton conductivity of 183 ms cm 1 which was about 36 higher in relation to the pristine nafion membranes due to the enhanced movement of hydronium ions porous g c3n4 nanosheets in the hybrid membranes could act as a barrier for methanol molecules the dmfc comprising nafion s gcn 0 5 wt hybrid membranes delivered an enhanced peak power density of 125 mw cm 2 at 70 c under ambient pressure which was much higher than that of the pristine nafion membranes 65 mw cm 2 fig 16 b gang et al fabricated speek nanocomposite membranes filled with g c3n4 nanosheets for improving the performance of proton exchange membranes in the dmfc gang et al 2016 the proton conductivity was increased from 0 0606 s cm 1 of the speek control membrane to 0 0786 s cm 1 of the speek g c3n4 nanocomposite membrane when the content of g c3n4 nanosheets was 0 5 wt at 20 c owing to the molecular sieving effect caused by periodic vacancies in the lattice of g c3n4 the methanol permeability decreased significantly at room temperature in addition the speek composite membranes modified with phosphotungstic acid carbon nitride nanosheets hpw g c3n4 also exhibited enhanced potential for dmfc application dong et al 2017 the selectivity of speek hpw g c3n4 membranes doped with 1 0 wt g c3n4 nanosheets was 2 3 and 1 5 times higher than those of speek hpw membranes and pristine speek membranes respectively moreover in the presence of g c3n4 nanosheets speek hpw g c3n4 hybrid membranes exhibited superior mechanical property with maximum elongation at break of 223 3 and it could operate stably for 240 h at 60 c vrb is another important energy storage system due to the fast response time long cycle life and deep discharge capability wang et al 2017a niu et al 2017 the proton exchange membranes modified with g c3n4 have also been extensively explored for vrb applications niu et al confirmed that the incorporation of g c3n4 nanosheets could effectively improve the ion selectivity vanadium ion permeation and structure stability of hybrid membranes niu et al 2017 as a result the acid base pairs between nh2 groups of g c3n4 and so4h of speek promoted the proton transport and restricted the vanadium ion permeation the vrb assembled with speek g c3n4 1 5 hybrid membranes exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency ce 97 and energy efficiency ee 83 6 at 30 ma cm 2 to further improve the performance of pems in vrb wang et al fabricated speek composite membranes modified by oxidized g c3n4 ocn wang et al 2017a they found that the hydrophilic groups on the surface of ocn were conducive to the construction of hydrophobic hydrophilic separation structure by forming hydrogen bonds with polymer chains in the hybrid membranes niu et al 2017 furthermore the carboxyl groups at the defects of ocn could form proton jumping sites which was favorable for the improvement of proton conductivity qiu et al 2017 the ocn speek hybrid membranes with 1 ocn showed the lowest vanadium ion permeability 9 09 10 7 cm2 min 1 and the highest ion selectivity 6 60 104 smin cm 3 the vrb equipped with this membrane exhibited a higher coulombic efficiency 98 than nafion 117 membrane 95 at 60 ma cm 2 g c3n4 has also been adopted to improve the performance of h2 o2 fuel cells ingabire et al introduced g c3n4 based nanocomposite tio2 g c3n4 into spaes polymers which endowed the hybrid membranes with enhanced proton conductivity good mechanical and dimensional stability as well as improved oxidative and hydrolytic stability in comparison with the control spaes membranes ingabire et al 2020a similarly the quaternary aminated poly arylene ether sulfone qpaes modified with tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite system also exhibited remarkable performance during the test of h2 o2 fuel cell ingabire et al 2020b the qpaes tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes containing 0 45 wt tio2 g c3n4 showed a hydroxide conductivity of 43 8 ms cm 1 at 80 c they could absorb water as high as 88 7 but expand less than 13 in in plane direction of membranes besides the qpaes tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes also displayed high oxidative stability and good stability in alkaline solution at 60 c for 240 h at least this performance improvement was ascribed to the strong interfacial interactions between qpaes and tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposites the h2 o2 fuel cell assembled with this membrane showed a maximum power density at 64 3 mw cm 2 under a current density of 131 2 ma cm2 at 80 c ions transport through confined space with characteristic dimensions comparable to the debye length has widely applications in water desalination dialysis and energy conversion xiao et al 2018 the ultrathin free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes obtained by vapor deposition polymerization and chemical vapor deposition have excellent nano fluidic ion transport properties ionic transport through the free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes was similar as that of the bulk electrolyte solution besides the surface charge governed ion transport also endowed g c3n4 membranes with the function of converting salinity gradients into electric energy fig 16 c d with the advantages of low cost facile fabrication and supporting high ionic currents free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes provides an alternative platform for the development of new energy conversion systems and ionic devices 6 outlook and future works the tailorable structure and the inherent catalytic activity of g c3n4 provide a broad range of unprecedented opportunities for its application in the field of environmental remediation the potential of using g c3n4 membranes for wastewater treatment and freshwater preparation is vivid due to their unique and multifunctional properties although great progresses have been made in this field in recent years the study of g c3n4 based membranes is still in its infant stage for their practical applications several critical issues needed to be considered regulation of g c3n4 nanoarchitecture to improve its dispersibility and stability in special solvents is critical for the rational design of membrane in spite of the exfoliation of bulk g c3n4 into 2d ultrathin nanosheets provides an approachable way to tailor its structure for membrane preparation the low yield of ultrathin g c3n4 nanostructures is the intrinsic shortcoming of most exfoliation strategies new material strategy is highly desirable for the mass production of homogeneous g c3n4 dispersion in a facial low cost and environmental friendly way in addition the structural evolution law of g c3n4 molecules during physicochemical treatment should be explored in more detailed so as to better optimize the tailoring methods of g c3n4 it is worthy noting that the performance of lamellar membranes is highly dependent on the lateral size of 2d materials specifically the impact of lateral size of go flakes on the membrane performance have been reported by several groups it was found that smaller go flakes could minimize the defects of membrane separation layer thereby produced a higher membrane flux and selectivity akther et al 2020 li et al 2021 nie et al 2020 however the influence of g c3n4 lateral size on the morphology and performance of membranes is yet to be investigated constructing shorter and less tortuous transport pathways for water or other solvent molecules by controlling the lateral dimension will expand new ideas for membrane design and maximize the separation capacity of membranes therefore in the further research it is meaningful to improve the membrane performance by modulating the physical properties of 2d g c3n4 rather than solely chemical tailoring of nanomaterials furthermore the molecular transport behavior through the nanoporous g c3n4 membranes and the separation mechanism need to be fundamentally investigated for membranes preparation hybridizing g c3n4 with traditional polymer membranes is a common method to construct g c3n4 membranes but the presence of organic components inevitably affect the catalytic performance of g c3n4 materials in addition the ros produced by g c3n4 may accelerate the aging of polymer matrix which leads to a significant decrease in the durability of membranes under continuous exposure to light therefore self supporting g c3n4 membranes with both physical filtration and photocatalysis properties should be more attractive for this direction researchers need to put an emphasis on the development of more cost effective and feasible technology to realize the large scale preparation of self supporting g c3n4 membranes and endow membranes with sufficient mechanical strength and stability during the long term operation in addition to the above mentioned the bottom up assembly of g c3n4 membranes is still an exploited field with abundant amine groups the self assembly behavior of g c3n4 nanostructures can provide an industrially approachable approach to prepared high performance water treatment membranes however more fundamental insights into the self assembly mechanism are urgently needed in addition the framework defects caused by the nonuniform deposition of g c3n4 nanosheets during stacking process may affect the molecular transport behavior and membrane separation performance precisely controlling the structure and morphology of self assembled membranes is of both scientific and technical importance for the practical applications in terms of application g c3n4 based membranes have been widely applied in various environment and energy related separation processes but several challenges are still remained to be overcome firstly due to the excellent catalytic properties of g c3n4 improving the synergistic effect between physical filtration photocatalysis and other advanced oxidation processes has always been the research hotspot of g c3n4 membranes however the degradation of organic pollutants during the processes of physical filtration and photocatalysis inevitably generate some intermediate products which may penetrate membranes and get into the filtration so far there is little attention paid to the formation and toxicity of degradation intermediates in the permeate solution future research is required to comprehensively evaluate the permeate quality and further elucidate the degradation pathway of pollutants secondly up to now most of the current experiments on the evaluation of g c3n4 membranes are restricted to ideal simulated solutes with laboratory scale dead end filtration units and the external factors affecting the membrane performance are not completely understood consequently more studies on the separation performance and structure stability of g c3n4 membranes in acidic basic conditions in complex feed solutions and at high temperatures are required moreover new methods for regulating the performance of g c3n4 based membranes should be developed for different applications finally owing to the nano size g c3n4 and its nanocomposite materials may be released from membranes into retentate and permeate streams resulting in a potential threat to the environment and organisms in this regard exploring the effective approaches to achieve no minimal leaching of nano materials from membrane matrix is necessary meanwhile the concentration of g c3n4 and its composites in the permeate solution should be continuously monitored over long term operating conditions to avoid secondary environmental pollution 7 conclusions this article reviews the latest research progress of metal free g c3n4 as promising polymeric materials to construct the next generation of separation membranes for water purification structure tailoring exhibits more prominent advantages to obtain 2d g c3n4 nanosheets with improved dispersibility and stability in special solvents for membrane fabrication chemical exfoliation has emerged as an efficient method to regulate the lateral size surface area and reactive sites of g c3n4 several strategies such as vapor deposition microcontact printing assisted access vacuum filtration blending interfacial polymerization potentiostatic anodization and electrospinning can be utilized to prepare g c3n4 based membranes the incorporation of g c3n4 can not only introduce ordered channels for fast water transportation but also improve the hydrophilicity chemical structure stability mechanical strength and swelling resistance of membranes its inherent

castro muñoz 2020 the discharge of industrial wastewater brings about large quantities of heavy metals and synthetic pollutants leading to the continuous deterioration of water quality in order to deter the environmental risk of contaminated water various conventional and advanced treatment methods have been applied for water purification hayat et al 2017 jiao et al 2017 pintor et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 among these approaches membrane based technologies have been considered as one of the most promising ways owing to the advantages of versatile efficient economical low energy intensive and easy for operation goh and ismail 2015 koros and zhang 2017 most importantly besides water treatment membrane processes provide a sustainable way to augment the water supply by combining with the technologies of new energy generation so far membrane filtration systems such as pressure driven seawater and brackish water reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro have been widely employed in drinking water production desalination water reuse and wastewater treatment ali et al 2020 anand et al 2018 meng et al 2020 qasim et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 emerging electrically driven membrane processes represented by electrodialysis and electrophoresis further promote the application of membrane technology in combating water issues zhu and jassby 2019 essentially the performance of water treatment membranes is strongly related to the physicochemical characteristics of membrane materials therefore the core task of membrane technology is exploring appropriate materials for membrane fabrication wei et al 2018 by far various of polymeric and ceramic materials have been used to fabricate water treatment membranes because of the rich resources low price and tailorable structures macromolecule polymers predominate raw materials for membrane construction after all polymer membranes are currently the most mature commercial system in the forefront of desalination and wastewater treatment hendrik 2012 samaei mohsen et al 2018 zakrzewska trznadel 2013 compared to organic polymers inorganic ceramic materials possess obvious advantages such as good chemical stability mechanical strength and fouling resistance thus ceramic membranes are more suitable for challenging water purification processes such as oil water separation pharmaceutical wastewater and liquid radioactive waste treatment chen et al 2020b despite great progresses have been achieved either polymeric or ceramic materials are confronted with inherent shortages for industrial applications for example organic polymeric materials have deficient resistance to heat and long term ageing while inorganic materials suffer from poor corrosion resistance and high production cost this has brought about technical dilemmas of membranes for practical water purification such as the unavoidable membrane fouling and the trade off between separation efficiency and water permeability goh and ismail 2017 currently many efforts are being pursued in alleviating the above difficulties such as the construction of thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes and mixed matrix membranes mmms by combining the unique properties of polymer substrates and inorganic fillers to enhance the sustainable application of polymer membranes kumar et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the preparation of low cost ceramic membranes with cheap clay and organic pore making agents to promote the prevalence of ceramic membranes hamdi et al 2016 hubadillah et al 2017 nevertheless it is still a huge challenge to obtain a kind of membrane with satisfactory cost high selectivity high permeability superior stability and antifouling ability advances in nanotechnology brings about new opportunities for the development of membrane science and technology in recent years numerous nanostructured materials have been explored for membrane synthesis such as gold nanocrystal he et al 2015 carbon nanotubes cnts li et al 2019b graphene derivatives anand et al 2018 wei et al 2018 mxenes al hamadani et al 2020 metal organic frameworks mofs wang et al 2019a and zeolites dong et al 2016 the multifunction of nanomaterials endows as developed membranes modified by these nanomaterials with improved surface hydrophilicity unique surface charge as well as anti scaling and antibacterial properties liu et al 2019a with earth abundant and environmental friendly components carbon based materials shows remarkable advantages over other types of nanomaterials for high separation efficiency via different permeation mechanisms anand et al 2018 taken the mostly focused graphene as an example it has been reported that water molecules could flow through the two dimensional 2d channels with nearly zero friction joshi et al 2014 nair et al 2012 however the high cost of materials the technological challenge in large scale membranes manufacturing as well as the limited structure stability have become the main significant barriers to slow down the adoption of graphene based membranes cheng et al 2020 cohen tanugi and grossman 2014 goh et al 2016 therefore new type of carbonaceous nanomaterials are highly desirable for the development of high performance water treatment membranes due to the facile and inexpensive synthesis procedures outstanding physicochemical stability and unique catalytic properties polymeric g c3n4 with a graphene like structure is attracting more and more attention in environmental remediation and energy conversion kessler et al 2017 liu et al 2019b g c3n4 is composed of 2d layered structure and the neighboring layers are held together by weak van der waals interactions triazine c3n3 and tri s triazine c6n7 are the two fundamental tectonic units for establishing g c3n4 fig 1 ong et al 2016 wang et al 2012b in which tri s triazine based g c3n4 is deemed as the most stable g c3n4 form with regularly distributed triangular nanopores 3 11 å throughout the entire laminar structure both the laminar structure and triangular nanopores contribute to the fast permeation of small molecules h2o h2 and so on and the effective retention of larger molecules tian et al 2016 zou et al 2019 furthermore g c3n4 generally possesses a defect rich structure that is generated by thermal condensation these defects with the size of 3 1 3 4 å can shorten the transmission path and endow g c3n4 to be more water permeable lotsch et al 2007 in contrast to the conjugated double bonds in the tri s triazine units the weaker single bond of tertiary amino n c 3 makes it easy to eliminate the tri s triazine units in g c3n4 so that the nanostructure of g c3n4 and transport path of different molecules can be further optimized wang et al 2017c moreover with the combination of inorganic and organic characteristics g c3n4 is wildly considered as an ideal material for photocatalytic membrane preparation the relatively narrow bandgap 2 7 ev and maximum absorption wavelength at about 460 nm fully improve the utilization of g c3n4 for visible light its capability of light energy conversion makes it possible to in situ degrade retained contaminants or generate new energy undoubtedly g c3n4 can provide an opportunity for the construction of next generation water treatment membranes with high separation efficiency and self cleaning ability although the applications of g c3n4 for environment catalysis have been well summarized by several groups comprehensive assess of the latest progress of g c3n4 based water purification membranes is rare in this critical review we begin with the fabrication and modification methods of g c3n4 based self supporting film and composite membranes we emphasized the material strategies used to regulate the structure of bulk g c3n4 for membrane fabrication the applications of g c3n4 based membranes in typical water purification processes have been elaborated finally some concluding remarks and perspective on the future development of g c3n4 based membranes are discussed 2 regulation strategies of g c3n4 molecule structures thermal polymerization of various of nitrogen contained precursors such as melamine urea and dicyanodiamide can be readily used to fabricate bulk g c3n4 however the large lateral size and low surface area ca 10 m2 g 1 with deficient surface functional groups of bulk g c3n4 result in its poor dispersibility in most solvent which in turn causes the difficulty in membrane preparation and the degradation of membrane performance kumru et al 2018 therefore from the perspective of membrane preparation structure tailoring of bulk g c3n4 is highly desirable to improve its dispersibility and stability in special solvents based on this idea g c3n4 nanosheets with ultrathin 2d nanostructures are wildly accepted as the most suitable candidate materials for membranes preparation two approaches have been developed to prepare g c3n4 nanosheets one is top down exfoliation treatment that is stripping layered g c3n4 solids into free standing nanosheets and other is bottom up template assisted synthesis in which organic molecules are anisotropic assembled into g c3n4 in a 2d manner in addition modification and functionalization are also effective strategies for structure regulation of g c3n4 which can further improve its inherent shortcomings of limited visible light absorption and high recombination rate of photo generated carriers thereby improving the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 and giving fully play the multifunctionality of g c3n4 based membranes 2 1 exfoliation treatment owing to the typical layered structural features of g c3n4 three commonly used exfoliation approaches including thermal oxidation etching ultrasonication assisted liquid exfoliation and chemical exfoliation have been applicated to stripping bulk g c3n4 solid into 2d nanosheets with significant reduced dimension 2 1 1 thermal oxidation etching the research on the structure of g c3n4 by lotsch et al have convincingly confirmed that there are not only strong c n covalent bonds in each layer of g c3n4 but also hydrogen bonding between strands of polymeric melon units with nh nh2 groups and these medium strong planar hydrogen bonding could be easily broken by oxidation lotsch et al 2007 based on the principle niu et al prepared g c3n4 nanosheets by the direct thermal oxidation etching of bulk g c3n4 solids in air niu et al 2012 the holding time of thermal treatment played an important role in the delamination and the layer thickness of g c3n4 layers could be reduced to a desired nanoscale by the layer by layer thermal etching process fig 2 a shows a typical g c3n4 nanosheet after thermal etching at 500 c for 2 h the thickness of 2 nm corresponds to 6 7 layers of g c3n4 monolayers using this strategy cao et al synthesized a new type of g c3n4 filler to fabricate polymeric nanocomposite membranes cao et al 2015 chen et al 2016 easy operation low cost and environmental friendliness are the outstanding merits of this thermal etching method however this vapor based route suffers from the low yield 6 of exfoliated products moreover the generation of structural defects during thermal exfoliation might cause the deceleration of membrane performance 2 1 2 ultrasonication assisted liquid exfoliation inspired by the synthesis of graphene oxide liquid exfoliation routes have been intensively adopted to fabricate ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets zhang et al firstly reported that bulk g c3n4 can be effectively delaminated into 2d nanosheets in some solvents with the help of continuous ultrasonication fig 2 b zhang et al 2013 yang et al confirmed that isopropanol ipa and acetone could be used as liquid medium to strip g c3n4 layers into nanosheet with a lateral dimension of microscale and a thickness of 2 nm yang et al 2013 owing to the absence of any high temperature treatment or oxidation process the resultant g c3n4 nanosheets can retain the original structure and chemical stoichiometric ratio to further improve the quality of exfoliated nanosheets water based mixed solvents such as ipa h2o ethanol h2o dimethyl formamide h2o and tetrahydrofuran h2o have been used as the liquid mediums through adjusting the volume ratio of solvents the thickness of 2d g c3n4 nanosheets can be further reduced to 0 38 nm thus yielded high quality g c3n4 suspension with excellent stability for membrane fabrication lin et al 2015 with respect to this strategy increasing the yield of g c3n4 nanosheets and shortening the treatment time is essential for the large scale applications 2 1 3 chemical exfoliation acid etching is an efficient technique to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets with good dispersibility mineral acids such as hcl and h2so4 are commonly used to protonate bulk g c3n4 solids the stranded nitrogen atoms can act as receptor sites to promote the insertion of acids making polymeric matrix expanded and stratified ma et al 2014 xu et al 2013 for instance g c3n4 nanosheets with a lateral size of several micrometers and a single atomic thickness of 0 4 nm were fabricated by h2so4 treatment xu et al 2013 the protonation of g c3n4 by hcl was further combined with the ultrasonic stripping process forming ultrathin nanosheets with large specific surface area 305 m2 g 1 and excellent stability of water dispersion ma et al 2014 this protonation process can not only shorten the ultrasonication time from 10 h to 2 h but also significantly improve the yield of the product 25 30 du et al developed an efficient method for the large scale fabrication of acidified g c3n4 they found that strong acid high temperature and anhydrous environment were the three key factors for the exfoliation and acidification of g c3n4 du et al 2015 after the successive treatment by anhydrous h2so4 and hcl fig 2 c acidified g c3n4 exhibited the characteristics of a poly ammonium salt and could be dissolved in several solvents with good dissolution recrystallization reversible equilibrium besides the ph value and temperature dependent solubility of the acidified g c3n4 make it possible to recycle these nanosheets through low temperature crystallization followed by filtration besides acid assisted route bulk g c3n4 can also be exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets under suitable alkaline conditions li et al 2019d when mixed with alkaline solution such as koh naoh and nh3 h2o the weak van der waals interactions between the layers of bulk g c3n4 could be easily destroyed by the inserted oh thus caused the complete delamination zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 at the same time partial nh2 groups connected with heterocyclic carbon atoms are replaced by oh due to the electrophilic substitution between oh and heterocyclic carbon atoms leading to the originally neutral g c3n4 nanosheets would become somewhat negatively charged as reported the hydrophilic and negatively charged oxygen related functional groups are favorable for the dispersion of g c3n4 in water or some special solvents without aggregation based on this mechanism li et al 2017b obtained a transparent colloidal solution of g c3n4 nanosheets by the continuous treatment of bulk g c3n4 with koh aqueous solution 5 0 m at 80 c for 24 h as shown in fig 2 d the interactions between oh and terminal or bridged nh2 groups of the triazine units in bulk g c3n4 decreased the bonding energy between different layers and promoted the delamination this led to the formation of nanosheets with a large lateral size of hundred nanometers and a thickness of 0 4 nm interestingly after the neutralization of hcl electrolyte solution g c3n4 nanosheets could be re assembled into multilayered structure with recovered crystallinity and chemical features this further demonstrated the amphiphilicity of g c3n4 nanosheets fabricated by chemical exfoliation interestingly chemical exfoliation process can introduce specific functional groups at the edges of the g c3n4 nanosheets such as cooh and oh the functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets with hydrophilic groups should play an irreplaceable role in improving the membrane flux and preventing membrane fouling in conclusion exfoliation treatment can not only decrease the material size to nanoscale and even sub nanometer scale but also endow them with high specific surface and reactive sites which is widely accepted as a facile controlled pathway to obtain well defined g c3n4 nanosheets with improved dispersibility for membrane fabrication among the various exfoliation strategies mentioned above chemical exfoliation is usually regarded as a sol processing of bulk g c3n4 and the g c3n4 colloidal dispersion obtained by acid or alkali treatment usually exhibited more satisfactory flexibility and compatibility moreover the introduction of specific functional groups after chemical exfoliation endows g c3n4 nanosheets with more possibilities for compounding with other materials zhang et al 2015b therefore in comparison with other exfoliation strategies chemical exfoliation has more prominent advantages in the preparation of g c3n4 based membranes 2 2 template assisted assembly different from the above exfoliation strategies anisotropic assembly of building molecules into a quasi 2d structure provides an appealing way for the large scale synthesis of g c3n4 nanosheets zhang et al 2015a generally either hard or soft templates could be used for this bottom up assembly of g c3n4 yang et al synthesized of g c3n4 nanosheets fig 3 a using go derived porous silica nanosheets as hard templates and ethylenediamine and carbon tetrachloride as precursors for g c3n4 formation yang et al 2011a in that method the polymerization of ethylenediamine and carbon tetrachloride was nano confined by the nanosheet templates as a result the resulting g c3n4 nanosheets not only possessed a high nitrogen content thin thicknesses high surface areas and large aspect ratios but also exhibited enhanced electrical conductivity other than silica nanosheets layered clays have also been employed as hard templates for the fabrication of g c3n4 nanosheets jiang et al 2010 recently liu et al reported the fabrication of g c3n4 nanosheets via the controlled polycondensation of cyanamide on a diatom substrate liu et al 2013 different from the hard template method this soft template approach was more environmentally friendly since the avoidance of harmful chemicals to remove the hard templates similarly lu et al report a facile one step method to synthesize high quality g c3n4 nanosheets by heating the mixture of dicyandiamide and nh4cl at 550 c for 4 h the fast pyrolysis of nh4cl released numerous large bubbles which could act as dynamic gas template to mediate the solid state reactions during the formation of ultrathin nanosheets fig 3 b lu et al 2014 as obtained g c3n4 nanosheets with 3 1 nm thickness possessed superior photocatalytic activity than that of bulk g c3n4 in short the template assisted synthesis as a facile and scalable synthetic approach should be given priority when it is necessary to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets with quasi 2d morphology in bulk to meet the requirements of large scale membrane fabrication 2 3 modification and functionalization thanks to the intrinsic π conjugated polymer function of g c3n4 and the abundant nh2 nh functional groups in its molecular structure some organic polymers containing specific groups and inorganic nanomaterials e g carbon based materials ag ago2 tio2 fe3o4 mn3o4 can be easily introduced into g c3n4 interlayer or anchored onto g c3n4 surface through hydrogen bonding acid base interactions electrostatic interactions and to realize the modification and functionalization of g c3n4 for instance ran et al modified g c3n4 with organics containing sulfonic acid groups so3h such as methyl blue mb evans blue eb and sulfonated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide sppo ran et al 2019 as an intercalation molecule so3h combine with the strand nitrogen atoms and nh2 nh groups in g c3n4 nanosheets via brønsted acid alkaline interaction fig 4 a which is beneficial for the opening of tightly packed layers and the constructing of highly stable 2d channels to sustain high pressure and harsh chemical environments the resulting g c3n4 based membranes embedded with so3h containing molecules exhibit two orders of magnitude improvements for water permeance 8867 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in contrast with original g c3n4 membranes the highly opened two dimensional morphology with enlarged surface area enables g c3n4 nanosheets to be an ideal host platform for the construction of nanocomposites zhang et al 2015a combining with other functional components to form heterojunction can further optimize the structural characteristics of g c3n4 and enable the obtained composite possesses the advantages of multiple components at the same time for example taking advantage of the difference in fermi level between p type ago2 and n type g c3n4 shen et al prepared g c3n4 ag ago2 composite with p n semiconductor heterojunction shen et al 2019 the modification of ag and ago2 significantly increase the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs and the responsiveness of g c3n4 in vis nir light thereby endowing g c3n4 ag ag2o composite with enhanced photocatalytic performance for the degradation of contamination under full spectrum light irradiation fig 4 b in addition carbon based materials such as graphene and its derivatives cnt usually have the same sp2 bonded π conjugated structure as g c3n4 nanosheet which enables g c3n4 carbon composite to be endowed intimate interfacial contact and compatible nanostructures which is conducive to the separation of electron hole pairs across the contacting interface for enhanced activity as shown in fig 4 c li et al 2017a constructed 2d 2d heterojunction between reduced graphene oxide rgo and g c3n4 with pda modifiers the superior electron transport property of rgo and outstanding hydrophilicity of pda endowed the rgo pda g c3n4 composite membranes with high photocatalytic retention efficiency and permeability in a word the targeted regulation and modification of the g c3n4 structure is not only conducive to the reasonable design of the g c3n4 based membranes but also enables the membranes to exert the best performance during the application 3 preparation methods of g c3n4 based membranes with a unique graphite like laminar structure flexibly adjustable interlayer spacing and pore structure as well as facilely tailored functionality polymeric g c3n4 has been considered as a strong candidate for the construction of next generation membranes so far a variety of technologies have been developed to prepare g c3n4 based membranes with excellent selectivity and permeability according to the latest research on this field g c3n4 could not only be made into self supporting membrane but also be assembled into a lamellar membrane through integrating with supporting substrates or embedded as nanofillers into organic polymer matrix to obtain hybrid membrane this section will introduce the common methods used to fabricate g c3n4 based membranes in detail 3 1 preparation of self supporting g c3n4 membranes the pioneering success of graphene based water treatment membranes have stimulated broad interests for the construction of self supporting g c3n4 membranes physical processes such as vapor deposition polymerization vdp and chemical vapor deposition cvd can be used to synthesize self supporting g c3n4 membranes for example the transformation of solid precursors into vapor precursors could facilitate the deposition of g c3n4 membranes on substrates wang et al 2019b fig 5 a illustrates the fabrication procedures of free standing and crack free g c3n4 membranes with a thickness of several hundred nanometers through the vdp method xiao et al 2018 using melamine as solid precursors the in situ thermal polymerization generated a yellowish transparent membrane on the glass surface which could be easily delaminated from the glass substrate without damage by soaking with water as shown in fig 5 b the membrane possessed a transparent and smooth surface with highly oriented layer structure parallel to the surface which could be used to manipulate the ions transportation and salinity gradient for energy conversion in another work liu et al used a novel template assisted method which was named as microcontact printing assisted access to prepared self supporting g c3n4 films liu et al 2015 in this strategy anodic aluminum oxide aao aqueous cyanamide solution and two pieces of fto or glass slide glass were used as the template precursor and substrates respectively typically aao membrane were placed between two substrates after impregnated with aqueous cyanamide solution the cyanamide vapor diffused along the template at the high temperature of 550 c and finally reached the substrates where they polymerize into g c3n4 film fig 5 c the free standing g c3n4 film with controlled thickness and microstructure could be easily obtained upon the removal of aao substrates fig 5 d e in short in order to reduce the mass transfer resistance and enhance the permeation flux the above mentioned vapor deposition and novel microcontact printing assisted access method are effective strategies to synthesize ultra thin self supporting g c3n4 membrane however current self supporting membranes generally have some problems such as weak chemical stability low mechanical strength and complex fabrication process therefore optimizing the existing preparation technology to obtain self supporting g c3n4 membranes with strong stability to satisfy the requirements of practical applications is a direction worthy of exploration in the future 3 2 preparation of g c3n4 lamellar membranes with supporting substrates integrating g c3n4 lamellar films with supporting substrates provides a promising way to improve the mechanical strength and stability of g c3n4 based membranes inorganic aao membranes wang et al 2017c wang et al 2018b and several polymer membranes such as polyacrylonitrile pan membranes li et al 2019c polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes ran et al 2019 shi et al 2019 polycarbonate pc membranes wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018c and mixed cellulose ester mce membranes cai et al 2020 liu et al 2018 have been used as supporting substrates to prepare g c3n4 based membranes the porous skeleton of these membranes can not only facilitate the formation of consecutive g c3n4 lamellar membrane but also play a synergistic role for optimizing the membrane performance through the facile vacuum or pressure assisted filtration processes g c3n4 nanosheets dispersed in water or some special solvents can be deposited onto different base membranes to form well ordered g c3n4 coating in this strategy the thickness of composite membranes can be easily adjusted by changing the volume or concentration of membrane fabrication solutions therefore it is one of the most frequently used methods for the construction of g c3n4 membranes for example zhou et al prepared an ultrathin g c3n4 membrane by vacuum filtration of g c3n4 nanosheets suspension on anodized alumina oxide support the obtained membrane gave full play to the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 which possessed good removal effect on a variety of organic dyes zhou et al 2016 hydrogen bonding are the primary binding force between membrane substrate and g c3n4 coating layers formed by vacuum filtration which is relatively weak and easy to fracture to solve this problem li et al 2019c vacuum filtered the g c3n4 dispersion onto porous pan substrates and then formed a stable coating on g c3n4 membrane surface through a cross linking reaction of polyvinyl alcohol pva and glutaraldehyde ga fig 6 a the existence of cross linking layer not only enhances the mechanical strength of g c3n4 layer but also resist the adsorption of pollutants on the membrane soft self assembly routes exhibit unique advantages for the large scale assembly fabrication of functional membranes because of the spontaneous organization of molecules into well defined aggregates with a significant order parameter under equilibrium conditions liu et al 2018 tevis et al 2011 yang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016b our groups recently constructed a novel g c3n4 membrane with photo fenton activity and self cleaning ability by filtering the mixture of hydrolyzed g c3n4 sol solution and fe containing polyoxometalates fe poms solution onto pc membrane lan et al 2019 intermolecular hydrogen bonding between g c3n4 nanofibers played an important role for the repolymerization of hydrolyzed molecules into dense and solid membranes and the intercalated fe poms not only acted as molecular linkers to facilitate connections of g c3n4 nanofibers but also provided new opportunities for the catalytic functionality of g c3n4 based hybrid membrane in addition vacuum filtration also provides a new idea for the assembly of 0d nanoparticles membranes for example wang et al fabricated a novel 0d 2d composite membrane by filtrating 2d g c3n4 nanosheet solution onto aao support under vacuum followed by the vacuum deposition of 0d fe oh 3 nanoparticles fig 4 b wang et al 2018b due to the electrostatic interactions between fe oh 3 and g c3n4 porous g c3n4 layer acted as an ideal interlayer medium for the uniform distribution immobilization of fe oh 3 nanoparticle the resulting fe oh 3 g c3n4 composite membrane prepared by this approach displayed outstanding separation performance for dye removal because of the g c3n4 layer with high water permeance and uniform pores formed between nanoparticles in conclusion vacuum pressure assisted filtration is a facile and fast approach to prepare highly ordered and uniform g c3n4 layered membranes on the supporting substrate however a large amount of diluted g c3n4 suspension is generally required in this method which might hinder the large scale fabrication of g c3n4 based membranes in addition further efforts should be devoted to improve the bonding force between g c3n4 layer and base as well as the swelling resistance of the lamellar membrane in different solvents 3 3 preparation of g c3n4 hybrided membranes due to its potential to synergistically combine the easy processability of polymers and the unique structure features and catalytic activity of g c3n4 the preparation of g c3n4 hybrided membranes through incorporating g c3n4 and its composites into traditional polymer membranes materials are attracting increasingly attraction unlike g c3n4 layered membranes prepared by vacuum filtration g c3n4 hybrided membranes fabricated by immobilizing g c3n4 in the matrix of organic polymers commonly exhibited relatively high mechanical strength and swelling resistance due to the strong interfacial interactions between g c3n4 and polymer bulk the family of g c3n4 hybridized membranes has grown rapidly in recent years the methods used for membrane fabrication can be summarized as follows 3 3 1 blending blending is an important class of design strategies for g c3n4 based membranes especially for g c3n4 based mixed matrix membranes mmms simple operation and easily scale up application are the typical advantages of this method moreover in contrast to the lamellar membranes with bare g c3n4 layer g c3n4 surrounded by polymers probably be much more stable which confer the long term stability to such g c3n4 based membranes two methods have been developed to design g c3n4 based mmms one is substrate based blending and the other is substrate free blending substrate based blending was widely used to prepare g c3n4 based mmms for liquid separation especially for pervaporation some porous membranes such pan membranes and pes membranes are commonly applied as support of obtained hybrid membranes to improve their strength and stability the implementation of this method usually involves three steps a mixing g c3n4 with polymer dopes to obtain uniform casting solution b casting the solution onto the porous support by spin coating to form a thin film c removing the solution through drying or curing treatment li et al 2017c after these processes thin g c3n4 based mmms could be formed on the surface of porous supports it is worth noting that the mixing ratio of g c3n4 to polymer usually affects the structure and properties of as obtained mmms for example cao et al firstly prepared g c3n4 based mmms with excellent water permeability and separation properties for water ethanol mixture separation by introducing g c3n4 nanosheets into hydrophilic polymeric sodium alginate sa matrix cao et al 2015 in the hybrid membranes oh and cooh groups of sa interacted weakly with nh2 and nh groups of g c3n4 through intramolecular hydrogen bonds li et al 2013 as the content of g c3n4 nanosheets increased the cross section of sa g c3n4 hybrid membranes demonstrated a well aligned lamellar structure due to the restack of adjacent nanosheets caused by surface activation energy but excessive concentration will cause the local disordered of nanosheet alignments fig 7 referring to this method wang et al used 2d g c3n4 nanosheets as inorganic fillers pva as polymer matrix and succinic acid as crosslinking agent to fabricate cpva g c3n4 pervaporation membranes on the surface of pan and pes ultrafiltration membranes by the solution blending and coating process wang et al 2017b the resulting cpva g c3n4 hybrid membrane with the average thickness of 50 μm showed both high swelling resistance and mechanical stability due to the interfacial interactions among g c3n4 succinic acid and pva matrix in order to further improve the compatibility of g c3n4 with polymer matrix wang et al combined polydopamine modified g c3n4 pda o g c3n4 nanosheets with pva polymer matrix to construct novel hybrid pervaporation membranes wang et al 2018a the existence of flexible chemical bonds between pva polymer and pda o g c3n4 nanosheets could effectively increase the number of water selective channels in the hybrid membrane and adjust the hydrophilic hydrophobic balance of polymeric membranes thereby enhanced its permeability and selectivity substrate free blending usually show more flexible applications in designing g c3n4 based mmms because it is not limited by the material of porous support in the actual water purification process different from the substrate based blending method the casting solution is cast onto nonporous supports e g glass plates and stainless steel plates to ensure that the membrane can be peeled off from the substrate after phase conversion gang et al mixed g c3n4 with sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek casting solution and cast the mixed solution onto glass plates gang et al 2016 after a series of vacuum drying and cooling processes the free standing g c3n4 speek nanocomposite membrane was obtained by peeled off from the plate it is worth mentioning that in the blending process the phase change can not only be caused by the solvent evaporation but also can be induced by the non solvent guillen et al 2011 for example wang et al used reduced graphene oxide rgo modified g c3n4 nanosheets cn rgo as a modifier to prepared pes cn rgo membranes by non solvent induced phase inversion wang et al 2015 the casting solution was obtained by added cn rgo into a mixed solvent containing pes after casting the resulting solution on a glass pane with a casting knife and partial evaporation of the solvent for 20 s the membrane was immersed into deionized water non solvents to induce phase inversion appropriate amount of cn rgo could increase the exchange rate of solvent nonsolvent and thus favor the pore formation however the conventional method of blending fillers with polymer solution and then phase conversion will inevitably lead to the maldistribution of nano fillers and the possible blocking of membrane channels to overcome this problem li et al 2019a developed a novel magnetically induced freezing casting method to assist the preparation of g c3n4 based mmms the preparation process of the membrane is shown in fig 8 firstly magnetic fe3o4 particles were in situ precipitated on g c3n4 surface and thus was employed to induce g c3n4 moving to the membrane surface under magnetic field subsequently fe3o4 g c3n4 pvdf membranes fcms were obtained by a directional freezing casting technique combined with phase inversion the orderly latticed macroporous structure significantly facilitated the light absorption performance of g c3n4 and the interfacial affinity for pollutant rejection overall blending method have been demonstrated to be an effective and straightforward strategy to prepare g c3n4 based mmms duo to its merits of simple highly reproducibility and easy to scale up through three steps of mixing with polymer casting solution solution casting and phase inversion g c3n4 and its composites can be easily introduced into polymer matrix which allows the fabrication and modification of polymer membranes to proceed simultaneously it should be noted that nanosized g c3n4 particles may be released from embedded hybrid membranes leading to a decrease in the performance of membranes and causing harmful effects to the environment therefore reducing or avoiding the leaching of g c3n4 materials from polymeric membranes is the focus of blending methods that need to be improved in the future 3 3 2 interfacial polymerization interfacial polymerization ip process is a classical method to generate ultrathin active polyamide pa layer through making two monomers react on the surface of polymer substrate introducing highly hydrophilic g c3n4 into the pa layer of tfc is one of the effective means to form high performance tfn membranes due to the nanoscale particle sizes along with porous structure of g c3n4 the properties of pa layer in terms of morphology tortuosity and thickness can be remarkably affected upon g c3n4 incorporation besides the embedded g c3n4 can provide more channels for transportation while selectively intercept hydrated cations thereby endowing the hybrid membrane with a high permeability without compromising the selectivity for example gao et al dispersed acidified g c3n4 nanosheets acn into m phenylenediamine mpd aqueous solution which was used to fabricate acn incorporated pa layer by interfacial polymerization between mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc gao et al 2017 the acn embedded tfn membranes exhibited excellent water permeability and antifouling capability however the incompatibility between the nanoparticles and polymers will lead to the aggregation of g c3n4 in pa layer this phenomenon would hinder the reaction between monomers during interfacial polymerization forming a defective pa layer which resulting in the degraded performance of tfn membranes to further improve the dispersion of g c3n4 nanosheets in the pa layer and enhance the interfacial interactions interfacial polymerization between piperazine pip and tmc was adopted to fabricate tfn membranes by incorporating surface modified g c3n4 nanosheets with different types of functional groups such as cooh so3h and oh into pa active layer shahabi et al 2020 among them the modified membranes with cooh functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited optimal water permeation and salt rejection performance atomic force microscope afm fig 9 and contract angle characterizations proved that functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets could significantly reduce the surface roughness and increase the hydrophilicity of membranes thus improved the permeation performance of membranes in fact introducing g c3n4 or functionalized g c3n4 into pa active layer via ip process have been widely accepted as an effective way to improve the performance of tfc membranes by combining the benefits of g c3n4 nanoarchitectures with tfc membranes the g c3n4 modified tfn membranes usually exhibited dramatically increased permeance and salt rejection compared with unmodified membranes however the easy aggregation of g c3n4 nanoparticles in the pa layers and the weak bonding force between g c3n4 and pa matrix will potentially impair the selectivity and stability of membranes which are the main challenge for the preparation of tfn membranes thus future research should focus on rationally tuning the size and morphology of g c3n4 particles and optimizing its distribution within polymer matrix as well as enhancing the structural stability of g c3n4 based tfn membranes 3 4 other preparation methods for g c3n4 based membrane the performance of g c3n4 based membranes is closely related to the development of preparation technologies which can significantly influence the physicochemical properties including structure and mechanical strength operational stability and actual separation efficiency in addition to the above mentioned relatively mature membrane preparation strategies some emerging preparation methods have been utilized to prepare g c3n4 based composite membranes for instance zhang et al assembled g c3n4 quantum dots into tio2 nanotube array tna via a potentiostatic anodization method achieving the g c3n4 tna membranes with visible light driven photocatalytic activity attributed to the straight channels and highly self ordered arrangements as well as the high porosity of 72 as obtained g c3n4 tna membranes exhibited an enhanced anti fouling ability and permeate flux during filtering water containing escherichia coli under visible light irradiation zhang et al 2017b electrospinning technique is a classical method to synthesize nanofibers from a viscous polymeric solution and recently this method has been successfully utilized to fabricate g c3n4 incorporated nanofibrous membrane for instance alias et al fabricated a novel g c3n4 nanofiber coated al2o3 hollow fiber membrane nf nsgcn al2o3 membranes by coating g c3n4 nanosheet embedded pan nanofiber on top of al2o3 hollow fiber membrane through an electrospinning process followed by thermal treatment alias et al 2019 the distinctive characteristics including sparse mesh structure high water affinity and smooth nanofiber morphology endowed the as obtained hollow fiber membrane with high permeability and rejection fouling resistance and self cleaning performance for oilfield produced water treatment 4 molecular dynamic simulation of g c3n4 based membrane in recent year molecular dynamics md simulations have been widely used to optimize the structure of g c3n4 based membranes as well as explain and predict their separation performance based on the md simulations analysis zou et al found that hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and g c3n4 nanosheets affected the diffusion of water molecules in the channels of g c3n4 membranes zou et al 2019 thus benzene doped g c3n4 membranes were developed to facilitate the water permeation because the hydrogen bond between water molecules in it had a shorter lifetime than original g c3n4 membranes fig 10 a for the pervaporation process the separation performance largely depends on the preferential adsorption and diffusion of water molecules through the membrane md simulations calculated that the diffusion coefficients of water and ethanol through g c3n4 lamellar were 2 24 10 5 cm2 s 1 and 1 04 10 5 cm2 s 1 respectively which reasonably confirmed that the lamellar structures of g c3n4 nanosheets were efficient in the separation of ethanol and water zou et al 2019 in another research by comparing the md simulation results of water and n hexane through g c3n4 nanosheets with artificial nanopores wang et al confirmed the ultra low friction of water passing through g c3n4 membrane duo to the faster velocities of water molecules through two layered g c3n4 nanosheets than that of n hexane molecules fig 10 b e wang et al 2017c this finding also provides a new understanding of fluidics in nanochannels 5 application of g c3n4 based membranes as an emerging material for energy conversion and environmental restoration g c3n4 has displayed vast application potentials for the development of high performance membranes many efforts have been made to explore g c3n4 based membranes for water purification as summarized in table 1 3 benefitted from the tailorable structure of g c3n4 nanosheets the performances of g c3n4 hybridized membranes in some aspects have exceeded that of conventional membranes in particular with inherent catalytic property the introduction of g c3n4 could endow the water treatment membranes with multi functions properties such as the in situ catalytic degradation of pollutants and anti fouling performance from this viewpoint it even has some advantages over the graphene based water purification membranes 5 1 pervaporation pervaporation is an effective molecular scale process for liquid separation due to the similarities in size and other physical properties of separated molecules the fabrication of pervaporation membranes with both high permeability and high selectivity remains a big challenge especially for the dense polymeric membranes bolto et al 2011 geise et al 2011 recent studies have evidenced that embedding g c3n4 into hydrophilic polymer matrix could significantly improve the separation performance of pervaporation membranes and most of g c3n4 pervaporation membranes are employed in ethanol dehydration cao et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2017b for example cao et al reported the preparation and application of highly water selective sa cns pan membranes whose separation and permeation performance for ethanol dehydration was superior to the sa based membranes reported in the other literatures cao et al 2014 gao et al 2014a magalad et al 2010 yeom et al 1996 yeom and lee 1998a yeom and lee 1998b zhao et al 2014 for the membranes with 3 wt g c3n4 the permeation flux could reach 2469 g m 2 h 1 while the separation factor was up to1653 for 90 wt ethanol water mixtures at 75 c besides due to the contribution of g c3n4 to the thermal stability and mechanical property of sa such g c3n4 hybridized membranes showed strong thermal stability at 215 c and the tensile strength reached up to 120 mpa shi et al 2014 in wang et al s research cpva g c3n4 pan membrane with the g c3n4 content of 0 2 g exhibited an outstanding pervaporation performance with a permeation flux of 6632 g m 2 h 1 and a separation factor of 30 7 for the dehydration of 90 wt ethanol aqueous at 75 c wang et al 2017b in another study researchers further improved the separation factor of hybrid membranes from 32 4 to 57 9 by changing the binding force between polymer inorganic interface from hydrogen bonds cpva g c3n4 to flexible chemical bonds cpva pda o g c3n4 while the total flux still maintained at a high level of 2328 g m 2 h 1 fundamentally there are several reasons for the outstanding water selective performance of dense polymeric membranes modified by g c3n4 nanosheets or functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets in pervaporation firstly as revealed in fig 11 g c3n4 nanosheets formed horizontal and orderly queued alignment in the hybrid membranes constructing ordered channels for water transportation due to their ultrathin 2d morphology and the high aspect ratio secondly the nanoporous structure of g c3n4 nanosheets led to the molecular sieving effect the preferential permeation of water molecules over ethanol molecules led to the high selectivity thirdly interfacial interactions arisen from the hydrogen bonds between residual nh nh2 groups of g c3n4 nanosheets and oh cooh groups of hydrophilic polymers decreased the crystallinity of polymer matrix and enhanced the permeation flux cao et al 2015 wang et al 2017b that is g c3n4 hybrided membranes are candidates with promising applications in the ethanol dehydration 5 2 desalination desalination has been considered as one of the most effective ways to cope with the increasingly serious water pollution and the shortage of fresh water resources guan et al 2020 the integration of g c3n4 with ultra thin separation layer or porous substrate layer of tfc membranes could effectively improve the desalination performance during nf ro and fo operations chen et al firstly reported the application of tfn nf membranes modified by g c3n4 nanosheets for desalination in their work g c3n4 nanosheets was introduced into the pip aqueous solution and incorporated into the pa layer through the interfacial polymerization reaction between pip and tmc compared to the unmodified membranes tfn membranes containing 0 0025 wt g c3n4 nanosheets presented a distinct increased water flux from 20 9 l m 2 h 1 to 37 6 l m 2 h 1 at 2 bar while the rejection of na2so4 was maintained above 84 0 chen et al 2016 besides the antifouling property of pa g c3n4 hybrid membranes was much better than that of unmodified pa membranes this improvement was ascribed to the uniform distribution of g c3n4 nanosheets on the membrane surface which significantly improved the hydrophilicity roughness density of negative charges and thermal stability of membranes beyond that gao et al found that tfn membranes embedded with g c3n4 tfn acn possessed supreme ro performance compared with the unmodified tfc membranes gao et al 2017 with the increase of acn concentration from 0 to 50 mg l 1 water flux of tfn membranes increased from 25 1 to 45 0 l m 2 h 1 under the operating pressure of 16 bar while the nacl rejection was still maintained at a high level 98 6 the increased permeation flux of tfn acn50 membranes was mainly attributed to the excellent dispersion of acn with defect rich topological structure which significantly improved the surface hydrophilicity of hybrid membranes and offered additional nanochannels between acn and polymer interface for water permeation mahdavi et al 2017 yu et al 2006 in addition the ro performance of membrane can be further improved by introduced functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets due to their high hydrophilicity and good compatibility for example shahabi et al fabricated tfn ro membranes by adding g c3n4 nanosheets with different hydrophilic groups into the pa separation layer shahabi et al 2020 tfn membrane embedded with cooh modified g c3n4 nanosheets showed the maximum pure water flux of 91 84 l m 2 h 1 and a relatively high saline solution flux of 60 0 l m 2 h 1 as well as satisfactory nacl rejection of 98 1 the addition of functionalized g c3n4 nanosheets introduced more negative charges on the surface which led to the enhanced antifouling capacity against bovine serum albumin bsa and natural organic foulants the ro performance of as prepared tfn ro membranes modified with functionalized g c3n4 are superior to the tfn ro membranes modified with other nanomaterials farahbakhsh et al 2017 hegab et al 2015 kim et al 2014 zhao and ho 2014 fo has long been considered as an effective technology with low cost and high water recovery for water treatment and desalination to further improve the quality of purified water great efforts have also been devoted to exploring g c3n4 hybridized fo membranes rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 2018 wei et al 2011 rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 2018 proved that the modification of pa selective layer by g c3n4 could effectively enhance the performance of typical fo membranes in their work the introduction of g c3n4 nanoparticles into the pa layer led to the formation of nearly super hydrophilic surface which significantly improved the fo water flux to 18 88 l m 2 h 1 without increasing reverse solute flux besides a selective layer with high rejection of dissolved solutes the optimization of substrate materials is also critically important for fo membranes ma et al 2013 sotto et al 2012 tiraferri et al 2011 wang et al 2012a hence wang et al used cn rgo to modify the pes substrate for the construction of novel tfc membranes wang et al 2015 compared to the control membranes without modification tfc membranes with 0 5 wt cn rgo in the substrate showed significant improvement in the osmotic water flux 41 4 l m 2 h 1 which could be attributed to the modified structure of the porous substrates and the enhanced wettability specifically the addition of appropriate concentration of cn rgo alleviated the internal concentration polarization icp thus led to the high water flux su and chung 2011 through these studies we can reasonably believe that in order to improve the performance of the fo membrane pa layer should be reasonably designed and functionalized and distinct modification routes should also be explored to better enhance the compatibility of g c3n4 and polymers 5 3 oil water separation the oil pollution resulted from petrochemical metallurgical food textile and leather processing has caused the great harm to water environment membrane filtration is thought to be a potential strategy to achieve the oil in water separation owing to its lower energy cost and high oil removal efficiency tanudjaja et al 2019 with large surface area and super hydrophilic characteristic graphene oxide go is usually considered as a promising 2d material for the construction of oil water separation membranes huang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 however the conventional go based membranes suffer from serious fouling caused by the adsorption and deposition of foulants on the surface of membrane leading to the high mass transfer resistance and performance degradation chen et al 2017 gao et al 2014b yu et al 2015 recent studies indicated that the integration of g c3n4 with oil water separation membranes could not only effectively alleviate the above problems but also endow them self cleaning property with the assistance of sunlight cai et al 2020 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2019 this is because that g c3n4 incorporated into the membranes can play the role of photocatalyst to effectively degrade oil contaminants accumulated on the membrane surfaces thus recovered the underwater superoleophobicity of membranes for example shi et al developed a novel membrane by filtrating the mixture of go nanosheets and mcu c3n4 onto pvdf support membranes using ga as crosslinker shi et al 2019 the increased permeation flux and enhanced separation performance of go mcu c3n4 pvdf composite membranes for oil in water separation could be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing of go nanosheets by adding mcu c3n4 and the promoted underwater superhydrophilicity of the water membrane interface zhan et al 2018 under visible light irradiation h and active radicals such as o2 and oh generated by the excitation of go mcu c3n4 composite could effectively degrade the oil pollutants on the surface membranes into small molecule without pollution and the degraded products could easily self detached from the membrane surfaces thus mitigating the problem of permeate flux reduction caused by the pollution of membranes cai et al 2020 when the ratio of go to muc c3n4 was 2 1 the composite membranes possessed much higher frr 92 36 and lower irreversible fouling resistance rir ratio 8 under visible light irradiation compared to go pvdf membranes in another work liu et al fabricated go g c3n4 tio2 membranes through intercalating g c3n4 tio2 0d 2d heterostructures into adjacent go nanosheets fig 12 a liu et al 2018 the increased interlayer distance of go nanosheets from 0 81 to 5 62 nm promoted the permeation flux of go g c3n4 tio2 membranes to a higher lever 4536 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the hydrophilicity of hierarchically assembled go nanosheets and the photocatalysis capability of g c3n4 tio2 endowed the composite membranes with superoleophobicity underwater and outstanding self cleaning property frr 95 after ten cycles fig 12 b c similarly graphene oxide palyorskite graphene carbon nitride bismuth oxycarbonate go pg cn boc 2d heterostructure membranes were fabricated by cai et al which displayed high flux 4600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and efficiency 99 9 for the separation of oil water emulsions cai et al 2020 all these results demonstrated that the integration of photoactive g c3n4 with 2d go offers a promising approach to construct high performance membranes for oil water separation 5 4 dye removal the textile dyeing wastewater is one of the most challenging industrial wastewater which contains a mass of toxic azo dyes and inorganic salts such as nacl and na2so4 tremendous effort has been directed to synthesizing g c3n4 based membranes for removing harmful dyes from textile wastewater wang et al fabricated a membrane with artificial nanopores and self supporting spacers by assembling 2d g c3n4 nanosheets in a stack with elaborate structure fig 13 a wang et al 2017c the membrane exhibited considerable separation performance with a water permeance of 29 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection rate of 87 for 3 nm eb molecules permeation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the artificial nanopores in the g c3n4 nanosheets and the spacers between the partially exfoliated g c3n4 nanosheets provided nanochannels for water transport with ultralow friction more importantly the self supporting nanochannels in the g c3n4 membranes are very stable and rigid enough to resist changes in ph and pressure conditions the interlayer insertion of some special molecules or ions can effectively adjust the width of the nanochannels between 2d g c3n4 nanosheets thereby improving the water flux of membranes for example wang et al used cheap commercial polymer polyacrylic acid paa to tune the nanochannels formed between the g c3n4 nanosheets the abundant carboxyl groups of paa bonded with the nh groups of the g c3n4 nanosheets through hydrogen bonds in the g c3n4 paa hybrid membranes fig 13 b wang et al 2018c when the mass ratio of paa and g c3n4 nanosheets was 0 1 the water flux and rejection for eb molecules were determined to 117 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 83 respectively compared with the pure g c3n4 the water flux of g c3n4 paa hybrid membrane was enhanced by 147 without considerably sacrificing the rejection rate and antifouling properties in addition to the effect of pore size screening the charge interaction between dye molecules and membranes is also an important factor affecting the separation performance for g c3n4 based composite membranes the water flux in the treatment of dye wastewater is closely related to the charging characteristics of dye molecules as reported by wang et al fe oh 3 g c3n4 composite membranes demonstrated a pure water permeance of 48 l m 2 h 1 bar 1and a molecular weight cut off mwco of 800 da wang et al 2018b the permeance maintained nearly 90 when filtrating positively charged rhodamine b rhb and methylene blue meb molecules while the permeance is only 50 of the pure water permeance when filtrating negatively charged eb and mb molecules the decreased water permeance was ascribed to partial obstruction of pores on positively charged fe oh 3 layer by negatively charged molecules huang et al 2013 interestingly g c3n4 hybirdized membranes have also demonstrated great application potential for the desalination of textile dyeing wastewater ye et al described the fabrication of high flux nf membranes through the bio inspired co deposition of hydrophilic g c3n4 nanosheets and polydopamine polyethylenimine pda pei layer onto porous ultrafiltration substrates fig 13 c ye et al 2019 the optimized membranes exhibited high permeability 28 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ultrahigh retention of dyes 610 630 da 99 3 and salt rejection 2 9 for nacl and 7 6 for na2so4 these results can be attributed to the incorporation of g c3n4 nanosheets effectively accelerates the polymerization behavior of pda and pei thereby changing the structure of the membrane surface and finally breaking through the permeability selectivity trade off effect therefore the bio inspired membranes provided competitive and practical alternatives for the purification of high salt textile wastewater 5 5 g c3n4 based catalytic membranes membranes fabricated with catalytic materials afford membranes with multiple functions such as degradation of pollutants and self cleaning li et al 2020 however conventional commercial polymers have no catalytic property and some of them polymers are vulnerable to oxidation by oh radical attacks on the contrary robust g c3n4 with inherent photocatalytic activity and chemical resistance property provides a new opportunity for the construction of catalytic membranes zeng et al 2020 benefitted from the visible light response of g c3n4 the integration of membrane separation and photocatalysis has become the most representative application of g c3n4 based membranes chi et al 2019 li et al 2017a shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016a in this process g c3n4 based photocatalytic membranes reject pollutants through membrane filtration and degrade them by photocatalysis at the same time the reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidation such as oh and o2 generated by g c3n4 and its composite photocatalysts under visible light play the key role in the degradation of organics taking advantage of the strong and broad light absorption of c3n4 ag ag2o heterojunctions shen et al developed a novel cf c3n4 ag ag2o filtration cloth the filter membrane shaped photocatalysts could photodegrade 97 of acid orange ao7 after eight grade reactors shen et al 2019 it is worth mentioned that the porous structure of membranes usually has a positive contribution to the photocatalytic activity because of the large specific surface area and high light absorption ability the enhanced mass transfer of contaminant molecules in the porous structure also facilitates the photodegradation zhang et al 2018a based on this principle li et al 2019a fabricated a novel fe3o4 g c3n4 pvdf blending membrane with ordered macroporous structure and extremely high porosity 88 5 as developed membranes exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity 97 8 removal efficiency of rhb high water flux 15835 2 l m 2 h 1 under 0 1mpa and satisfactory anti fouling performance 2 38 bsa adsorption the application of g c3n4 based membranes for the treating of water contaminated by multiple pollutants has also been attempted for instance li et al 2017a preparedsss rgo pda g c3n4 composite membranes for the treatment of dye contaminated oily water the nearly 100 rejection of soluble organic dyes and the in situ degradation by photocatalysis resulted in the continuous and simultaneous flow through separation of oil water emulsion and water purification in one device membrane fouling seriously restricts the application of membrane technology in water treatment biofouling is one of the most serious obstacles for the maintenance of membrane performance during the filtration process under light irradiation the antibacterial ability of g c3n4 plays an important role in alleviating or even eliminating the biofouling on the membrane surface li et al 2019c found that the pan membranes functionalized by g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited nearly 100 disinfection efficiency for escherichia coli e coli ros such as h2o2 and photogenerated o2 and oh generated from g c3n4 nanosheets under visible light is responsible for the bacterium cell inactivation fig 14 a since the higher charge carrier separation is conducive to produce more ros heterostructured photocatalysts should exhibit stronger bactericidal activity therefore in the research of zhao et al the g c3n4 ns rgo ca membranes effectively removed more than six log units of e coli zhao et al 2016a in addition to biofouling organic fouling caused by the deposition of natural organic matter nom on the membrane surface during filtration process could also severely weaken the membrane performance truong et al have confirmed that the c3n4 wo3 nano sheet composite nscw21 could be applied as a visible light active photocatalyst to degrade nom and this photocatalyst exhibited high adsorption and degradation performance for the typical humus components in nom truong et al 2020 when combining with ultrafiltration the removal of nom in the overall system would be significantly improved to 91 and an alleviation in membrane fouling were achieved fig 14 c all these research results provide strong support for the g c3n4 based photocatalytic membrane as a multifunctional membrane with excellent anti fouling performance for practical applications fast degradation efficiency is of great importance for the industrial application of g c3n4 based catalytic membranes besides photocatalysis the combination of physical separation and other advanced oxidation processes such as peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation h2o2 and fenton reactions as well as electrochemical oxidation provide vast potentials for developing high performance catalytic membranes as presented in table 2 these attempts resulted in the synergistic improvements for the degradation of organic pollutant membrane fouling mitigation disinfection and the inhibition of disinfection by products the addition of carbonaceous materials into g c3n4 based membranes can not only improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes but also provides new opportunities for electrochemical degradation of pollutants for this purpose wang et al prepared g c3n4 cnts al2o3 membranes through sequentially coating cnts layer and g c3n4 layer onto al2o3 support membranes wang et al 2017d the composite membranes doped with 0 5 mg ml 1 cnt was used for the electrochemically enhanced removal of phenol as presented in fig 15 a a positive voltage could effectively extract the photogenerated electrons from irradiated g c3n4 layer thus obviously improved the performance of g c3n4 based membranes for pollutant removal with a voltage of 1 0 v the removal rate of phenol over electrochemical enhanced photocatalytic membranes was 2 7 times and 10 1 times higher than those of photocatalytic filtration membranes and physical filtration alone respectively in our recent work the synergistic contribution of photocatalytic degradation and fenton like oxidation to the catalytic performance of self assembled g c3n4 based membranes has been investigated the uniform intercalation of fe containing polyoxometalates fe pom clusters into g c3n4 membranes not only improved the separation of photo induced charge carriers but also brought about versatile fenton like activity for the activation of h2o2 wang et al 2018a our photo fenton like membranes exhibited excellent pollutant rejection performance 99 97 8 removal efficiency of cr high water permeation flux 80 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and self catalytic ability for degrading intercepted pollutants fig 15 b as a consequence of light irradiation and h2o2 addition such photo fenton like membranes presented steady water flux and good rejection ability during the continuous operation activation of pms has been considered as one of the most effective methods for removing organic pollutants from water because of the generation of highly oxidizing active species chen et al 2020a oh and lim 2019 zhao et al 2017 the integration of contaminant interception and pms evolved oxidation over g c3n4 based membranes has been reported for example mn3o4 cnns ptfe catalytic membranes with 150 mg g c3n4 nanosheets cnns could remove 90 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp bpa and rhb after 60 min with the addition of 1mm pms while only 10 of 4 cp could be removed over the same period by polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes via physical adsorption chen et al 2020a as illustrated in fig 15 c the redox cycles of mn iv mn iii mn ii on the mn3o4 surface was the main reason for the activation of pms it is worth mentioned that the activity of this membrane could be easily restored by the solve thermal treatment in ethanol suggesting the good potential of mn3o4 cnns 150 ptfe membranes for treatment of actual wastewater 5 6 energy production in recent years the energy water nexus of the water supply has become a focus of the water treatment research in fact water could be considered a source of power since contaminated water contains plentiful organic matters membrane based systems could effectively capture energy from natural and wastewaters thus provides a new opportunity for the sustainable water treatment g c3n4 has emerged as a promising material for the development of new energy conversion systems proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs represented by direct methanol fuel cell dmfc and vanadium redox flow battery vrb have attracted an increasing attention due to their high efficiency and environmental benign nature as the core component of pemfcs proton exchange membranes pems should have high proton conductivity good mechanical and thermal stability and low fuel crossover wang et al 2017a niu et al 2017 however the commonly used nafion membranes and some sulfonated aromatic polymers membranes such as sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek and sulfonated poly aryl ether sulfone spaes are far from satisfactory due to their high fuel permeability short duration and poor mechanical strength dong et al 2017 introducing g c3n4 or modified g c3n4 into polymer matrix is an effective strategy to reduce the membrane fuel permeability and improve its mechanical strength for instance velayutham et al used surface functionalized g c3n4 s gcn as an effective filler to modify the nafion membrane for dmfcs application velayutham and sahu 2018 the proton transfer in the nafion s gcn hybrid membranes was enhanced by the acid base interactions between nh2 groups of s gcn and so3h groups of hybrid membranes fig 16 a the nafion s gcn hybrid membrane with an optimized filler content exhibited a proton conductivity of 183 ms cm 1 which was about 36 higher in relation to the pristine nafion membranes due to the enhanced movement of hydronium ions porous g c3n4 nanosheets in the hybrid membranes could act as a barrier for methanol molecules the dmfc comprising nafion s gcn 0 5 wt hybrid membranes delivered an enhanced peak power density of 125 mw cm 2 at 70 c under ambient pressure which was much higher than that of the pristine nafion membranes 65 mw cm 2 fig 16 b gang et al fabricated speek nanocomposite membranes filled with g c3n4 nanosheets for improving the performance of proton exchange membranes in the dmfc gang et al 2016 the proton conductivity was increased from 0 0606 s cm 1 of the speek control membrane to 0 0786 s cm 1 of the speek g c3n4 nanocomposite membrane when the content of g c3n4 nanosheets was 0 5 wt at 20 c owing to the molecular sieving effect caused by periodic vacancies in the lattice of g c3n4 the methanol permeability decreased significantly at room temperature in addition the speek composite membranes modified with phosphotungstic acid carbon nitride nanosheets hpw g c3n4 also exhibited enhanced potential for dmfc application dong et al 2017 the selectivity of speek hpw g c3n4 membranes doped with 1 0 wt g c3n4 nanosheets was 2 3 and 1 5 times higher than those of speek hpw membranes and pristine speek membranes respectively moreover in the presence of g c3n4 nanosheets speek hpw g c3n4 hybrid membranes exhibited superior mechanical property with maximum elongation at break of 223 3 and it could operate stably for 240 h at 60 c vrb is another important energy storage system due to the fast response time long cycle life and deep discharge capability wang et al 2017a niu et al 2017 the proton exchange membranes modified with g c3n4 have also been extensively explored for vrb applications niu et al confirmed that the incorporation of g c3n4 nanosheets could effectively improve the ion selectivity vanadium ion permeation and structure stability of hybrid membranes niu et al 2017 as a result the acid base pairs between nh2 groups of g c3n4 and so4h of speek promoted the proton transport and restricted the vanadium ion permeation the vrb assembled with speek g c3n4 1 5 hybrid membranes exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency ce 97 and energy efficiency ee 83 6 at 30 ma cm 2 to further improve the performance of pems in vrb wang et al fabricated speek composite membranes modified by oxidized g c3n4 ocn wang et al 2017a they found that the hydrophilic groups on the surface of ocn were conducive to the construction of hydrophobic hydrophilic separation structure by forming hydrogen bonds with polymer chains in the hybrid membranes niu et al 2017 furthermore the carboxyl groups at the defects of ocn could form proton jumping sites which was favorable for the improvement of proton conductivity qiu et al 2017 the ocn speek hybrid membranes with 1 ocn showed the lowest vanadium ion permeability 9 09 10 7 cm2 min 1 and the highest ion selectivity 6 60 104 smin cm 3 the vrb equipped with this membrane exhibited a higher coulombic efficiency 98 than nafion 117 membrane 95 at 60 ma cm 2 g c3n4 has also been adopted to improve the performance of h2 o2 fuel cells ingabire et al introduced g c3n4 based nanocomposite tio2 g c3n4 into spaes polymers which endowed the hybrid membranes with enhanced proton conductivity good mechanical and dimensional stability as well as improved oxidative and hydrolytic stability in comparison with the control spaes membranes ingabire et al 2020a similarly the quaternary aminated poly arylene ether sulfone qpaes modified with tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite system also exhibited remarkable performance during the test of h2 o2 fuel cell ingabire et al 2020b the qpaes tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes containing 0 45 wt tio2 g c3n4 showed a hydroxide conductivity of 43 8 ms cm 1 at 80 c they could absorb water as high as 88 7 but expand less than 13 in in plane direction of membranes besides the qpaes tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes also displayed high oxidative stability and good stability in alkaline solution at 60 c for 240 h at least this performance improvement was ascribed to the strong interfacial interactions between qpaes and tio2 g c3n4 nanocomposites the h2 o2 fuel cell assembled with this membrane showed a maximum power density at 64 3 mw cm 2 under a current density of 131 2 ma cm2 at 80 c ions transport through confined space with characteristic dimensions comparable to the debye length has widely applications in water desalination dialysis and energy conversion xiao et al 2018 the ultrathin free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes obtained by vapor deposition polymerization and chemical vapor deposition have excellent nano fluidic ion transport properties ionic transport through the free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes was similar as that of the bulk electrolyte solution besides the surface charge governed ion transport also endowed g c3n4 membranes with the function of converting salinity gradients into electric energy fig 16 c d with the advantages of low cost facile fabrication and supporting high ionic currents free standing polymeric g c3n4 membranes provides an alternative platform for the development of new energy conversion systems and ionic devices 6 outlook and future works the tailorable structure and the inherent catalytic activity of g c3n4 provide a broad range of unprecedented opportunities for its application in the field of environmental remediation the potential of using g c3n4 membranes for wastewater treatment and freshwater preparation is vivid due to their unique and multifunctional properties although great progresses have been made in this field in recent years the study of g c3n4 based membranes is still in its infant stage for their practical applications several critical issues needed to be considered regulation of g c3n4 nanoarchitecture to improve its dispersibility and stability in special solvents is critical for the rational design of membrane in spite of the exfoliation of bulk g c3n4 into 2d ultrathin nanosheets provides an approachable way to tailor its structure for membrane preparation the low yield of ultrathin g c3n4 nanostructures is the intrinsic shortcoming of most exfoliation strategies new material strategy is highly desirable for the mass production of homogeneous g c3n4 dispersion in a facial low cost and environmental friendly way in addition the structural evolution law of g c3n4 molecules during physicochemical treatment should be explored in more detailed so as to better optimize the tailoring methods of g c3n4 it is worthy noting that the performance of lamellar membranes is highly dependent on the lateral size of 2d materials specifically the impact of lateral size of go flakes on the membrane performance have been reported by several groups it was found that smaller go flakes could minimize the defects of membrane separation layer thereby produced a higher membrane flux and selectivity akther et al 2020 li et al 2021 nie et al 2020 however the influence of g c3n4 lateral size on the morphology and performance of membranes is yet to be investigated constructing shorter and less tortuous transport pathways for water or other solvent molecules by controlling the lateral dimension will expand new ideas for membrane design and maximize the separation capacity of membranes therefore in the further research it is meaningful to improve the membrane performance by modulating the physical properties of 2d g c3n4 rather than solely chemical tailoring of nanomaterials furthermore the molecular transport behavior through the nanoporous g c3n4 membranes and the separation mechanism need to be fundamentally investigated for membranes preparation hybridizing g c3n4 with traditional polymer membranes is a common method to construct g c3n4 membranes but the presence of organic components inevitably affect the catalytic performance of g c3n4 materials in addition the ros produced by g c3n4 may accelerate the aging of polymer matrix which leads to a significant decrease in the durability of membranes under continuous exposure to light therefore self supporting g c3n4 membranes with both physical filtration and photocatalysis properties should be more attractive for this direction researchers need to put an emphasis on the development of more cost effective and feasible technology to realize the large scale preparation of self supporting g c3n4 membranes and endow membranes with sufficient mechanical strength and stability during the long term operation in addition to the above mentioned the bottom up assembly of g c3n4 membranes is still an exploited field with abundant amine groups the self assembly behavior of g c3n4 nanostructures can provide an industrially approachable approach to prepared high performance water treatment membranes however more fundamental insights into the self assembly mechanism are urgently needed in addition the framework defects caused by the nonuniform deposition of g c3n4 nanosheets during stacking process may affect the molecular transport behavior and membrane separation performance precisely controlling the structure and morphology of self assembled membranes is of both scientific and technical importance for the practical applications in terms of application g c3n4 based membranes have been widely applied in various environment and energy related separation processes but several challenges are still remained to be overcome firstly due to the excellent catalytic properties of g c3n4 improving the synergistic effect between physical filtration photocatalysis and other advanced oxidation processes has always been the research hotspot of g c3n4 membranes however the degradation of organic pollutants during the processes of physical filtration and photocatalysis inevitably generate some intermediate products which may penetrate membranes and get into the filtration so far there is little attention paid to the formation and toxicity of degradation intermediates in the permeate solution future research is required to comprehensively evaluate the permeate quality and further elucidate the degradation pathway of pollutants secondly up to now most of the current experiments on the evaluation of g c3n4 membranes are restricted to ideal simulated solutes with laboratory scale dead end filtration units and the external factors affecting the membrane performance are not completely understood consequently more studies on the separation performance and structure stability of g c3n4 membranes in acidic basic conditions in complex feed solutions and at high temperatures are required moreover new methods for regulating the performance of g c3n4 based membranes should be developed for different applications finally owing to the nano size g c3n4 and its nanocomposite materials may be released from membranes into retentate and permeate streams resulting in a potential threat to the environment and organisms in this regard exploring the effective approaches to achieve no minimal leaching of nano materials from membrane matrix is necessary meanwhile the concentration of g c3n4 and its composites in the permeate solution should be continuously monitored over long term operating conditions to avoid secondary environmental pollution 7 conclusions this article reviews the latest research progress of metal free g c3n4 as promising polymeric materials to construct the next generation of separation membranes for water purification structure tailoring exhibits more prominent advantages to obtain 2d g c3n4 nanosheets with improved dispersibility and stability in special solvents for membrane fabrication chemical exfoliation has emerged as an efficient method to regulate the lateral size surface area and reactive sites of g c3n4 several strategies such as vapor deposition microcontact printing assisted access vacuum filtration blending interfacial polymerization potentiostatic anodization and electrospinning can be utilized to prepare g c3n4 based membranes the incorporation of g c3n4 can not only introduce ordered channels for fast water transportation but also improve the hydrophilicity chemical structure stability mechanical strength and swelling resistance of membranes its inherent catalytic activity further endows membranes with additional self cleaning properties these multifunctional membranes display an overall high performance in pervaporation desalination oil water separation catalysis and energy production we highlighted the in depth studies on the physicochemical properties of g c3n4 materials the cost effective flexible and large scale fabrication methods of g c3n4 membranes as well as molecular transport path and membrane separation mechanism a comprehensive assessment on the stability of membranes and the permeate quality under long term operation in actual water is highly required in order to meet the requirements of practical applications declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal

electrode capacitive deionization fcdi as a novel electro driven desalination technology has attracted growing exploration towards brackish water treatment hypersaline water treatment and selective resource recovery in recent years as a flow electrode based electrochemical technology fcdi has similarities with several other electrochemical technologies such as electrochemical flow capacitors and semi solid fuel cells whose performance are closely coupled with the characteristics of the flow electrodes in this review we sort out the potentially parallel mechanisms of electrosorption and electrodialysis in the fcdi desalination process and make clear the importance of the flowable capacitive electrodes we then adopt an equivalent circuit model to distinguish the resistances to ion transport and electron transport within the electrodes and clarify the importance of electronic conductivity on the system performance based on a series of electrochemical tests furthermore we discuss the effects of electrode selection and flow circulation patterns on system performance energy consumption salt removal rate review the current treatment targets and system performance and then provide an outlook on the research directions in the field to support further applications of fcdi keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization electrosorption electrodialysis charge transport electronic resistance 1 introduction desalination is an important technology to treat brine water and a promising way to address the increasing concerns relating global water resource shortage elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 among many desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and thermal distillation electro driven desalination is known to be advantageous as it can separate target ions from aqueous rather than transporting water under an applied voltage lin 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 apart from the early developed electrodialysis ed strathmann 2010 electro driven desalination has been developed so extensively in the last two decades that several branch technologies emerged including capacitive deionization cdi porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi lee et al 2006 and flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi jeon et al 2013 different from other electro driven desalination devices that employ solid electrodes to remove target ions fcdi applies flow electrodes normally carbon slurry which can be recirculated during the desalination process and thus greatly facilitates continuous desalination flow electrodes with conductive carbon slurry were first utilized by kastening et al to achieve charge transport and ion electrosorption in 1985 kastening et al 1985 kastening 1988 but few studies followed until duduta et al proposed semi solid flow battery ssfb using flowable carbon to store energy in 2011 duduta et al 2011 soon afterwards a new concept called electrochemical flow capacitor efc combining the advantages of supercapacitors and flow batteries was proposed in 2012 presser et al realized rapid charging discharging process by using a carbon electrolyte mixture as active substance to store energy presser et al 2012 in 2013 carbon slurry as flow electrode was introduced in capacitive deionization known as fcdi to desalt high salinity 32 1 g l 1 nacl brine water delivering a superior salt removal efficiency of 95 jeon et al 2013 since then increasing research efforts have been made to optimize electrode materials cai et al 2020 chang et al 2019 cho et al 2019 cohen et al 2016 doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015b liang et al 2017 park et al 2016 tang et al 2019 yang et al 2017b configuration cho et al 2017 choo et al 2019 hatzell et al 2014a linnartz et al 2020 ma et al 2020a rommerskirchen et al 2015 yang et al 2016b 2019 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a and operation mode gendel et al 2014 jeon et al 2019 luo et al 2020 rommerskirchen et al 2015 yang et al 2017a as well as to investigate energy recovery from fcdi hatzell et al 2014b jeon et al 2014 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2019a porada et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2018a and to explore its application fig 1 a several studies in the past two years have also started to try to achieve selective recovery of target ions after they are enriched in flow electrodes in fcdi bian et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2021 lin et al 2020 xu et al 2021b 2021a 2021c zhang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 besides intensive experimental studies on fcdi modeling work was also performed to better understand the main influencing factors rommerskirchen et al 2018b 2020a wang et al 2020 conventional flow electrodes used in fcdi are prepared by dispersing activated carbon ac powders 10 to 20 μm in diameter in salt solution at a loading of 5 20 wt a typical fcdi device is with three chambers separated by ion exchange membranes iems comprising two electrode chambers filled with flow electrodes and a desalination chamber to let in the feedwater fig 1b jeon et al 2013 current collectors bound the electrode chambers and a grid is placed in the desalination chamber to prevent short circuits graphite plates carved with serpentine flow channels are normally employed as current collectors to bridge the electron transport between flow electrodes and external circuit similar to the desalination with cdi a constant voltage or constant current is typically applied to operate an fcdi cell with this applied voltage carbon particles in flow electrodes are electrically charged while ions in desalination chamber are forced to pass through the iems and adsorbed in the electric double layers edls formed in the micropores of carbon particles in this way the brine is desalinated as it flows through the middle channel the fcdi research field is rapidly growing and a systematic understanding of the complex transport and ion storage processes at play are currently being developed in the literature in this work we take the flow electrode as the core and comprehensively analyze the technology we first provide insight into the desalination mechanisms of fcdi and investigate the differences as compared with electrodialysis process then we propose a qualitative electrochemical analysis method to distinguished the electronic resistance and ionic resistance with the support of the research data the current performance of fcdi and the critical factors are discussed and prospects of future research directions are presented 2 desalination process of fcdi similarities and differences as compared with ed desalination process of fcdi is similar to that in electrodialysis ed as in both salt ions in aqueous solutions are forced through the iems due to an applied electric field in both electrical energy is consumed to drive the electromigration of salt ions across iems lin 2020 for example sodium ions across a cation exchange membrane or chloride across an anion exchange membrane in fcdi unlike ed after passing through iems target ions are absorbed into charged edls of the carbon based flow electrodes or concentrated in the electrolyte phase of the flow electrode fig 2 it is also possible that the untargeted ions such as protons or hydroxide ions generated by self ionization of water would be adsorbed into the edls instead of the target ions in the electrolyte another way to retain target ions in the electrolyte is the faradaic reactions anodic oxidation cathodic reduction that occur in carbon electrodes or at the current collector interface yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a in an ideal fcdi system all target ions should be adsorbed onto the electrode however the way in which the desalination proceeds greatly depends on operating mode voltage applied and electrode materials liang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 tang et al 2020 in a conventional ed system all removed ions are retained within the solution in the concentrate chamber also faradaic reactions occur only in the terminal electrode chambers fig s1 when edls of flow electrodes serve to store the ions either targeted or untargeted ions the electrical energy applied to the fcdi cell is converted into electrostatic energy as in traditional cdi however when there is an oxidation reduction such as anodic carbon oxidation the electrical energy is converted into chemical energy similar to the energy conversion in an ed process this suggests that a major distinction between the desalination process of ed and fcdi is the mode of energy consumption for the ed process only faradaic reactions occur and the electrolyte of anode and cathode chambers are recirculated to ensure constant ph al amshawee et al 2020 while in fcdi both faradic reactions which requires high applied voltage and electrosorption processes may be occur concurrently ha et al 2020 tang and zhou 2020 previous experimental studies reported that salt ion removal via electrosorption in fcdi may require less energy per m3 than the use of faradaic reactions in ed although such studies analyzed ed stacks with only a small number of cell pairs which substantially overestimated the contribution of faradaic reaction from ed electrodes in real applications ma et al 2019b tang et al 2020 ma et al investigated desalination performance with and without carbon electrode added into anode and cathode chamber in fcdi and found that the energy consumption of carbon free fcdi was 3 5 times that of fcdi with 10 wt carbon content at a similar desalination rate ma et al 2019b furthermore rommerskirchen et al constructed a stacked fcdi system to treat high salinity brines 60 g l 1 fig 3 a rommerskirchen et al 2020b theoretical calculations demonstrated that energy consumption of fcdi was lower than ed in a 1 5 pairs stacked structure fig 3b subsequently stacked fcdi and ed devices consisted of three pairs were assembled respectively with the same current density applied on the stacked fcdi and ed devices similar desalination rates were delivered while the energy consumption of fcdi 14 93 kwh m 3 was significantly lower than ed 53 01 kwh m 3 the current voltage curves of the two systems indicated that a higher voltage is required for the faradaic reactions to occur in the electrode which led to the higher energy consumption of the ed system besides experimental research modeling studies have been performed to analyze the energy consumption of fcdi rommerskirchen et al 2018b 2020a wang et al 2020 with an equivalent film electrode model wang et al revealed that the potential drop across the electrodes accounted for over 30 of constant applied voltage on fcdi suggesting the electrodes would consume considerable energy during desalination wang et al 2020 based on a theoretical calculation of the resistances at different effluent concentrations rommerskirchen et al found that the resistance of electrode in a single cell pair was a dominating consumer in whole energy consumption accounting for about 35 50 rommerskirchen et al 2020b therefore a thorough knowledge and optimization of the electrode is critical to reduce energy demand 3 flow electrodes in fcdi 3 1 charge transport in flow electrode charge transport in the flow electrode consists of both electron transport and ion transport as illustrated in fig 4 for the electrons they can transport between the current collector and activated carbon particles through direct contact transport among activated carbon particles through a continuous network formed by particle contact and transport between activated carbon particles via redox reactions marked with① ② and ③ in fig 4 respectively the first and second mechanisms of electron transport occur in all fcdi cells while the last one requires an additional redox couple present within the flow electrode which will be further described in section 4 the ions can transport through the electrolyte and along particles edls tangentially to surfaces marked with ④ and ⑤ in fig 4 respectively shocron and suss 2017 better understanding and quantification of charge transport in flow electrodes would help to improve fcdi performance it is generally believed the electron percolation within the flow electrodes greatly depends on the physical contact to characterize the charge transport in flow electrodes consisted of activated carbon hatzell et al employed synchrotron radiation x ray tomographic microscopy to image particle interactions and revealed the percolating cluster depending on the solid content loading hatzell et al 2017 on this basis another study managed to obtain a 3d reconstructed images capturing the degree of percolation and interparticle voids in the electrode to resolve the charge percolation pathways dixit et al 2019 they found that with higher carbon content loading not only the connected particulate network was increased but also the anisotropy of electron transport and a more tortuous ion transport path were displayed another modeling study by karzar jeddi et al investigated the effect of hydrodynamic interaction on charge transport and demonstrated that charge transport in flow electrode was improved with faster particle charging karzar jeddi et al 2019 these studies have significantly promoted the understanding of charge transport at micron level but are still limited by the difficulty of measuring in the flow state in real application scenarios of flow electrodes to improve understanding electrochemical tests are often performed to determine the resistance and capacitance of flow electrodes which can be performed in situ and enable quantitative analysis of charge transport electrochemical tests can be performed transient e g electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and steady state e g direct current dc measurements previous studies have tried to obtain the electron transport resistance by performing dc tests gloukhovski and suss 2020 hatzell et al 2015a 2017 as one of the typical and most employed electrochemical tests eis is performed by controlling the current or potential as a sinusoidal signal with small amplitude which effectively linearizes the electrochemical system the relevant parameters of the system like resistance and capacitance can be determined through an equivalent linear circuit model built by connecting circuit elements in series and parallel the equivalent circuit model is an important tool for electrochemical analysis hoyt et al proposed an equivalent circuit model including a new custom element as the impedance of the surface charge boundary layer zefc which showed that the electronic resistance was almost unchanged when the flow rate increased from 50 ml min to 250 ml min hoyt et al 2018 however modeling work is still required to simulate the process of charge transport more accurately including ion transport in the 1960s a theoretical transmission line model for porous electrodes was proposed and was employed to study the dynamic charge transport later in the impedance tests on fluidized bed electrodes flowing status de levie 1963 gabrielli et al 1992 1994 juan bisquert et al 1999 based on the transmission line model and previous research on the electrode of electrochemical flow capacitor dennison et al 2014b petek et al 2016 here we present an equivalent circuit for fcdi where the carriers of the current inside the flow electrodes are the electrons and ions and the two currents are linked by a double layer capacitance fig 5 this equivalent circuit aims to better characterize the resistances in fcdi where r s represents the series resistance including the resistance of iems and ionic resistance in the desalination chamber qu et al 2015 2016 further r o is the resistance in the outer circuit elements if any such as current collectors and wires r ct is the contact resistance between carbon particles in flow electrodes and the current collector the constant phase element q ct in parallel with r ct is the interfacial contact capacitance of current collectors and r e n r ion n and c n are electronic resistance ionic resistance and electric double layer capacitance of the carbon particles in flow electrodes per unit volume length respectively where n is a discretization parameter and depends on the test system and computational requirements this model gives a relatively realistic description of the charge transport process but is too complex for fitting calculations and thus a simpler model will be adopted in the subsequent fitting 3 2 electrochemical testing and analysis of flow electrodes 3 2 1 devices and methods for electrochemical testing of flow electrodes cylinder fig 6 a and plate shaped devices fig 6b c have been employed to perform electrochemical tests of flow electrodes equivalent circuit would depend on the devices utilized for example gloukhovski et al utilized a polycarbonate tube with four rectangular titanium electrodes parallel to the flow direction for testing in which the contact resistance between the collector and flow electrodes was negligible according to the test results cohen et al 2016 gloukhovski and suss 2020 rommerskirchen et al examined the entire fcdi system using a graphite plate carved with flow channels where the resistances for charge transport included those in iems and in the solution of the middle chamber rommerskirchen et al 2019 in order to measure the resistance of the flow electrode our device has a plate shape as shown in fig 5c in which the serpentine flow channels are carved in acrylic plate and graphite plates are placed on both sides as current collectors for test systems of fig 6a and c the equivalent circuit is as shown in fig s2 through which the electronic resistance was determined with the dc method the regular eis measurements for flow electrodes are performed at open circuit voltage with 5 20 mv amplitude and with a frequency range between 10 2 and 105 hz high amplitude should be avoided as it may cause non stationary conditions schwarz et al 2002 dc measurements are usually performed by applying a series of low constant voltages increasing from 100 mv to 100 mv at intervals of 20 mv where the resistance is determined as the ratio of voltage to current generally two electrode configuration would go with plate shaped device for the testing but two electrode and four electrode configurations were both applicable in cylinder shaped device which showed little influence on results gloukhovski and suss 2020 3 2 2 data analysis and resistance identification a typical nyquist plot for an eis test with cell in fig 6c is shown in fig 7 a the black line obtained in our study similar to the plots of an fcdi cell in rommerskirchen et al s work rommerskirchen et al 2019 which contains two arcs corresponding to two peaks appearing in the bode plot fig s3 suggesting the system is characterized by two time constants the first arc at higher frequencies is considered related to the parallel connection of contact resistance and interfacial contact capacitance of current collector the higher arc seen in the low frequency region corresponds to charge transport in the flow electrodes it is notable that the arcs may change depending on the configurations of testing devices a study found that the first arc might not appear gloukhovski and suss 2020 and another study obtained a linear line in the low frequency because of the separator in testing device choo et al 2017 for analyzing the data rommerskirchen et al developed an equivalent circuit model which contained the influence of diffusion electrode porosity and convection rommerskirchen et al 2019 the modeling studies were in highly agreement with experimental results most of which were aimed to explore the effects of various conditions on the overall performance of fcdi however it is still difficult to quantify separately the resistances associated with electron or ion transport within the flow electrodes by employing the equivalent circuit based on the theoretical transmission line as described previously and upon substitution of limiting frequencies different resistances in charge transport can be extracted from the nyquist plot fig 6a specifically at high frequency the capacitor acts as a short circuit and as an open circuit at low frequency hence the high frequency intersection on the real axis can be regarded as the sum of resistance of outer circuit elements and the parallel connection of ionic and electronic resistances the low frequency intersection can be estimated as the sum of outer contact and electronic resistances our device was also used to perform a dc test to determine the electron transport resistance fig 6a and c which was found similar to the value of low frequency intersection in eis testing a simplified equivalent circuit as shown in fig 7b has previously utilized to determine the ion transport and electron transport resistances hatzell et al 2015a youssry et al 2013 2015 where r o r ct and q ct are described in section 3 1 r e and r ion are the total electronic and ionic resistances respectively and the constant phase element q is set as the non ideal capacitance of electrode due to the rough electrode surface by applying different experimental conditions of flow electrodes in device fig 6c including carbon content electrolyte concentration and flow rate the results from eis tests fitting calculations and dc tests are shown in table s1 the resistance of current collector and wires r o is too small and is excluded from this table as can be seen the electron transport resistances determined by eis tests are quite in line with those obtained in dc tests the last two columns suggesting the validity of the equivalent circuit based on the same testing and calculation principles the conductivity of various flow electrodes was obtained with both devices in fig 6a and c the conductivity of flow electrode with 2 5 vol multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and 100 mm kbr was measured to be approximately 34 ms cm 1 through a cylindrical device gloukhovski and suss 2020 and similarly in the plate device the conductivity of electrode with 10 wt ac yec 200d and 171 mm nacl was 18 ms cm 1 3 3 resistances in flow electrodes of fcdi as shown in fig 8 and table s1 the dominating resistance of the flow electrode in device fig 6c is electronic resistance which is much higher than ionic resistance suggesting electron transport is the limiting step of charge transport within the electrode in addition the ac content salt concentration of electrolyte and flow rate all have significant impacts on the resistances as shown in fig 8a and table s1 increased carbon content in flow electrodes leads to the decrease in all resistances investigated electronic resistance appears more sensitive than ionic resistance towards carbon content when the carbon content is raised from 10 to 20 electronic resistance sharply drops by an order of magnitude the likely cause is the larger average size of the percolating cluster with higher carbon loading which promotes the electron transport gao et al 2007 hatzell et al 2017 ionic resistance decreases from 7 ω to 2 4 ω when carbon content increases from 5 to 20 suggesting that more solid carbon particles would facilitate the transport of ions this finding is similar to the results of gloukhovski et al gloukhovski and suss 2020 in order to quantify ionic resistance a multi chamber device was fabricated to perform dc tests fig s3a results once again demonstrates that the ionic resistance of flow electrodes are reduced with higher carbon content fig s3b which could be attributed to the short circuiting of the ion conduction path through the particles sabacky and evans 1977 it is noticeable that the contact resistance r ct becomes larger with increased carbon content as determined by eis results table s1 the reason is still under investigation when electrolyte concentration increases from 1 g l 1 to 35 g l 1 ionic resistance decreases from 7 ω to 0 5 ω fig 8b with increasing salt concentration electronic resistance decreases substantially at the beginning but remained stable after the salt concentration is above a certain level as explained by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dvlo theory the increase of electrolyte ionic strength compresses the edls on the surface of the carbon materials thus reducing the average distance between particles increasing particle aggregation and providing an improved path for electron transport between particles daintree and biggs 2010 farina and oldham 1977 gloukhovski and suss 2020 electronic resistance is found to decrease substantially with increased flow rate fig 8c because high flow rate can promote flow disturbances facilitating the contact of particles and reducing the resistance halfon and suss 2019 however several research results show that in a wider test range the resistance first decreases and then increases as faster flow rate applied dennison et al 2014a rommerskirchen et al 2019 which may be a result of boundary layer effects the ionic and contact resistances are both less affected by flow rate fig 8c and table s1 the unusual drop of contact resistance at flow rate of 5 ml min 1 is probably due to increased aggregation of activated carbon particles on the collector surface at low flow rates 3 4 conductivity of flow electrodes with different materials as mentioned above electronic resistance is critical to the electrode the electronic conductivity of flow electrodes with different materials also varies dramatically as shown in the data in table s3 the electronic conductivity of the flow electrode with mwcnt is greater than that of several other materials ac and acetylene black for various volume mass fractions in addition to the conductivity of the solid particle material itself the reasons for these differences are related mainly to particle shape and agglomeration tendencies for example high aspect ratio particles such as mwcnts can form more effective percolating networks relative to low aspect ratio particles for a given particle loading foygel et al 2005 mutiso and winey 2015 parant et al 2017 takeno et al 2017 tarlton et al 2017 we tested the conductivity of flow electrodes of mwcnt ac yp 50f and ac norit sx ultra when suspended into di water to isolate their electronic conductivity and for various particle volume fractions conductive additives such as carbon black were not included in the flow electrodes from well established percolation theory measurements of electronic conductivity can be used to calculate the percolation threshold of the conductive phase mutiso and winey 2015 the percolation threshold was found by best fitting the measured conductivities to a power law for carbon volume fractions in the vicinity of significant macroscopic electrical conductivity onset σ σ0 φ φc t where σ is the macroscopic electrical conductivity in s cm 1 σ 0 is the pre exponent in s cm 1 φ is the carbon volumetric fraction in the suspension φ c is the percolation threshold and t is the conductivity exponent there is no clear reference to the upper limit of the aforementioned power law applicability however it should work at φ values close to the percolation threshold mutiso and winey 2015 as clearly seen in fig 9 the mwcnt suspension conductivity dominated over the activated carbon suspension conductivities yp 50f suspensions significantly differed from mwcnt and norit sx ultra yp 50f particles conducted electricity very poorly and its calculated percolation threshold was 2 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the other materials all the tested materials fit well to a power law however differ in the prefactor and the conductivity exponent the prefactor is influenced by the inherent particle conductivity contact resistance and network topology foygel et al 2005 and ranged 4 orders of magnitude the conductivity exponent equaled to t 2 in the mwcnt and yp50f power laws and t 1 in the norit sx ultra power law in the polymer composite literature t 2 matches the 3d universal exponent for spherical particles foygel et al 2005 mutiso and winey 2015 we hypothesize supported by the images in fig 10 that mwcnt particles agglomerated into sphere like aggregates and effectively acted as large spherical particles resulting in t 2 according to fig 10 the yp 50f particles with aspect ratio ar 1 remained fully dispersed thus resulting in t 2 surprisingly the norit sx ultra conductivity exponent tended towards the lower values mentioned in literature for 2d 3d elongated particles ranging 1 1 1 6 foygel et al 2005 fig 10 shows optical microscope images of the particle suspensions we tested comprising 1 vol and di water the field of view sizes in fig 10 are 1 1 mm x 1 5 mm a b and 1 5 mm x 2 mm c although our mwcnt primary particles are rod shaped elongated cylinders with aspect ratio ar 200 500 they agglomerate to 100 µm sized bundles with an aspect ratio close to 1 see fig 10a as they interconnect via van der waals interactions of neighboring agglomerates in a di water suspension tarlton et al 2017 norit sx ultra suspension is shown in fig 10b these particles are initially large with ar 1 d90 100 µm and it seems they connect via the smaller particles d10 3 µm d50 15 µm of the suspension the agglomerates formed here look much more elongated than those of mwcnt suggesting higher ar than 1 the yp 50f suspension shown in fig 10c comprises uniformly separated 5 20 µm sized primary particles which apparently do not form any significant agglomerates 4 factors affecting desalination performance of fcdi evaluation metrics of fcdi desalination performance include desalination rate and energy consumption that are usually normalized to either per unit of treated water or per unit of ion removal hawks et al 2019 through summarizing over 30 reported fcdi desalination performances in literatures normalized to per mole of ions removed fig s5 shows their energy consumptions and salt removal rates the factors that affect performance are diverse including not only separation itself i e feed salinity and removal efficiency but also flow electrodes device design operation mode etc detailed information in table s3 clearly current studied desalination process by fcdi required the energy between 60 kj mol 1 and 250 kj mol 1 while mostly delivered salt removal rates below 3 μmol cm 2 min 1 when treating high saline water nacl concentration over 30 g l 1 the exceptionally high salt removal rates up to 38 5 μmol cm 2 min 1 were achieved and other factors affecting the desalination performance including the flow electrodes and operation mode will be discussed below 4 1 effects of flow electrodes on fcdi desalination the resistance against electron transport in flow electrodes greatly restrains charge transport leading to limited desalination performance of fcdi various measures have been employed to reduce the electron transport resistance among activated carbon particles including increasing carbon content adding conductive agents introducing redox reactions and assembling current collectors and iems for shorter charge transport distance fig 11 the understanding that increasing the content of activated carbon can promote the formation of the electron transport network to facilitate electron transport has been evidenced by an experimental study where increased carbon content from 10 wt to 20 wt significantly improved the salt removal rate from 0 3 to 1 2 μmol cm 2 min 1 fig 11a porada et al 2014 however the carbon content of flow electrodes in fcdi is generally considered no more than 20 wt to be well circulated but surface modification of the carbon material can reduce its viscosity and thus enable a high carbon content of flow electrodes up to 35 hatzell et al 2015b park et al 2016 adding conductive agents e g carbon black and carbon nanotube in flow electrodes can also improve the desalination performance liang et al 2017 tang et al 2019 when 0 5 wt functionalized carbon nanotubes were added in flow electrodes to form conducting bridges among activated carbon particles for the electrons the resistance of electron transport was greatly reduced leading to a much increased salt removal rate from 8 7 to 34 32 μmol cm 2 min 1 fig 11b cho et al 2019 another study employed additional 14 mm l 1 liquid solvent benzoquinone into 1 wt activated carbon flow electrodes the electron transport among carbon particles were considerably facilitated through benzoquinone s redox properties and the salt removal rate was improved fig 11c ma et al 2016 but the difficulty in separating and the toxicity of benzoquinone would pose a safety hazard besides promoting charge transport in flow electrodes reformed current collectors can also facilitate charge transport by providing an easier distance for charge transport fig 11d linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 when a titanium mash was placed adjacent to the iem to serve as current collector the salt removal rate was increased by 89 than the control fcdi with titanium mesh far from the membrane in summary adding solid conductive agents to promote the formation of a conducting network is the simplest and most applied way to increase charge transport in flow electrodes however those conductive agents are of high cost besides flow electrodes salt concentration in the electrode chamber also significantly affects the desalination performance of fcdi as described in section 3 3 an increase in the salt concentration in flow electrodes will reduce the overall resistance and thus improve the performance which has been experimentally evidenced by a study where increased nacl concentration in flow electrodes from 0 wt to 1 48 wt reduced the total resistance from 24 26 to 5 03 ω and doubled the salt removal rate yang et al 2016a apart from the change in resistance the salt concentration also affects the donnan potential across iems simultaneously which will influence the portion of the voltage for driving ions transport at a given applied voltage in addition excessive salt in the electrode will lead to the increased back diffusion of ions which reduces the charge efficiency and degrades desalination performance ma et al 2019b moreno and hatzell 2018 yang et al 2017a it has been reported that when salt concentration in electrode was increased from 342 mm to 855 mm the salt removal rate decreased from 0 94 to 0 68 μmol cm 2 min 1 ma et al 2019b these facts suggest that an optimal salt concentration of electrolyte should be carefully determined in the meantime a stable salt concentration in the flow electrodes is also conducive for a stable desalination performance zhang et al succeeded in continuously operating fcdi for 14 days by maintaining a stable electrode salt concentration through separating and discharging the concentrated water from the electrodes with a microfiltration membrane zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a flow rate of electrodes has also been found to affect fcdi s desalination performance as well as energy consumption it is acknowledged that increased flow rate within a certain range will reduce the electron transport resistance as discussed in 3 3 leading to faster desalting performance and less energy requirement particularly for salt removal however a high flow rate will definitely increase the energy consumption of pumping an experimental study revealed that increased electrode flow rate from 100 ml min 1 to 150 ml min 1 slightly declined the energy consumption for salt removal from 0 72 wh g 1 nacl to 0 7 wh g 1 nacl but raised the total energy consumption including energy for salt removal and pumping from 0 77 wh g 1 nacl to 0 8 wh g 1 nacl rommerskirchen et al 2018a 4 2 effects of operation mode on fcdi desalination there are three typical modes to operate an fcdi based on different ways to circulate flow electrodes i e isolated closed cycle icc short circuited closed cycle scc and single cycle sc modes he et al 2018 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2019b 2020b rommerskirchen et al 2015 these three modes have different electrosorption desorption patterns energy consumption and advantageous application areas in icc mode flow electrodes are circulated in anode chamber and cathode chamber respectively fig 12 a it can be regarded that the electrosorption and desorption in icc operation happen in sequence like in cdi the desorption occurs when short circuited or reversely charged there is distinguished electrosorption and desorption in scc mode as well fig 12b after absorbing the ions the flow electrodes from anode and cathode chamber will be introduced into an outer chamber where they are mixed up to release the ions dahiya and mishra 2020 however in sc mode the flow electrodes are circulated all through anode chamber and cathode chamber fig 12c while the flow electrodes enriched with ions in one chamber directly enter the other chamber desorption and electrosorption will occur simultaneously this desorption process here is similar to reversed voltage current desorption in cdi compared with the icc mode where electrosorption and desorption occur successively the timely desorption in the scc and sc modes would help to renew more available electrosorption capacity of activated carbon particles during the whole desalination process leading to better desalination performance as well as lower operating voltage required because the salt removal is mostly led by the electrosorption in edls he et al found that at the same current density fcdi s operation in scc mode would require a much reduced maximum voltage 1 0 v than in icc mode 1 92 v and only 47 energy consumption of icc mode he et al 2018 it is noticed that simultaneous charging and discharging in sc mode would make well use of the electrostatic energy accumulated during desorption and therefore decrease the energy consumption ma et al 2020b similar to sc mode jeon et al connected the anode and cathode chambers of two fcdi cells in reverse series as shown in fig 12d jeon et al 2019 the positive electrode marked in red would adsorb the anions in the first fcdi cell and then enter negatively charged chamber in the second cell where the anions would be discharged and retained in the electrolyte promoting more cations to migrate into the anode chamber due to the effect of charge neutralization when operating in scc or sc modes the ions are eventually concentrated in the electrolyte where separation of ions from the flow electrodes is normally required however rommerskirchen et al employed a four chamber fcdi device operating with sc mode and facilitated the refreshment of flow electrodes rommerskirchen et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 12e after absorbing chloride ions the flow electrodes in anode chamber would enter the cathode chamber where the chloride ions would be desorbed into the solution and pass through the adjacent anion exchange membrane under the applied electric field afterwards chloride and sodium ions would be removed in the concentrated chamber since scc and sc modes greatly facilitate the regeneration of electrodes desorption it has been found advantageous over other operation modes as it could avoid re salination of desalted water and achieve high water recovery hawks et al 2018 effective regeneration of flow electrodes also makes desalination performance of fcdi no longer limited by the electrosorption capacity of carbon particles and enables the desalting treatments of both low and high concentration salt water rommerskirchen et al successfully desalted high salinity water with 60 g l 1 nacl by fcdi accompanied by water recovery of 77 6 rommerskirchen et al 2020b several researchers have also noticed that when fcdi was operated with icc mode dissociation of water or faradaic reactions would occur in the electrode chamber producing oh and h and resulting in ph increase in the cathode chamber and decrease in the anode chamber respectively a study operating fcdi for 11 h with icc mode found obvious change in cathode ph from 9 to 12 5 and in anode from 9 to 1 42 nativ et al 2017 particularly for recovering target resource this ph change in icc mode can promote the conversion of some substances such as the conversion of nh4 to nh3 in alkaline solution of the cathode or the conversion of po4 3 to h3po4 in acidic solution of the anode which is beneficial for further separation bian et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al employed fcdi under icc mode to remove ammonium ions from dilute wastewater after selectively concentrated in the cathode ammonium ions turned into dissolved nh3 with following stripping via gas permeable membrane and finally recovered as ammonium sulfate zhang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a 5 conclusions and outlook fcdi is an appealing electro driven desalination process based on flow electrodes it is revealed that the electron transport in flow electrodes is critical to the fcdi performance which is related not only to the conductivity of the solid electrode particles themselves but also to the inter particle connectivity and the potentially parallel mechanisms of electrosorption and electrodialysis in the fcdi desalination process is presented despite of demonstrated advantages of continuous desalination and low energy consumption fcdi is still in early stage of development and is far from practical application for now first for a better desalination performance conductive agents are intensively employed to enhance the conductivity of flow electrodes however these conductive agents like carbon nanotubes and carbon black are normally costly materials it is still challenging to develop low cost high conductivity capacitive materials to serve as flow electrodes regarding energy consumption it should not be ignored that maintaining the circulation of flow electrodes requires a considerable amount of energy which accounts for 5 25 as reported previously reducing the viscosity of flow electrodes e g surface modifying of electrode materials and proper design of flow channel e g applying a parallel flow channel to replace serpentine channel for a shorter flow path and lower pressure drop may present solutions to address this concern so far desalination studies of fcdi have explored a wide salinity range from 0 5 to 60 g l 1 suggesting that besides treating brackish water fcdi may be further employed in the field of zero discharge of industrial wastewater another potential application of fcdi should be the recovery of specific resources like phosphates and heavy metal ions through promoted transformation of target ions declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement this work

electrode capacitive deionization fcdi as a novel electro driven desalination technology has attracted growing exploration towards brackish water treatment hypersaline water treatment and selective resource recovery in recent years as a flow electrode based electrochemical technology fcdi has similarities with several other electrochemical technologies such as electrochemical flow capacitors and semi solid fuel cells whose performance are closely coupled with the characteristics of the flow electrodes in this review we sort out the potentially parallel mechanisms of electrosorption and electrodialysis in the fcdi desalination process and make clear the importance of the flowable capacitive electrodes we then adopt an equivalent circuit model to distinguish the resistances to ion transport and electron transport within the electrodes and clarify the importance of electronic conductivity on the system performance based on a series of electrochemical tests furthermore we discuss the effects of electrode selection and flow circulation patterns on system performance energy consumption salt removal rate review the current treatment targets and system performance and then provide an outlook on the research directions in the field to support further applications of fcdi keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization electrosorption electrodialysis charge transport electronic resistance 1 introduction desalination is an important technology to treat brine water and a promising way to address the increasing concerns relating global water resource shortage elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 among many desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and thermal distillation electro driven desalination is known to be advantageous as it can separate target ions from aqueous rather than transporting water under an applied voltage lin 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 apart from the early developed electrodialysis ed strathmann 2010 electro driven desalination has been developed so extensively in the last two decades that several branch technologies emerged including capacitive deionization cdi porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi lee et al 2006 and flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi jeon et al 2013 different from other electro driven desalination devices that employ solid electrodes to remove target ions fcdi applies flow electrodes normally carbon slurry which can be recirculated during the desalination process and thus greatly facilitates continuous desalination flow electrodes with conductive carbon slurry were first utilized by kastening et al to achieve charge transport and ion electrosorption in 1985 kastening et al 1985 kastening 1988 but few studies followed until duduta et al proposed semi solid flow battery ssfb using flowable carbon to store energy in 2011 duduta et al 2011 soon afterwards a new concept called electrochemical flow capacitor efc combining the advantages of supercapacitors and flow batteries was proposed in 2012 presser et al realized rapid charging discharging process by using a carbon electrolyte mixture as active substance to store energy presser et al 2012 in 2013 carbon slurry as flow electrode was introduced in capacitive deionization known as fcdi to desalt high salinity 32 1 g l 1 nacl brine water delivering a superior salt removal efficiency of 95 jeon et al 2013 since then increasing research efforts have been made to optimize electrode materials cai et al 2020 chang et al 2019 cho et al 2019 cohen et al 2016

2017a as well as to investigate energy recovery from fcdi hatzell et al 2014b jeon et al 2014 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2019a porada et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2018a and to explore its application fig 1 a several studies in the past two years have also started to try to achieve selective recovery of target ions after they are enriched in flow electrodes in fcdi bian et al 2019 2020 fang et al 2021 lin et al 2020 xu et al 2021b 2021a 2021c zhang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 besides intensive experimental studies on fcdi modeling work was also performed to better understand the main influencing factors rommerskirchen et al 2018b 2020a wang et al 2020 conventional flow electrodes used in fcdi are prepared by dispersing activated carbon ac powders 10 to 20 μm in diameter in salt solution at a loading of 5 20 wt a typical fcdi device is with three chambers separated by ion exchange membranes iems comprising two electrode chambers filled with flow electrodes and a desalination chamber to let in the feedwater fig 1b jeon et al 2013 current collectors bound the electrode chambers and a grid is placed in the desalination chamber to prevent short circuits graphite plates carved with serpentine flow channels are normally employed as current collectors to bridge the electron transport between flow electrodes and external circuit similar to the desalination with cdi a constant voltage or constant current is typically applied to operate an fcdi cell with this applied voltage carbon particles in flow electrodes are electrically charged while ions in desalination chamber are forced to pass through the iems and adsorbed in the electric double layers edls formed in the micropores of carbon particles in this way the brine is desalinated as it flows through the middle channel the fcdi research field is rapidly growing and a systematic understanding of the complex transport and ion storage processes at play are currently being developed in the literature in this work we take the flow electrode as the core and comprehensively analyze the technology we first provide insight into the desalination mechanisms of fcdi and investigate the differences as compared with electrodialysis process then we propose a qualitative electrochemical analysis method to distinguished the electronic resistance and ionic resistance with the support of the research data the current performance of fcdi and the critical factors are discussed and prospects of future research directions are presented 2 desalination process of fcdi similarities and differences as compared with ed desalination process of fcdi is similar to that in electrodialysis ed as in both salt ions in aqueous solutions are forced through the iems due to an applied electric field in both electrical energy is consumed to drive the electromigration of salt ions across iems lin 2020 for example sodium ions across a cation exchange membrane or chloride across an anion exchange membrane in fcdi unlike ed after passing through iems target ions are absorbed into charged edls of the carbon based flow electrodes or concentrated in the electrolyte phase of the flow electrode fig 2 it is also possible that the untargeted ions such as protons or hydroxide ions generated by self ionization of water would be adsorbed into the edls instead of the target ions in the electrolyte another way to retain target ions in the electrolyte is the faradaic reactions anodic oxidation cathodic reduction that occur in carbon electrodes or at the current collector interface yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a in an ideal fcdi system all target ions should be adsorbed onto the electrode however the way in which the desalination proceeds greatly depends on operating mode voltage applied and electrode materials liang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 tang et al 2020 in a conventional ed system all removed ions are retained within the solution in the concentrate chamber also faradaic reactions occur only in the terminal electrode chambers fig s1 when edls of flow electrodes serve to store the ions either targeted or untargeted ions the electrical energy applied to the fcdi cell is converted into electrostatic energy as in traditional cdi however when there is an oxidation reduction such as anodic carbon oxidation the electrical energy is converted into chemical energy similar to the energy conversion in an ed process this suggests that a major distinction between the desalination process of ed and fcdi is the mode of energy consumption for the ed process only faradaic reactions occur and the electrolyte of anode and cathode chambers are recirculated to ensure constant ph al amshawee et al 2020 while in fcdi both faradic reactions which requires high applied voltage and electrosorption processes may be occur concurrently ha et al 2020 tang and zhou 2020 previous experimental studies reported that salt ion removal via electrosorption in fcdi may require less energy per m3 than the use of faradaic reactions in ed although such studies analyzed ed stacks with only a small number of cell pairs which substantially overestimated the contribution of faradaic reaction from ed electrodes in real applications ma et al 2019b tang et al 2020 ma et al investigated desalination performance with and without carbon electrode added into anode and cathode chamber in fcdi and found that the energy consumption of carbon free fcdi was 3 5 times that of fcdi with 10 wt carbon content at a similar desalination rate ma et al 2019b furthermore rommerskirchen et al constructed a stacked fcdi system to treat high salinity brines 60 g l 1 fig 3 a rommerskirchen et al 2020b theoretical calculations demonstrated that energy consumption of fcdi was lower than ed in a 1 5 pairs stacked structure fig 3b subsequently stacked fcdi and ed devices consisted of three pairs were assembled respectively with the same current density applied on the stacked fcdi and ed devices similar desalination rates were delivered while the energy consumption of fcdi 14 93 kwh m 3 was significantly lower than ed 53 01 kwh m 3 the current voltage curves of the two systems indicated that a higher voltage is required for the faradaic reactions to occur in the electrode which led to the higher energy consumption of the ed system besides experimental research modeling studies have been performed to analyze the energy consumption of fcdi rommerskirchen et al 2018b 2020a wang et al 2020 with an equivalent film electrode model wang et al revealed that the potential drop across the electrodes accounted for over 30 of constant applied voltage on fcdi suggesting the electrodes would consume considerable energy during desalination wang et al 2020 based on a theoretical calculation of the resistances at different effluent concentrations rommerskirchen et al found that the resistance of electrode in a single cell pair was a dominating consumer in whole energy consumption accounting for about 35 50 rommerskirchen et al 2020b therefore a thorough knowledge and optimization of the electrode is critical to reduce energy demand 3 flow electrodes in fcdi 3 1 charge transport in flow electrode charge transport in the flow electrode consists of both electron transport and ion transport as illustrated in fig 4 for the electrons they can transport between the current collector and activated carbon particles through direct contact transport among activated carbon particles through a continuous network formed by particle contact and transport between activated carbon particles via redox reactions marked with① ② and ③ in fig 4 respectively the first and second mechanisms of electron transport occur in all fcdi cells while the last one requires an additional redox couple present within the flow electrode which will be further described in section 4 the ions can transport through the electrolyte and along particles edls tangentially to surfaces marked with ④ and ⑤ in fig 4 respectively shocron and suss 2017 better understanding and quantification of charge transport in flow electrodes would help to improve fcdi performance it is generally believed the electron percolation within the flow electrodes greatly depends on the physical contact to characterize the charge transport in flow electrodes consisted of activated carbon hatzell et al employed synchrotron radiation x ray tomographic microscopy to image particle interactions and revealed the percolating cluster depending on the solid content loading hatzell et al 2017 on this basis another study managed to obtain a 3d reconstructed images capturing the degree of percolation and interparticle voids in the electrode to resolve the charge percolation pathways dixit et al 2019 they found that with higher carbon content loading not only the connected particulate network was increased but also the anisotropy of electron transport and a more tortuous ion transport path were displayed another modeling study by karzar jeddi et al investigated the effect of hydrodynamic interaction on charge transport and demonstrated that charge transport in flow electrode was improved with faster particle charging karzar jeddi et al 2019 these studies have significantly promoted the understanding of charge transport at micron level but are still limited by the difficulty of measuring in the flow state in real application scenarios of flow electrodes to improve understanding electrochemical tests are often performed to determine the resistance and capacitance of flow electrodes which can be performed in situ and enable quantitative analysis of charge transport electrochemical tests can be performed transient e g electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and steady state e g direct current dc measurements previous studies have tried to obtain the electron transport resistance by performing dc tests gloukhovski and suss 2020 hatzell et al 2015a 2017 as one of the typical and most employed electrochemical tests eis is performed by controlling the current or potential as a sinusoidal signal with small amplitude which effectively linearizes the electrochemical system the relevant parameters of the system like resistance and capacitance can be determined through an equivalent linear circuit model built by connecting circuit elements in series and parallel the equivalent circuit model is an important tool for electrochemical analysis hoyt et al proposed an equivalent circuit model including a new custom element as the impedance of the surface charge boundary layer zefc which showed that the electronic resistance was almost unchanged when the flow rate increased from 50 ml min to 250 ml min hoyt et al 2018 however modeling work is still required to simulate the process of charge transport more accurately including ion transport in the 1960s a theoretical transmission line model for porous electrodes was proposed and was employed to study the dynamic charge transport later in the impedance tests on fluidized bed electrodes flowing status de levie 1963 gabrielli et al 1992 1994 juan bisquert et al 1999 based on the transmission line model and previous research on the electrode of electrochemical flow capacitor dennison et al 2014b petek et al 2016 here we present an equivalent circuit for fcdi where the carriers of the current inside the flow electrodes are the electrons and ions and the two currents are linked by a double layer capacitance fig 5 this equivalent circuit aims to better characterize the resistances in fcdi where r s represents the series resistance including the resistance of iems and ionic resistance in the desalination chamber qu et al 2015 2016 further r o is the resistance in the outer circuit elements if any such as current collectors and wires r ct is the contact resistance between carbon particles in flow electrodes and the current collector the constant phase element q ct in parallel with r ct is the interfacial contact capacitance of current collectors and r e n r ion n and c n are electronic resistance ionic resistance and electric double layer capacitance of the carbon particles in flow electrodes per unit volume length respectively where n is a discretization parameter and depends on the test system and computational requirements this model gives a relatively realistic description of the charge transport process but is too complex for fitting calculations and thus a simpler model will be adopted in the subsequent fitting 3 2 electrochemical testing and analysis of flow electrodes 3 2 1 devices and methods for electrochemical testing of flow electrodes cylinder fig 6 a and plate shaped devices fig 6b c have been employed to perform electrochemical tests of flow electrodes equivalent circuit would depend on the devices utilized for example gloukhovski et al utilized a polycarbonate tube with four rectangular titanium electrodes parallel to the flow direction for testing in which the contact resistance between the collector and flow electrodes was negligible according to the test results cohen et al 2016 gloukhovski and suss 2020 rommerskirchen et al examined the entire fcdi system using a graphite plate carved with flow channels where the resistances for charge transport included those in iems and in the solution of the middle chamber rommerskirchen et al 2019 in order to measure the resistance of the flow electrode our device has a plate shape as shown in fig 5c in which the serpentine flow channels are carved in acrylic plate and graphite plates are placed on both sides as current collectors for test systems of fig 6a and c the equivalent circuit is as shown in fig s2 through which the electronic resistance was determined with the dc method the regular eis measurements for flow electrodes are performed at open circuit voltage with 5 20 mv amplitude and with a frequency range between 10 2 and 105 hz high amplitude should be avoided as it may cause non stationary conditions schwarz et al 2002 dc measurements are usually performed by applying a series of low constant voltages increasing from 100 mv to 100 mv at intervals of 20 mv where the resistance is determined as the ratio of voltage to current generally two electrode configuration would go with plate shaped device for the testing but two electrode and four electrode configurations were both applicable in cylinder shaped device which showed little influence on results gloukhovski and suss 2020 3 2 2 data analysis and resistance identification a typical nyquist plot for an eis test with cell in fig 6c is shown in fig 7 a the black line obtained in our study similar to the plots of an fcdi cell in rommerskirchen et al s work rommerskirchen et al 2019 which contains two arcs corresponding to two peaks appearing in the bode plot fig s3 suggesting the system is characterized by two time constants the first arc at higher frequencies is considered related to the parallel connection of contact resistance and interfacial contact capacitance of current collector the higher arc seen in the low frequency region corresponds to charge transport in the flow electrodes it is notable that the arcs may change depending on the configurations of testing devices a study found that the first arc might not appear gloukhovski and suss 2020 and another study obtained a linear line in the low frequency because of the separator in testing device choo et al 2017 for analyzing the data rommerskirchen et al developed an equivalent circuit model which contained the influence of diffusion electrode porosity and convection rommerskirchen et al 2019 the modeling studies were in highly agreement with experimental results most of which were aimed to explore the effects of various conditions on the overall performance of fcdi however it is still difficult to quantify separately the resistances associated with electron or ion transport within the flow electrodes by employing the equivalent circuit based on the theoretical transmission line as described previously and upon substitution of limiting frequencies different resistances in charge transport can be extracted from the nyquist plot fig 6a specifically at high frequency the capacitor acts as a short circuit and as an open circuit at low frequency hence the high frequency intersection on the real axis can be regarded as the sum of resistance of outer circuit elements and the parallel connection of ionic and electronic resistances the low frequency intersection can be estimated as the sum of outer contact and electronic resistances our device was also used to perform a dc test to determine the electron transport resistance fig 6a and c which was found similar to the value of low frequency intersection in eis testing a simplified equivalent circuit as shown in fig 7b has previously utilized to determine the ion transport and electron transport resistances hatzell et al 2015a youssry et al 2013 2015 where r o r ct and q ct are described in section 3 1 r e and r ion are the total electronic and ionic resistances respectively and the constant phase element q is set as the non ideal capacitance of electrode due to the rough electrode surface by applying different experimental conditions of flow electrodes in device fig 6c including carbon content electrolyte concentration and flow rate the results from eis tests fitting calculations and dc tests are shown in table s1 the resistance of current collector and wires r o is too small and is excluded from this table as can be seen the electron transport resistances determined by eis tests are quite in line with those obtained in dc tests the last two columns suggesting the validity of the equivalent circuit based on the same testing and calculation principles the conductivity of various flow electrodes was obtained with both devices in fig 6a and c the conductivity of flow electrode with 2 5 vol multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and 100 mm kbr was measured to be approximately 34 ms cm 1 through a cylindrical device gloukhovski and suss 2020 and similarly in the plate device the conductivity of electrode with 10 wt ac yec 200d and 171 mm nacl was 18 ms cm 1 3 3 resistances in flow electrodes of fcdi as shown in fig 8 and table s1 the dominating resistance of the flow electrode in device fig 6c is electronic resistance which is much higher than ionic resistance suggesting electron transport is the limiting step of charge transport within the electrode in addition the ac content salt concentration of electrolyte and flow rate all have significant impacts on the resistances as shown in fig 8a and table s1 increased carbon content in flow electrodes leads to the decrease in all resistances investigated electronic resistance appears more sensitive than ionic resistance towards carbon content when the carbon content is raised from 10 to 20 electronic resistance sharply drops by an order of magnitude the likely cause is the larger average size of the percolating cluster with higher carbon loading which promotes the electron transport gao et al 2007 hatzell et al 2017 ionic resistance decreases from 7 ω to 2 4 ω when carbon content increases from 5 to 20 suggesting that more solid carbon particles would facilitate the transport of ions this finding is similar to the results of gloukhovski et al gloukhovski and suss 2020 in order to quantify ionic resistance a multi chamber device was fabricated to perform dc tests fig s3a results once again demonstrates that the ionic resistance of flow electrodes are reduced with higher carbon content fig s3b which could be attributed to the short circuiting of the ion conduction path through the particles sabacky and evans 1977 it is noticeable that the contact resistance r ct becomes larger with increased carbon content as determined by eis results table s1 the reason is still under investigation when electrolyte concentration increases from 1 g l 1 to 35 g l 1 ionic resistance decreases from 7 ω to 0 5 ω fig 8b with increasing salt concentration electronic resistance decreases substantially at the beginning but remained stable after the salt concentration is above a certain level as explained by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dvlo theory the increase of electrolyte ionic strength compresses the edls on the surface of the carbon materials thus reducing the average distance between particles increasing particle aggregation and providing an improved path for electron transport between particles daintree and biggs 2010 farina and oldham 1977 gloukhovski and suss 2020 electronic resistance is found to decrease substantially with increased flow rate fig 8c because high flow rate can promote flow disturbances facilitating the contact of particles and reducing the resistance halfon and suss 2019 however several research results show that in a wider test range the resistance first decreases and then increases as faster flow rate applied dennison et al 2014a rommerskirchen et al 2019 which may be a result of boundary layer effects the ionic and contact resistances are both less affected by flow rate fig 8c and table s1 the unusual drop of contact resistance at flow rate of 5 ml min 1 is probably due to increased aggregation of activated carbon particles on the collector surface at low flow rates 3 4 conductivity of flow electrodes with different materials as mentioned above electronic resistance is critical to the electrode the electronic conductivity of flow electrodes with different materials also varies dramatically as shown in the data in table s3 the electronic conductivity of the flow electrode with mwcnt is greater than that of several other materials ac and acetylene black for various volume mass fractions in addition to the conductivity of the solid particle material itself the reasons for these differences are related mainly to particle shape and agglomeration tendencies for example high aspect ratio particles such as mwcnts can form more effective percolating networks relative to low aspect ratio particles for a given particle loading foygel et al 2005 mutiso and winey 2015 parant et al 2017 takeno et al 2017 tarlton et al 2017 we tested the conductivity of flow electrodes of mwcnt ac yp 50f and ac norit sx ultra when suspended into di water to isolate their electronic conductivity and for various particle volume fractions conductive additives such as carbon black were not included in the flow electrodes from well established percolation theory measurements of electronic conductivity can be used to calculate the percolation threshold of the conductive phase mutiso and winey 2015 the percolation threshold was found by best fitting the measured conductivities to a power law for carbon volume fractions in the vicinity of significant macroscopic electrical conductivity onset σ σ0 φ φc t where σ is the macroscopic electrical conductivity in s cm 1 σ 0 is the pre exponent in s cm 1 φ is the carbon volumetric fraction in the suspension φ c is the percolation threshold and t is the conductivity exponent there is no clear reference to the upper limit of the aforementioned power law applicability however it should work at φ values close to the percolation threshold mutiso and winey 2015 as clearly seen in fig 9 the mwcnt suspension conductivity dominated over the activated carbon suspension conductivities yp 50f suspensions significantly differed from mwcnt and norit sx ultra yp 50f particles conducted electricity very poorly and its calculated percolation threshold was 2 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the other materials all the tested materials fit well to a power law however differ in the prefactor and the conductivity exponent the prefactor is influenced by the inherent particle conductivity contact resistance and network topology foygel et al 2005 and ranged 4 orders of magnitude the conductivity exponent equaled to t 2 in the mwcnt and yp50f power laws and t 1 in the norit sx ultra power law in the polymer composite literature t 2 matches the 3d universal exponent for spherical particles foygel et al 2005 mutiso and winey 2015 we hypothesize supported by the images in fig 10 that mwcnt particles agglomerated into sphere like aggregates and effectively acted as large spherical particles resulting in t 2 according to fig 10 the yp 50f particles with aspect ratio ar 1 remained fully dispersed thus resulting in t 2 surprisingly the norit sx ultra conductivity exponent tended towards the lower values mentioned in literature for 2d 3d elongated particles ranging 1 1 1 6 foygel et al 2005 fig 10 shows optical microscope images of the particle suspensions we tested comprising 1 vol and di water the field of view sizes in fig 10 are 1 1 mm x 1 5 mm a b and 1 5 mm x 2 mm c although our mwcnt primary particles are rod shaped elongated cylinders with aspect ratio ar 200 500 they agglomerate to 100 µm sized bundles with an aspect ratio close to 1 see fig 10a as they interconnect via van der waals interactions of neighboring agglomerates in a di water suspension tarlton et al 2017 norit sx ultra suspension is shown in fig 10b these particles are initially large with ar 1 d90 100 µm and it seems they connect via the smaller particles d10 3 µm d50 15 µm of the suspension the agglomerates formed here look much more elongated than those of mwcnt suggesting higher ar than 1 the yp 50f suspension shown in fig 10c comprises uniformly separated 5 20 µm sized primary particles which apparently do not form any significant agglomerates 4 factors affecting desalination performance of fcdi evaluation metrics of fcdi desalination performance include desalination rate and energy consumption that are usually normalized to either per unit of treated water or per unit of ion removal hawks et al 2019 through summarizing over 30 reported fcdi desalination performances in literatures normalized to per mole of ions removed fig s5 shows their energy consumptions and salt removal rates the factors that affect performance are diverse including not only separation itself i e feed salinity and removal efficiency but also flow electrodes device design operation mode etc detailed information in table s3 clearly current studied desalination process by fcdi required the energy between 60 kj mol 1 and 250 kj mol 1 while mostly delivered salt removal rates below 3 μmol cm 2 min 1 when treating high saline water nacl concentration over 30 g l 1 the exceptionally high salt removal rates up to 38 5 μmol cm 2 min 1 were achieved and other factors affecting the desalination performance including the flow electrodes and operation mode will be discussed below 4 1 effects of flow electrodes on fcdi desalination the resistance against electron transport in flow electrodes greatly restrains charge transport leading to limited desalination performance of fcdi various measures have been employed to reduce the electron transport resistance among activated carbon particles including increasing carbon content adding conductive agents introducing redox reactions and assembling current collectors and iems for shorter charge transport distance fig 11 the understanding that increasing the content of activated carbon can promote the formation of the electron transport network to facilitate electron transport has been evidenced by an experimental study where increased carbon content from 10 wt to 20 wt significantly improved the salt removal rate from 0 3 to 1 2 μmol cm 2 min 1 fig 11a porada et al 2014 however the carbon content of flow electrodes in fcdi is generally considered no more than 20 wt to be well circulated but surface modification of the carbon material can reduce its viscosity and thus enable a high carbon content of flow electrodes up to 35 hatzell et al 2015b park et al 2016 adding conductive agents e g carbon black and carbon nanotube in flow electrodes can also improve the desalination performance liang et al 2017 tang et al 2019 when 0 5 wt functionalized carbon nanotubes were added in flow electrodes to form conducting bridges among activated carbon particles for the electrons the resistance of electron transport was greatly reduced leading to a much increased salt removal rate from 8 7 to 34 32 μmol cm 2 min 1 fig 11b cho et al 2019 another study employed additional 14 mm l 1 liquid solvent benzoquinone into 1 wt activated carbon flow electrodes the electron transport among carbon particles were considerably facilitated through benzoquinone s redox properties and the salt removal rate was improved fig 11c ma et al 2016 but the difficulty in separating and the toxicity of benzoquinone would pose a safety hazard besides promoting charge transport in flow electrodes reformed current collectors can also facilitate charge transport by providing an easier distance for charge transport fig 11d linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 when a titanium mash was placed adjacent to the iem to serve as current collector the salt removal rate was increased by 89 than the control fcdi with titanium mesh far from the membrane in summary adding solid conductive agents to promote the formation of a conducting network is the simplest and most applied way to increase charge transport in flow electrodes however those conductive agents are of high cost besides flow electrodes salt concentration in the electrode chamber also significantly affects the desalination performance of fcdi as described in section 3 3 an increase in the salt concentration in flow electrodes will reduce the overall resistance and thus improve the performance which has been experimentally evidenced by a study where increased nacl concentration in flow electrodes from 0 wt to 1 48 wt reduced the total resistance from 24 26 to 5 03 ω and doubled the salt removal rate yang et al 2016a apart from the change in resistance the salt concentration also affects the donnan potential across iems simultaneously which will influence the portion of the voltage for driving ions transport at a given applied voltage in addition excessive salt in the electrode will lead to the increased back diffusion of ions which reduces the charge efficiency and degrades desalination performance ma et al 2019b moreno and hatzell 2018 yang et al 2017a it has been reported that when salt concentration in electrode was increased from 342 mm to 855 mm the salt removal rate decreased from 0 94 to 0 68 μmol cm 2 min 1 ma et al 2019b these facts suggest that an optimal salt concentration of electrolyte should be carefully determined in the meantime a stable salt concentration in the flow electrodes is also conducive for a stable desalination performance zhang et al succeeded in continuously operating fcdi for 14 days by maintaining a stable electrode salt concentration through separating and discharging the concentrated water from the electrodes with a microfiltration membrane zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a flow rate of electrodes has also been found to affect fcdi s desalination performance as well as energy consumption it is acknowledged that increased flow rate within a certain range will reduce the electron transport resistance as discussed in 3 3 leading to faster desalting performance and less energy requirement particularly for salt removal however a high flow rate will definitely increase the energy consumption of pumping an experimental study revealed that increased electrode flow rate from 100 ml min 1 to 150 ml min 1 slightly declined the energy consumption for salt removal from 0 72 wh g 1 nacl to 0 7 wh g 1 nacl but raised the total energy consumption including energy for salt removal and pumping from 0 77 wh g 1 nacl to 0 8 wh g 1 nacl rommerskirchen et al 2018a 4 2 effects of operation mode on fcdi desalination there are three typical modes to operate an fcdi based on different ways to circulate flow electrodes i e isolated closed cycle icc short circuited closed cycle scc and single cycle sc modes he et al 2018 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2019b 2020b rommerskirchen et al 2015 these three modes have different electrosorption desorption patterns energy consumption and advantageous application areas in icc mode flow electrodes are circulated in anode chamber and cathode chamber respectively fig 12 a it can be regarded that the electrosorption and desorption in icc operation happen in sequence like in cdi the desorption occurs when short circuited or reversely charged there is distinguished electrosorption and desorption in scc mode as well fig 12b after absorbing the ions the flow electrodes from anode and cathode chamber will be introduced into an outer chamber where they are mixed up to release the ions dahiya and mishra 2020 however in sc mode the flow electrodes are circulated all through anode chamber and cathode chamber fig 12c while the flow electrodes enriched with ions in one chamber directly enter the other chamber desorption and electrosorption will occur simultaneously this desorption process here is similar to reversed voltage current desorption in cdi compared with the icc mode where electrosorption and desorption occur successively the timely desorption in the scc and sc modes would help to renew more available electrosorption capacity of activated carbon particles during the whole desalination process leading to better desalination performance as well as lower operating voltage required because the salt removal is mostly led by the electrosorption in edls he et al found that at the same current density fcdi s operation in scc mode would require a much reduced maximum voltage 1 0 v than in icc mode 1 92 v and only 47 energy consumption of icc mode he et al 2018 it is noticed that simultaneous charging and discharging in sc mode would make well use of the electrostatic energy accumulated during desorption and therefore decrease the energy consumption ma et al 2020b similar to sc mode jeon et al connected the anode and cathode chambers of two fcdi cells in reverse series as shown in fig 12d jeon et al 2019 the positive electrode marked in red would adsorb the anions in the first fcdi cell and then enter negatively charged chamber in the second cell where the anions would be discharged and retained in the electrolyte promoting more cations to migrate into the anode chamber due to the effect of charge neutralization when operating in scc or sc modes the ions are eventually concentrated in the electrolyte where separation of ions from the flow electrodes is normally required however rommerskirchen et al employed a four chamber fcdi device operating with sc mode and facilitated the refreshment of flow electrodes rommerskirchen et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 12e after absorbing chloride ions the flow electrodes in anode chamber would enter the cathode chamber where the chloride ions would be desorbed into the solution and pass through the adjacent anion exchange membrane under the applied electric field afterwards chloride and sodium ions would be removed in the concentrated chamber since scc and sc modes greatly facilitate the regeneration of electrodes desorption it has been found advantageous over other operation modes as it could avoid re salination of desalted water and achieve high water recovery hawks et al 2018 effective regeneration of flow electrodes also makes desalination performance of fcdi no longer limited by the electrosorption capacity of carbon particles and enables the desalting treatments of both low and high concentration salt water rommerskirchen et al successfully desalted high salinity water with 60 g l 1 nacl by fcdi accompanied by water recovery of 77 6 rommerskirchen et al 2020b several researchers have also noticed that when fcdi was operated with icc mode dissociation of water or faradaic reactions would occur in the electrode chamber producing oh and h and resulting in ph increase in the cathode chamber and decrease in the anode chamber respectively a study operating fcdi for 11 h with icc mode found obvious change in cathode ph from 9 to 12 5 and in anode from 9 to 1 42 nativ et al 2017 particularly for recovering target resource this ph change in icc mode can promote the conversion of some substances such as the conversion of nh4 to nh3 in alkaline solution of the cathode or the conversion of po4 3 to h3po4 in acidic solution of the anode which is beneficial for further separation bian et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al employed fcdi under icc mode to remove ammonium ions from dilute wastewater after selectively concentrated in the cathode ammonium ions turned into dissolved nh3 with following stripping via gas permeable membrane and finally recovered as ammonium sulfate zhang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a 5 conclusions and outlook fcdi is an appealing electro driven desalination process based on flow electrodes it is revealed that the electron transport in flow electrodes is critical to the fcdi performance which is related not only to the conductivity of the solid electrode particles themselves but also to the inter particle connectivity and the potentially parallel mechanisms of electrosorption and electrodialysis in the fcdi desalination process is presented despite of demonstrated advantages of continuous desalination and low energy consumption fcdi is still in early stage of development and is far from practical application for now first for a better desalination performance conductive agents are intensively employed to enhance the conductivity of flow electrodes however these conductive agents like carbon nanotubes and carbon black are normally costly materials it is still challenging to develop low cost high conductivity capacitive materials to serve as flow electrodes regarding energy consumption it should not be ignored that maintaining the circulation of flow electrodes requires a considerable amount of energy which accounts for 5 25 as reported previously reducing the viscosity of flow electrodes e g surface modifying of electrode materials and proper design of flow channel e g applying a parallel flow channel to replace serpentine channel for a shorter flow path and lower pressure drop may present solutions to address this concern so far desalination studies of fcdi have explored a wide salinity range from 0 5 to 60 g l 1 suggesting that besides treating brackish water fcdi may be further employed in the field of zero discharge of industrial wastewater another potential application of fcdi should be the recovery of specific resources like phosphates and heavy metal ions through promoted transformation of target ions declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement this work

ema 2006 the asrit exposes an activated sludge bacterial community to a test compound and measures for significant decreases in respiration oecd 2009 concerns that the asrit and other eukaryotic ecotoxicological endpoints may not be protective of selection for amr in the environment and the subsequent need for novel methods to quantify selective endpoints have been circulating for close to ten years ashbolt et al 2013 brandt et al 2015 gullberg et al 2011 le page et al 2017 this review summarises for the first time the benefits and limitations of the different approaches to determining selective concentrations of antibiotics alongside selective concentrations determined to date recommendations on how these data can be interpreted to determine selective endpoints for era with minimal adjustment to current era approaches are outlined unique challenges posed by amr through an era lens are also discussed 2 methods that determine selective concentrations of antibiotics the potential selection for amr in natural environments has been largely overlooked in part due to the unsupported hypothesis that very low concentrations of antimicrobials or antibiotics are unable to select for amr gullberg et al 2011 performed the first significant study that challenged this assumption where they demonstrated that very low antibiotic concentrations could select for antibiotic resistant bacteria by conducting single species competition experiments isogenic bacterial species genetically identical except for the presence of a resistance determinant on the chromosome of the resistant strain were fluorescently tagged allowing for their accurate enumeration these isogenic strains were grown in defined ratios of resistant to susceptible cells in the presence of multiple concentrations of antibiotics in a serial passage experiment where the bacteria were transferred into fresh media and antibiotic each day enumeration after antibiotic exposure allowed calculation of selection coefficients which represent the difference in fitness between resistant and susceptible bacteria otto and day 2007 for example selection coefficients greater than 0 indicate the bacteria harbouring the studied resistance gene are under positive selection and their numbers will increase over time conversely selection coefficients less than 0 indicate numbers of resistant bacteria will decrease over time day et al 2015 selection coefficients can be plotted against antibiotic concentration and the x axis intercept of the line of best fit through these data points indicates the minimal selective concentration msc this is the lowest concentration at which resistance is predicted to be selected for i e when numbers of resistant bacteria are expected to increase over time relative to non resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2011 found that the msc can be over 200x lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of the susceptible strain and confirmed antibiotics do not need to exceed the mic of susceptible bacteria in order to have a selective effect gullberg et al built upon their previous work by determining mscs for antimicrobial resistance genes args located on a mobile clinically isolated plasmid again mscs were much lower than mics of the susceptible strain gullberg et al 2014 these studies raised concerns regarding the potential selection of amr occurring in the environment as selection was observed at environmentally relevant concentrations down to 2 ng l gullberg et al 2011 however the relevance of these findings in relation to the environment is unclear as single isogenic host species are unlikely to be representative of the complex competitive interactions occurring within and other selective pressures encountered by environmental communities of bacteria this was confirmed by a study that found mscs differ when isogenic strains are cultured in single species competition experiments compared to within a bacterial community klümper et al 2019 in this study mscs of gentamicin and kanamycin were determined using isogenic strains in single species competitions assays as well as when the strains were embedded within a pig faecal bacterial community the mscs of gentamicin and kanamycin increased by 13 and 43x respectively when in the presence of the community though the exact msc values were not reported klümper et al 2019 other work has attempted to determine selective concentrations within complex bacterial communities in an effort to increase environmental relevance strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of these different approaches are detailed in table 1 whilst experimental details are outlined below the first of the experimental approaches that used complex communities lundstrom et al 2016 established a biofilm from untreated wastewater in a flow through system which was continuously exposed to low concentrations of tetracycline low nutrient media and untreated wastewater a variety of methods were explored for determining the selective concentration including phenotypic and culture based methods the pollution induced community tolerance pict assay schmitt et al 2005 and molecular methods including qpcr and metagenome analyses the qpcr method was deemed the most sensitive identifying the lowest tetracycline concentration where an effect was observed at 1 ug l two different tetracycline resistance genes were quantified alongside 16s rrna copy number as a proxy for number of bacteria enabling determination of molecular arg prevalence arg 16s rrna copy number lundstrom et al 2016 further studies have also used untreated wastewater but in closed experimental systems where bacterial communities are passed into fresh antibiotic media daily for 7 or 8 days metagenomic analyses were used to confirm suitable gene targets for qpcr and molecular arg prevalence was quantified with qpcr at the beginning and end of the experiment which allowed determination of the msc as well as statistically defined selective concentrations murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 more recently selection experiments were performed using the flow through system described by lundstrom et al 2016 and a batch microcosm system within the same study kraupner et al 2018 both used the same minimal medium though batch microcosms were incubated at 25 c and the flow through system was maintained at 20 c percentages of escherichia coli resistant to ciprofloxacin the test antibiotic were calculated and the lowest concentration where an increase was observed relative to the control occurred at 5 µg l and 10 µg l for the flow through system and batch microcosm respectively though this differs by a factor of two the no observed effect concentration noec the concentration directly below the lowest observed effect concentration for both systems was 1 µg l therefore in this instance the two systems were comparable and may even have yielded the same result were the same concentrations tested in both systems kraupner et al 2018 a comparison was also made between the flow through system lundstrom et al 2016 and the high nutrient batch microcosm murray et al 2018 in a study by stanton et al 2020 both lundstrom et al 2016 and stanton et al 2020 quantified increases in tetracycline resistance genes using qpcr and when data were analysed in the same way the same noec was observed however as hypothesised previously murray et al 2018 the observed effect was likely increased persistence of resistance genes as opposed to positive selection stanton et al 2020 this minimal increased persistence concentration mipc is still relevant for human health risk assessment as it results in higher numbers of resistant bacteria being present in a given microbiome in the presence of antibiotic than in the absence which increases the potential of human or animal exposure to these bacteria stanton et al 2020 in addition there could be increased likelihood of horizontal gene transfer as there would be a greater number of arg donors a selective endpoint for ciprofloxacin was also determined by stanton et al 2020 as 7 6 µg l very similar to the 5 10 µg l observed in kraupner et al 2018 together these points indicate highly replicable high throughput batch microcosms can produce very similar if not identical selective concentration data as more expensive technically demanding flow through systems a further study by n kraupner et al 2020 compared selective endpoints of trimethoprim in different systems changes in taxonomic composition were determined in an effluent sewage community biofilm microcosm but the study primarily focused on resistant e coli in three different experimental systems biofilms derived from treated effluent a community of 149 e coli strains isolated from sewage and isogenic strains of e coli in competition experiments at 100 µg l of trimethoprim significant increases in percentage of resistant e coli in the biofilm and the e coli community were observed whereas only a trend for significance was observed in taxonomic composition for the engineered e coli positive selection coefficients were determined at 100 µg l but not 10 µg l however the authors indicate that the cost of the resistance gene was significantly reduced at 10 µg l n kraupner et al 2020 i e there would be increased persistence at this concentration stanton et al 2020 when statistically comparing percentages of engineered resistant e coli carrying four of the five genes tested an exposure limit of 1 µg l was suggested based on this observation the most recent experimental method to determine selective endpoints is the select selection endpoints in communities of bacteria method a k murray et al 2020 this method exposes a community of sewage bacteria to two fold dilutions of antibiotics in a 96 well plate and measures optical density in a plate reader during exponential growth phase of the community a significant dose response relationship can be observed the selective endpoint is the antibiotic concentration that significantly reduces the growth of the community at the time point where that dose response relationship is strongest this has been demonstrated to be a reliable proxy for selection for resistance genes determined using qpcr in previous studies murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 due to the rapidity of the method selective endpoints for several antibiotics were determined including trimethoprim at 1 56 µg l extremely similar to the 1 µg l determined previously n kraupner et al 2020 in the select study lower temperature and nutrient conditions use of artificial sewage as the growth media as in the asrit oecd 2009 were also tested and had minimal effect on the endpoints derived this study was also the first to directly compare different sewage inocula for the same antibiotic and found this too had minimal effect on the endpoints derived indicating a single endpoint may be suitable for different geographical locations or environments a k murray et al 2020 finally there have been attempts to consider selection by estimating selective endpoints as opposed to using experimental approaches the first of these used mic50 values for susceptible pathogens as surrogates for selective endpoints to perform risk assessment of antibiotics in hospital effluent kümmerer and henninger 2003 an assessment factor af of 100 was applied this relatively large af was used for two reasons the first was to estimate the mic10 value given that noecs can be considered as the concentration where only a 10 effect is observed eu 1996 the second was because the pecs were multiplied by 10 to estimate maximum peak loads kümmerer and henninger 2003 the second paper to estimate selective endpoint predicted species sensitivity distributions using mic data and extrapolated these selective concentrations across bacterial genera through phylogenetic analyses by comparing to mecs it was estimated 7 of environmental genera could be under selection tello et al 2012 finally selective concentrations have been estimated using the eucast mic database to estimate predicted no effect concentrations for resistance pnecrs all mics for all the species were extracted and mics above the wildtype were removed these were adjusted against the numbers of species per antibiotic finally the lowest 1 of all mics were taken and an af of 10 applied this resulted in pnecrs ranging from 8 ng l to 64 ug l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 all of these studies have not yet determined how community resilience may affect selection for amr community resilience is the ability of a bacterial community to return to its original state or a new stable state following the removal of a disturbance brandt et al 2015 the functionality of bacterial communities may be compromised for example if diversity is reduced and this could be further compounded by exposure to other pollution sources or changes in temperature making it particularly pertinent in light of climate change amr adds an additional facet to community resilience as resistance normally results in an evolutionary cost to the host bacterium however there are numerous evolutionary mechanisms to mitigate this cost such as presence of compensatory mutations cost free resistance traits or location of resistance genes on plasmids which confer a fitness benefit andersson and hughes 2011 arguably following exposure to antibiotics bacterial communities may never return to a pre exposure state due to these compensatory effects furthermore it is unclear whether communities that have evolved at selective concentrations of antibiotics are then primed to face future episodes of exposure due to these evolutionary compensatory mechanisms however whether communities do become primed will likely dependant on many factors these include whether the resistance mechanism is selfish or produces public goods bottery et al 2016 murray et al 2018 public good resistance mechanisms such as antibiotic degradation by enzymes produced by resistant bacteria could be negatively selected because the degradation of antibiotics is beneficial to all bacteria in the population whether they produce the enzyme or not whether a resistance mechanism is readily mobilisable i e plasmid borne will impact the extent of transmission within the community and the fitness of the bacterial host in the absence of exposure is also key if future studies point toward a lack of community resilience then different safe release limits may be required for different environments e g pharmaceutical waste vs municipal waste or limits may need to change over time depending on the history of exposure 3 amr specific era adjusting and consolidating with current guidelines all of the above studies have determined selective concentrations but there are differences in how these are derived what they are termed and what they mean each has different implications for both environmental and human health exposure risk assessment the standardised era approach determines the lowest observed effect concentration loec on the basis this test concentration has a significantly different response compared to the control echa 2008 ema 2006 2018 fda 1998b the concentration below this the noec is used to derive the predicted no effect concentration pnec by dividing it by an af which differs based on chronic or acute exposure and number of studies echa 2008 see af section environmental risk is then determined by dividing the predicted environmental concentration pec or measured environmental concentration mec by the pnec to generate a risk quotient rq ema 2006 a recent meta analysis le page et al 2017 compared the relative sensitivity of environmental species used to derive pnecs in regulatory approaches to era there are currently four antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole included on the third version of the water framework directive s wfd watch list gomez cortes et al 2020 these are surface water pollutants where the pec or mec regularly exceeds the pnec which are being monitored with the european union to determine if environmental quality standards eqs are required carvalho et al 2015 loos et al 2018 until this most recent iteration these pnecs were based on ecotoxicological endpoints though amr data are now being considered gomez cortes et al 2020 to enable rapid era and human health risk assessment of the selective potential of compounds released into our environments it would be best to align with current methodologies however it has been established that ecotoxicological pnecs are not always protective against selection for amr bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le page et al 2017 tell et al 2019 therefore it is recommended that pnecrs are used when referring specifically to selective concentrations of antibiotics which may not always have ecotoxicological effects at ecologically relevant pecs or mecs furthermore as there are several experimental methodologies several different definitions of selective concentrations also exist the first of these methods used was the msc gullberg et al 2011 as described above however it is debatable whether a pnec should be derived from mscs as this endpoint is a modelled estimate that can be greatly impacted by the number of test concentrations included in the model and the intervals between these test concentrations in addition the msc is defined as the concentration where the fitness cost of the resistance is balanced by the antibiotic conferred selection for the resistant mutant gullberg et al 2011 or in other words where resistant strains are under neither positive nor negative selection and there is no longer an evolutionary cost to resistance only when stochastic events occur or further increases in selective pressure are introduced will resistant bacteria be positively selected therefore in terms of protection against selection the msc is likely conservative and may marginally overestimate risk if used to calculate a pnecr mscs are also likely to change when different isogenic strains are used which could lead to over or underestimation of risk the msc method also presents difficulties as the no antibiotic control may also show positive selection for resistance n kraupner et al 2020 stanton et al 2020 as all selection coefficients are 0 the intercept msc cannot be calculated although this could be overcome by subtracting the no antibiotic control selection coefficients from the exposure selection coefficients this may introduce bias the msc method does however require quantification of resistance at the beginning of the exposure experiment as this is crucial for understanding risk this allows clarification between increases in total number of resistance genes resistant bacteria over time i e positive selection vs reduced loss of resistance genes compared to the control i e increased persistence which is needed for interpretation of risk increased persistence of resistance has been referred to as the mipc which is below the msc stanton et al 2020 however it is unclear how an mipc could be determined using an msc approach as the mipc lies beneath the intercept of the x axis i e below the msc this phenomenon has also been referred to as a significant reduction in fitness cost n kraupner et al 2020 persistence could be defined statistically as the concentration where a significant increase in antibiotic resistance gene prevalence is observed compared to the control at the end of the experiment and irrespective of starting prevalence fig 1 it would be unnecessary to first calculate selection coefficients and then perform statistical tests when the same tests could be used directly on the antibiotic resistance endpoint data e g antibiotic resistance gene prevalence to closer align to current era methods a statistical method should be used to determine the selective concentration as opposed to an estimate like the msc given the differences highlighted in this review and elsewhere between selection and persistence n kraupner et al 2020 murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 we propose new terms to clarify these endpoints the lowest observed selection concentration losc represents the concentration where a significant increase in resistance gene prevalence other endpoint is observed over time compared to the control a no observed selection concentration nosc would then be the concentration below this and a pnecr derived through applying an af as before in terms of human exposure it may be more protective to consider overall numbers of resistant bacteria stanton et al 2020 the concentration at which persistence is observed could be considered as the loec which could be used to derive a predicted no effect concentration for persistence pnecp using the noec compared to the msc and by extension mipc that may overestimate risk for the reasons described above the losc and loec may slightly underestimate risk but are statistically robust adjustment with afs would further reduce the possibility of risk underestimation whether safe release limits should be based on the pnecr or pnecp is a matter for debate but broadly the former may be more suited to era and the latter to human health risk assessment the relationship between these values are shown in fig 1 it is important to define and distinguish between the two in order to 1 facilitate compliance by not imposing overly stringent targets in areas with minimal human exposure whilst still preventing increases in resistance and 2 recognise the difference in risk posed by overall resistant numbers of bacteria genes in an environment to which humans or animals may be readily exposed however use of the pnecp for both environmental and human health risk assessment would be the most protective there are also further considerations when considering risk of individual genes bacteria such as mobilisable potential of different genes which have been reviewed elsewhere bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 martinez et al 2014 however generally we recommend a mixed community approach for the experimental determination of pnecrs or pnecps to be more environmentally representative and to provide a diverse collection of bacteria and args that selection could act upon the options of loscs loecs and mscs have been discussed but the question remains over what an appropriate assessment factor might be in order to convert these into pnecrs or pnecps recently the ema revised their guidance on era of medicines approved for human use an af of 10 was recommended for surface water and sewage treatment plant pnecs ema 2018 in addition the wfd used an af of 10 when determining which substances to include on the watch list carvalho et al 2015 given these current approaches and the lack of understanding regarding effects of acute or chronic exposure to antibiotics of bacterial communities and community resilience this af seems appropriate for the time being however it has been suggested previously that microbial community level studies may require greater assessment factors to account for the greater degree of uncertainty within these systems brandt et al 2015 therefore the community based studies described above could utilise larger afs the inclusion of more prokaryotic taxa within the revised ema era guideline ema 2018 attempts to address some aspects of this uncertainty by recognising the limited value of fish studies and testing more relevant taxa we applied this framework to interpret all the concentration data generated thus far table 2 in the experimental studies already described there are 33 concentration data generated to date for 11 antibiotics spanning 6 antibiotic classes we determined the pnecr or pnecp as follows selective concentration data determined using the msc approach we left unadjusted as this is already a modelled estimate as described above where statistics were used to assign the selective or persistence concentration the test concentration below this the nosc or noec was adjusted with an af of 10 where the methodology was insufficient to determine the concentration as being the selective or persistence concentration we assigned this as unknown applied an af of 10 and assigned as either a potential pnecr or pnecp see table 2 using this approach and the data currently available the antibiotic likely to pose the greatest risk to the environment is ciprofloxacin pnecrs 0 05 and 0 78 µg l msc 0 004 10 77 µg l n studies 3 unknown potential pnecr or pnecp using metagenomics of 0 01 µg l trimethoprim is also of potential concern pnecrs 1 5 µg l n studies 3 mscs 33 49 6 µg l n studies 2 these two compounds are already on the current version of the wfd watch list gomez cortes et al 2020 and are the most well studied in terms of selective concentrations table 2 tetracycline may also pose a risk but further work is needed as currently only pnecp or unknown data 0 01 and 0 09 µg l respectively are available alongside the msc data 15 and 45 µg l by comparison pnecrs determined to date for the three macrolides azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin indicate these pose relatively low risk of selection for resistance with all lowest pnecrs determined as 50 µg l but ranging from 50 to 12 500 µg l for erythromycin n studies 4 these macrolides were on previous versions of the wfd watch list carvalho et al 2015 loos et al 2018 but have since been removed these data indicate pnecr determination and era of other quinolones and fluoroquinolones should be of high priority followed potentially by cephalosporins cefotaxime msc 4 µg l pnecr 0 78 and 6 25 µg l and further consolidation work on tetracyclines there are still two classes of non combination antibiotic classes without any data penicillin beta lactams and sulfonamides though trimethoprim is usually grouped with these as they are commonly used in combination these should also be prioritised for determination of further amr endpoints however more data are still required for the other antibiotics e g macrolides aminoglycosides in order to draw definitive conclusions about the risk they pose currently available data suggest amr endpoints will not always be more protective than ecotoxicological endpoints and vice versa so both are needed to move toward maximum environmental and human health protection a k murray et al 2020 4 further considerations for determination of any pnec chemical quantification of the test compound is required this is essential for antibiotics as many antibiotic resistance mechanisms are degradative in nature for example almost complete degradation of cefotaxime at clinical concentrations 2 mg l was observed in the presence of a wastewater community whereas in sterile culture degradation was around 60 murray et al 2018 it is possible that the relatively low mecs of antibiotics such as cefotaxime to which there are numerous degradative resistance mechanisms have resulted from degradation by resistant bacterial populations present in the environment as opposed to high lability alone this raises questions about the robustness of chemical based eqs used under the wfd to protect human health they will be adequate for ecological protection but high levels of resistance that could pose a human health threat may occur where there are low levels of antibiotic if the resistance mechanism is degradative this is most relevant for the beta lactam class of antibiotics including the world health organisation critically important humans medicines such as third generation cephalosporins and last line carbapenems who 2017 to which clinical resistance is often conferred by degradative enzymes such as the extended spectrum beta lactamases canton and coque 2006 or carbapenemases nordmann et al 2011 this is problematic as low mecs could actually indicate high levels of resistance monitoring of resistance genes in soil was recently proposed by the european commission eu 2019 and so this could also be recommended for monitoring surface waters for example in future amendments to the wfd watch list however quantitatively linking the presence of resistance genes in the environment to colonisation subsequent infection and adverse clinical outcomes remains a significant challenge when determining pnecrs for highly labile antibiotics it may be necessary to introduce antibiotic continuously in a flow through system though this may still not be recommended if the required flow rate exceeds the maximum growth rate of bacteria as this would result in wash out and reduced ecological relevance ziv et al 2013 in batch systems degradation experiments are recommended to enable extrapolation of the average exposure concentration over the test period to determine a more accurate noec for either system understanding of compound lability is essential to prevent pnecr overestimation chemical quantification is complicated further when considering biofilms and heterogeneous penetration by antibiotics very little is understood regarding the antibiotic concentration within bacterial cells or at the bacterial cell surface and how this may affect selection furthermore there is some evidence to suggest intra and extracellular ph concentrations can lead to different antimicrobial activity of the same antibiotic in different bacteria tappe et al 2008 studying these phenomena is now possible due to the development of single cell microfluidic systems such as the mother machine microfluidic device bamford et al 2017 in addition to quantification of antibiotics within experimental systems greater effort is required to generate pecs of antibiotics with high spatial resolution and to determine mecs of antibiotics in a more systematic manner looking at catchments and inputs over time there are many physiochemical considerations that may affect fate and transport of antibiotics which are reviewed elsewhere jafari ozumchelouei et al 2020 the largest open access database of mecs was collated by the umweltbundesamt in 2016 umweltbundesamt 2016 and was recently updated aus der beek et al 2016 umweltbundesamt 2019 these data are essential for determining rqs that are protective of selection better understanding of the pathways of human exposure to these mecs is also needed for example the relative significance of these pathways for colonisation infection by resistant bacteria which may be pathogenic opportunistically pathogenic or even non pathogenic or their impacts on the existing commensal bacteria that form the human microbiome such as potential horizontal gene exchange between the pre existing microbiome and ingested bacteria this should be included within an integrated human and environmental health risk framework ashbolt et al 2013 larsson et al 2018 a significant factor affecting all aspects of era not just era of amr is the inescapable fact that pharmaceuticals exist in the environment as a complex mixture with other chemicals and stressors it is likely that in the majority of cases selective concentrations of individual antibiotics will be reduced in antibiotic mixtures especially as some antibiotics are used in combination clinically for their synergistic effects such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole within class antibiotics are likely to have additive effects given the lack of methods to experimentally quantify ecotoxicological effects of mixtures in general and the missing requirement for mixtures assessment in current era guidelines a tiered approach has been suggested backhaus 2016 firstly rqs derived for individual compounds could be summed using readily available individual compound pnec data and secondly mixture specific afs could also be used backhaus 2016 however as previously highlighted still comparatively few pnecr data are available for amr era furthermore how antibiotics may interact with other co selective compounds such as metals baker austin et al 2006 or biocides pal et al 2015 may be less predictable and more research is needed in this area co selection is the process whereby resistance to a compound can be indirectly selected for in the absence of that compound or when it is only present at a sub selective concentration this can be through genetic hitch hiking of co localised resistance genes for example on mobile genetic elements co resistance or if one gene confers resistance to both compounds cross resistance such as multidrug efflux pumps only one compound needs to be present in order to select for the entire mobile element or gene conferring cross resistance to be selected for baker austin et al 2006 generally it is assumed both metals and biocides could co select for antibiotic resistance and therefore may have an additive or synergistic effect however there are some data to suggest antagonistic effects may also occur for example one recent study demonstrated the selective concentration of ciprofloxacin increased in the presence of zinc possibly due to chelation vos et al 2020 the baseline msc of ciprofloxacin of 0 004 µg l increased to 0 011 µg l and 0 022 µg l in the presence of 0 5 mm and 1 mm concentrations of zinc 2 respectively vos et al 2020 however generally it is assumed that risks posed by mixtures are greater than the individual constituent compounds backhaus 2016 revision of current era guidelines such as those by the ema that progress to phase ii toxicity testing based on pec data for individual compounds may also be required backhaus 2016 if and when mixture effects are incorporated into current guidelines any amr specific era guidelines should be updated one possible approach to quantify mixture effects could be whole effluent toxicity wet this is currently used in the usa to determine if all the compounds present in effluents are safe or have a toxic effect epa 2002 this could be adapted to examine the selective potential of effluents through exposure experiments as outlined above where a range of diluted effluents are used in place of a single test antibiotic the most selective effluents can then be prioritised for further analyses e g chemical quantification prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and or genes or mitigation 5 conclusions and future directions a novel framework for era of antibiotics is required for antibiotic stewardship and by extension protection of human health food security and the global economy we have outlined such a potential framework and recommended determination of pnecrs through experimentally defined losc noscs and pnecps through experimentally defined loecs noecs these should be determined for both new and old antibiotic compounds and we have highlighted quinolone cephalosporins beta lactams and sulphonamide antibiotics should be priority candidates moving forward whilst environmental monitoring of mecs is crucial derivation of reliable pec data is particularly important for novel compounds as mec data will be unavailable by drawing on current era guidelines we hope to accelerate standardisation and adoption of this new era which addresses the selective effect of antibiotics inclusion of antibiotics on the wfd watch list presents opportunities to compare ecological and selective endpoints for era however monitoring of args may also be required at this scale to complement chemical monitoring data new antibiotics approved for use in humans may provide novel opportunities to track resistance development by monitoring chemical and resistance data in human sewage wastewater treatment plants and surface waters in populations that experience either high or low use the environment could become an early indicator for clinical resistance there is already a body of evidence demonstrating that current clinically important resistance genes originated in the environment humeniuk et al 2002 poirel et al 2008 poirel et al 2004 potron et al 2011 such environmental surveillance data could inform and complement routine clinical surveillance efforts selection for resistance in the environment and human or animal exposure to resistant bacteria are interlinked phenomena better understanding of the human and animal health effects of exposure to resistant environmental bacteria genes is required larsson et al 2018 as this will help drive development and adoption of amr relevant eqs however appropriate eqs will be required to mitigate the health effects of such exposure the precautionary principle recommends that given the alarming impacts on human health and the global economy estimated as a result of amr o neill 2014 era which considers selection for amr cannot and should not wait there are also opportunities to reduce the environmental risk of selection for amr in the short term whilst longer term solutions such as implementation of a novel era are underway some recommended immediate actions are summarised 1 appropriate use of antibiotics i e improved diagnosis appropriate prescribing and reduction and elimination of over the counter use of antibiotics and their use in growth promotion 2 controlling release of selective compounds into the environment it is now more than 10 years since the larsson et al measured alarmingly high concentrations of ciprofloxacin in pharmaceutical manufacturing effluent larsson et al 2007 safe release limits for antibiotics were reported recently tell et al 2019 and meeting these targets should be a top priority for antibiotic manufacturers and industry 3 sanitation basic levels of sanitation are still lacking in many parts of the world particularly in lower to middle income countries though wastewater treatment in areas like europe and the usa are still not completely effective removal of antibiotics and resistant bacteria is still significant provision of this in all countries would reduce opportunities for environmental selection and human exposure but also reduce prevalence of communicable disease and thereby antibiotic use declaration of competing interest jason snape is an employee and shareholder of astrazeneca plc all remaining authors declare no competing

16902,antibiotics and antimicrobials are used misused and overused in human and veterinary medicine animal husbandry and aquaculture these compounds can persist in both human and animal waste and then enter the environment through a variety of mechanisms though generally measured environmental concentrations mecs of antibiotics in aquatic systems are significantly lower than point of therapeutic use concentrations there is increasing evidence that suggests these concentrations may still enrich antimicrobial resistant bacteria in light of this evidence a rigorous and standardised novel methodology needs to be developed which can perform environmental risk assessment era of antimicrobials in terms of their selective potential as well as their environmental impact to ensure that diffuse and point source discharges are safe this review summarises and critically appraises the current methodological approaches that study selection at below point of therapeutic use or sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics we collate and compare selective concentration data generated to date we recommend how these data can be interpreted in line with current era guidelines outlining and describing novel concepts unique to risk assessment of amr such as direct selection of amr or increased persistence of amr we consolidate terminology used thus far into a single framework that could be adopted moving forward by proposing predicted no effect concentrations for resistance pnecrs and predicted no effect concentrations for persistence pnecps be determined in amr

resistance selection ecotoxicology antibiotics 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr is one of the greatest threats to global health and the economy it has been estimated that by 2050 antimicrobial resistant infections will be the leading cause of death worldwide and result in the loss of 100 trillion dollars of gdp o neill 2014 the environmental dimension of amr is being increasingly recognised as an area for potential mitigation with several international efforts to raise the profile of this issue particularly in a one health context eu 2019 unep 2019 who 2015 antibiotics can enter the aquatic environment through a variety of interconnected pathways these include release from industrial and wastewater treatment plants run off from agricultural fields fertilised with municipal human sewage sludge and or animal manure and or treated with antibiotic plant protection products and in some countries direct discharge of waste where there is no centralised wastewater treatment infrastructure antibiotic concentrations in the environment generally range from mg l in the most impacted environments such as industrial waste to µg l in wastewater and wastewater effluent to ng l in surface waters aus der beek et al 2016 umweltbundesamt 2019 this is of great concern regarding the development of amr given the growing body of research outlined in this review that demonstrates environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics can increase levels of amr i e select for resistance in order to curb the rise in amr it is essential to recognise assess and mitigate the risk antibiotics pose in the environment as a direct result of anthropogenic activities development of an amr specific environmental risk assessment era framework will be crucial but has yet to be realised and is the focus of this review currently era is required for pharmaceuticals when the predicted environmental concentration pec is greater than 10 ng l for members of the european union ema 2006 or 100 ng l for the usa fda 1998a the only ecotoxicological test required that specifically targets bacteria is the activated sludge respiration inhibition test asrit ema 2006 the asrit exposes an activated sludge bacterial community to a test compound and measures for significant decreases in respiration oecd 2009 concerns that the asrit and other eukaryotic ecotoxicological endpoints may not be protective of selection for amr in the environment and the subsequent need for novel methods to quantify selective endpoints have been circulating for close to ten years ashbolt et al 2013 brandt et al 2015 gullberg et al 2011 le page et al 2017 this review summarises for the first time the benefits and limitations of the different approaches to determining selective concentrations of antibiotics alongside selective concentrations determined to date recommendations on how these data can be interpreted to determine selective endpoints for era with minimal adjustment to current era approaches are outlined unique challenges posed by amr through an era lens are also discussed 2 methods that determine selective concentrations of antibiotics the potential selection for amr in natural environments has been largely overlooked in part due to the unsupported hypothesis that very low concentrations of antimicrobials or antibiotics are unable to select for amr gullberg et al 2011 performed the first significant study that challenged this assumption where they demonstrated that very low antibiotic concentrations could select for antibiotic resistant bacteria by conducting single species competition experiments isogenic bacterial species genetically identical except for the presence of a resistance determinant on the chromosome of the resistant strain were fluorescently tagged allowing for their accurate enumeration these isogenic strains were grown in defined ratios of resistant to susceptible cells in the presence of multiple concentrations of antibiotics in a serial passage experiment where the bacteria were transferred into fresh media and antibiotic each day enumeration after antibiotic exposure allowed calculation of selection coefficients which represent the difference in fitness between resistant and susceptible bacteria otto and day 2007 for example selection coefficients greater than 0 indicate the bacteria harbouring the studied resistance gene are under positive selection and their numbers will increase over time conversely selection coefficients less than 0 indicate numbers of resistant bacteria will decrease over time day et al 2015 selection coefficients can be plotted against antibiotic concentration and the x axis intercept of the line of best fit through these data points indicates the minimal selective concentration msc this is the lowest concentration at which resistance is predicted to be selected for i e when numbers of resistant bacteria are expected to increase over time relative to non resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2011 found that the msc can be over 200x lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of the susceptible strain and confirmed antibiotics do not need to exceed the mic of susceptible bacteria in order to have a selective effect gullberg et al built upon their previous work by determining mscs for antimicrobial resistance genes args located on a mobile clinically isolated plasmid again mscs were much lower than mics of the susceptible strain gullberg et al 2014 these studies raised concerns regarding the potential selection of amr occurring in the environment as selection was observed at environmentally relevant concentrations down to 2 ng l gullberg et al 2011 however the relevance of these findings in relation to the environment is unclear as single isogenic host species are unlikely to be representative of the complex competitive interactions occurring within and other selective pressures encountered by environmental communities of bacteria this was confirmed by a study that found mscs differ when isogenic strains are cultured in single species competition experiments compared to within a bacterial community klümper et al 2019 in this study mscs of gentamicin and kanamycin were determined using isogenic strains in single species competitions assays as well as when the strains were embedded within a pig faecal bacterial community the mscs of gentamicin and kanamycin increased by 13 and 43x respectively when in the presence of the community though the exact msc values were not reported klümper et al 2019 other work has attempted to determine selective concentrations within complex bacterial communities in an effort to increase environmental relevance strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of these different approaches are detailed in table 1 whilst experimental details are outlined below the first of the experimental approaches that used complex communities lundstrom et al 2016 established a biofilm from untreated wastewater in a flow through system which was continuously exposed to low concentrations of tetracycline low nutrient media and untreated wastewater a variety of methods were explored for determining the selective concentration including phenotypic and culture based methods the pollution induced community tolerance pict assay schmitt et al 2005 and molecular methods including qpcr and metagenome analyses the qpcr method was deemed the most sensitive identifying the lowest tetracycline concentration where an effect was observed at 1 ug l two different tetracycline resistance genes were quantified alongside 16s rrna copy number as a proxy for number of bacteria enabling determination of molecular arg prevalence arg 16s rrna copy number lundstrom et al 2016 further studies have also used untreated wastewater but in closed experimental systems where bacterial communities are passed into fresh antibiotic media daily for 7 or 8 days metagenomic analyses were used to confirm suitable gene targets for qpcr and molecular arg prevalence was quantified with qpcr at the beginning and end of the experiment which allowed determination of the msc as well as statistically defined selective concentrations murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 more recently selection experiments were performed using the flow through system described by lundstrom et al 2016 and a batch microcosm system within the same study kraupner et al 2018 both used the same minimal medium though batch microcosms were incubated at 25 c and the flow through system was maintained at 20 c percentages of escherichia coli resistant to ciprofloxacin the test antibiotic were calculated and the lowest concentration where an increase was observed relative to the control occurred at 5 µg l and 10 µg l for the flow through system and batch microcosm respectively though this differs by a factor of two the no observed effect concentration noec the concentration directly below the lowest observed effect concentration for both systems was 1 µg l therefore in this instance the two systems were comparable and may even have yielded the same result were the same concentrations tested in both systems kraupner et al 2018 a comparison was also made between the flow through system lundstrom et al 2016 and the high nutrient batch microcosm murray et al 2018 in a study by stanton et al 2020 both lundstrom et al 2016 and stanton et al 2020 quantified increases in tetracycline resistance genes using qpcr and when data were analysed in the same way the same noec was observed however as hypothesised previously murray et al 2018 the observed effect was likely increased persistence of resistance genes as opposed to positive selection stanton et al 2020 this minimal increased persistence concentration mipc is still relevant for human health risk assessment as it results in higher numbers of resistant bacteria being present in a given microbiome in the presence of antibiotic than in the absence which increases the potential of human or animal exposure to these bacteria stanton et al 2020 in addition there could be increased likelihood of horizontal gene transfer as there would be a greater number of arg donors a selective endpoint for ciprofloxacin was also determined by stanton et al 2020 as 7 6 µg l very similar to the 5 10 µg l observed in kraupner et al 2018 together these points indicate highly replicable high throughput batch microcosms can produce very similar if not identical selective concentration data as more expensive technically demanding flow through systems a further study by n kraupner et al 2020 compared selective endpoints of trimethoprim in different systems changes in taxonomic composition were determined in an effluent sewage community biofilm microcosm but the study primarily focused on resistant e coli in three different experimental systems biofilms derived from treated effluent a community of 149 e coli strains isolated from sewage and isogenic strains of e coli in competition experiments at 100 µg l of trimethoprim significant increases in percentage of resistant e coli in the biofilm and the e coli community were observed whereas only a trend for significance was observed in taxonomic composition for the engineered e coli positive selection coefficients were determined at 100 µg l but not 10 µg l however the authors indicate that the cost of the resistance gene was significantly reduced at 10 µg l n kraupner et al 2020 i e there would be increased persistence at this concentration stanton et al 2020 when statistically comparing percentages of engineered resistant e coli carrying four of the five genes tested an exposure limit of 1 µg l was suggested based on this observation the most recent experimental method to determine selective endpoints is the select selection endpoints in communities of bacteria method a k murray et al 2020 this method exposes a community of sewage bacteria to two fold dilutions of antibiotics in a 96 well plate and measures optical density in a plate reader during exponential growth phase of the community a significant dose response relationship can be observed the selective endpoint is the antibiotic concentration that significantly reduces the growth of the community at the time point where that dose response relationship is strongest this has been demonstrated to be a reliable proxy for selection for resistance genes determined using qpcr in previous studies murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 due to the rapidity of the method selective endpoints for several antibiotics were determined including trimethoprim at 1 56 µg l extremely similar to the 1 µg l determined previously n kraupner et al 2020 in the select study lower temperature and nutrient conditions use of artificial sewage as the growth media as in the asrit oecd 2009 were also tested and had minimal effect on the endpoints derived this study was also the first to directly compare different sewage inocula for the same antibiotic and found this too had minimal effect on the endpoints derived indicating a single endpoint may be suitable for different geographical locations or environments a k murray et al 2020 finally there have been attempts to consider selection by estimating selective endpoints as opposed to using experimental approaches the first of these used mic50 values for susceptible pathogens as surrogates for selective endpoints to perform risk assessment of antibiotics in hospital effluent kümmerer and henninger 2003 an assessment factor af of 100 was applied this relatively large af was used for two reasons the first was to estimate the mic10 value given that noecs can be considered as the concentration where only a 10 effect is observed eu 1996 the second was because the pecs were multiplied by 10 to estimate maximum peak loads kümmerer and henninger 2003 the second paper to estimate selective endpoint predicted species sensitivity distributions using mic data and extrapolated these selective concentrations across bacterial genera through phylogenetic analyses by comparing to mecs it was estimated 7 of environmental genera could be under selection tello et al 2012 finally selective concentrations have been estimated using the eucast mic database to estimate predicted no effect concentrations for resistance pnecrs all mics for all the species were extracted and mics above the wildtype were removed these were adjusted against the numbers of species per antibiotic finally the lowest 1 of all mics were taken and an af of 10 applied this resulted in pnecrs ranging from 8 ng l to 64 ug l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 all of these studies have not yet determined how community resilience may affect selection for amr community resilience is the ability of a bacterial community to return to its original state or a new stable state following the removal of a disturbance brandt et al 2015 the functionality of bacterial communities may be compromised for example if diversity is reduced and this could be further compounded by exposure to other pollution sources or changes in temperature making it particularly pertinent in light of climate change amr adds an additional facet to community resilience as resistance normally results in an evolutionary cost to the host bacterium however there are numerous evolutionary mechanisms to mitigate this cost such as presence of compensatory mutations cost free resistance traits or location of resistance genes on plasmids which confer a fitness benefit andersson and hughes 2011 arguably following exposure to antibiotics bacterial communities may never return to a pre exposure state due to these compensatory effects furthermore it is unclear whether communities that have evolved at selective concentrations of antibiotics are then primed to face future episodes of exposure due to these evolutionary compensatory mechanisms however whether communities do become primed will likely dependant on many factors these include whether the resistance mechanism is selfish or produces public goods bottery et al 2016 murray et al 2018 public good resistance mechanisms such as antibiotic degradation by enzymes produced by resistant bacteria could be negatively selected because the degradation of antibiotics is beneficial to all bacteria in the population whether they produce the enzyme or not whether a resistance mechanism is readily mobilisable i e plasmid borne will impact the extent of transmission within the community and the fitness of the bacterial host in the absence of exposure is also key if future studies point toward a lack of community resilience then different safe release limits may be required for different environments e g pharmaceutical waste vs municipal waste or limits may need to change over time depending on the history of exposure 3 amr specific era adjusting and consolidating with current guidelines all of the above studies have determined selective concentrations but there are differences in how these are derived what they are termed and what they mean each has different implications for both environmental and human health exposure risk assessment the standardised era approach determines the lowest observed effect concentration loec on the basis this test concentration has a significantly different response compared to the control echa 2008 ema 2006 2018 fda 1998b the concentration below this the noec is used to derive the predicted no effect concentration pnec by dividing it by an af which differs based on chronic or acute exposure and number of studies echa 2008 see af section environmental risk is then determined by dividing the predicted environmental concentration pec or measured environmental concentration mec by the pnec to generate a risk quotient rq ema 2006 a recent meta analysis le page et al 2017 compared the relative sensitivity of environmental species used to derive pnecs in regulatory approaches to era there are currently four antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole included on the third version of the water framework directive s wfd watch list gomez cortes et al 2020 these are surface water pollutants where the pec or mec regularly exceeds the pnec which are being monitored with the european union to determine if environmental quality standards eqs are required carvalho et al 2015 loos et al 2018 until this most recent iteration these pnecs were based on ecotoxicological endpoints though amr data are now being considered gomez cortes et al 2020 to enable rapid era and human health risk assessment of the selective potential of compounds released into our environments it would be best to align with current methodologies however it has been established that ecotoxicological pnecs are not always protective against selection for amr bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le page et al 2017 tell et al 2019 therefore it is recommended that pnecrs are used when referring specifically to selective concentrations of antibiotics which may not always have ecotoxicological effects at ecologically relevant pecs or mecs furthermore as there are several experimental methodologies several different definitions of selective concentrations also exist the first of these methods used was the msc gullberg et al 2011 as described above however it is debatable whether a pnec should be derived from mscs as this endpoint is a modelled estimate that can be greatly impacted by the number of test concentrations included in the model and the intervals between these test concentrations in addition the msc is defined as the concentration where the fitness cost of the resistance is balanced by the antibiotic conferred selection for the resistant mutant gullberg et al 2011 or in other words where resistant strains are under neither positive nor negative selection and there is no longer an evolutionary cost to resistance only when stochastic events occur or further increases in selective pressure are introduced will resistant bacteria be positively selected therefore in terms of protection against selection the msc is likely conservative and may marginally overestimate risk if used to calculate a pnecr mscs are also likely to change when different isogenic strains are used which could lead to over or underestimation of risk the msc method also presents difficulties as the no antibiotic control may also show positive selection for resistance n kraupner et al 2020 stanton et al 2020 as all selection coefficients are 0 the intercept msc cannot be calculated although this could be overcome by subtracting the no antibiotic control selection coefficients from the exposure selection coefficients this may introduce bias the msc method does however require quantification of resistance at the beginning of the exposure experiment as this is crucial for understanding risk this allows clarification between increases in total number of resistance genes resistant bacteria over time i e positive selection vs reduced loss of resistance genes compared to the control i e increased persistence which is needed for interpretation of risk increased persistence of resistance has been referred to as the mipc which is below the msc stanton et al 2020 however it is unclear how an mipc could be determined using an msc approach as the mipc lies beneath the intercept of the x axis i e below the msc this phenomenon has also been referred to as a significant reduction in fitness cost n kraupner et al 2020 persistence could be defined statistically as the concentration where a significant increase in antibiotic resistance gene prevalence is observed compared to the control at the end of the experiment and irrespective of starting prevalence fig 1 it would be unnecessary to first calculate selection coefficients and then perform statistical tests when the same tests could be used directly on the antibiotic resistance endpoint data e g antibiotic resistance gene prevalence to closer align to current era methods a statistical method should be used to determine the selective concentration as opposed to an estimate like the msc given the differences highlighted in this review and elsewhere between selection and persistence n kraupner et al 2020 murray et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 we propose new terms to clarify these endpoints the lowest observed selection concentration losc represents the concentration where a significant increase in resistance gene prevalence other endpoint is observed over time compared to the control a no observed selection concentration nosc would then be the concentration below this and a pnecr derived through applying an af as before in terms of human exposure it may be more protective to consider overall numbers of resistant bacteria stanton et al 2020 the concentration at which persistence is observed could be considered as the loec which could be used to derive a predicted no effect concentration for persistence pnecp using the noec compared to the msc and by extension mipc that may overestimate risk for the reasons described above the losc and loec may slightly underestimate risk but are statistically robust adjustment with afs would further reduce the possibility of risk underestimation whether safe release limits should be based on the pnecr or pnecp is a matter for debate but broadly the former may be more suited to era and the latter to human health risk assessment the relationship between these values are shown in fig 1 it is important to define and distinguish between the two in order to 1 facilitate compliance by not imposing overly stringent targets in areas with minimal human exposure whilst still preventing increases in resistance and 2 recognise the difference in risk posed by overall resistant numbers of bacteria genes in an environment to which humans or animals may be readily exposed however use of the pnecp for both environmental and human health risk assessment would be the most protective there are also further considerations when considering risk of individual genes bacteria such as mobilisable potential of different genes which have been reviewed elsewhere bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 martinez et al 2014 however generally we recommend a mixed community approach for the experimental determination of pnecrs or pnecps to be more environmentally representative and to provide a diverse collection of bacteria and args that selection could act upon the options of loscs loecs and mscs have been discussed but the question remains over what an appropriate assessment factor might be in order to convert these into pnecrs or pnecps recently the ema revised their guidance on era of medicines approved for human use an af of 10 was recommended for surface water and sewage treatment plant pnecs ema 2018 in addition the wfd used an af of 10 when determining which substances to include on the watch list carvalho et al 2015 given these current approaches and the lack of understanding regarding effects of acute or chronic exposure to antibiotics of bacterial communities and community resilience this af seems appropriate for the time being however it has been suggested previously that microbial community level studies may require greater assessment factors to account for the greater degree of uncertainty within these systems brandt et al 2015 therefore the community based studies described above could utilise larger afs the inclusion of more prokaryotic taxa within the revised ema era guideline ema 2018 attempts to address some aspects of this uncertainty by recognising the limited value of fish studies and testing more relevant taxa we applied this framework to interpret all the concentration data generated thus far table 2 in the experimental studies already described there are 33 concentration data generated to date for 11 antibiotics spanning 6 antibiotic classes we determined the pnecr or pnecp as follows selective concentration data determined using the msc approach we left unadjusted as this is already a modelled estimate as described above where statistics were used to assign the selective or persistence concentration the test concentration below this the nosc or noec was adjusted with an af of 10 where the methodology was insufficient to determine the concentration as being the selective or persistence concentration we assigned this as unknown applied an af of 10 and assigned as either a potential pnecr or pnecp see table 2 using this approach and the data currently available the antibiotic likely to pose the greatest risk to the environment is ciprofloxacin pnecrs 0 05 and 0 78 µg l msc 0 004 10 77 µg l n studies 3 unknown potential pnecr or pnecp using metagenomics of 0 01 µg l trimethoprim is also of potential concern pnecrs 1 5 µg l n studies 3 mscs 33 49 6 µg l n studies 2 these two compounds are already on the current version of the wfd watch list gomez cortes et al 2020 and are the most well studied in terms of selective concentrations table 2 tetracycline may also pose a risk but further work is needed as currently only pnecp or unknown data 0 01 and 0 09 µg l respectively are available alongside the msc data 15 and 45 µg l by comparison pnecrs determined to date for the three macrolides azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin indicate these pose relatively low risk of selection for resistance with all lowest pnecrs determined as 50 µg l but ranging from 50 to 12 500 µg l for erythromycin n studies 4 these macrolides were on previous versions of the wfd watch list carvalho et al 2015 loos et al 2018 but have since been removed these data indicate pnecr determination and era of other quinolones and fluoroquinolones should be of high priority followed potentially by cephalosporins cefotaxime msc 4 µg l pnecr 0 78 and 6 25 µg l and further consolidation work on tetracyclines there are still two classes of non combination antibiotic classes without any data penicillin beta lactams and sulfonamides though trimethoprim is usually grouped with these as they are commonly used in combination these should also be prioritised for determination of further amr endpoints however more data are still required for the other antibiotics e g macrolides aminoglycosides in order to draw definitive conclusions about the risk they pose currently available data suggest amr endpoints will not always be more protective than ecotoxicological endpoints and vice versa so both are needed to move toward maximum environmental and human health protection a k murray et al 2020 4 further considerations for determination of any pnec chemical quantification of the test compound is required this is essential for antibiotics as many antibiotic resistance mechanisms are degradative in nature for example almost complete degradation of cefotaxime at clinical concentrations 2 mg l was observed in the presence of a wastewater community whereas in sterile culture degradation was around 60 murray et al 2018 it is possible that the relatively low mecs of antibiotics such as cefotaxime to which there are numerous degradative resistance mechanisms have resulted from degradation by resistant bacterial populations present in the environment as opposed to high lability alone this raises questions about the robustness of chemical based eqs used under the wfd to protect human health they will be adequate for ecological protection but high levels of resistance that could pose a human health threat may occur where there are low levels of antibiotic if the resistance mechanism is degradative this is most relevant for the beta lactam class of antibiotics including the world health organisation critically important humans medicines such as third generation cephalosporins and last line carbapenems who 2017 to which clinical resistance is often conferred by degradative enzymes such as the extended spectrum beta lactamases canton and coque 2006 or carbapenemases nordmann et al 2011 this is problematic as low mecs could actually indicate high levels of resistance monitoring of resistance genes in soil was recently proposed by the european commission eu 2019 and so this could also be recommended for monitoring surface waters for example in future amendments to the wfd watch list however quantitatively linking the presence of resistance genes in the environment to colonisation subsequent infection and adverse clinical outcomes remains a significant challenge when determining pnecrs for highly labile antibiotics it may be necessary to introduce antibiotic continuously in a flow through system though this may still not be recommended if the required flow rate exceeds the maximum growth rate of bacteria as this would result in wash out and reduced ecological relevance ziv et al 2013 in batch systems degradation experiments are recommended to enable extrapolation of the average exposure concentration over the test period to determine a more accurate noec for either system understanding of compound lability is essential to prevent pnecr overestimation chemical quantification is complicated further when considering biofilms and heterogeneous penetration by antibiotics very little is understood regarding the antibiotic concentration within bacterial cells or at the bacterial cell surface and how this may affect selection furthermore there is some evidence to suggest intra and extracellular ph concentrations can lead to different antimicrobial activity of the same antibiotic in different bacteria tappe et al 2008 studying these phenomena is now possible due to the development of single cell microfluidic systems such as the mother machine microfluidic device bamford et al 2017 in addition to quantification of antibiotics within experimental systems greater effort is required to generate pecs of antibiotics with high spatial resolution and to determine mecs of antibiotics in a more systematic manner looking at catchments and inputs over time there are many physiochemical considerations that may affect fate and transport of antibiotics which are reviewed elsewhere jafari ozumchelouei et al 2020 the largest open access database of mecs was collated by the umweltbundesamt in 2016 umweltbundesamt 2016 and was recently updated aus der beek et al 2016 umweltbundesamt 2019 these data are essential for determining rqs that are protective of selection better understanding of the pathways of human exposure to these mecs is also needed for example the relative significance of these pathways for colonisation infection by resistant bacteria which may be pathogenic opportunistically pathogenic or even non pathogenic or their impacts on the existing commensal bacteria that form the human microbiome such as potential horizontal gene exchange between the pre existing microbiome and ingested bacteria this should be included within an integrated human and environmental health risk framework ashbolt et al 2013 larsson et al 2018 a significant factor affecting all aspects of era not just era of amr is the inescapable fact that pharmaceuticals exist in the environment as a complex mixture with other chemicals and stressors it is likely that in the majority of cases selective concentrations of individual antibiotics will be reduced in antibiotic mixtures especially as some antibiotics are used in combination clinically for their synergistic effects such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole within class antibiotics are likely to have additive effects given the lack of methods to experimentally quantify ecotoxicological effects of mixtures in general and the missing requirement for mixtures assessment in current era guidelines a tiered approach has been suggested backhaus 2016 firstly rqs derived for individual compounds could be summed using readily available individual compound pnec data and secondly mixture specific afs could also be used backhaus 2016 however as previously highlighted still comparatively few pnecr data are available for amr era furthermore how antibiotics may interact with other co selective compounds such as metals baker austin et al 2006 or biocides pal et al 2015 may be less predictable and more research is needed in this area co selection is the process whereby resistance to a compound can be indirectly selected for in the absence of that compound or when it is only present at a sub selective concentration this can be through genetic hitch hiking of co localised resistance genes for example on mobile genetic elements co resistance or if one gene confers resistance to both compounds cross resistance such as multidrug efflux pumps only one compound needs to be present in order to select for the entire mobile element or gene conferring cross resistance to be selected for baker austin et al 2006 generally it is assumed both metals and biocides could co select for antibiotic resistance and therefore may have an additive or synergistic effect however there are some data to suggest antagonistic effects may also occur for example one recent study demonstrated the selective concentration of ciprofloxacin increased in the presence of zinc possibly due to chelation vos et al 2020 the baseline msc of ciprofloxacin of 0 004 µg l increased to 0 011 µg l and 0 022 µg l in the presence of 0 5 mm and 1 mm concentrations of zinc 2 respectively vos et al 2020 however generally it is assumed that risks posed by mixtures are greater than the individual constituent compounds backhaus 2016 revision of current era guidelines such as those by the ema that progress to phase ii toxicity testing based on pec data for individual compounds may also be required backhaus 2016 if and when mixture effects are incorporated into current guidelines any amr specific era guidelines should be updated one possible approach to quantify mixture effects could be whole effluent toxicity wet this is currently used in the usa to determine if all the compounds present in effluents are safe or have a toxic effect epa 2002 this could be adapted to examine the selective potential of effluents through exposure experiments as outlined above where a range of diluted effluents are used in place of a single test antibiotic the most selective effluents can then be prioritised for further analyses e g chemical quantification prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and or genes or mitigation 5 conclusions and future directions a novel framework for era of antibiotics is required for antibiotic stewardship and by extension protection of human health food security and the global economy we have outlined such a potential framework and recommended determination of pnecrs through experimentally defined losc noscs and pnecps through experimentally defined loecs noecs these should be determined for both new and old antibiotic compounds and we have highlighted quinolone cephalosporins beta lactams and sulphonamide antibiotics should be priority candidates moving forward whilst environmental monitoring of mecs is crucial derivation of reliable pec data is particularly important for novel compounds as mec data will be unavailable by drawing on current era guidelines we hope to accelerate standardisation and adoption of this new era which addresses the selective effect of antibiotics inclusion of antibiotics on the wfd watch list presents opportunities to compare ecological and selective endpoints for era however monitoring of args may also be required at this scale to complement chemical monitoring data new antibiotics approved for use in humans may provide novel opportunities to track resistance development by monitoring chemical and resistance data in human sewage wastewater treatment plants and surface waters in populations that experience either high or low use the environment could become an early indicator for clinical resistance there is already a body of evidence demonstrating that current clinically important resistance genes originated in the environment humeniuk et al 2002 poirel et al 2008 poirel et al 2004 potron et al 2011 such environmental surveillance data could inform and complement routine clinical surveillance efforts selection for resistance in the environment and human or animal exposure to resistant bacteria are interlinked phenomena better understanding of the human and animal health effects of exposure to resistant environmental bacteria genes is required larsson et al 2018 as this will help drive development and adoption of amr relevant eqs however appropriate eqs will be required to mitigate the health effects of such exposure the precautionary principle recommends that given the alarming impacts on human health and the global economy estimated as a result of amr o neill 2014 era which considers selection for amr cannot and should not wait there are also opportunities to reduce the environmental risk of selection for amr in the short term whilst longer term solutions such as implementation of a novel era are underway some recommended immediate actions are summarised 1 appropriate use of antibiotics i e improved diagnosis appropriate prescribing and reduction and elimination of over the counter use of antibiotics and their use in growth promotion 2 controlling release of selective compounds into the environment it is now more than 10 years since the larsson et al measured alarmingly high concentrations of ciprofloxacin in pharmaceutical manufacturing effluent larsson et al 2007 safe release limits for antibiotics were reported recently tell et al 2019 and meeting these targets should be a top priority for antibiotic manufacturers and industry 3 sanitation basic levels of sanitation are still lacking in many parts of the world particularly in lower to middle income countries though wastewater treatment in areas like europe and the usa are still not completely effective removal of antibiotics and resistant bacteria is still significant provision of this in all countries would reduce opportunities for environmental selection and human exposure but also reduce

16903,a key gap in the literature on the treatment of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in impacted water is the absence of a review article dedicated to anion exchange resin aer treatment this gap is important because previous research has consistently shown adsorption by aer to be one of the most effective treatment processes for pfas removal from impacted water and aer is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field given the scope of the previous review articles on pfas removal by various adsorbent types the sections on aer do not explore the full depth of pfas and aer interactions nor cover the breadth of aer testing conditions accordingly the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer reviewed literature on pfas removal from water by aer the specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on 1 batch adsorption behavior 2 impact of water chemistry conditions 3 continuous flow adsorption 4 adsorption modeling 5 regeneration and 6 weak base aer following from critical review of the literature the future research priorities discussed include i improving the underlying science that governs pfas resin

fire fighting foams and other applications all of which have resulted in release of pfas to the environment oecd 2013 pfas have been detected in water soil and other media on a global scale are highly persistent in the environment and have raised concerns due to the potential for adverse health effects on humans banzhaf et al 2017 pontius 2019 toms et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the following pfas nomenclature and categories i e class subclass group and subgroup are used in this paper pfas are divided into two classes polymers and nonpolymers the polymer class includes high molecular weight compound subclasses such as fluoropolymers and perfluoropolyethers the nonpolymers class includes chemicals with fluorinated carbon tail attached to a head group and is divided into two subclasses perfluoroalkyl substances and polyfluoroalkyl substances that differ in terms of all c atoms being saturated with fluorine f atoms or at least one but not all c atoms being saturated with f atoms respectively the head group includes oxygen o nitrogen n sulfur s phosphorus p and other functional groups pfas from the nonpolymers class that have been evaluated for aer removal are listed in table 1 and discussed more in section 2 table 1 illustrates the classification and structure of relevant pfas for example important groups from the perfluoroalkyl substances subclass includes perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas and perfluoroalkyl ether acids pfeas with some groups further subdivided such as the pfaas subgroups of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas the polyfluoroalkyl substances subclass includes perfluoroalkane sulfonamido substances fluorotelomer based substances ftss and other groups the two most studied pfas are perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa of pfcas subgroup and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos of pfsas subgroup pontius 2019 which are highly persistent due to long perfluoroalkyl tail and mobile due to negatively charged acid head group wang et al 2017 recent concerns about pfas in water include short chain pfaas such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and pfaa alternatives like genx 1 2 previous review articles on pfas treatment table s1 in appendix a summarizes the previous review articles on pfas removal and destruction in impacted water most of the review articles focus on the pfaas group of pfas and in response to pfas research trends the articles show a shift in focus from pfoa and pfos arias espana et al 2015 du et al 2014 to short chain pfaas such as pfba and pfbs ateia et al 2019b gagliano et al 2020 li et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 the main treatment categories covered in the reviews are removal separation processes including adsorption by granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resin aer and separation by nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro banks et al 2020 du et al 2014 ji et al 2020 kucharzyk et al 2017 and destruction processes including advanced oxidation advanced reduction and thermal destruction ahmed et al 2020 merino et al 2016 nzeribe et al 2019 there have been several reviews on pfas adsorption du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 zhang et al 2019 that consider various adsorbents adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting adsorption capacity the previous adsorption reviews cover gac biochar aer and other synthesized materials because the reviews cover different types of adsorbents it is outside the scope of these reviews to provide comprehensive analysis of pfas removal by aer including ion exchange mechanism impacts of resin properties and water matrix batch vs column adsorption and regeneration chemistry while many treatment processes especially destruction technologies are being actively studied in the laboratory setting trojanowicz et al 2018 in practice field and especially full scale treatment has been limited almost exclusively to gac and aer adsorption processes arias espana et al 2015 crone et al 2019 ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 underscoring the need for a review on pfas removal from water by aer 1 3 scope of this review a key gap in the literature highlighted by the analysis of previous review articles on pfas treatment is the absence of a review dedicated to aer prior to the final revision of this paper a review article on pfas removal from water by aer was published dixit et al 2021b this gap is important because previous research has consistently shown aer to be one of the most effective treatment processes for pfas removal from impacted water and aer is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field arias espana et al 2015 itrc 2020a ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 although initial efforts for remediating pfas impacted water focused on gac ion exchange technology is receiving increasing consideration crone et al 2019 a key reason for the shift in focus to aer is because aer exhibits significantly higher adsorption capacity than gac for both short and long chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 previous review articles on pfas removal by various adsorbent types include sections on aer that explore adsorption mechanisms adsorption capacity impacts of water matrix and regeneration du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 zhang et al 2019 and a review article on amine functionalized adsorbents is focused on designing new adsorbents and treats commercial aers as a single adsorbent material ateia et al 2019a the previous review articles provide important insights on pfas removal by aer but the scope of the previous articles covering numerous adsorbent types does not allow for critical review of pfas adsorption and desorption by aers considering the important properties of aers and the interactions between resin properties pfas structure and experimental conditions the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer reviewed literature on pfas removal from water by aer this included 31 articles published between 2007 and 2021 with more than half of the articles published since 2016 the review included both strong base aer sb aer and weak base aer wb aer and considered all pfas groups and subgroups for which aer removal data were available the specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on 1 batch adsorption behavior 2 impact of water chemistry conditions on adsorption 3 continuous flow adsorption 4 modeling pfas adsorption 5 regeneration and 6 wb aer as alternative to sb aer a cross cutting objective for this review was to elucidate the impacts of pfas structure and resin properties on ion exchange behavior the article concludes with prioritized future research needs thereby providing a roadmap for researchers and others involved with remediating pfas impacted water 2 pfas test waters and resins tables 1 and 2 summarize the pfas test waters and resins that have been studied within the scope of this literature review note that over half of the pfas listed in tables 1 and 2 have only been evaluated in one study using one resin wang et al 2020 the pfas listed in table 2 show initial research focus on pfoa and pfos then shift in research focus to include additional pfcas and pfsas especially the shorter chain analogs of pfoa and pfos other perfluoroalkyl substances e g fasas pfecas and polyfluoroalkyl substances e g fasaas ftsas the pfas listed in table 1 highlight the fluorinated carbon tail lengths and head groups that have been tested for removal by aer fluorinated carbon tail lengths vary from 1 to 13 and head groups include anionic carboxylic acid carboxylate and sulfonic acid sulfonate nonionic sulfonamide and zwitterionic quaternary ammonium sulfonic acid because some head groups include a c atom the fluorinated carbon tail length can be shorter than the total number of c atoms e g pfoa vs pfos and fosa following established conventions pfhpa and shorter and pfpes and shorter are defined as short chain pfaas whereas pfoa and longer and pfhxs and longer are defined as long chain pfaas oecd 2013 the test waters used in studies were classified based on their origin including synthetic typically composed of di water and salts natural i e field collected surface water or groundwater wastewater etc where any water not created synthetically is categorized as real water in many of the studies both synthetic and real test waters were spiked with pfas however real contaminated waters have also been studied for context pfas concentrations in groundwater on the order of 10 100 µg l have been measured near contaminated source zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 whereas groundwater production wells can have pfas concentrations of 10 100 ng l zeng et al 2020 the implication of spiking pfas in test water versus using real contaminated water is that higher pfas concentrations can be studied higher concentrations can be advantageous for instrument detection however high concentrations may not be realistic and can introduce artifacts to adsorption behavior such as micelle formation schuricht et al 2017 other concerns with spiking pfas in test water include addition of organic solvent inhomogeneity of pfas mixture and accumulation at air water interface the impact of very high pfas concentrations 100 1000 mg l which are not realistic for environmental waters but generated for easier treatment and analysis on pfas adsorption by aer is explored in later sections of this critical review most studies have tested sb aer which are characterized by quaternary ammonium functional groups with permanent positive charge while several studies have tested wb aer which have tertiary amine groups that exhibit ph dependent charging behavior in this review article resins are referred to by polymer composition pore structure and functional group using the categories and abbreviations described in fig 1 table 2 and fig 1 show that a variety of aer types have been tested for pfas removal the following are general rules based on the properties of ion exchange resins helfferich 1995 which are expected to impact pfas adsorption polystyrene ps resin is more hydrophobic than polyacrylic pa resin and as a result pa resin has higher water content than ps resin gel g resin exhibits size exclusion of high molecular weight compounds whereas size exclusion is not relevant for macroporous mp resin type i functional group is more hydrophobic than type ii functional group and the hydrophobicity and size of type i functional group increases with increasing alkylamine chain length regarding terminology ion exchange resins adsorb contaminants through a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions the electrostatic interactions are between positively charged functional groups on the resin and negatively charged head group of the pfas the two most relevant non electrostatic interactions are van der waals interactions and hydrophobic attractions chandler 2005 meyer et al 2006 however isolating their contributions to adsorption remains a major research challenge tang et al 2018 hence most descriptions of pfas adsorption to aer use the terms electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions 3 batch adsorption 3 1 ion exchange stoichiometry previous research shows that aer removal of inorganic anions hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and naphthalene sulfonate and natural organic matter nom follow ion exchange stoichiometry i e one equivalent of chloride released from resin for each equivalent of anion taken up from solution boyer et al 2008 li and sengupta 1998 2004 rahmani and mohseni 2017 ion exchange also appears to play an important role in pfas uptake by aers with non electrostatic interactions likely contributing to the strong uptake of pfas compared with inorganic anions the importance of non electrostatic interactions is supported by perfluorinated carbon tail length dependent pfas removal by aers discussed in next subsection and the difficulty of desorbing pfas from aers during regeneration discussed later the non electrostatic interactions referenced here include solute resin i e physisorption and solute solute i e molecular aggregation interactions which are the result of van der waals interactions and hydrophobic attractions deng et al 2012 for example strong uptake of hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and naphthalene sulfonate by ps mp type i resin was attributed to favorable physisorption between nonpolar moieties of solute and polystyrene resin li and sengupta 1998 2004 unlike hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds studied previously surfactant molecules like pfas exhibit solute solute interactions including hemimicelle monolayer admicelle bilayer and micelle formation du et al 2014 gangula et al 2010 which do not necessarily occur in pure form but rather various states of molecular aggregation as a result it is possible for pfas uptake to occur without release of equivalent chloride counterion underscoring the important role of non electrostatic interactions several studies have investigated the stoichiometry of pfas removal by sb aers the studies include polyacrylic resins with pfoa pfos genx pfmoba and pfmopra deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 2020a and polystyrene resins with pfba pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 the ratio of pfas adsorbed chloride released increased from approx 1 pure electrostatic interactions to 1 3 combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions as pfas concentration increased and or pfas perfluoroalkyl tail length increased at constant concentration for example the ratio of pfba adsorbed chloride related was always 1 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 whereas pfos adsorbed chloride released increased from 1 to 1 3 as the pfos concentration increased indicating that some pfos molecules were adsorbing to the resin without ion exchange occurring deng et al 2010 deng et al 2012 maimaiti et al 2018 because deng et al 2010 used high initial concentration of pfos 400 mg l and hydrophilic resin pa mp type i enhanced pfos adsorption via molecular aggregation likely occurred instead of physisorption to resin polymer for instance using high pfos concentration of 1000 mg l high uptake of pfos by pa mp type i resin was speculated via micelle formation in the resin pore water schuricht et al 2017 at concentration range of 0 5 10 mg l pfas pfoa and pfos uptake by pa mp type i resin was accompanied by stoichiometric release of chloride with no indication of non electrostatic interactions dixit et al 2019 uptake of genx pfmoba and pfmopra by polyacrylic resin also showed stoichiometric release of chloride dixit et al 2020a 3 2 impact of pfas structure pfos removal by aers has been shown to be faster than pfoa lampert et al 2007 slower than pfoa maimaiti et al 2018 and approximately equal to pfoa dixit et al 2019 the properties of pfos and pfoa explain some of the results for example pfos and pfoa have similar aqueous diffusivities 0 54 0 04 10 5 vs 0 49 0 09 10 5 cm2 s with pfos having a higher molar volume than pfoa 272 1 vs 237 3 cm3 mol schaefer et al 2019a and molecular length 1 2 vs 1 0 nm xiao et al 2012 hence size exclusion and hindered diffusion are more likely for pfos than pfoa for resin properties such as polystyrene composition and or gel pore structure yu et al 2009 most studies evaluating the time varying removal of different tail length pfas show a higher adsorption rate for shorter pfas for example for ps g type i and type ii resins the adsorption rate was higher for pfbs than pfos deng et al 2010 suggesting that size exclusion was hindering pfos uptake for ps mp type ii resin the adsorption rate decreased as follows pfhxa pfbs pfoa pfhxs pfba pfos maimaiti et al 2018 which suggests adsorption kinetics was influenced in part by perfluoroalkyl tail length for pa mp type i resin the adsorption rate decreased as follows pfmopra pfmoba genx dixit et al 2020a which followed increasing number of c atoms however for pa mp type i miex resin the adsorption rate increased with increasing length of perfluoroalkyl tail for pfcas and pfsas park et al 2020 and at same number of c atoms pfsas showed higher adsorption rate than pfcas the variation in adsorption kinetics for different pfas structures is likely influenced by initial pfas concentration and its impact on mass transfer control for example pfoa pfos pfmopra pfmoba genx adsorption to pa mp type i resin was film diffusion controlled at initial concentration 50 µg l and switched to intraparticle pore diffusion controlled at higher concentrations dixit et al 2019 2020a comparison of pfos and pfbs removal showed differing trends for different resin properties specifically pa g type i resin had greater capacity for pfos than pfbs carter and farrell 2010 whereas ps g type i and ii resins had greater capacity for pfbs than pfos chularueangaksorn et al 2014 deng et al 2010 in studies evaluating aer removal of multiple pfas trends include decreasing adsorption capacity with decreasing length of perfluoroalkyl tail greater adsorption of pfsas than pfcas at same number of c atoms and lowest adsorption capacity for pfba del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 which are limited to polystyrene sb aers greater removal of pfsas than pfcas is supported by previous research showing higher aer selectivity for monosulfonic acids then monocarboxylic acids kanazawa et al 2004 in contrast to most published research pfas removal by ps g type i resin decreased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length for mixing time of 15 min kothawala et al 2017 suggesting mass transfer limitations also in contrast to most published research pfoa pfos and fosa which has neutral sulfonamide head group showed very similar removal kothawala et al 2017 in the most comprehensive study to date 68 pfas were screened for removal by ps g complex amino resin wang et al 2020 pfas classes that were removed to greater than 50 were fasa fasaa h pfsa mefasaa pfsa and spr fasa wang et al 2020 which included the functional groups sulfonamide neutral sulfonamido acetic acid anionic and sulfonate anionic aer removal efficiency showed limited statistical correlations with perfluoroalkyl tail length e g it was not significantly correlated with pfca length was inversely correlated with pfsa length and showed significant positive correlation with fasa length wang et al 2020 the strong positive correlation between perfluoroalkyl tail length of fasa and removal suggests that non electrostatic interactions can be the dominant force of attraction of polystyrene resin the pfas adsorption trends reviewed in the previous paragraph were for polystyrene sb aers data on removal of multiple pfas from solution using polyacrylic sb aer showed removals of 50 pfos 20 pfhxa pfoa pfbs and pfhxs and no removal of pfba del moral et al 2020 and in another study removals were approx 60 90 for pfoa pfbs pfda pfos and 20 60 for pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa park et al 2020 density functional theory calculations were used to show the o atoms in the sulfonate head group i e pfbs and pfos possessed a greater negative charge than the o atoms in the carboxylate head group i e pfba and pfoa and anionic character increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length park et al 2020 which implies stronger electrostatic interactions between pfsas and resin functional groups 3 3 impact of resin properties the rate of pfos removal increased for the following combination of resin properties ps g type i ps g type ii ps mp type i ps mp wb pa g wb pa mp type i chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 in another study the rate of pfos removal increased for the following combination of polystyrene resin properties mp type i trialkyl with c 2 mp type i triethyl mp type i trimethyl mp wb schuricht et al 2017 the rate of pfos removal increased as the aer became more hydrophilic more porous or the volume of the functional groups decreased all of which enhanced mass transfer specifically intraparticle diffusion the first two trends are clear comparing ps vs pa resin and g vs mp resin respectively the later trend becomes evident when wb aers are included the functional groups for wb aers and sb aers type i are polymer n ch3 2h and polymer n ch3 3 respectively where the size of the functional group increases by one methyl group in addition for type i resins where the trialkylamine groups are ethyl propyl butyl etc intraparticle diffusion is impeded by the increased volume of the functional groups the most comprehensive comparisons of aer properties have relied on pfos and a few studies have made comparisons of aer properties considering other pfas considering 16 different commercial aers resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfos were pa g wb pa mp type i ps mp type i triethyl ps mp type i ps mp wb ps g type ii ps g type i chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 schuricht et al 2017 schuricht et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 the wb aers are included here for completeness and discussed in detail later most of the studies referenced above conducted adsorption isotherms or batch loading with high pfos concentrations 400 to 1000 mg l which may have influenced the adsorption results for instance it was suggested that the high pfos uptake by polyacrylic resin was an artifact of high pfos concentration resulting in micelle formation in the resin pore water schuricht et al 2017 ps g type i resin consistently exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity for pfos and much lower than its ion exchange capacity which is noteworthy since it is the most widely studied aer for pfas removal see table 2 and pfas selective resins are composed of ps g with proprietary functional groups wang et al 2020 resin properties that showed decreasing removal of pfoa were pa g type i ps mp type i ps mp wb ps g type i ps g type ii lampert et al 2007 and resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfhxs were ps mp type ii pa g wb ps mp wb ps g type i maimaiti et al 2018 and genx were pa g wb ps g type i wang et al 2019 this suggests that complementary resin properties like ps mp and pa g was more effective than ps g resin for pfoa pfhxs and genx which was consistent with the trend for pfos resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos were ps g bifunctional ps mp type i triethyl ps g type i zaggia et al 2016 although the identity of the bifunctional functional group is not known it appears to play an important role enhancing the selectivity of sb aer for pfas considering resin properties that are selective for short and long chain pfcas and pfsas a ps mp type i triethyl resin exhibited greater removal of pfba pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos than a pa mp type i resin del moral et al 2020 the low selectivity of pa mp resin for pfaas was observed for pfas concentrations of 300 650 µg l del moral et al 2020 which is lower than the concentrations used in other adsorption studies comparing resin properties 4 impact of water chemistry conditions 4 1 ph most research shows that pfas adsorption to aer is not strongly impacted by ph strong base aers are not influenced by ph so the impact of changing ph is on the speciation of pfas and subsequent interaction with aer adsorption of pfoa pfhxs pfos and genx all with pka 1 itrc 2020b to sb aer have been studied at varying ph pfoa adsorption to sb aer shows the most variable trends with ph for example greater adsorption to polystyrene resin at ph 3 vs ph 7 yu et al 2009 no impact on adsorption to polyacrylic resin between ph 5 10 and lower adsorption at ph 3 and 11 yang et al 2018 and decreased adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 dixit et al 2019 the higher pfoa adsorption at lower ph e g 3 could be explained by physisorption of protonated pfoa i e neutral form to polystyrene resin considering there are varying reports on the pka of pfoa itrc 2020b the dramatic decrease in pfoa adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 was not clearly explained most studies show no impact of changing ph on pfos adsorption to polystyrene and polyacrylic resins deng et al 2010 maimaiti et al 2018 yu et al 2009 which is consistent with the strong acid properties of the sulfonic acid head group of pfos one study however did show significant decrease in pfos adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 dixit et al 2019 the reason for this was not clear but could be due to increasing competition by carbonate and hydroxide ions only one study has evaluated pfhxs adsorption at varying ph and showed no impact at ph 6 vs 9 for polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 genx shows different adsorption behavior for different resin composition with constant adsorption to polystyrene resin over ph 4 10 and lower adsorption at ph 2 wang et al 2019 and decreasing adsorption to polyacrylic resin over ph 4 10 dixit et al 2020a the reason for which was not clear the impact of ph on adsorption of short chain pfcas and pfsas and non pfaas with the exception genx by sb aers has not been explored 4 2 inorganic ions aers are known to have high selectivity for sulfate chromate and other inorganic anions hu et al 2016 a few studies have evaluated the impact of competing inorganic anions on pfos pfhxs and pfoa adsorption by sb aer for example at 0 4 mmol l pfos increasing sulfate concentration to 1 mmol l had minimal impact on pfos adsorption to polyacrylic resin and increasing chromate concentration to 2 mmol l resulted in only moderate decrease in pfos adsorption to the same resin deng et al 2010 in another study using 0 5 mmol l pfhxs increasing sulfate nitrate bicarbonate and phosphate to 50 mmol l reduced pfhxs adsorption to polystyrene resin by 10 and very high nacl concentration 1000 mmol l decreased pfhxs adsorption to the same resin by approx 30 maimaiti et al 2018 the presence of sulfate and carbonate reduced pfoa uptake by polyacrylic resin yang et al 2018 the minimal impact of competing inorganic anions on pfhxs and pfos removal by aers supports the importance of non electrostatic interactions such as physisorption and molecular aggregation in addition to electrostatic interactions sulfate was more competitive with pfoa than pfhxs or pfos which is consistent with the sulfonic acid head group having stronger electrostatic interactions with the resin compared with carboxylic acid head group the impact of competing inorganic anions on short chain pfsas and pfcas and non pfaas by aers has not been explored but it is anticipated that the effects will be more pronounced than those observed here for instance since electrostatic interactions govern pfba removal i e pfba adsorbed chloride released 1 increasing the concentration of competing inorganic anions would be expected to decrease pfba removal 4 3 natural organic matter nom aers are used for removal of nom measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in water treatment bazri et al 2016 graf et al 2014 so the impact of doc on pfas removal by aers is an important topic as background nom interacts with polystyrene and polyacrylic sb aer through electrostatic interactions with stoichiometric release of chloride from the resin boyer and singer 2008 and doc removal by sb aer increases as the charge density molecular weight or aromatic carbon content of the nom increases boyer et al 2008 hence hydrophobic interactions contribute to nom removal by sb aer the literature indicates that the presence of doc can reduce pfas removal by sb aer with the extent of impact depending on resin and nom properties and the impact due to competition between nom and pfas for ion exchange sites for example the presence of 2 8 mg l doc decreased removal of pfsas and pfcas by less than 10 percentage points compared with doc free control using polystyrene resin kothawala et al 2017 which is less effective for doc removal than polyacrylic resin for a wide variety of doc sources including suwannee river nom suwannee river humic acid suwannee river fulvic acid and pony lake fulvic acid the presence of 5 mg l doc decreased removal of pfoa and pfos by 10 to 50 percentage points compared with doc free controls using polyacrylic resin dixit et al 2019 which also exhibited high removal of doc the presence of suwannee river humic acid caused the greatest reduction in pfas removal while the presence of pony lake fulvic acid caused the least reduction in pfas removal dixit et al 2019 where the extent of impact was directly related to the molecular weight and aromatic carbon content of the nom commercial humic acid reduced the adsorption of pfhxs to polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 and pfoa to polyacrylic resin yang et al 2018 using polyacrylic resin increasing doc concentration and or molecular weight of nom decreased the bed volumes to breakthrough for pfba pfoa pfbs and genx dixit et al 2020b and reduced adsorption of genx pfmoba and pfmopra dixit et al 2020a pfas removal by aers was equal to or greater than doc removal on a percentage basis dixit et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 del moral et al 2020 evaluated pfas removal by ps mp type i triethyl and pa mp type i in the absence and presence of suwannee river nom polystyrene resin removed more pfas than polyacrylic resin whereas the polyacrylic resin removed more doc than the polystyrene resin del moral et al 2020 for both resins the addition of 9 mg l doc had only a minor impact on removal of pfcas and pfsas del moral et al 2020 given that polyacrylic resins are known to have higher capacity and selectivity for nom than polystyrene resins bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 shuang et al 2015 it is reasonable that pfas studies that used polyacrylic resin observed greater adverse impact by nom dixit et al 2019 2020b than pfas studies that used polystyrene resin del moral et al 2020 kothawala et al 2017 in particular the results suggest that pfas removal is reduced by competition with nom and this competition is more pronounced for polyacrylic resins and for nom with high charge density high molecular weight or high aromatic carbon content the studies reviewed here used both nom isolates del moral et al 2020 dixit et al 2019 2020a b maimaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2018 and natural waters as source of nom dixit et al 2019 2020a kothawala et al 2017 and in general showed similar results 4 4 co occurring contaminants pfas impacted groundwater can contain co occurring contaminants such as hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents and surfactants the impact of these has only been investigated in one study the neutral compounds methylbenzene and trichloroethylene had no impact on pfhxs removal by polystyrene resin whereas anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds resulted in significant decrease in pfhxs removal by polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 sds has 12 c tail and organosulfate head group that was able to effectively compete with pfhxs for ion exchange sites 5 continuous flow adsorption table 3 summarizes column breakthrough results for pfas removal from water by aer from bench and pilot scale studies the table lists pfas aer combinations test water composition initial pfas concentration and bed volumes bvs to breakthrough defined as the outlet concentration exceeding 10 of the inlet concentration the following pfas are included in table 3 pfsas pfba pfhxs pfos pfcas pfba pfdoda pfteda fasas fosa pfecas pfmopra pfmoba genx and ftsas 6 2 8 2 for each pfas data are listed for polystyrene aer from low to high pfas concentration and then repeated for polyacrylic aer and wb aer if data are available in general bvs to breakthrough decreased as the initial pfas concentration increased which is consistent with pfas removal by aers through stoichiometric exchange with finite ion exchange capacity this trend was influenced by test water composition and resin properties with greater bvs to breakthrough for di water and simple water matrices than real waters and greater bvs to breakthrough for polystyrene aer than polyacrylic aer and wb aer regarding short chain pfaas i e pfbs pfba pfpea and pfhxa and polystyrene aer the results suggest greater bvs to breakthrough for gel structure than macroporous structure and proprietary functional groups than traditional type i functional group however more data sets are needed to confirm this trend the results for polyacrylic aer are limited to initial pfas concentration of 10 000 ng l and greater whereas polystyrene aer have data spanning initial pfas concentration of 10 to 10 000 ng l the results compiled in table 3 provide guidance on the expected i e order of magnitude number bvs to breakthrough for different pfas at varying initial concentrations and highlight where there are gaps in the data for example for long chain pfaas bvs to breakthrough was 100 000 and 10 000 for initial pfas concentration of 10 ng l and 10 000 ng l respectively results from bench scale column tests corroborate many of the results from batch adsorption tests most importantly breakthrough of pfcas occurred before breakthrough of pfsas and within pfcas and pfsas breakthrough of short chain compounds occurred before long chain compounds lampert et al 2007 schaefer et al 2019b zeng et al 2020 for example considering equal perfluoroalkyl tail length pfpea breakthrough occurred before pfbs and pfhpa breakthrough occurred before pfhxs schaefer et al 2019b whereas pfna and pfos were both completely removed zeng et al 2020 the general breakthrough trend was analogous to results from batch adsorption tests showing greater removal of pfsas than pfcas and increasing removal with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length maimaiti et al 2018 rapid small scale column tests rsscts which were developed for gac adsorption of trace organic contaminants crittenden et al 1991 were effectively applied to pfas removal by aer schaefer et al 2019b zeng et al 2020 the validity of using rsscts is an important result because it allows continuous flow testing to be conducted in a fraction of the time and using much less water than conventional bench scale column tests as another approach one study used multiple loading jar tests to mimic column adsorption and showed similar bvs to breakthrough for pfba pfoa pfbs pfos and genx dixit et al 2020b which is in contrast to most other batch and continuous flow studies and suggests additional research is needed on the multiple loading jar test procedure finally based on comparison in one contaminated groundwater influent total pfas 7 000 ng l perchlorate selective resin dowex psr 2 had 6 higher pfas loading than pfas selective resin pfa694e at 75 000 bvs zeng et al 2020 the results from pilot scale column tests further support the results from bench scale column tests and batch adsorption tests conte et al 2015 franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 pilot column tests showed that pfsas were removed to a greater extent and treated more bvs to breakthrough than pfcas franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 comparing pfas with the same perfluoroalkyl tail length at 10 breakthrough pfca breakthrough was significantly less than pfsa breakthrough e g pfpea 1549 bvs vs pfbs 13368 bvs pfhpa 6980 bvs vs pfhxs 26375 bvs and pfna 12938 bvs vs pfos 62920 bvs mccleaf et al 2017 which clearly highlights the important difference between the carboxylate and sulfonate head groups on electrostatic interactions with aer and corroborates density functional theory calculations that show oxygen with greater negative charge in sulfonate than carboxylate park et al 2020 removal of pfcas and pfsas and bvs to breakthrough increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length mccleaf et al 2017 which suggests the important role of non electrostatic interactions with polystyrene aer however density functional theory calculations indicate greater overall negative charge with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length park et al 2020 so it is difficult to separate the roles of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions for example 10 breakthrough for fosa was 14278 bvs which was greater than pfna even though fosa is considered a neutral molecule that could only interact with aer through non electrostatic interactions during pilot column tests pfba through pfoa desorbed from the resin due to secondary ion exchange with more favorable pfcas such as pfna through pfteda and pfsas mccleaf et al 2017 removal on a percentage basis of pfcas pfna through pfteda and pfsas was greater than doc removal which was less than 45 mccleaf et al 2017 finally mccleaf et al 2017 suggested that pfas uptake by ps g type i resin transitioned from monolayer coverage to multilayer coverage which is similar to batch adsorption tests showing pfas adsorbed chloride released becoming 1 as the pfas concentration in water increased maimaiti et al 2018 there is one study evaluating the full scale treatment efficiency of pfas removal by aers at two different plants appleman et al 2014 neither plant however was designed with the intention of using aer to remove pfas one plant used a hybrid sb aer ferrix a33e for arsenic removal whereby arsenic adsorbs to iron oxide infused in the ps mp resin and pfas are removed by combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions sampling showed pfsas were removed to a greater extent than pfcas and within each subgroup removal increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length the other ion exchange plant used miex resin for removal of nom miex is a pa mp type i resin with magnetic iron oxide to aid in settling full scale miex treatment showed no removal of pfaas which is in contrast to batch miex study showing 60 removal of long chain pfcas pfbs and pfos park et al 2020 the very limited full scale data suggests that polystyrene aer is more effective than polyacrylic aer for pfas removal 6 adsorption modeling 6 1 kinetic adsorption models the pseudo second order kinetic adsorption model given in equation 1 has been shown to be widely applicable to various solutes and adsorbents ho and mckay 1998 1999 and has been extensively applied to batch kinetic data on pfas uptake by aers see table s2 in appendix a 1 t q t 1 k 2 q c a p 2 t q c a p 2 v 0 k 2 q c a p 2 where qt mmol g is amount adsorbed at time t qcap mmol g is adsorption capacity at equilibrium k2 g mmol h is pseudo second order rate constant t h is time and v0 mmol g h is initial adsorption rate in theory the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained from equation 1 should match the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained from equilibrium isotherm models plazinski et al 2009 one limitation of the pseudo second order model is that the rate constant and hence the initial adsorption rate vary with experimental conditions such as initial solute concentration specifically v0 decreases as the initial solute concentration increases plazinski et al 2009 which explains the higher initial adsorption rate in dixit et al 2021a that used lower initial concentration than other studies nevertheless compiling the initial adsorption rates for pfas removal by aers in table s2 provides a semi quantitative approach to identify potential tends for pfas structure and resin properties on adsorption kinetics results for wb aer are discussed in section 8 in general the initial adsorption rate decreases as pfas chain length increases for pfsas and pfcas this result is consistent with decreasing aqueous diffusivity and increasing molar volume with increasing pfas chain length schaefer et al 2019a and its impact on intraparticle diffusion for pfos the initial adsorption rate was higher for polyacrylic resin ira958 than polystyrene resins ira400 ira410 ira900 ira910 for pfoa and pfos the initial adsorption rate was higher for macroporous resins ira910 ira958 than gel resins ira400 ira410 these trends for resin properties are also consistent with hindered intraparticle diffusion the initial adsorption rate for genx pfmoba and pfmopra was similar to pfba and pfbs for pa mp type i resin which is consistent with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule 6 2 adsorption isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models have been applied to numerous combinations of solute and adsorbent including pfas and aers see table s3 in appendix a although the assumptions for the langmuir isotherm model including monolayer coverage and homogeneous adsorption site energy are more consistent with ion exchange the freundlich model was included for completeness the langmuir isotherm model is defined as 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qe mmol g is amount of solute adsorbed at equilibrium qmax mmol g is maximum saturated monolayer adsorption capacity kl l mmol is constant related to affinity between adsorbent and solute and ce mmol l is solute concentration in solution at equilibrium the freundlich isotherm model is defined as 4 q e k f c e 1 n where qe and ce are as defined above and kf and n are empirical constants related to adsorption capacity and selectivity respectively table s3 compiles isotherm conditions and maximum adsorption capacity qmax for the langmuir isotherm model and or solid phase loading qe at maximum aqueous concentration ce for the freundlich isotherm model note the two different approaches commonly employed to conduct isotherm tests constant mass of adsorbent while varying solute concentration vs constant concentration of solute while varying mass of adsorbent can give different results millar et al 2015 in particular the constant mass approach is susceptible for giving different estimates of adsorption capacity in addition since the constant concentration approach typically uses high pfas concentrations the adsorption results are possibly subject to artifacts from the effects of molecular aggregation finally no adsorbent controls are important for assessing adsorption behavior due to air water interfacial losses particularly for pfos in batch conditions but rarely mentioned despite the various limitations of comparing adsorption capacity values from different studies and different models it is informative to compile the data and identify possible trends most of the adsorption isotherm results compiled in table s3 qualitatively conform to the shape of the langmuir isotherm exhibiting a plateau in adsorption capacity deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 yu et al 2009 which is consistent with aers having finite chloride exchange capacity an exception to this trend was pfos uptake by pa mp type i resin that did not show saturation in adsorption capacity schuricht et al 2017 which was attributed to micelle formation within the resin pore water the langmuir qmax and freundlich qe values in table s3 can be viewed relative to the chloride exchange capacity of aers which range from 2 0 to 5 6 mmol g depending on resin properties deng et al 2010 maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 in general wb aers have higher chloride exchange capacity than sb aers because tertiary amine functional groups are smaller than quaternary ammonium groups and hence more ion exchange sites can be accommodated in the resin likewise sb aers with large functional groups e g type i triaklyamine with carbon chain length 2 have some of the lowest chloride exchange capacity in table s3 there are cases where langmuir qmax or freundlich qe is near or even greater than the chloride exchange capacity of aers specifically this occurs for high initial concentration of pfas up to 1000 mg l and macroporous aers and suggests the potential for multilayer adsorption as a corollary for low initial concentration and or gel aers qmax or qe can be 10 of the chloride exchange capacity of the resin the langmuir and freundlich adsorption values did not show a trend for pfas structure e g perfluoroalkyl tail length head group due to the influence of initial pfas concentration and aer properties 6 3 modeling column adsorption different modeling approaches have been explored to predict pfas breakthrough curves for fixed bed aer treatment while these models vary in complexity and required parameters they are useful for predicting how changes in operating parameters e g flow rate influent concentration impact treatment and for extrapolating testing results to approximate aer longevity certain models rely on experimental data and ion exchange theory to predict breakthrough times for pfas using assumptions of equilibrium and rapid exchange as is typically the case in aqueous inorganic ion exchange systems one such approach utilized the equilibrium multicomponent chromatography theory emct to predict breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in columns of aer which yielded reasonable predictions of mean breakthrough times lampert et al 2007 however while the mean breakthrough time was reasonably predicted the emct model failed to capture the overall pfas breakthrough trend thus limiting its ability to predict early i e 10 breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in contrast to this equilibrium model pfas breakthrough in aer columns has been well characterized by the yoon nelson lin and huang and thomas models all of which assume kinetically limited langmuir adsorption these models contain a rate constant k to reflect the kinetic rate of mass transfer and can be linearized to produce accurate regression equations between effluent concentration and time xu et al 2013 both the yoon nelson and lin and huang models utilize this rate constant k and a characteristic time variable τ time to 50 breakthrough to generate breakthrough curves using only parameters for influent concentration c0 effluent concentration c and time t the yoon nelson model was able to accurately predict pfos breakthrough for five columns of different aers with r2 values ranging from 0 84 0 95 chularueangaksorn et al 2014 the lin and huang model uses the same parameters of the yoon nelson model and has closely predicted breakthrough of numerous pfas in aer columns with r2 values ranging from 0 76 0 91 franke et al 2019 another multisolute study used the lin and huang model to fit two distinct stages of aer adsorption of pfas due to an increase in mass transfer including second stage model r2 values of 0 95 0 99 mccleaf et al 2017 while these models accurately fit observed data their parameters are not resilient to changes in site characteristics like empty bed contact time ebct and bed size thus have limited utility for predicting treatment performance the thomas model is more complex and can account for these changes by including in addition to a kinetic term variables for resin mass adsorption capacity at a given solute concentration and ebct the thomas model accurately predicted breakthrough of pfas in multiple rsscts containing different types of aer at multiple concentrations and resin particle sizes with r2 values between 0 96 0 98 for certain resins schaefer et al 2019b results from this study support the dominance of intraparticle diffusion and resin capacity in determining the extent of pfas adsorption to aers and indicate that the thomas model can be accurately scaled from rsscts to larger conditions by accounting for particle surface area therefore the additional complexity of these kinetically limited models has led to more accurate predictions of pfas breakthrough that in some cases can be applied across a range of operational conditions however it remains unclear how both the kinetic constants and adsorption capacity terms used in the thomas and other kinetic models relate to the kinetic and adsorption capacity parameters obtained in batch aer studies 6 4 comparison of batch and continuous flow adsorption capacity pfas adsorption to aers has been shown to exhibit nonlinear isotherm behavior typically langmuir or freundlich based on batch studies using pfas concentration range of 1 1 000 mg l however continuous flow studies have been conducted using pfas concentration range of 10 10 000 ng l mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019b woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 therefore pfas adsorption to aer in continuous flow studies is linearly correlated in the lower concentration range i e ng l to µg l for example comparison of pfas adsorption to aers in raw water and membrane concentrate illustrates the linear behavior of pfas adsorption where increasing the pfas concentration by 2 to 5 times depending on pfas resulted in 4 times higher pfas loading on resin franke et al 2019 furthermore the low concentration range of the adsorption isotherm is typically extrapolated from high concentration range mg l to g l batch data which likely overestimates the adsorption capacity several studies have shown less favorable isotherms for pfas adsorption to aers in particular the s sigmoidal shaped isotherm where adsorption is low at low concentrations and becomes higher as concentration increases alberti et al 2012 for example pfbs exhibited an s sigmoidal shaped isotherm at mg l concentrations carter and farrell 2010 while pfoa pfos genx pfmopra and pfmoba exhibited s sigmoidal shaped isotherms at µg l concentrations dixit et al 2019 2020a schuricht et al 2017 pfas adsorption to aers in continuous flow studies could be occurring in the unfavorable region of an s sigmoidal shaped adsorption isotherm as a caveat on adsorption at low solute concentrations the adsorption isotherm discussion is based on regenerable sb aers carter and farrell 2010 dixit et al 2019 schuricht et al 2017 not pfas selective resins where higher adsorption capacity is expected dixit et al 2021a zaggia et al 2016 7 resin disposal and regeneration 7 1 disposal of non regenerable pfas selective resin aers can be used without regeneration and incinerated once its adsorption capacity for pfas is reached for example ps g bifunctional resin a532e was considered non regenerable zaggia et al 2016 and would need to be incinerated following single use application typical conditions for municipal waste incinerators are 1000 c and 2 s residence time taylor et al 2014 which research shows leads to the chemical breakdown of pfoa krusic et al 2005 pfos khan et al 2020 and other pfas and associated wastes taylor et al 2014 tsang et al 1998 yamada et al 2005 for example a recent study showed that the pfas content of ash leachates decreased with increasing incineration temperature between 760 980 c implying more complete pfas breakdown at higher temperatures solo gabriele et al 2020 however gaseous perfluorocarbon emissions are still a concern usepa 2019 research on incineration of polystyrene sb aer showed the resin followed a shrinking particle model with no solid product and optimum temperature of 650 c kinoshita et al 1991 there was no difference in the reaction rate of decomposition for hydroxide vs chloride form aer in another study on incineration of polystyrene sb aer degradation was nearly complete at 800 c dubois et al 1995 with volatile products having a molecular weight of 44 g mol carbon dioxide nitrous oxide finally pyrolysis of polystyrene and polyacrylic wb aers showed higher thermal stability for polystyrene resin zhang and qian 2014 there is no published study that evaluates incineration of pfas loaded aer to investigate thermal behavior and volatile products 7 2 regeneration efficiency of regenerable resin although most of the aers studied for pfas removal are regenerable regeneration is less studied compared with removal capacity and selectivity among regeneration studies most evaluate batch regeneration and only a few studies have investigated column mode regeneration or discussed disposal options for waste regeneration solution table 4 summarizes all regeneration studies involving aer and pfas and is organized showing pfas aer combinations regeneration solution composition regeneration efficiency and experiment type regeneration time is not included because of its secondary importance compared with regeneration solution composition and concentration chularueangaksorn et al 2013 this section is confined to regeneration results for sb aer while wb aer is discussed in the next section the regeneration solution composition is listed for salt base solvent salt base salt solvent base solvent in order of increasing concentration the key result from table 4 is that for most combinations of pfas and aer effective desorption is only achieved for regeneration solutions that combined salt or alkaline aqueous solution with organic co solvent hereafter salt organic co solvent or base organic co solvent the salt or base is not always clearly defined in terms of whether the concentration applies to the aqueous solution fraction only or to the total water co solvent solution the solvent is consistently reported as v v for the total water co solvent solution aers are typically regenerated using salt and or alkaline aqueous solution to desorb inorganic anions and nom hu and boyer 2018 maul et al 2014 however many studies that have investigated pfas desorption from aers using salt nacl kcl nh4cl or alkaline naoh koh nh4oh aqueous solution concentration range 1 5 show negligible desorption of pfas for example there was negligible pfos desorption from pa g type i resin carter and farrell 2010 and pa mp type i resin deng et al 2010 using nacl or naoh there was also negligible pfos desorption from ps g type i and ps g type ii resins using nacl kcl naoh and koh chularueangaksorn et al 2013 zaggia et al 2016 the previous studies also showed negligible desorption of pfba pfoa and pfbs albeit with limited data carter and farrell 2010 zaggia et al 2016 a few studies however have shown pfas desorption using nacl or naoh for example 90 desorption of pfba pfoa pfbs pfos and genx from ps mp type i resin using 10 nacl dixit et al 2020b and 80 desorption of genx from ps g type i resin using 0 5 nacl wang et al 2019 for comparison two studies used the same resin type pa mp type i from different manufacturers and showed very different pfos regeneration efficiency using 5 nacl negligible desorption deng et al 2010 vs 60 desorption dixit et al 2020b key differences between the studies included the presence of nom and lower initial pfas concentration dixit et al 2020b which resulted in 90 of the ion exchange sites being occupied by nom and only 1 2 of the sites being occupied by pfos therefore it is possible that desorption of nom aided the desorption of pfas dixit et al 2018 neale et al 2010 the effective desorption of genx from both pa and ps resins using nacl implies that genx adsorption to aer is based on electrostatic interactions given that most studies show minimal desorption of pfas from sb aer using salt or alkaline aqueous solutions researchers that show contrary results should support their findings with appropriate controls and theoretical explanations methanol alone was not effective in desorbing pfos from aers chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 which indicates the importance of electrostatic interactions the most consistent regeneration results have been achieved using a combination of salt aqueous solution and methanol e g nacl methanol or alkaline aqueous solution and methanol e g naoh methanol with increasing desorption of pfas with increasing methanol content chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 for example for polyacrylic resin 1 nacl 50 methanol achieved 70 pfos desorption and increasing the methanol fraction to 70 increased pfos desorption to 90 deng et al 2010 for polystyrene resin 70 methanol in nacl or naoh achieved nearly 100 pfos desorption chularueangaksorn et al 2013 an interesting regeneration result is the effectiveness of dilute aqueous only solutions of salt and base specifically 0 5 nh4cl 0 5 nh4oh and to a lesser extent 0 5 kcl 0 5 koh to desorb 50 to 80 of pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos from two different polystyrene resins zaggia et al 2016 reasons mentioned for the effectiveness of combined salt and base regeneration include that pfas are more soluble in dilute salt solution e g 0 5 than typical salt regeneration solutions 5 10 and that the presence of ammonium or potassium co ion in the regeneration solution enhances the solubility of pfas through ion pair formation however another study showed increasing pfas desorption with increasing nacl concentration up to 20 dixit et al 2020b so the higher regeneration efficiency of dilute salt solution is not clear 8 weak base anion exchange resin key studies on pfas removal by wb aers focus on pa g tertiary amine resin ira67 and ps mp tertiary amine resin ira96 for pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs pfos f 53b and genx deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yao et al 2014 the ira67 and ira96 products names are used in this section since they were the main wb aers evaluated the dissociation constants for the protonated forms of ira67 and ira96 were determined to be logka 9 0 and logka 6 4 respectively miyazaki and nakai 2011 meaning ira67 should be mostly protonated and act like a sb aer up to ph 9 0 whereas ira96 should be mostly protonated up to ph 6 4 the order of increasing initial pseudo second order adsorption rate was pfhpa genx pfhxa pfos pfoa f 53b on ira67 and ira96 ira67 for pfoa see table s2 the more hydrophilic properties of polyacrylic resin relative to polystyrene resin shuang et al 2015 likely contributed to the higher initial adsorption rate and increased mass transfer observed for ira67 over ira96 the order of increasing adsorption capacity based on capacity constants from pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models was pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs genx f 53b pfos on ira67 and ira96 ira67 for pfhxs and pfos see tables s2 and s3 the trend shows increasing adsorption capacity with increasing number of perfluorinated carbons and sulfonate head group over carboxylate head group f 53b and pfos were compared in the same study whereas the comparison of genx with other pfas was made across studies so introduces uncertainty the ratio of pfas adsorbed chloride released for ira67 increased from 1 to 1 2 as the concentration of pfos and f 53b increased up to 0 4 mmol l deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 due to the hydrophilic properties of polyacrylic resin this suggests the possibility of excess pfas adsorption was by molecular aggregation e g admicelle or micelle formation pfos and f 53b adsorption to ira67 decreased substantially above ph 10 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 and pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and genx adsorption to ira67 decreased as ph increased over the range 2 9 du et al 2015 wang et al 2019 all of which is consistent with weak base chemistry of the resin adsorption of pfos and f 53b to ira67 decreased with increasing sulfate and chromate concentration deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 likewise the presence of sulfate decreased adsorption of pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa to ira67 while the presence of chloride or nitrate did not have an effect du et al 2015 genx adsorption to ira67 resin was substantially decreased in bi solute solution containing genx and pfoa indicating more selective adsorption of pfoa the results on competitive ion exchange are consistent with the pfas stoichiometry results showing electrostatic interactions to be the predominant mechanism and non electrostatic interactions contributing to adsorption selectivity the ph dependence of wb aer functional groups results in different regeneration chemistry than sb aers with higher regeneration efficiency for pfas see table 4 regeneration solutions consisting of nacl methanol or ethanol naoh methanol and naoh aqueous solution were able to desorb pfhxa pfhpa pfoa genx f 53b and pfos from ira67 deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 nacl methanol solution required at least 50 methanol to desorb greater than 80 pfos and f 53b whereas naoh with reduced methanol content i e 30 methanol showed similar desorption of pfos and f 53b deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 using ira67 a 0 04 naoh aqueous solution was able to desorb 50 of pfos deng et al 2010 and 80 pfhpa and pfoa du et al 2015 and a 0 5 naoh aqueous solution was able to desorb 90 genx desorption of pfcas from ira67 increased as follows pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and was similar for 0 04 naoh 1 nacl 70 methanol and 1 nacl 70 ethanol du et al 2015 this trend is counterintuitive given that pfhxa has weaker interactions with aer than pfoa hence one would expect pfhxa to show the highest desorption genx showed 90 desorption using 0 5 naoh or 0 5 nacl indicating that its interactions with wb aer is predominantly through electrostatic interactions the regeneration results show that at high ph the tertiary amine functional group of weak base resin deprotonates rendering the functional group neutral and thereby eliminating electrostatic interactions between pfas head group and resin functional group in addition the polyacrylic resin has weaker non electrostatic van der waals interactions with perfluoroalkyl tail than polystyrene resin hence the effective desorption an important caveat for pfas like pfos and f 53b is that the regeneration solution needs to have low ionic strength e g 0 04 naoh because of low pfas solubility at high ionic strength finally wb aer have not been studied for removal or regeneration efficiency for pfcas shorter than pfhxa or pfsas shorter than pfos however genx has been studied hence regeneration studies using short chain pfaas and other non pfaa pfas would fill key gap in the literature 9 conclusions and future research needs table 5 shows the extent of research that has been completed on pfas removal by aers the table illustrates that there are many aspects of pfas removal by aers with little or no research especially for short chain pfcas and pfsas and pfas beyond pfaas some topics like impact of organic co contaminants has not been studied for any pfas the conclusions listed below are based on the literature available future research needs are provided and prioritized to aid researchers and those engaged with pfas remediation 9 1 conclusions pfas removal by aers follows ion exchange stoichiometry and is influenced by pfas structure and resin properties which manifests itself as a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic van der waals hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions between solute and resin dominate for short chain pfcas and pfecas e g genx which results in short chain pfcas being displaced by long chain pfcas and short and long chain pfsas short chain pfsas exhibit stronger electrostatic interactions with aers than short chain pfcas non electrostatic interactions appear to be enhanced for long chain pfas and polystyrene resin composition including neutral pfas such as fasa e g fosa and include both solute resin physisorption and solute solute molecular aggregation interactions solute solute interactions are believed to occur within hydrophilic polyacrylic resin at high concentrations mg l to g l of long chain pfas polystyrene gel resin exhibits the greatest resistance to mass transfer while polyacrylic macroporous resin exhibits the least resistance to mass transfer in addition mass transfer limitations are greater for long chain pfas than short chain analogs at high pfas concentrations mg l to g l the capacity of aers for pfas equals the chloride exchange capacity of the resin the adsorption behavior at high pfas concentrations mostly conforms to the langmuir isotherm model showing saturation capacity however in some case the freundlich isotherm model shows a better fit as pfas concentration decreases pfas loading on aer decreases following the linear region of the isotherm there is some evidence to suggest that at ng l to µg l concentrations pfas adsorption to aers follows an s sigmoidal shaped isotherm that contributes to low adsorption capacity at low pfas concentrations batch and continuous flow adsorption experiments agree on aer selectivity for pfas with the general order of increasing selectivity as pfba pfhxa genx pfbs pfoa pfhxs fosa pfos in general water composition has a minor impact on pfas removal by aer ph and the presence of inorganic anions results in minor change in pfas removal by sb aer and slightly greater impact of wb aer the presence of nom can reduce pfas removal by aer with greater impact of high molecular weight nom such as humic acid and polyacrylic resin pfas can be desorbed from aers using salt aqueous solution with organic cosolvent typically methanol a higher fraction of cosolvent 70 is required for polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin due to enhanced non electrostatic interactions between pfas and polystyrene resin a few studies have shown that aqueous only regeneration solution salt alone or salt base can desorb pfas from sb aers however the mechanism is not known it is possible that the pfas desorbed during aqueous only regeneration are from molecular aggregations e g micelles that formed during adsorption under high concentration conditions or associated with nom weak base aers can be effectively regenerated using aqueous only alkaline solution which is consistent with the ph dependent behavior of the resin functional groups finally pfas selective aers that are used in single use mode without regeneration offer a simplified alternative to regenerable aers however there is minimal published research on their performance and especially disposal 9 2 future research needs 1 underlying adsorption science further research is needed to advance understanding of the basic science controlling pfas interactions with ion exchange resins although there are many reports on ion exchange adsorption of pfcas and pfsas much less is known about adsorption of other groups of pfas including short chain fasas perfluoroalkyl ether acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonamido substances dixit et al 2020a wang et al 2020 addressing the wide structural diversity of pfas in these processes would benefit greatly from spectroscopic and theoretical analyses of molecular scale interactions between solutes resins and solvents spectroscopic methods particularly in situ methods like atr ftir can provide insights into important intermolecular forces that contribute to the varying affinity of different pfas for specific resin structures there have been significant advancements in computational methods like density function theory and molecular dynamics that can now be exploited to simulate molecular behavior in multi phase systems and assess how specific molecular changes in either the solute e g pfas fluoroalkyl chain length and degree of fluorination or the sorbent e g change in alkylamine functional group structure or polymer porosity might affect adsorption processes likewise better understanding of these intermolecular interactions will be critical to evaluating the importance of phenomena unique to pfas treatment including potential for micelle hemi micelle and admicelle formation in solutions and potentially within polymer pore spaces current understanding of pfas treatment is guided mostly by empirical observations but a stronger molecular scale understanding can be exploited by polymer scientists to design new resins with desired properties to target specific pfas of concern including short chain and branched pfas that are not strongly adsorbed to current resins this could include bifunctional adsorbents with some sites tailored to select for shorter chain pfas some studies suggest that mass transfer within aer i e intraparticle diffusion may be hindered for some pfas e g long chain or branched structures and some resins e g gel type macroscopic and spectroscopic experimentation coupled with molecular dynamics simulations may be particularly useful for assessing the importance of these processes for controlling observed adsorption behavior 2 resin regeneration and concentrate management although the industry trend is moving towards application of pfas selective resins that are operated in single use non regenerable fashion this move is driven in large part by the complicated processes required for regeneration of current resins loaded with pfas current practices for regeneration of pfas loaded resins involve use of high concentrations of alcohol cosolvent e g 70 methanol together with brines and separate distillation steps are required to recover the cosolvent in addition to the complexity of such systems use of high concentrations of flammable organic solvents necessitates the need to add fire suppression systems for safety thus future research is needed to develop resins and treatment systems that are effective for pfas treatment but also amenable to regeneration using aqueous only regenerants composed of salts that do not present safety or toxicity concerns of their own e g avoid using ammonium based salts dixit et al 2020b wang et al 2019 furthermore legislation currently under consideration that would ban incineration of pfas containing wastes may result in greater need for regenerable resins complementary to the need for improved regeneration strategies and resins is the need to develop effective and efficient technologies for destruction of pfas in the regenerant byproduct streams from ion exchange systems including concentrating the pfas in foam currently such byproduct streams must be shipped off site for landfilling or incineration many technologies are actively being developed for destruction of pfas including electrochemical plasma hydrothermal photochemical photocatalytic thermochemical and catalytic while some promising results are being reported complete destruction and mineralization of the full suite of pfas to exceedingly stringent levels e g 1 ng l a necessary pre requisite for any plans to re use the regenerant streams remains very challenging and requires very high energy expenditures furthermore efforts are needed to ensure that application of the destructive technology does not result in undesirable byproducts e g chlorine byproducts from electrochemical treatment of pfas in chloride containing brines it follows that regenerant brine makeup may be modified to minimize such byproducts e g substituting sulfate based salt brines for chloride based brines 3 life cycle environmental impacts finally with the accumulation of data from ion exchange treatment systems both regenerable and non regenerable there is a need for systems level analyses of the full life cycle costs and environmental impacts of ion exchange and competing technologies like activated carbon adsorption emery et al 2019 only through such analyses that consider the full integrated treatment systems can optimal treatment solutions be identified life cycle cost analyses can explore the trade offs in both capital and operating costs over the lifetime of a treatment system similarly life cycle assessment frameworks have been developed that can more accurately compare the full environmental impacts of competing treatment technologies for example non regenerable ion exchange systems are expected to require the manufacturing transportation and disposal of a greater amount of resin materials than a regenerable ion exchange system over the lifetime of treatment operations but impacts associated with these activities may be more than offset by a reduction in salt and organic co solvent use and management operations e g energy for distillation processes to recover cosolvent one area of research need is better information on inputs and wastes from the manufacturing of different ion exchange resin formulations while much of the necessary information is proprietary research efforts

16903,a key gap in the literature on the treatment of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in impacted water is the absence of a review article dedicated to anion exchange resin aer treatment this gap is important because previous research has consistently shown adsorption by aer to be one of the most effective treatment processes for pfas removal from impacted water and aer is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field given the scope of the previous review articles on pfas removal by various adsorbent types the sections on aer do not explore the full depth of pfas and aer interactions nor cover the breadth of aer testing conditions accordingly the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer reviewed literature on pfas removal from water by aer the specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on 1 batch adsorption behavior 2 impact of water chemistry conditions 3 continuous flow adsorption 4 adsorption modeling 5 regeneration and 6 weak base aer following from critical review of the literature the future research priorities discussed include i improving the underlying science that governs pfas resin interactions ii improving methods for resin regeneration and management of pfas contaminated concentrate streams and iii comparative life cycle environmental and economic analyses for ion exchange

polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas encompass a wide range of chemicals that are characterized by highly fluorinated carbon c chain that imparts useful chemical properties for industry consumer products fire fighting foams and other applications all of which have resulted in release of pfas to the environment oecd 2013 pfas have been detected in water soil and other media on a global scale are highly persistent in the environment and have raised concerns due to the potential for adverse health effects on humans banzhaf et al 2017 pontius 2019 toms et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the following pfas nomenclature and categories i e class subclass group and subgroup are used in this paper pfas are divided into two classes polymers and nonpolymers the polymer class includes high molecular weight compound subclasses such as fluoropolymers and perfluoropolyethers the nonpolymers class includes chemicals with fluorinated carbon tail attached to a head group and is divided into two subclasses perfluoroalkyl substances and polyfluoroalkyl substances that differ in terms of all c atoms being saturated with fluorine f atoms or at least one but not all c atoms being saturated with f atoms respectively the head group includes oxygen o nitrogen n sulfur s phosphorus p and other functional groups pfas from the nonpolymers class that have been evaluated for aer removal are listed in table 1 and discussed more in section 2 table 1 illustrates the classification and structure of relevant pfas for example important groups from the perfluoroalkyl substances subclass includes perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas and perfluoroalkyl ether acids pfeas with some groups further subdivided such as the pfaas subgroups of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas the polyfluoroalkyl substances subclass includes perfluoroalkane sulfonamido substances fluorotelomer based substances ftss and other groups the two most studied pfas are perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa of pfcas subgroup and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos of pfsas subgroup pontius 2019 which are highly persistent due to long perfluoroalkyl tail and mobile due to negatively charged acid head group wang et al 2017 recent concerns about pfas in water include short chain pfaas such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and pfaa alternatives like genx 1 2 previous review articles on pfas treatment table s1 in appendix a summarizes the previous review articles on pfas removal and destruction in impacted water most of the review articles focus on the pfaas group of pfas and in response to pfas research trends the articles show a shift in focus from pfoa and pfos arias espana et al 2015 du et al 2014 to short chain pfaas such as pfba and pfbs ateia et al 2019b gagliano et al 2020 li et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 the main treatment categories covered in the reviews are removal separation processes including adsorption by granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resin aer and separation by nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro banks et al 2020 du et al 2014 ji et al 2020 kucharzyk et al 2017 and destruction processes including advanced oxidation advanced reduction and thermal destruction ahmed et al 2020 merino et al 2016 nzeribe et al 2019 there have been several reviews on pfas adsorption du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 zhang et al 2019 that consider various adsorbents adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting adsorption capacity the previous adsorption reviews cover gac biochar aer and other synthesized materials because the reviews cover different types of adsorbents it is outside the scope of these reviews to provide comprehensive analysis of pfas removal by aer including ion exchange mechanism impacts of resin properties and water matrix batch vs column adsorption and regeneration chemistry while many treatment processes especially destruction technologies are being actively studied in the laboratory setting trojanowicz et al 2018 in practice field and especially full scale treatment has been limited almost exclusively to gac and aer adsorption processes arias espana et al 2015 crone et al 2019 ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 underscoring the need for a review on pfas removal from water by aer 1 3 scope of this review a key gap in the literature highlighted by the analysis of previous review articles on pfas treatment is the absence of a review dedicated to aer prior to the final revision of this paper a review article on pfas removal from water by aer was published dixit et al 2021b this gap is important because previous research has consistently shown aer to be one of the most effective treatment processes for pfas removal from impacted water and aer is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field arias espana et al 2015 itrc 2020a ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 although initial efforts for remediating pfas impacted water focused on gac ion exchange technology is receiving increasing consideration crone et al 2019 a key reason for the shift in focus to aer is because aer exhibits significantly higher adsorption capacity than gac for both short and long chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 previous review articles on pfas removal by various adsorbent types include sections on aer that explore adsorption mechanisms adsorption capacity impacts of water matrix and regeneration du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 vu and wu 2020 zhang et al 2019 and a review article on amine functionalized adsorbents is focused on designing new adsorbents and treats commercial aers as a single adsorbent material ateia et al 2019a the previous review articles provide important insights on pfas removal by aer but the scope of the previous articles covering numerous adsorbent types does not allow for critical review of pfas adsorption and desorption by aers considering the important properties of aers and the interactions between resin properties pfas structure and experimental conditions the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer reviewed literature on pfas removal from water by aer this included 31 articles published between 2007 and 2021 with more than half of the articles published since 2016 the review included both strong base aer sb aer and weak base aer wb aer and considered all pfas groups and subgroups for which aer removal data were available the specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on 1 batch adsorption behavior 2 impact of water chemistry conditions on adsorption 3 continuous flow adsorption 4 modeling pfas adsorption 5 regeneration and 6 wb aer as alternative to sb aer a cross cutting objective for this review was to elucidate the impacts of pfas structure and resin properties on ion exchange behavior the article concludes with prioritized future research needs thereby providing a roadmap for researchers and others involved with remediating pfas impacted water 2 pfas test waters and resins tables 1 and 2 summarize the pfas test waters and resins that have been studied within the scope of this literature review note that over half of the pfas listed in tables 1 and 2 have only been evaluated in one study using one resin wang et al 2020 the pfas listed in table 2 show initial research focus on pfoa and pfos then shift in research focus to include additional pfcas and pfsas especially the shorter chain analogs of pfoa and pfos other perfluoroalkyl substances e g fasas pfecas and polyfluoroalkyl substances e g fasaas ftsas the pfas listed in table 1 highlight the fluorinated carbon tail lengths and head groups that have been tested for removal by aer fluorinated carbon tail lengths vary from 1 to 13 and head groups include anionic carboxylic acid carboxylate and sulfonic acid sulfonate nonionic sulfonamide and zwitterionic quaternary ammonium sulfonic acid because some head groups include a c atom the fluorinated carbon tail length can be shorter than the total number of c atoms e g pfoa vs pfos and fosa following established conventions pfhpa and shorter and pfpes and shorter are defined as short chain pfaas whereas pfoa and longer and pfhxs and longer are defined as long chain pfaas oecd 2013 the test waters used in studies were classified based on their origin including synthetic typically composed of di water and salts natural i e field collected surface water or groundwater wastewater etc where any water not created synthetically is categorized as real water in many of the studies both synthetic and real test waters were spiked with pfas however real contaminated waters have also been studied for context pfas concentrations in groundwater on the order of 10 100 µg l have been measured near contaminated source zones backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 whereas groundwater production wells can have pfas concentrations of 10 100 ng l zeng et al 2020 the implication of spiking pfas in test water versus using real contaminated water is that higher pfas concentrations can be studied higher concentrations can be advantageous for instrument detection however high concentrations may not be realistic and can introduce artifacts to adsorption behavior such as micelle formation schuricht et al 2017 other concerns with spiking pfas in test water include addition of organic solvent inhomogeneity of pfas mixture and accumulation at air water interface the impact of very high pfas concentrations 100 1000 mg l which are not realistic for environmental waters but generated for easier treatment and analysis on pfas adsorption by aer is explored in later sections of this critical review most studies have tested sb aer which are characterized by quaternary ammonium functional groups with permanent positive charge while several studies have tested wb aer which have tertiary amine groups that exhibit ph dependent charging behavior in this review article resins are referred to by polymer composition pore structure and functional group using the categories and abbreviations described in fig 1 table 2 and fig 1 show that a variety of aer types have been tested for pfas removal the following are general rules based on the properties of ion exchange resins helfferich 1995 which are expected to impact pfas adsorption polystyrene ps resin is more hydrophobic than polyacrylic pa resin and as a result pa resin has higher water content than ps resin gel g resin exhibits size exclusion of high molecular weight compounds whereas size exclusion is not relevant for macroporous mp resin type i functional group is more hydrophobic than type ii functional group and the hydrophobicity and size of type i functional group increases with increasing alkylamine chain length regarding terminology ion exchange resins adsorb contaminants through a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions the electrostatic interactions are between positively charged functional groups on the resin and negatively charged head group of the pfas the two most relevant non electrostatic interactions are van der waals interactions and hydrophobic attractions chandler 2005 meyer et al 2006 however isolating their contributions to adsorption remains a major research challenge tang et al 2018 hence most descriptions of pfas adsorption to aer use the terms electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions 3 batch adsorption 3 1 ion exchange stoichiometry previous research shows that aer removal of inorganic anions hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and naphthalene sulfonate and natural organic matter nom follow ion exchange stoichiometry i e one equivalent of chloride released from resin for each equivalent of anion taken up from solution boyer et al 2008 li and sengupta 1998 2004 rahmani and mohseni 2017 ion exchange also appears to play an important role in pfas uptake by aers with non electrostatic interactions likely contributing to the strong uptake of pfas compared with inorganic anions the importance of non electrostatic interactions is supported by perfluorinated carbon tail length dependent pfas removal by aers discussed in next subsection and the difficulty of desorbing pfas from aers during regeneration discussed later the non electrostatic interactions referenced here include solute resin i e physisorption and solute solute i e molecular aggregation interactions which are the result of van der waals interactions and hydrophobic attractions deng et al 2012 for example strong uptake of hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and naphthalene sulfonate by ps mp type i resin was attributed to favorable physisorption between nonpolar moieties of solute and polystyrene resin li and sengupta 1998 2004 unlike hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds studied previously surfactant molecules like pfas exhibit solute solute interactions including hemimicelle monolayer admicelle bilayer and micelle formation du et al 2014 gangula et al 2010 which do not necessarily occur in pure form but rather various states of molecular aggregation as a result it is possible for pfas uptake to occur without release of equivalent chloride counterion underscoring the important role of non electrostatic interactions several studies have investigated the stoichiometry of pfas removal by sb aers the studies include polyacrylic resins with pfoa pfos genx pfmoba and pfmopra deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 2020a and polystyrene resins with pfba pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 the ratio of pfas adsorbed chloride released increased from approx 1 pure electrostatic interactions to 1 3 combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions as pfas concentration increased and or pfas perfluoroalkyl tail length increased at constant concentration for example the ratio of pfba adsorbed chloride related was always 1 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 whereas pfos adsorbed chloride released increased from 1 to 1 3 as the pfos concentration increased indicating that some pfos molecules were adsorbing to the resin without ion exchange occurring deng et al 2010 deng et al 2012 maimaiti et al 2018 because deng et al 2010 used high initial concentration of pfos 400 mg l and hydrophilic resin pa mp type i enhanced pfos adsorption via molecular aggregation likely occurred instead of physisorption to resin polymer for instance using high pfos concentration of 1000 mg l high uptake of pfos by pa mp type i resin was speculated via micelle formation in the resin pore water schuricht et al 2017 at concentration range of 0 5 10 mg l pfas pfoa and pfos uptake by pa mp type i resin was accompanied by stoichiometric release of chloride with no indication of non electrostatic interactions dixit et al 2019 uptake of genx pfmoba and pfmopra by polyacrylic resin also showed stoichiometric release of chloride dixit et al 2020a 3 2 impact of pfas structure pfos removal by aers has been shown to be faster than pfoa lampert et al 2007 slower than pfoa maimaiti et al 2018 and approximately equal to pfoa dixit et al 2019 the properties of pfos and pfoa explain some of the results for example pfos and pfoa have similar aqueous diffusivities 0 54 0 04 10 5 vs 0 49 0 09 10 5 cm2 s with pfos having a higher molar volume than pfoa 272 1 vs 237 3 cm3 mol schaefer et al 2019a and molecular length 1 2 vs 1 0 nm xiao et al 2012 hence size exclusion and hindered diffusion are more likely for pfos than pfoa for resin properties such as polystyrene composition and or gel pore structure yu et al 2009 most studies evaluating the time varying removal of different tail length pfas show a higher adsorption rate for shorter pfas for example for ps g type i and type ii resins the adsorption rate was higher for pfbs than pfos deng et al 2010 suggesting that size exclusion was hindering pfos uptake for ps mp type ii resin the adsorption rate decreased as follows pfhxa pfbs pfoa pfhxs pfba pfos maimaiti et al 2018 which suggests adsorption kinetics was influenced in part by perfluoroalkyl tail length for pa mp type i resin the adsorption rate decreased as follows pfmopra pfmoba genx dixit et al 2020a which followed increasing number of c atoms however for pa mp type i miex resin the adsorption rate increased with increasing length of perfluoroalkyl tail for pfcas and pfsas park et al 2020 and at same number of c atoms pfsas showed higher adsorption rate than pfcas the variation in adsorption kinetics for different pfas structures is likely influenced by initial pfas concentration and its impact on mass transfer control for example pfoa pfos pfmopra pfmoba genx adsorption to pa mp type i resin was film diffusion controlled at initial concentration 50 µg l and switched to intraparticle pore diffusion controlled at higher concentrations dixit et al 2019 2020a comparison of pfos and pfbs removal showed differing trends for different resin properties specifically pa g type i resin had greater capacity for pfos than pfbs carter and farrell 2010 whereas ps g type i and ii resins had greater capacity for pfbs than pfos chularueangaksorn et al 2014 deng et al 2010 in studies evaluating aer removal of multiple pfas trends include decreasing adsorption capacity with decreasing length of perfluoroalkyl tail greater adsorption of pfsas than pfcas at same number of c atoms and lowest adsorption capacity for pfba del moral et al 2020 maimaiti et al 2018 zaggia et al 2016 which are limited to polystyrene sb aers greater removal of pfsas than pfcas is supported by previous research showing higher aer selectivity for monosulfonic acids then monocarboxylic acids kanazawa et al 2004 in contrast to most published research pfas removal by ps g type i resin decreased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length for mixing time of 15 min kothawala et al 2017 suggesting mass transfer limitations also in contrast to most published research pfoa pfos and fosa which has neutral sulfonamide head group showed very similar removal kothawala et al 2017 in the most comprehensive study to date 68 pfas were screened for removal by ps g complex amino resin wang et al 2020 pfas classes that were removed to greater than 50 were fasa fasaa h pfsa mefasaa pfsa and spr fasa wang et al 2020 which included the functional groups sulfonamide neutral sulfonamido acetic acid anionic and sulfonate anionic aer removal efficiency showed limited statistical correlations with perfluoroalkyl tail length e g it was not significantly correlated with pfca length was inversely correlated with pfsa length and showed significant positive correlation with fasa length wang et al 2020 the strong positive correlation between perfluoroalkyl tail length of fasa and removal suggests that non electrostatic interactions can be the dominant force of attraction of polystyrene resin the pfas adsorption trends reviewed in the previous paragraph were for polystyrene sb aers data on removal of multiple pfas from solution using polyacrylic sb aer showed removals of 50 pfos 20 pfhxa pfoa pfbs and pfhxs and no removal of pfba del moral et al 2020 and in another study removals were approx 60 90 for pfoa pfbs pfda pfos and 20 60 for pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa park et al 2020 density functional theory calculations were used to show the o atoms in the sulfonate head group i e pfbs and pfos possessed a greater negative charge than the o atoms in the carboxylate head group i e pfba and pfoa and anionic character increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length park et al 2020 which implies stronger electrostatic interactions between pfsas and resin functional groups 3 3 impact of resin properties the rate of pfos removal increased for the following combination of resin properties ps g type i ps g type ii ps mp type i ps mp wb pa g wb pa mp type i chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 in another study the rate of pfos removal increased for the following combination of polystyrene resin properties mp type i trialkyl with c 2 mp type i triethyl mp type i trimethyl mp wb schuricht et al 2017 the rate of pfos removal increased as the aer became more hydrophilic more porous or the volume of the functional groups decreased all of which enhanced mass transfer specifically intraparticle diffusion the first two trends are clear comparing ps vs pa resin and g vs mp resin respectively the later trend becomes evident when wb aers are included the functional groups for wb aers and sb aers type i are polymer n ch3 2h and polymer n ch3 3 respectively where the size of the functional group increases by one methyl group in addition for type i resins where the trialkylamine groups are ethyl propyl butyl etc intraparticle diffusion is impeded by the increased volume of the functional groups the most comprehensive comparisons of aer properties have relied on pfos and a few studies have made comparisons of aer properties considering other pfas considering 16 different commercial aers resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfos were pa g wb pa mp type i ps mp type i triethyl ps mp type i ps mp wb ps g type ii ps g type i chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 schuricht et al 2017 schuricht et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 the wb aers are included here for completeness and discussed in detail later most of the studies referenced above conducted adsorption isotherms or batch loading with high pfos concentrations 400 to 1000 mg l which may have influenced the adsorption results for instance it was suggested that the high pfos uptake by polyacrylic resin was an artifact of high pfos concentration resulting in micelle formation in the resin pore water schuricht et al 2017 ps g type i resin consistently exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity for pfos and much lower than its ion exchange capacity which is noteworthy since it is the most widely studied aer for pfas removal see table 2 and pfas selective resins are composed of ps g with proprietary functional groups wang et al 2020 resin properties that showed decreasing removal of pfoa were pa g type i ps mp type i ps mp wb ps g type i ps g type ii lampert et al 2007 and resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfhxs were ps mp type ii pa g wb ps mp wb ps g type i maimaiti et al 2018 and genx were pa g wb ps g type i wang et al 2019 this suggests that complementary resin properties like ps mp and pa g was more effective than ps g resin for pfoa pfhxs and genx which was consistent with the trend for pfos resin properties that showed decreasing capacity for pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos were ps g bifunctional ps mp type i triethyl ps g type i zaggia et al 2016 although the identity of the bifunctional functional group is not known it appears to play an important role enhancing the selectivity of sb aer for pfas considering resin properties that are selective for short and long chain pfcas and pfsas a ps mp type i triethyl resin exhibited greater removal of pfba pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos than a pa mp type i resin del moral et al 2020 the low selectivity of pa mp resin for pfaas was observed for pfas concentrations of 300 650 µg l del moral et al 2020 which is lower than the concentrations used in other adsorption studies comparing resin properties 4 impact of water chemistry conditions 4 1 ph most research shows that pfas adsorption to aer is not strongly impacted by ph strong base aers are not influenced by ph so the impact of changing ph is on the speciation of pfas and subsequent interaction with aer adsorption of pfoa pfhxs pfos and genx all with pka 1 itrc 2020b to sb aer have been studied at varying ph pfoa adsorption to sb aer shows the most variable trends with ph for example greater adsorption to polystyrene resin at ph 3 vs ph 7 yu et al 2009 no impact on adsorption to polyacrylic resin between ph 5 10 and lower adsorption at ph 3 and 11 yang et al 2018 and decreased adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 dixit et al 2019 the higher pfoa adsorption at lower ph e g 3 could be explained by physisorption of protonated pfoa i e neutral form to polystyrene resin considering there are varying reports on the pka of pfoa itrc 2020b the dramatic decrease in pfoa adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 was not clearly explained most studies show no impact of changing ph on pfos adsorption to polystyrene and polyacrylic resins deng et al 2010 maimaiti et al 2018 yu et al 2009 which is consistent with the strong acid properties of the sulfonic acid head group of pfos one study however did show significant decrease in pfos adsorption to polyacrylic resin above ph 8 dixit et al 2019 the reason for this was not clear but could be due to increasing competition by carbonate and hydroxide ions only one study has evaluated pfhxs adsorption at varying ph and showed no impact at ph 6 vs 9 for polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 genx shows different adsorption behavior for different resin composition with constant adsorption to polystyrene resin over ph 4 10 and lower adsorption at ph 2 wang et al 2019 and decreasing adsorption to polyacrylic resin over ph 4 10 dixit et al 2020a the reason for which was not clear the impact of ph on adsorption of short chain pfcas and pfsas and non pfaas with the exception genx by sb aers has not been explored 4 2 inorganic ions aers are known to have high selectivity for sulfate chromate and other inorganic anions hu et al 2016 a few studies have evaluated the impact of competing inorganic anions on pfos pfhxs and pfoa adsorption by sb aer for example at 0 4 mmol l pfos increasing sulfate concentration to 1 mmol l had minimal impact on pfos adsorption to polyacrylic resin and increasing chromate concentration to 2 mmol l resulted in only moderate decrease in pfos adsorption to the same resin deng et al 2010 in another study using 0 5 mmol l pfhxs increasing sulfate nitrate bicarbonate and phosphate to 50 mmol l reduced pfhxs adsorption to polystyrene resin by 10 and very high nacl concentration 1000 mmol l decreased pfhxs adsorption to the same resin by approx 30 maimaiti et al 2018 the presence of sulfate and carbonate reduced pfoa uptake by polyacrylic resin yang et al 2018 the minimal impact of competing inorganic anions on pfhxs and pfos removal by aers supports the importance of non electrostatic interactions such as physisorption and molecular aggregation in addition to electrostatic interactions sulfate was more competitive with pfoa than pfhxs or pfos which is consistent with the sulfonic acid head group having stronger electrostatic interactions with the resin compared with carboxylic acid head group the impact of competing inorganic anions on short chain pfsas and pfcas and non pfaas by aers has not been explored but it is anticipated that the effects will be more pronounced than those observed here for instance since electrostatic interactions govern pfba removal i e pfba adsorbed chloride released 1 increasing the concentration of competing inorganic anions would be expected to decrease pfba removal 4 3 natural organic matter nom aers are used for removal of nom measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in water treatment bazri et al 2016 graf et al 2014 so the impact of doc on pfas removal by aers is an important topic as background nom interacts with polystyrene and polyacrylic sb aer through electrostatic interactions with stoichiometric release of chloride from the resin boyer and singer 2008 and doc removal by sb aer increases as the charge density molecular weight or aromatic carbon content of the nom increases boyer et al 2008 hence hydrophobic interactions contribute to nom removal by sb aer the literature indicates that the presence of doc can reduce pfas removal by sb aer with the extent of impact depending on resin and nom properties and the impact due to competition between nom and pfas for ion exchange sites for example the presence of 2 8 mg l doc decreased removal of pfsas and pfcas by less than 10 percentage points compared with doc free control using polystyrene resin kothawala et al 2017 which is less effective for doc removal than polyacrylic resin for a wide variety of doc sources including suwannee river nom suwannee river humic acid suwannee river fulvic acid and pony lake fulvic acid the presence of 5 mg l doc decreased removal of pfoa and pfos by 10 to 50 percentage points compared with doc free controls using polyacrylic resin dixit et al 2019 which also exhibited high removal of doc the presence of suwannee river humic acid caused the greatest reduction in pfas removal while the presence of pony lake fulvic acid caused the least reduction in pfas removal dixit et al 2019 where the extent of impact was directly related to the molecular weight and aromatic carbon content of the nom commercial humic acid reduced the adsorption of pfhxs to polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 and pfoa to polyacrylic resin yang et al 2018 using polyacrylic resin increasing doc concentration and or molecular weight of nom decreased the bed volumes to breakthrough for pfba pfoa pfbs and genx dixit et al 2020b and reduced adsorption of genx pfmoba and pfmopra dixit et al 2020a pfas removal by aers was equal to or greater than doc removal on a percentage basis dixit et al 2019 kothawala et al 2017 del moral et al 2020 evaluated pfas removal by ps mp type i triethyl and pa mp type i in the absence and presence of suwannee river nom polystyrene resin removed more pfas than polyacrylic resin whereas the polyacrylic resin removed more doc than the polystyrene resin del moral et al 2020 for both resins the addition of 9 mg l doc had only a minor impact on removal of pfcas and pfsas del moral et al 2020 given that polyacrylic resins are known to have higher capacity and selectivity for nom than polystyrene resins bolto et al 2002 boyer and singer 2008 shuang et al 2015 it is reasonable that pfas studies that used polyacrylic resin observed greater adverse impact by nom dixit et al 2019 2020b than pfas studies that used polystyrene resin del moral et al 2020 kothawala et al 2017 in particular the results suggest that pfas removal is reduced by competition with nom and this competition is more pronounced for polyacrylic resins and for nom with high charge density high molecular weight or high aromatic carbon content the studies reviewed here used both nom isolates del moral et al 2020 dixit et al 2019 2020a b maimaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2018 and natural waters as source of nom dixit et al 2019 2020a kothawala et al 2017 and in general showed similar results 4 4 co occurring contaminants pfas impacted groundwater can contain co occurring contaminants such as hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents and surfactants the impact of these has only been investigated in one study the neutral compounds methylbenzene and trichloroethylene had no impact on pfhxs removal by polystyrene resin whereas anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds resulted in significant decrease in pfhxs removal by polystyrene resin maimaiti et al 2018 sds has 12 c tail and organosulfate head group that was able to effectively compete with pfhxs for ion exchange sites 5 continuous flow adsorption table 3 summarizes column breakthrough results for pfas removal from water

the initial pfas concentration increased which is consistent with pfas removal by aers through stoichiometric exchange with finite ion exchange capacity this trend was influenced by test water composition and resin properties with greater bvs to breakthrough for di water and simple water matrices than real waters and greater bvs to breakthrough for polystyrene aer than polyacrylic aer and wb aer regarding short chain pfaas i e pfbs pfba pfpea and pfhxa and polystyrene aer the results suggest greater bvs to breakthrough for gel structure than macroporous structure and proprietary functional groups than traditional type i functional group however more data sets are needed to confirm this trend the results for polyacrylic aer are limited to initial pfas concentration of 10 000 ng l and greater whereas polystyrene aer have data spanning initial pfas concentration of 10 to 10 000 ng l the results compiled in table 3 provide guidance on the expected i e order of magnitude number bvs to breakthrough for different pfas at varying initial concentrations and highlight where there are gaps in the data for example for long chain pfaas bvs to breakthrough was 100 000 and 10 000 for initial pfas concentration of 10 ng l and 10 000 ng l respectively results from bench scale column tests corroborate many of the results from batch adsorption tests most importantly breakthrough of pfcas occurred before breakthrough of pfsas and within pfcas and pfsas breakthrough of short chain compounds occurred before long chain compounds lampert et al 2007 schaefer et al 2019b zeng et al 2020 for example considering equal perfluoroalkyl tail length pfpea breakthrough occurred before pfbs and pfhpa breakthrough occurred before pfhxs schaefer et al 2019b whereas pfna and pfos were both completely removed zeng et al 2020 the general breakthrough trend was analogous to results from batch adsorption tests showing greater removal of pfsas than pfcas and increasing removal with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length maimaiti et al 2018 rapid small scale column tests rsscts which were developed for gac adsorption of trace organic contaminants crittenden et al 1991 were effectively applied to pfas removal by aer schaefer et al 2019b zeng et al 2020 the validity of using rsscts is an important result because it allows continuous flow testing to be conducted in a fraction of the time and using much less water than conventional bench scale column tests as another approach one study used multiple loading jar tests to mimic column adsorption and showed similar bvs to breakthrough for pfba pfoa pfbs pfos and genx dixit et al 2020b which is in contrast to most other batch and continuous flow studies and suggests additional research is needed on the multiple loading jar test procedure finally based on comparison in one contaminated groundwater influent total pfas 7 000 ng l perchlorate selective resin dowex psr 2 had 6 higher pfas loading than pfas selective resin pfa694e at 75 000 bvs zeng et al 2020 the results from pilot scale column tests further support the results from bench scale column tests and batch adsorption tests conte et al 2015 franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 pilot column tests showed that pfsas were removed to a greater extent and treated more bvs to breakthrough than pfcas franke et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 comparing pfas with the same perfluoroalkyl tail length at 10 breakthrough pfca breakthrough was significantly less than pfsa breakthrough e g pfpea 1549 bvs vs pfbs 13368 bvs pfhpa 6980 bvs vs pfhxs 26375 bvs and pfna 12938 bvs vs pfos 62920 bvs mccleaf et al 2017 which clearly highlights the important difference between the carboxylate and sulfonate head groups on electrostatic interactions with aer and corroborates density functional theory calculations that show oxygen with greater negative charge in sulfonate than carboxylate park et al 2020 removal of pfcas and pfsas and bvs to breakthrough increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length mccleaf et al 2017 which suggests the important role of non electrostatic interactions with polystyrene aer however density functional theory calculations indicate greater overall negative charge with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length park et al 2020 so it is difficult to separate the roles of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions for example 10 breakthrough for fosa was 14278 bvs which was greater than pfna even though fosa is considered a neutral molecule that could only interact with aer through non electrostatic interactions during pilot column tests pfba through pfoa desorbed from the resin due to secondary ion exchange with more favorable pfcas such as pfna through pfteda and pfsas mccleaf et al 2017 removal on a percentage basis of pfcas pfna through pfteda and pfsas was greater than doc removal which was less than 45 mccleaf et al 2017 finally mccleaf et al 2017 suggested that pfas uptake by ps g type i resin transitioned from monolayer coverage to multilayer coverage which is similar to batch adsorption tests showing pfas adsorbed chloride released becoming 1 as the pfas concentration in water increased maimaiti et al 2018 there is one study evaluating the full scale treatment efficiency of pfas removal by aers at two different plants appleman et al 2014 neither plant however was designed with the intention of using aer to remove pfas one plant used a hybrid sb aer ferrix a33e for arsenic removal whereby arsenic adsorbs to iron oxide infused in the ps mp resin and pfas are removed by combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions sampling showed pfsas were removed to a greater extent than pfcas and within each subgroup removal increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl tail length the other ion exchange plant used miex resin for removal of nom miex is a pa mp type i resin with magnetic iron oxide to aid in settling full scale miex treatment showed no removal of pfaas which is in contrast to batch miex study showing 60 removal of long chain pfcas pfbs and pfos park et al 2020 the very limited full scale data suggests that polystyrene aer is more effective than polyacrylic aer for pfas removal 6 adsorption modeling 6 1 kinetic adsorption models the pseudo second order kinetic adsorption model given in equation 1 has been shown to be widely applicable to various solutes and adsorbents ho and mckay 1998 1999 and has been extensively applied to batch kinetic data on pfas uptake by aers see table s2 in appendix a 1 t q t 1 k 2 q c a p 2 t q c a p 2 v 0 k 2 q c a p 2 where qt mmol g is amount adsorbed at time t qcap mmol g is adsorption capacity at equilibrium k2 g mmol h is pseudo second order rate constant t h is time and v0 mmol g h is initial adsorption rate in theory the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained from equation 1 should match the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained from equilibrium isotherm models plazinski et al 2009 one limitation of the pseudo second order model is that the rate constant and hence the initial adsorption rate vary with experimental conditions such as initial solute concentration specifically v0 decreases as the initial solute concentration increases plazinski et al 2009 which explains the higher initial adsorption rate in dixit et al 2021a that used lower initial concentration than other studies nevertheless compiling the initial adsorption rates for pfas removal by aers in table s2 provides a semi quantitative approach to identify potential tends for pfas structure and resin properties on adsorption kinetics results for wb aer are discussed in section 8 in general the initial adsorption rate decreases as pfas chain length increases for pfsas and pfcas this result is consistent with decreasing aqueous diffusivity and increasing molar volume with increasing pfas chain length schaefer et al 2019a and its impact on intraparticle diffusion for pfos the initial adsorption rate was higher for polyacrylic resin ira958 than polystyrene resins ira400 ira410 ira900 ira910 for pfoa and pfos the initial adsorption rate was higher for macroporous resins ira910 ira958 than gel resins ira400 ira410 these trends for resin properties are also consistent with hindered intraparticle diffusion the initial adsorption rate for genx pfmoba and pfmopra was similar to pfba and pfbs for pa mp type i resin which is consistent with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule 6 2 adsorption isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models have been applied to numerous combinations of solute and adsorbent including pfas and aers see table s3 in appendix a although the assumptions for the langmuir isotherm model including monolayer coverage and homogeneous adsorption site energy are more consistent with ion exchange the freundlich model was included for completeness the langmuir isotherm model is defined as 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qe mmol g is amount of solute adsorbed at equilibrium qmax mmol g is maximum saturated monolayer adsorption capacity kl l mmol is constant related to affinity between adsorbent and solute and ce mmol l is solute concentration in solution at equilibrium the freundlich isotherm model is defined as 4 q e k f c e 1 n where qe and ce are as defined above and kf and n are empirical constants related to adsorption capacity and selectivity respectively table s3 compiles isotherm conditions and maximum adsorption capacity qmax for the langmuir isotherm model and or solid phase loading qe at maximum aqueous concentration ce for the freundlich isotherm model note the two different approaches commonly employed to conduct isotherm tests constant mass of adsorbent while varying solute concentration vs constant concentration of solute while varying mass of adsorbent can give different results millar et al 2015 in particular the constant mass approach is susceptible for giving different estimates of adsorption capacity in addition since the constant concentration approach typically uses high pfas concentrations the adsorption results are possibly subject to artifacts from the effects of molecular aggregation finally no adsorbent controls are important for assessing adsorption behavior due to air water interfacial losses particularly for pfos in batch conditions but rarely mentioned despite the various limitations of comparing adsorption capacity values from different studies and different models it is informative to compile the data and identify possible trends most of the adsorption isotherm results compiled in table s3 qualitatively conform to the shape of the langmuir isotherm exhibiting a plateau in adsorption capacity deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 yu et al 2009 which is consistent with aers having finite chloride exchange capacity an exception to this trend was pfos uptake by pa mp type i resin that did not show saturation in adsorption capacity schuricht et al 2017 which was attributed to micelle formation within the resin pore water the langmuir qmax and freundlich qe values in table s3 can be viewed relative to the chloride exchange capacity of aers which range from 2 0 to 5 6 mmol g depending on resin properties deng et al 2010 maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 in general wb aers have higher chloride exchange capacity than sb aers because tertiary amine functional groups are smaller than quaternary ammonium groups and hence more ion exchange sites can be accommodated in the resin likewise sb aers with large functional groups e g type i triaklyamine with carbon chain length 2 have some of the lowest chloride exchange capacity in table s3 there are cases where langmuir qmax or freundlich qe is near or even greater than the chloride exchange capacity of aers specifically this occurs for high initial concentration of pfas up to 1000 mg l and macroporous aers and suggests the potential for multilayer adsorption as a corollary for low initial concentration and or gel aers qmax or qe can be 10 of the chloride exchange capacity of the resin the langmuir and freundlich adsorption values did not show a trend for pfas structure e g perfluoroalkyl tail length head group due to the influence of initial pfas concentration and aer properties 6 3 modeling column adsorption different modeling approaches have been explored to predict pfas breakthrough curves for fixed bed aer treatment while these models vary in complexity and required parameters they are useful for predicting how changes in operating parameters e g flow rate influent concentration impact treatment and for extrapolating testing results to approximate aer longevity certain models rely on experimental data and ion exchange theory to predict breakthrough times for pfas using assumptions of equilibrium and rapid exchange as is typically the case in aqueous inorganic ion exchange systems one such approach utilized the equilibrium multicomponent chromatography theory emct to predict breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in columns of aer which yielded reasonable predictions of mean breakthrough times lampert et al 2007 however while the mean breakthrough time was reasonably predicted the emct model failed to capture the overall pfas breakthrough trend thus limiting its ability to predict early i e 10 breakthrough of pfos and pfoa in contrast to this equilibrium model pfas breakthrough in aer columns has been well characterized by the yoon nelson lin and huang and thomas models all of which assume kinetically limited langmuir adsorption these models contain a rate constant k to reflect the kinetic rate of mass transfer and can be linearized to produce accurate regression equations between effluent concentration and time xu et al 2013 both the yoon nelson and lin and huang models utilize this rate constant k and a characteristic time variable τ time to 50 breakthrough to generate breakthrough curves using only parameters for influent concentration c0 effluent concentration c and time t the yoon nelson model was able to accurately predict pfos breakthrough for five columns of different aers with r2 values ranging from 0 84 0 95 chularueangaksorn et al 2014 the lin and huang model uses the same parameters of the yoon nelson model and has closely predicted breakthrough of numerous pfas in aer columns with r2 values ranging from 0 76 0 91 franke et al 2019 another multisolute study used the lin and huang model to fit two distinct stages of aer adsorption of pfas due to an increase in mass transfer including second stage model r2 values of 0 95 0 99 mccleaf et al 2017 while these models accurately fit observed data their parameters are not resilient to changes in site characteristics like empty bed contact time ebct and bed size thus have limited utility for predicting treatment performance the thomas model is more complex and can account for these changes by including in addition to a kinetic term variables for resin mass adsorption capacity at a given solute concentration and ebct the thomas model accurately predicted breakthrough of pfas in multiple rsscts containing different types of aer at multiple concentrations and resin particle sizes with r2 values between 0 96 0 98 for certain resins schaefer et al 2019b results from this study support the dominance of intraparticle diffusion and resin capacity in determining the extent of pfas adsorption to aers and indicate that the thomas model can be accurately scaled from rsscts to larger conditions by accounting for particle surface area therefore the additional complexity of these kinetically limited models has led to more accurate predictions of pfas breakthrough that in some cases can be applied across a range of operational conditions however it remains unclear how both the kinetic constants and adsorption capacity terms used in the thomas and other kinetic models relate to the kinetic and adsorption capacity parameters obtained in batch aer studies 6 4 comparison of batch and continuous flow adsorption capacity pfas adsorption to aers has been shown to exhibit nonlinear isotherm behavior typically langmuir or freundlich based on batch studies using pfas concentration range of 1 1 000 mg l however continuous flow studies have been conducted using pfas concentration range of 10 10 000 ng l mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019b woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 therefore pfas adsorption to aer in continuous flow studies is linearly correlated in the lower concentration range i e ng l to µg l for example comparison of pfas adsorption to aers in raw water and membrane concentrate illustrates the linear behavior of pfas adsorption where increasing the pfas concentration by 2 to 5 times depending on pfas resulted in 4 times higher pfas loading on resin franke et al 2019 furthermore the low concentration range of the adsorption isotherm is typically extrapolated from high concentration range mg l to g l batch data which likely overestimates the adsorption capacity several studies have shown less favorable isotherms for pfas adsorption to aers in particular the s sigmoidal shaped isotherm where adsorption is low at low concentrations and becomes higher as concentration increases alberti et al 2012 for example pfbs exhibited an s sigmoidal shaped isotherm at mg l concentrations carter and farrell 2010 while pfoa pfos genx pfmopra and pfmoba exhibited s sigmoidal shaped isotherms at µg l concentrations dixit et al 2019 2020a schuricht et al 2017 pfas adsorption to aers in continuous flow studies could be occurring in the unfavorable region of an s sigmoidal shaped adsorption isotherm as a caveat on adsorption at low solute concentrations the adsorption isotherm discussion is based on regenerable sb aers carter and farrell 2010 dixit et al 2019 schuricht et al 2017 not pfas selective resins where higher adsorption capacity is expected dixit et al 2021a zaggia et al 2016 7 resin disposal and regeneration 7 1 disposal of non regenerable pfas selective resin aers can be used without regeneration and incinerated once its adsorption capacity for pfas is reached for example ps g bifunctional resin a532e was considered non regenerable zaggia et al 2016 and would need to be incinerated following single use application typical conditions for municipal waste incinerators are 1000 c and 2 s residence time taylor et al 2014 which research shows leads to the chemical breakdown of pfoa krusic et al 2005 pfos khan et al 2020 and other pfas and associated wastes taylor et al 2014 tsang et al 1998 yamada et al 2005 for example a recent study showed that the pfas content of ash leachates decreased with increasing incineration temperature between 760 980 c implying more complete pfas breakdown at higher temperatures solo gabriele et al 2020 however gaseous perfluorocarbon emissions are still a concern usepa 2019 research on incineration of polystyrene sb aer showed the resin followed a shrinking particle model with no solid product and optimum temperature of 650 c kinoshita et al 1991 there was no difference in the reaction rate of decomposition for hydroxide vs chloride form aer in another study on incineration of polystyrene sb aer degradation was nearly complete at 800 c dubois et al 1995 with volatile products having a molecular weight of 44 g mol carbon dioxide nitrous oxide finally pyrolysis of polystyrene and polyacrylic wb aers showed higher thermal stability for polystyrene resin zhang and qian 2014 there is no published study that evaluates incineration of pfas loaded aer to investigate thermal behavior and volatile products 7 2 regeneration efficiency of regenerable resin although most of the aers studied for pfas removal are regenerable regeneration is less studied compared with removal capacity and selectivity among regeneration studies most evaluate batch regeneration and only a few studies have investigated column mode regeneration or discussed disposal options for waste regeneration solution table 4 summarizes all regeneration studies involving aer and pfas and is organized showing pfas aer combinations regeneration solution composition regeneration efficiency and experiment type regeneration time is not included because of its secondary importance compared with regeneration solution composition and concentration chularueangaksorn et al 2013 this section is confined to regeneration results for sb aer while wb aer is discussed in the next section the regeneration solution composition is listed for salt base solvent salt base salt solvent base solvent in order of increasing concentration the key result from table 4 is that for most combinations of pfas and aer effective desorption is only achieved for regeneration solutions that combined salt or alkaline aqueous solution with organic co solvent hereafter salt organic co solvent or base organic co solvent the salt or base is not always clearly defined in terms of whether the concentration applies to the aqueous solution fraction only or to the total water co solvent solution the solvent is consistently reported as v v for the total water co solvent solution aers are typically regenerated using salt and or alkaline aqueous solution to desorb inorganic anions and nom hu and boyer 2018 maul et al 2014 however many studies that have investigated pfas desorption from aers using salt nacl kcl nh4cl or alkaline naoh koh nh4oh aqueous solution concentration range 1 5 show negligible desorption of pfas for example there was negligible pfos desorption from pa g type i resin carter and farrell 2010 and pa mp type i resin deng et al 2010 using nacl or naoh there was also negligible pfos desorption from ps g type i and ps g type ii resins using nacl kcl naoh and koh chularueangaksorn et al 2013 zaggia et al 2016 the previous studies also showed negligible desorption of pfba pfoa and pfbs albeit with limited data carter and farrell 2010 zaggia et al 2016 a few studies however have shown pfas desorption using nacl or naoh for example 90 desorption of pfba pfoa pfbs pfos and genx from ps mp type i resin using 10 nacl dixit et al 2020b and 80 desorption of genx from ps g type i resin using 0 5 nacl wang et al 2019 for comparison two studies used the same resin type pa mp type i from different manufacturers and showed very different pfos regeneration efficiency using 5 nacl negligible desorption deng et al 2010 vs 60 desorption dixit et al 2020b key differences between the studies included the presence of nom and lower initial pfas concentration dixit et al 2020b which resulted in 90 of the ion exchange sites being occupied by nom and only 1 2 of the sites being occupied by pfos therefore it is possible that desorption of nom aided the desorption of pfas dixit et al 2018 neale et al 2010 the effective desorption of genx from both pa and ps resins using nacl implies that genx adsorption to aer is based on electrostatic interactions given that most studies show minimal desorption of pfas from sb aer using salt or alkaline aqueous solutions researchers that show contrary results should support their findings with appropriate controls and theoretical explanations methanol alone was not effective in desorbing pfos from aers chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 which indicates the importance of electrostatic interactions the most consistent regeneration results have been achieved using a combination of salt aqueous solution and methanol e g nacl methanol or alkaline aqueous solution and methanol e g naoh methanol with increasing desorption of pfas with increasing methanol content chularueangaksorn et al 2013 deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 for example for polyacrylic resin 1 nacl 50 methanol achieved 70 pfos desorption and increasing the methanol fraction to 70 increased pfos desorption to 90 deng et al 2010 for polystyrene resin 70 methanol in nacl or naoh achieved nearly 100 pfos desorption chularueangaksorn et al 2013 an interesting regeneration result is the effectiveness of dilute aqueous only solutions of salt and base specifically 0 5 nh4cl 0 5 nh4oh and to a lesser extent 0 5 kcl 0 5 koh to desorb 50 to 80 of pfba pfoa pfbs and pfos from two different polystyrene resins zaggia et al 2016 reasons mentioned for the effectiveness of combined salt and base regeneration include that pfas are more soluble in dilute salt solution e g 0 5 than typical salt regeneration solutions 5 10 and that the presence of ammonium or potassium co ion in the regeneration solution enhances the solubility of pfas through ion pair formation however another study showed increasing pfas desorption with increasing nacl concentration up to 20 dixit et al 2020b so the higher regeneration efficiency of dilute salt solution is not clear 8 weak base anion exchange resin key studies on pfas removal by wb aers focus on pa g tertiary amine resin ira67 and ps mp tertiary amine resin ira96 for pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs pfos f 53b and genx deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yao et al 2014 the ira67 and ira96 products names are used in this section since they were the main wb aers evaluated the dissociation constants for the protonated forms of ira67 and ira96 were determined to be logka 9 0 and logka 6 4 respectively miyazaki and nakai 2011 meaning ira67 should be mostly protonated and act like a sb aer up to ph 9 0 whereas ira96 should be mostly protonated up to ph 6 4 the order of increasing initial pseudo second order adsorption rate was pfhpa genx pfhxa pfos pfoa f 53b on ira67 and ira96 ira67 for pfoa see table s2 the more hydrophilic properties of polyacrylic resin relative to polystyrene resin shuang et al 2015 likely contributed to the higher initial adsorption rate and increased mass transfer observed for ira67 over ira96 the order of increasing adsorption capacity based on capacity constants from pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models was pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs genx f 53b pfos on ira67 and ira96 ira67 for pfhxs and pfos see tables s2 and s3 the trend shows increasing adsorption capacity with increasing number of perfluorinated carbons and sulfonate head group over carboxylate head group f 53b and pfos were compared in the same study whereas the comparison of genx with other pfas was made across studies so introduces uncertainty the ratio of pfas adsorbed chloride released for ira67 increased from 1 to 1 2 as the concentration of pfos and f 53b increased up to 0 4 mmol l deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 due to the hydrophilic properties of polyacrylic resin this suggests the possibility of excess pfas adsorption was by molecular aggregation e g admicelle or micelle formation pfos and f 53b adsorption to ira67 decreased substantially above ph 10 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 and pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and genx adsorption to ira67 decreased as ph increased over the range 2 9 du et al 2015 wang et al 2019 all of which is consistent with weak base chemistry of the resin adsorption of pfos and f 53b to ira67 decreased with increasing sulfate and chromate concentration deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 likewise the presence of sulfate decreased adsorption of pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa to ira67 while the presence of chloride or nitrate did not have an effect du et al 2015 genx adsorption to ira67 resin was substantially decreased in bi solute solution containing genx and pfoa indicating more selective adsorption of pfoa the results on competitive ion exchange are consistent with the pfas stoichiometry results showing electrostatic interactions to be the predominant mechanism and non electrostatic interactions contributing to adsorption selectivity the ph dependence of wb aer functional groups results in different regeneration chemistry than sb aers with higher regeneration efficiency for pfas see table 4 regeneration solutions consisting of nacl methanol or ethanol naoh methanol and naoh aqueous solution were able to desorb pfhxa pfhpa pfoa genx f 53b and pfos from ira67 deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 nacl methanol solution required at least 50 methanol to desorb greater than 80 pfos and f 53b whereas naoh with reduced methanol content i e 30 methanol showed similar desorption of pfos and f 53b deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 using ira67 a 0 04 naoh aqueous solution was able to desorb 50 of pfos deng et al 2010 and 80 pfhpa and pfoa du et al 2015 and a 0 5 naoh aqueous solution was able to desorb 90 genx desorption of pfcas from ira67 increased as follows pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and was similar for 0 04 naoh 1 nacl 70 methanol and 1 nacl 70 ethanol du et al 2015 this trend is counterintuitive given that pfhxa has weaker interactions with aer than pfoa hence one would expect pfhxa to show the highest desorption genx showed 90 desorption using 0 5 naoh or 0 5 nacl indicating that its interactions with wb aer is predominantly through electrostatic interactions the regeneration results show that at high ph the tertiary amine functional group of weak base resin deprotonates rendering the functional group neutral and thereby eliminating electrostatic interactions between pfas head group and resin functional group in addition the polyacrylic resin has weaker non electrostatic van der waals interactions with perfluoroalkyl tail than polystyrene resin hence the effective desorption an important caveat for pfas like pfos and f 53b is that the regeneration solution needs to have low ionic strength e g 0 04 naoh because of low pfas solubility at high ionic strength finally wb aer have not been studied for removal or regeneration efficiency for pfcas shorter than pfhxa or pfsas shorter than pfos however genx has been studied hence regeneration studies using short chain pfaas and other non pfaa pfas would fill key gap in the literature 9 conclusions and future research needs table 5 shows the extent of research that has been completed on pfas removal by aers the table illustrates that there are many aspects of pfas removal by aers with little or no research especially for short chain pfcas and pfsas and pfas beyond pfaas some topics like impact of organic co contaminants has not been studied for any pfas the conclusions listed below are based on the literature available future research needs are provided and prioritized to aid researchers and those engaged with pfas remediation 9 1 conclusions pfas removal by aers follows ion exchange stoichiometry and is influenced by pfas structure and resin properties which manifests itself as a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic van der waals hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions between solute and resin dominate for short chain pfcas and pfecas e g genx which results in short chain pfcas being displaced by long chain pfcas and short and long chain pfsas short chain pfsas exhibit stronger electrostatic interactions with aers than short chain pfcas non electrostatic interactions appear to be enhanced for long chain pfas and polystyrene resin composition including neutral pfas such as fasa e g fosa and include both solute resin physisorption and solute solute molecular aggregation interactions solute solute interactions are believed to occur within hydrophilic polyacrylic resin at high concentrations mg l to g l of long chain pfas polystyrene gel resin exhibits the greatest resistance to mass transfer while polyacrylic macroporous resin exhibits the least resistance to mass transfer in addition mass transfer limitations are greater for long chain pfas than short chain analogs at high pfas concentrations mg l to g l the capacity of aers for pfas equals the chloride exchange capacity of the resin the adsorption behavior at high pfas concentrations mostly conforms to the langmuir isotherm model showing saturation capacity however in some case the freundlich isotherm model shows a better fit as pfas concentration decreases pfas loading on aer decreases following the linear region of the isotherm there is some evidence to suggest that at ng l to µg l concentrations pfas adsorption to aers follows an s sigmoidal shaped isotherm that contributes to low adsorption capacity at low pfas concentrations batch and continuous flow adsorption experiments agree on aer selectivity for pfas with the general order of increasing selectivity as pfba pfhxa genx pfbs pfoa pfhxs fosa pfos in general water composition has a minor impact on pfas removal by aer ph and the presence of inorganic anions results in minor change in pfas removal by sb aer and slightly greater impact of wb aer the presence of nom can reduce pfas removal by aer with greater impact of high molecular weight nom such as humic acid and polyacrylic resin pfas can be desorbed from aers using salt aqueous solution with organic cosolvent typically methanol a higher fraction of cosolvent 70 is required for polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin due to enhanced non electrostatic interactions between pfas and polystyrene resin a few studies have shown that aqueous only regeneration solution salt alone or salt base can desorb pfas from sb aers however the mechanism is not known it is possible that the pfas desorbed during aqueous only regeneration are from molecular aggregations e g micelles that formed during adsorption under high concentration conditions or associated with nom weak base aers can be effectively regenerated using aqueous only alkaline solution which is consistent with the ph dependent behavior of the resin functional groups finally pfas selective aers that are used in single use mode without regeneration offer a simplified alternative to regenerable aers however there is minimal published research on their performance and especially disposal 9 2 future research needs 1 underlying adsorption science further research is needed to advance understanding of the basic science controlling pfas interactions with ion exchange resins although there are many reports on ion exchange adsorption of pfcas and pfsas much less is known about adsorption of other groups of pfas including short chain fasas perfluoroalkyl ether acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonamido substances dixit et al 2020a wang et al 2020 addressing the wide structural diversity of pfas in these processes would benefit greatly from spectroscopic and theoretical analyses of molecular scale interactions between solutes resins and solvents spectroscopic methods particularly in situ methods like atr ftir can provide insights into important intermolecular forces that contribute to the varying affinity of different pfas for specific resin structures there have been significant advancements in computational methods like density function theory and molecular dynamics that can now be exploited to simulate molecular behavior in multi phase systems and assess how specific molecular changes in either the solute e g pfas fluoroalkyl chain length and degree of fluorination or the sorbent e g change in alkylamine functional group structure or polymer porosity might affect adsorption processes likewise better understanding of these intermolecular interactions will be critical to evaluating the importance of phenomena unique to pfas treatment including potential for micelle hemi micelle and admicelle formation in solutions and potentially within polymer pore spaces current understanding of pfas treatment is guided mostly by empirical observations but a stronger molecular scale understanding can be exploited by polymer scientists to design new resins with desired properties to target specific pfas of concern including short chain and branched pfas that are not strongly adsorbed to current resins this could include bifunctional adsorbents with some sites tailored to select for shorter chain pfas some studies suggest that mass transfer within aer i e intraparticle diffusion may be hindered for some pfas e g long chain or branched structures and some resins e g gel type macroscopic and spectroscopic experimentation coupled with molecular dynamics simulations may be particularly useful for assessing the importance of these processes for controlling observed adsorption behavior 2 resin regeneration and concentrate management although the industry trend is moving towards application of pfas selective resins that are operated in single use non regenerable fashion this move is driven in large part by the complicated processes required for regeneration of current resins loaded with pfas current practices for regeneration of pfas loaded resins involve use of high concentrations of alcohol cosolvent e g 70 methanol together with brines and separate distillation steps are required to recover the cosolvent in addition to the complexity of such systems use of high concentrations of flammable organic solvents necessitates the need to add fire suppression systems for safety thus future research is needed to develop resins and treatment systems that are effective for pfas treatment but also amenable to regeneration using aqueous only regenerants composed of salts that do not present safety or toxicity concerns of their own e g avoid using ammonium based salts dixit et al 2020b wang et al 2019 furthermore legislation currently under consideration that would ban incineration of pfas containing wastes may result in greater need for regenerable resins complementary to the need for improved regeneration strategies and resins is the need to develop effective and efficient technologies for destruction of pfas in the regenerant byproduct streams from ion exchange systems including concentrating the pfas in foam currently such byproduct streams must be shipped off site for landfilling or incineration many technologies are actively being developed for destruction of pfas including electrochemical plasma hydrothermal photochemical photocatalytic thermochemical and catalytic while some promising results are being reported complete destruction and mineralization of the full suite of pfas to exceedingly stringent levels e g 1 ng l a necessary pre requisite for any plans to re use the regenerant streams remains very challenging and requires very high energy expenditures furthermore efforts are needed to ensure that application of the destructive technology does not result in undesirable byproducts e g chlorine byproducts from electrochemical treatment of pfas in chloride containing brines it follows that regenerant brine makeup may be modified to minimize such byproducts e g substituting sulfate based salt brines for chloride based brines 3 life cycle environmental impacts finally with the accumulation of data from ion exchange treatment systems both regenerable and non regenerable there is a need for systems level analyses of the full life cycle costs and environmental impacts of ion exchange and competing technologies like activated carbon adsorption emery et al 2019 only through such analyses that consider the full integrated treatment systems can optimal treatment solutions be identified life cycle cost analyses can explore the trade offs in both capital and operating costs over the lifetime of a treatment system similarly life cycle assessment frameworks have been developed that can more accurately compare the full environmental impacts of competing treatment technologies for example non regenerable ion exchange systems are expected to require the manufacturing transportation and disposal of a greater amount of resin materials than a regenerable ion exchange system over the lifetime of treatment operations but impacts associated with these activities may be more than offset by a reduction in salt and organic co solvent use and management operations e g energy for distillation processes to recover cosolvent one area of research need is better information on inputs and wastes from the manufacturing of different ion exchange resin formulations while much of the necessary information is proprietary research efforts may be able to refine our understanding of the major inputs and wastes from production to incorporate these factors into the larger systems analyses declaration of competing interest the authors

16904,due to the increased availability of high frequency measurements of stream chemistry provided by in situ sensors researchers have gained more access to relationships between stream discharge and constituent concentrations c q relationships at event scales existing studies reveal that event scale c q relationships are mostly non linear and exhibit temporal lags between peaks or troughs of hydrographs and chemographs resulting in apparent hysteresis effects in this paper we summarize and introduce tools and methods in hysteresis analysis especially the history and progresses of metrics to quantify hysteresis patterns in addition this paper provides a typical workflow to conduct event scale hysteresis analysis such as how to obtain the access to high frequency measurements existing methods to delineate storm events approaches to classify and quantify hysteresis patterns possible features properties controlling hysteresis patterns statistical methods to identify features at play and strategies to deliver the inferences from hysteresis analysis lastly we discuss some potential limitations that arise in the workflow and possible future work to address the challenges including the development of advanced quantitative hysteresis metrics generalized and standardized tools to delineate events and the integration of hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling this paper aims to provide a critical overview of technical approaches for hysteresis analysis for researchers and hopefully foster their interests to advance our understanding of complex mechanisms in event scale hydro biogeochemical processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords c q relationship hysteresis high frequency measurements nitrate watersheds statistical analyses 1 introduction the relationships between stream discharge and constituent concentrations c q relationships have been investigated for decades to infer the hydro biogeochemical processes within the watersheds e g baker and richards 2002 langlois et al 2005 williams 1989 recently due to the widespread use of in situ water quality sensors researchers have gained access to high frequency flow and concentration measurements in riverine systems e g blaen et al 2016 ledford and toran 2019 pellerin et al 2014 such high frequency measurements have enabled researchers to generate larger and more datasets focusing on event scale c q relationships i e hysteresis loops bowes et al 2005 to capture the rapidly changing hydrochemical conditions during events and to possibly enhance the understanding of biogeochemical processes associated with storm events blaen et al 2016 pellerin and bergamaschi 2014 generally c q hysteresis loops are caused by temporal lags between peaks or troughs of hydrographs and chemographs lloyd et al 2016a williams et al 2018 these lags can serve as a proxy to open the black box in complex soil and water systems at various temporal scales duncan et al 2017 to reveal controlling processes and mechanisms and thus assist in decision making for example by analyzing the patterns of nitrate hysteresis and flux in an urban watershed in france frazar et al 2019 found that orthophosphate exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis higher concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph and limited orthophosphate in the first flush of urban storms therefore to address the orthophosphate from urbanized areas it was suggested to implement runoff reduction strategies i e enhanced infiltration instead of traditional practices focusing on the first flush despite insightful outputs obtained from hysteresis analysis there is no systematic review or summary of methods and approaches utilized in existing hysteresis analysis studies in following sections we outlined tools and methods to quantify event scale c q relationships and to generate insights from the analyses instead of presenting a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and insights obtained from hysteresis analysis this paper aims to introduce tools and methods in hysteresis analysis to demonstrate a typical workflow from existing literature and to discuss some limitations and gaps of current understandings by providing a critical review regarding the technical approaches for hysteresis analysis the overall goal is to assist researchers in advancing our understanding of complex relationships between stream flow and constituent concentrations 2 a brief history of the development of event scale hysteresis metrics a hydrological event used in this article corresponds to the rapid response in flow rates associated with a generally short lived hydrological event i e rainfall precipitation snowmelt irrigation the flow response to rain is referred to as a hydrograph and is generally characterized by a rapid rise a peak and a slower falling limb fig 1 hydrographs are generally accompanied with non linear changes in the chemical concentration metrics have been developed to describe and quantitatively measure the change in constituent concentrations in response to flow the c q relationship fig 1 interpretation of these c q hysteresis metrics has in turn been used to infer physio chemical processes controlling constituent transport and spatial and temporal dynamics of constituent sources 2 1 metrics to quantify the direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops since the 1990s metrics describing the direction and magnitude of hysteresis effects have evolved several times fig 1 table 1 from qualitative description rose 2003 semi quantitative indices butturini et al 2008 2005 discrete indices that only consider the mid point aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 and integrated indices that consider multiple points in hysteresis loops lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 initially researchers qualitatively described the directions of the hysteresis loops based on their visual observations evans and davies 1998 although qualitative descriptions of hysteresis patterns have generated many insightful findings it has proven difficult to quantitatively compare the magnitude of the hysteresis loops among different storm events depending on qualitative narratives to improve the qualitative description of hysteresis patterns butturini et al 2005 proposed one semiautomatic index δr to quantify the hysteresis loops at the event scales eq a1 this index δr enables researchers to compare the hysteresis patterns of various events bieroza and heathwaite 2015 butturini et al 2008 darwiche criado et al 2015 and even of those from different watersheds butturini et al 2006 feinson et al 2016 moravcová et al 2013 despite the evident improvement of δr compared with qualitative description researchers would have to visually assess and manually assign the direction of each hysteresis loop to the index r in eq a1 involving potential uncertainties when handled by different persons and requiring considerable efforts when dealing with a great number of events these difficulties called for a more general numerical method to better quantify the hysteresis loops to address these difficulties researchers developed quantitative hysteresis metrics based on the discrete points mostly mid points in the hysteresis loops lawler et al 2006 reported a hysteresis index referred as himid which uses the ratio of parameter concentrations on the rising and falling limbs at the mid point of discharge eq a2 a3 aich et al 2014 further improved this hysteresis index denoted as hiaich by normalizing the measurements these hysteresis indices himid and hiaich provide many advantages and benefits including 1 they show the direction sign and magnitude absolute value in one single number 2 they are dimensionless 3 they are straightforward and easy to compute aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 researchers have employed this method to interpret their results of event based hysteresis analysis bowes et al 2015 esteves et al 2019 gao and josefson 2012 lefrançois et al 2007 outram et al 2014 sherriff et al 2016 however several concerns were raised regarding the limitations of the estimation method using mid points of the events for instance the values of himid tended to be skewed at high concentrations additionally these indices himid hiaich did not consider complex hysteresis effects e g figure of eight shapes with the combination of clockwise and anti clockwise loops lloyd et al 2016a lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 within the same event to overcome these shortcomings lawler et al 2006 suggested that the robustness of hysteresis index could be improved by considering multiple points that would then be averaged this improvement had the potential to change hysteresis indices from a discrete metric only considering one single mid point to an integrated metric subsequently researchers proposed integrative hysteresis metrics using the areas of rising and falling limbs langlois et al 2005 zuecco et al 2016 and averaged differences of constituent concentrations on the rising and falling limbs at different increments of discharge lloyd et al 2016b compared with the integrated metric suggested by langlois et al 2005 denoted as hlanglois eq a4 the indices developed by lloyd et al 2016b hilloyd and zuecco et al 2016 h are more robust due to the normalization of discharge rates and constituent concentrations although there exist some differences in calculations e g in calculating differences in concentrations for hilloyd and in areas for h the underlying ideas to quantify hyseresis effects are identical gramlich et al 2018 in addition both metrics exibited many benefits compared to previous metrics including automatic determination of direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops the ability to quantify complex hysteresis shapes ease of interpreting and comparing between events and study sites baker and showers 2019 birkel et al 2017 guarch ribot and butturini 2016 rose et al 2018 tunaley et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 williams et al 2018 therefore we recommend employing either of these two metrics to quantify the hysteretic behavior of event scale c q relationships 2 2 metrics to quantify chemo dynamic status of hysteresis loops in addition to the direction and magnitude of the hysteresis loops there are metrics to describe the chemo dynamic status slope of event scale c q relationships fig 1 c q relationships can characterize the change of constituent concentrations with varying stream flows and can be quantified as the slope b of the c q regression relationship on logarithmic axes bieroza et al 2018 godsey et al 2009 in studies with long term datasets e g decadal scales these researchers generally separate the chemo dynamic conditions into three categories including flushing enriching b 0 1 dilution b 0 1 and chemostatic b 0 1 bieroza et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhi and li 2020 similarly c q hysteresis analysis may also exhibit different chemo dynamic conditions flushing dilution or chemostatic of constituent concentration in the rising limbs to investigate the chemo dynamic status of constituents during storm events butturini et al 2008 proposed an index δc to describe whether the measured parameter is flushed or diluted for a certain event similarly by normalizing the flow rate and constituent concentrations during one event vaughan et al 2017 developed a flushing index fi to quantify the differences between the constituent concentrations at the beginning and peak of the rising limb at the event scale both δc and fi have been employed by researchers to analyze the chemo dynamic behavior for event scale c q relationships from different perspectives aguilera and melack 2018a hamshaw et al 2018 olshansky et al 2018 ramos et al 2015 rose et al 2018 however neither δc or fi are integrated metrics like hilloyd or h to evaluate the overall chemo dynamic conditions of the c q relationship further studies regarding the development of integrated metrics to quantify the chemo dynamic conditions are still needed 2 3 a recommended approach to calculate event scale hysteresis indices step 1 data normalization among all normalization methods lloyd et al 2016b and zuecco et al 2016 suggested the following method eq 1 2 after normalization the raw flow and constituent data were tranfered into the range between 0 and 1 1 q i n o r m q i q m i n q m a x q m i n 2 c i n o r m c i c m i n c m a x c m i n where q i n o r m c i n o r m are normalized flow rates and constituent concentrations for the i th time step respectively q i c i are the original flow rate and constituent concentrations for the i th time step respectively q m i n c m i n are the minimum flow rate and constituent concentration during the event respectively respectively q m a x c m a x are the maximum flow rate and constituent concentration during the event respectively step 2 the metrics to quantify direction and magnitude we recommend two methods to quantify the direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops specificially hilloyd developed by lloyd et al 2016b and h suggested by zuecco et al 2016 hilloyd is calculated by taking the mean of the differences between concentrations at the rising and falling limbs eq 3 if the concentration values were missing at certain segments it is suggested to estimate the missing data by interpolating the concentrations using neighboring segments i e linear interpretation as the flow and concentration data were normalized hilloyd should range from 1 to 1 3 h i lloyd i 1 n c i r i s i n g c i f a l l i n g n where hilloyd is the proposed hysteresis index ci rising ci falling are normalized concentrations at the ith segment for the rising and falling limbs respectively n is the scaling factor to evenly separate the segments of rising or falling limbs of actual measurements and n is recommended to 20 or higher up to 100 to achieve robust results of hysteresis metrics lloyd et al 2016b the second index h is calculated by the sum of differences in the definite integrals for the concentration functions of cr q and cf q for rising and falling limbs over stream flows first for normalized concentration functions cr norm q and cf norm q for two limbs the differences in definite integrals are calculated for a given interval of i j as eq 4 second the sum of definite integrals is the proposed hysteresis index h eq 5 4 δ a i j a r i j a f i j i j c r n o r m q d q i j c f n o r m q d q where δ a i j is the differences between the definite integrals on the rising and falling curves computed for a certain interval a r i j and a f i j are definite integrals calculated by the rising and falling limbs at certain intervals respectively i j are the lower and upper limits of the integration respectively q is the normalized flow data 5 h k 1 n δ a i j where h is the proposed hysteresis index k is the number of intervals used for the calculation n is the number of the overall intervals step 3 the metric to quantify chemo dynamic conditions for the metric to quantify chemo dynamic conditions the flushing index fi developed by vaughan et al 2017 is recommended as c is not normalized after normalizing the flow and concentration data fi is calculated by the differences of constituent concentration at the peak and the beginning of hydrograph eq 6 6 fi c q p e a k r i s i n g c 0 r i s i n g where fi is the flushing index c0 rising c q p e a k r i s i n g are the normalized concentrations at the beginning and peak of the storm event respectively 3 a typical workflow to analyze hysteresis effects at the event scale according to the existing literature we summarized a typical workflow for analyzing event based hysteresis patterns this workflow might include for instance 1 acquisition of high frequency water quality measurements either collected at the field watershed outlets by the researcher or obtained from open access datasets section 2 1 table 2 2 identification of events to generate event scale hydrographs and chemographs and then the visualization of the hysteresis loops section 2 2 3 quantification and classification of hysteresis patterns using hysteresis metrics e g hi fi 4 estimation of features for individual events including hydrological properties biogeochemical properties antecedent conditions watershed characters and or human activities section 2 4 5 statistical analysis of controls of hysteresis patterns among the event properties section 2 5 6 making the inferences based on identified controls background knowledge regarding hydro biochemical processes and or meta analysis of existing publications section 2 6 3 1 obtaining access to high frequency water quality datasets access to high frequency water quality measurements has been severely restricted in the past because these involved manual or automatic sampling of water later analyzed in the laboratory a method which had many limitations including funding labor and efforts harmel et al 2018 liu et al 2020a pellerin et al 2016 even though mechanical autosamplers are able to collect time or flow proportional water samples such samples are mostly left in the field for a certain period before being analyzed in the lab which can lead to bias in the data harmel et al 2006 vaughan et al 2017 thanks to the development since the 1990s and widespread implementation since the late 2000s of in situ water quality sensors high frequency water quality datasets have become more available and have drawn higher attention blaen et al 2016 the number of publications using high frequency measurements in riverine systems has dramatically increased from 35 in 2000 to 232 in 2020 fig 3 among the publications many critical reviews introduced different types of in situ water quality sensors and provided practical suggestions to conduct continuous measurements for stream chemistry blaen et al 2016 pellerin et al 2016 2014 it is important for potential researchers to select the most appropriate in situ sensors aligned with the setting s of their study site s in addition to field measurements researchers can also take advantage of open access datasets with high frequency water quality measurements provided by the government and or research teams table 2 united states geological survey usgs has been continuously collecting high frequency measurements in selected gauge stations since 2000s pellerin et al 2014 e g nitrate levels recorded at the interval of 15 min in usgs 05482300 since 2008 https waterdata usgs gov usa nwis uv

research focused on c q relationships at the event scale hansen and singh 2018 williams et al 2018 in addition to datasets collected by government agencies research teams may also share their dataset to help advance our understanding of nutrient dynamics in streams for example bernhardt et al 2018 and project members contributed their field measurements into the streampulse project to compile high frequency datasets focusing on the metabolic regimes of streams from monitoring sites in the u s appling et al 2018 many stations from streampulse equipped with high frequency discharge and nutrients concentrations enable researchers to investigate event scale c q relationships http pulseofstreams weebly com accessed on may 6th 2021 3 2 methods to delineate storm events event delineation involves the identification of the start and the end of an event hysteresis indices appear not to be sensitive to the exact timing of the end of an event but are sensitive to the choice of the beginning points vaughan et al 2017 many researchers treat an abrupt increase of discharge as the indicator of the beginning of an event table 3 lloyd et al 2016a tunaley et al 2017 for example bowes et al 2015 selected 60 increase 40 in dry seasons in flow as the criterion for the start of storm events lin 2017 picked storm events with at least 40 increase in stream flow in addition to the criteria of abrupt increases other researchers first partition the flow into baseflow and quick direct flow using hydrograph separation approaches and then define the beginning point of an event as the appearance or minimal rise of the quick direct flow outram et al 2016 hydrograph separation methods which have been considerably investigated by hydrologists mei and anagnostou 2015 offer a more objective way to detect events start and end hydrograph separation methods used in hysteresis analyses include the constant slope method macrae et al 2010 recursive digital filtering blanco et al 2010 jeong et al 2012 and rainfall as an indicator aubert et al 2013 as c q hysteresis effects can be rapidly changing during storm events the resolution and coverage of constituent measurements may also affect the event delineation zuecco et al 2016 if there are inadequate constituent measurements to capture the changes within events due to either equipment malfunctioning lin 2017 or insufficient measurement frequency such inadequate measurements may involve uncertainties in the results of event delineation vaughan et al 2017 specifically although the measuring frequency is not an urgent issue for existing high frequency measurements up to five minutes using in situ sensors blaen et al 2016 it is important to conduct further studies focusing on the threshold sampling frequency for different watersheds such knowledge will promote the hysteresis analysis in riverine systems by balancing the cost and benefits to increase sampling frequencies burns et al 2019 despite the success in event delineation for existing studies baseflow separation using different methods can impact the results of event delineation and thus propagate uncertainties in hysteresis analysis by evaluating the performances in baseflow separation by different methods in a lowland catchment in holland gonzales et al 2009 reported that tracer based methods were the most accurate methods in describing the groundwater contribution to stream discharge mostly baseflow however the requirement of intensive efforts and funding restricts the long term application of tracer based methods in many places furthermore using tracer based models as the benchmark gonzales et al 2009 found out that process based methods such as rating curve methods performed better than other non tracer based methods furthermore the recursive filtering method is reliable after calibrating the parameters to address the potential uncertainties involved in event delineation evaluation of the impacts of different separation techniques on hysteresis quantification is an interesting subject for future research 3 3 methods to classify and quantify hysteresis patterns following the hydrograph separation in stream discharge researchers have tried to classify hysteresis types with end member mixing analysis emma assuming that constituent concentrations would be constant for certain water sources e g baseflow vs event flow for two component models or baseflow event flow soil water flow for three component models hysteresis effects can be explained by the mixing of different flow components during storm events based on the ranking of constituent concentrations in different sources evans and davies 1998 proposed six types of hysteresis loops with different rotational directions curvatures and trends using end member analysis and proposed hysteresis types the authors were able to classify the events with different hydrochemical relations and thus revealed the runoff generation processes in these streams chanat et al 2002 further tested the variability of this end member analysis and concluded that in addition to the mixing assumptions field hydrological variability along with hysteresis loops inferred how flow components i e event water soil water and groundwater generate the hydro chemical responses to rainfall events in small catchments rose 2003 investigated c q relationships in both an urbanized and a less urbanized watershed for nine chemicals and classified the chemical parameters based on the end member analysis models this classification offered a chance to identify the sources of components and to contrast the differences between the urbanized watershed and the control watershed after identifying the source and transfer pathway of chemicals by interpreting the impacting points in the recessive curves using hydrograph separation and end member analysis loadograph regression analysis lra can also be a potential supplement to extend the research scope of hysteresis analysis fenton et al 2017 mellander et al 2012 first current hysteresis metrics are analyzed by the differences in rising and falling limbs hysteresis indices or only from rising limbs flushing index or δ c for storm events as the regression patterns in the falling limbs can infer much valuable information including metabolism in riverine systems bowes et al 2015 complex activation zones sources and transport pathways for chemicals in rivers blaen et al 2016 various contributing sources and flow components in watersheds with different managing practices mellander et al 2012 and or evaluating the potential performances for different management strategies husic et al 2020 in addition lra is conducted based on the products of event delineation hydrograph separation constant slope method in mellander et al 2012 and end member analysis which can be seemly embedded in the workflow of hysteresis analysis outlined in section 2 2 and this section although end member analysis are useful to identify patterns of hysteresis it is difficult for researchers to compare the hysteresis patterns among different events and or watersheds hysteresis metrics reviewed in section 1 e g hi and fi can be used to quantitatively classify the hysteresis patterns vaughan et al 2017 to combine the metrics of quantifying both hysteresis loops and chemo dynamic status butturini et al 2008 provided a schematic 2 dimentional presentation diagram to reveal the diversity continuum for different types of hysteresis loops fig 2 in butturini et al 2008 this type of plot is informative straightforward and easy to understand as a result this has become a popular way to demonstrate hysteresis patterns aguilera and melack 2018a darwiche criado et al 2015 kämäri et al 2018 liu et al 2020b strohmeier et al 2013 with the increased number of storm events analyzed in recent studies e g 365 events in baker and showers 2019 400 events in aguilera and melack 2018a 600 events in hamshaw et al 2018 more advanced methods are required to automatically classify storm events by their hysteresis patterns hamshaw et al 2018 trained and tested a supervised machine learning algorithm restricted boltzmann machine rbm to automate the classification of hysteresis plots after fine tuning the numbers of nodes and batch size the rbm was able to classify 77 of the hysteresis effects for the training dataset and 53 of the testing dataset specifically only 8 of the events were classified with an incorrect direction considering the benefits of the automated algorithm in saving time efforts high accessibility from open source programing languages and the lowering of uncertainties in classification brought by individuals hamshaw et al 2018 machine learning approaches are promising in the automatic classification of hysteresis patterns 3 4 summarized explanatory variables that could affect hysteresis patterns once event scale hysteresis metrics are calculated the focus becomes unveiling the potential mechanisms and processes that control the dynamics of hysteresis patterns such mechanisms and processes at play are represented and quantified by potential explanatory variables that may explain the variability of hysteresis metrics response variables fovet et al 2018 to better explore the variability it is advised to collect as many available explanatory variables as possible the more explanatory variables included for the coming statistical analysis the higher chance to capture critical explanatory variables affecting the hysteresis patterns such potential explanatory variables can be roughly separated into two categories watersheds characteristics and event scale hydro biogeochemical properties potential watersheds characteristics include land use slope soil types etc aguilera and melack 2018a examined hysteresis patterns from upland streams with different land use stream orders and watershed elevations in coastal california usa their results showed that the responses of nitrate hysteresis in nested catchments were affected by watershed elevations and land use types in addition to watershed characteristics the same researchers also found that hysteresis patterns can be highly influenced by the event scale properties ranging from hydrological biogeochemical and antecedent conditions in this section we summarize widely used potential properties reported by existing studies for each potential property we presented their denotations units descriptions and necessary equations in table 4 although we presented a comprehensive table of suggested event scale properties table 4 this list is still open it is possible and reasonable to add or remove certain properties according to specific studies for example if the site does not include a local rain gage all the properties regarding precipitation may be removed on the contrary bieroza and heathwaite 2015 included the information of ph or dissolved oxygen do to explain the potential hysteresis patterns of nitrate as nitrate dynamics could be altered at different levels of ph and or do 3 5 statistical methods to correlate hysteresis patterns and controlling properties multivariate analysis methods have been widely used to identify potential properties explanatory variables listed in table 4 at play on event scale hysteresis patterns response variables among the common statistical approaches listed in table 5 principal component analysis pca correlation and regression analysis gained more attention pca or similar methods have mostly been used to quantify the variations of response variables explained by linear combinations of explanatory variables and sometimes to reduce the dimensions of explanatory variables for further possible analysis methods many researchers have employed pca to elucidate which factor s could potentially impact the hysteresis patterns in their study site s aguilera and melack 2018a bhurtun et al 2019 keesstra et al 2019 despite the valuable insights obtained using pca attentions are needed to employ pca in the hysteresis analysis first due to the assumption of linear combinations in explanatory variables pca method may not be capable of capturing the non linear but correlated relationships among variables in addition when aggregating the explanatory variables into linear combinations sometimes the aggregation increases the difficulties to interpret the results for correlation analysis methods pearson s correlation has been utilized table 5 however as it was found that the hysteresis metrics often did not meet the normality assumption of pearson s correlations a non parametric method the spearman s rank correlation has become an alternative for pearson s correlation liu et al 2020b williams et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 for either pearson s or spearman s correlation correlation analysis methods have become attractive for two main reasons first explanatory variables with significantly strong correlation generally indicated that such explanatory variables played more critical roles in explaining the variability of hysteresis patterns lloyd et al 2016a second correlation analyses were able to identify the potential collinearity between explanatory variables ni et al 2020 it is recommended to eliminate the collinearity by removing highly correlated variables prior to further analysis lloyd et al 2016a as correlation does not guarantee causation caution does need to be taken when interpreting the results regression methods can provide quantitative evaluations of the contributions from explanatory variables along with their confidence levels α on the response variables according to the way they treat response variables regression methods can be roughly separated into linear regressions treating response variables as continuous variables and logistic regressions treating response variables as category variables for the first method after searching for the optimal model of multiple linear regressions the remaining variables in the optimal model appear to be the critical ones that influence the hysteresis patterns guarch ribot and butturini 2016 by using logistic regression baker and showers 2019 identified that antecedent soil moisture was the most critical factor in controlling the direction of the hysteresis loops special attentions are needed to ensure the assumptions of linear regression are valid including linear relationship normality of residues independence non collinearity can be addressed using correlation analysis mentioned above and homoscedasticity lloyd et al 2016a in addition to the statistical methods introduced in this section the increased numbers of hysteresis events should also encourage the use of well designed machine learning algorithms to identify the key explanatory variables and thus to indicate the controlling processes and mechanisms there are many potential advanced algorithms for multivariate analysis including but not limited to decision tree random forest support vector machine genetic analysis etc applying these machine learning methods on the event scale hysteresis patterns is promising 3 6 making inferences from hysteresis patterns analysis from statistical correlations and analyses researchers need to provide professional judgements to interpret the results and to make inferences such as the identification of critical processes and mechanisms at play spatio temporal dynamics of the corresponding processes and mechanisms and strategies inferred by the hysteresis analysis generally event scale hysteresis effects can be attributed the temporal lags of peaks or troughs in hydrograph and chemograph reflecting relative weights of constituent availability and hydrological connectivity during events outram et al 2016 the term of availability includes the vertical and spatial distribution of certain constituent with respect to its richness in one catchment and the mobile immobile phases of the constituent while the term of connectivity refers to the ability for water flow to transport constituent from its various sources to the point of interest the sampling location during events keesstra et al 2019 for example anti clockwise loops mostly represent that constituent concentrations are higher in falling limbs rather than rising limbs indicating constituents are located in longer delivery pathways and travels slower than the generated event runoff bowes et al 2015 fovet et al 2015 dilution in hysteresis loops generally demonstrates that the constituent concentrations in the fast flow such as surface runoff are lower than the baseflow e g deep groundwater the analyses of hysteresis patterns could infer potential processes and mechanisms controlling constituent export dynamics during events burns et al 2019 for instance williams et al 2018 compared an intensively subsurface drained agricultural watershed in midwestern u s with anti clockwise hysteresis patterns with those catchments that exhibit clockwise loops they found out that although subsurface drainage or tile drainage was more efficient to hydrologically connect distant agricultural fields with large nitrate pool sizes to streams the presence of subsurface drainage may slow down the rising of shallow groundwater table and could eventually delay the nitrate transport from the typical nitrate rich zone in shallower soil profile to streams resulting in anti clockwise hysteresis patterns therefore they concluded that the vertical availability of nitrate for being leached out in the soil profile instead of shallow groundwater was the main source for nitrate export in their study watershed for another study analyzing the phosphorus hysteresis patterns in a groundwater fed watershed bieroza and heathwaite 2015 stated that stream discharge variables and temperature were major controls of the direction of phosphorus hysteresis loops identified by spearman s rank correlation table 5 hysteresis analysis can also be used to explore seasonal patterns controlling processes and mechanisms for watersheds with long term data or effects of watershed characteristics into i e land use hydraulic settings climate conditions on the response of constituent to storms aguilera and melack 2018b baker and showers 2019 bieroza and heathwaite 2015 duncan et al 2017 haddadchi and hicks 2021 by analyzing hysteresis patterns of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus srp using 400 events from three watersheds dominated by different land use types agriculture forest urban kincaid et al 2020 revealed that land use influenced nitrate hysteresis patterns by changing the source and transport pathway among watersheds while land use had limited impacts on srp hysteresis patterns due to srp s lower mobility than nitrate in another study focusing on the intra annual variability of hysteresis patterns of turbidity nitrate and dissolved organic carbon doc fovet et al 2018 reported that different types of hysteretic responses of water quality parameters can be related to precipitation stream and antecedent conditions e g groundwater pre event levels for instance clockwise doc q hysteresis loops with flushing patterns happened when the contribution of rising limbs on doc were richer than the contribution from falling limbs such phenomenon could be caused by either an exhaustion of doc sources during events or a higher contribution of shallow groundwater with less doc concentrations during the falling limb to dilute doc concentrations from top soils by analyzing hysteresis patterns of suspended solid concentrations ssc and their controls at sub watersheds in china cao et al 2021 revealed that different factors regulating ssc q hysteresis patterns were recognized in sub watersheds with different characteristics for a sub watershed composed of peak cluster depression seasonal surface rivers and a developed epikarst zone cq rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions were the main controlling factors while for a sub watershed with more underground water cqdx results indicated that sediment pouring into underground rivers from surface water along with antecedent conditions and maximum discharge rate regulated the ssc hysteresis patterns overall with the increased data availability at both temporal and spatial scales hysteresis analysis can be used as a promising tool to help researchers to enhance the understanding of controlling mechanisms across different spatio temporal scales by gaining knowledge regarding controlling processes and mechanisms and their spatio temporal dynamics hysteresis analysis has facilitated the development of specific strategies to achieve management goals e g improving water quality in streams burns et al 2019 frazar et al 2019 sherriff et al 2016 taking sediment control as an example hysteresis analysis has successfully provided contrasting patterns with different permeability hydrological connectivity and or dominating land uses sherriff et al 2016 reported that the agricultural watershed with high hydrological connectivity generated greater sediment export at low groundcover periods while the grassland watershed only exported sediment with wetter weather therefore they concluded that hydrological connectivity in watersheds need to be managed correspondingly to their specific physical watershed characteristics e g physical conditions land use types and land management pressures to reduce sediment export after identifying the critical factors controlling sediment dynamics in a karst watershed cao et al 2021 recommended that for cq with rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions as controlling factors it was supposed to effectively reduce soil erosion by building drainage facilities along perimeters of farmland to reduce surface water accumulation at heavy rainfall events in agricultural fields on contrary for cqdx with sediment input from surface water they suggested those protective practices to prevent surface runoff from entering sinkholes to underground rivers such as walls around sinkholes 4 challenges and future work despite the considerable efforts invested in the analysis of event scale c q relationships there remain questions and challenges on this topic such challenges include more advanced hysteresis metrics generalized and standardized tools to define events and further integration of insights of hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling to develop management strategies 4 1 advanced quantitative metrics to classify hysteresis patterns 4 1 1 an integrated index to quantify chemo dynamic conditions existing literature indicates that integrated quantitative indices to quantify the direction and strength of hysteresis loops e g hilloyd and h were more robust than semi quantitative and descriptive metrics lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 such benefits included automatic determination of the direction and magnitude of hysteresis effects better representation of loops and robustness to data resolution sampling frequencies and measurement uncertainties for indices describing chemo dynamic conditions however widely used quantitative indices e g δc fi are discrete quantitative indices not integrated metrics table 1 therefore there is potential to develop more advanced indices to quantify chemo dynamic conditions for event scale c q relationships 4 1 2 classification of complex patterns existing studies have reported more than 15 types of complex patterns which exceeds the maximum classification capacity of nine types using the schematic 2 dimentional presentation diagram mentioned in section 2 3 see butturini et al 2008 in some occasions the combination of hysteresis and flushing indices failed to distinguish among different hysteresis patterns mostly in the case of shape of eight loops lloyd et al 2016a unsymmetrical loops and or incomplete loops as there remains unclear knowledge on the effects of watershed characteristics on the appearances of complex hysteresis patterns it is difficult to provide guidelines to identify which type of watersheds are more prone to generate complex patterns in practice many researchers have had to manually distinguish the patterns with visual inspection to conduct their research rose et al 2018 given the time and efforts towards manual classification further efforts are still needed to improve the classification approaches especially automatic classification using quantitative indices table 1 4 2 generalized and standardized tools to define and automatically delineate events given various methods to delineate storm events e g abrupt changes in stream discharge baker and showers 2019 jacobs et al 2018 and digital regression filters blaen et al 2017 a more standardized and objective method s is needed to ease comparison among studies hysteresis metrics and some event descriptors are sensitive to event delineation especially to the choice of the event starting point vaughan et al 2017 for example fi is defined as the differences in constituent concentrations at the starting point and at the peak flow rate eq 6 which can be considerably impacted by the choice of the starting point of events many event descriptors table 4 have either been obtained from the values of initial conditions e g initial flow and initial constituent concentrations or calculated based on the starting points e g event duration and antecedent conditions similar to the detection of event starting points current hydrograph separation methods could also generate uncertainties in event delineation and subsequent hysteresis analysis in many cases one precipitation event may occur in pulses and generate multiple peaks and troughs in the hydrographs and chemographs for hysteresis analysis each peak and trough may be employed as a proxy to infer the controlling mechanisms and processes however many event detection techniques have been developed from large datasets for flood detection purposes where the event starting points and multi peaks may not be as sensitive for the objectives sought mei and anagnostou 2015 shen et al 2017 therefore the investigation of hydro biogeochemical processes using c q analysis requires dedicated standardized and advanced methods to delineate events and or generate event databases for that purpose some researchers have also recognized the issue to separate multi peaks consecutive peaks during one event in hysteresis analysis some researchers treat the responses in c q relationships to one precipitation event as one event no matter how many peaks and troughs may exist in the corresponding hydrograph and chemograph mehdi et al 2021 while others considered one full peak and trough to represent a single event blaen et al 2017 liu et al 2020b regarding the selection of these two methods zuecco et al 2016 demonstrated that both methods were suitable to quantify the multi peak hysteresis effects they also recommended that the indicators used to describe event characteristics should align with the event separation methods in other words if researchers decide to take one single peak and trough as an event event characteristics should also scale to this unit 4 3 integration of insights from hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling and or decision makings there have been efforts to connect long term low frequency datasets with short term high frequency datasets by analyzing overall c q relationships and testing the loadings which has fostered many insightful findings in hydro biogeochemical processes in riverine systems jiang et al 2019 lefrançois et al 2007 webster et al 2019 zimmer et al 2019 unfortunately there are limited studies to link event scale hysteresis patterns to enhance the performances of numerical modeling either statistical modeling or process based modeling possibly because the processes and mechanisms behind the hysteresis patterns are not fully understood a recent study has evaluated the nitrate hysteresis patterns captured by high frequency measurements every five minutes and model simulations soil water assessment tool swat using aggregated daily nitrate measurements in a mixed forest and agricultural catchment after comparing the measured and simulated patterns mehdi et al 2021 demonstrated that numerical modeling failed to reproduce the hysteresis patterns demonstrated by actual high frequency measurements future studies are still needed to address the structural limitations of numerical models jiang et al 2019 mehdi et al 2021 to better represent the rapidly changing hysteresis patterns to effectively compare the inferences from hysteresis analysis with other analytical methods e g numerical modeling and thus to further integrate the insights from hysteresis analysis with modeling and or decision makings 5 conclusion in this critical review of tools and methods used in hysteresis analysis we found that the metrics to quantify hysteresis patterns have evolved several iterations and integrated metrics considering multiple points in hysteresis loops were more robust than other semi quantitative and descriptive metrics in addition according to the existing practices we developed a workflow to conduct hysteresis analysis and provided recommendations for specific methods furthermore this review also discussed several limitations challenges and future work to be addressed in studies focusing on hysteresis analysis last but not the least with the increased data size for hysteresis analysis machine learning algorithms are promising in many aspects such as the classification of hysteresis patterns and the identification of

16904,due to the increased availability of high frequency measurements of stream chemistry provided by in situ sensors researchers have gained more access to relationships between stream discharge and constituent concentrations c q relationships at event scales existing studies reveal that event scale c q relationships are mostly non linear and exhibit temporal lags between peaks or troughs of hydrographs and chemographs resulting in apparent hysteresis effects in this paper we summarize and introduce tools and methods in hysteresis analysis especially the history and progresses of metrics to quantify hysteresis patterns in addition this paper provides a typical workflow to conduct event scale hysteresis analysis such as how to obtain the access to high frequency measurements existing methods to delineate storm events approaches to classify and quantify hysteresis patterns possible features properties controlling hysteresis patterns statistical methods to identify features at play and strategies to deliver the inferences from hysteresis analysis lastly we discuss some potential limitations that arise in the workflow and possible future work to address the challenges including the development of advanced quantitative hysteresis metrics generalized and standardized tools to delineate events and the integration of hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling this paper aims to provide a critical overview of technical approaches for hysteresis analysis for researchers and hopefully foster their interests to advance our understanding of complex mechanisms in event scale hydro biogeochemical processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords c q relationship hysteresis high frequency measurements nitrate watersheds statistical analyses 1 introduction the relationships between stream discharge and constituent concentrations c q relationships have been investigated for decades to infer the hydro biogeochemical processes within the watersheds e g baker and richards 2002 langlois et al 2005 williams 1989 recently due to the widespread use of in situ water quality sensors researchers have gained access to high frequency flow and concentration measurements in riverine systems e g blaen et al 2016 ledford and toran 2019 pellerin et al 2014 such high frequency measurements have enabled researchers to generate larger and more datasets focusing on event scale c q relationships i e hysteresis loops bowes et al 2005 to capture the rapidly changing hydrochemical conditions during events and to possibly enhance the understanding of biogeochemical processes associated with storm events blaen et al 2016 pellerin and bergamaschi 2014 generally c q hysteresis loops are caused by temporal lags between peaks or troughs of hydrographs and chemographs lloyd et al 2016a williams et al 2018 these lags can serve as a proxy to open the black box in complex soil and water systems at various temporal scales duncan et al 2017 to reveal controlling processes and mechanisms and thus assist in decision making for example by analyzing the patterns of nitrate hysteresis and flux in an urban watershed in france frazar et al 2019 found that orthophosphate exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis higher concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph and limited orthophosphate in the first flush of urban storms therefore to address the orthophosphate from urbanized areas it was suggested to implement runoff reduction strategies i e enhanced infiltration instead of traditional practices focusing on the first flush despite insightful outputs obtained from hysteresis analysis there is no systematic review or summary of methods and approaches utilized in existing hysteresis analysis studies in following sections we outlined tools and methods to quantify event scale c q relationships and to generate insights from the analyses instead of presenting a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and insights obtained from hysteresis analysis this paper aims to introduce tools and methods in hysteresis analysis to demonstrate a typical workflow from existing literature and to discuss some limitations and gaps of current understandings by providing a critical review regarding the technical approaches for hysteresis analysis the overall goal is to assist researchers in advancing our understanding of complex relationships between stream flow and constituent concentrations 2 a brief history of the development of event scale hysteresis metrics a hydrological event used in this article corresponds to the rapid response in flow rates associated with a generally short lived hydrological event i e rainfall precipitation snowmelt irrigation the flow response to rain is referred to as a hydrograph and is generally characterized by a rapid rise a peak and a slower falling limb fig 1 hydrographs are generally accompanied with non linear changes in the chemical concentration metrics have been developed to describe and quantitatively measure the change in constituent concentrations in response to flow the c q relationship fig 1 interpretation of these c q hysteresis metrics has in turn been used to infer physio chemical processes controlling constituent transport and spatial and temporal dynamics of constituent sources 2 1 metrics to quantify the direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops since the 1990s metrics describing the direction and magnitude of hysteresis effects have evolved several times fig 1 table 1 from qualitative description rose 2003 semi quantitative indices butturini et al 2008 2005 discrete indices that only consider the mid point aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 and integrated indices that consider multiple points in hysteresis loops lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 initially researchers qualitatively described the directions of the hysteresis loops based on their visual observations evans and davies 1998 although qualitative descriptions of hysteresis patterns have generated many insightful findings it has proven difficult to quantitatively compare the magnitude of the hysteresis loops among different storm events depending on qualitative narratives to improve the qualitative description of hysteresis patterns butturini et al 2005 proposed one semiautomatic index δr to quantify the hysteresis loops at the event scales eq a1 this index δr enables researchers to compare the hysteresis patterns of various events bieroza and heathwaite 2015 butturini et al 2008 darwiche criado et al 2015 and even of those from different watersheds butturini et al 2006 feinson et al 2016 moravcová et al 2013 despite the evident improvement of δr compared with qualitative description researchers would have to visually assess and manually assign the direction of each hysteresis loop to the index r in eq a1 involving potential uncertainties when handled by different persons and requiring considerable efforts when dealing with a great number of events these difficulties called for a more general numerical method to better quantify the hysteresis loops to address these difficulties researchers developed quantitative hysteresis metrics based on the discrete points mostly mid points in the hysteresis loops lawler et al 2006 reported a hysteresis index referred as himid which uses the ratio of parameter concentrations on the rising and falling limbs at the mid point of discharge eq a2 a3 aich et al 2014 further improved this hysteresis index denoted as hiaich by normalizing the measurements these hysteresis indices himid and hiaich provide many advantages and benefits including 1 they show the direction sign and magnitude absolute value in one single number 2 they are dimensionless 3 they are straightforward and easy to compute aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 researchers have employed this method to interpret their results of event based hysteresis analysis bowes et al 2015 esteves et al 2019 gao and josefson 2012 lefrançois et al 2007 outram et al 2014 sherriff et al 2016 however several concerns were raised regarding the limitations of the estimation method using mid points of the events for instance the values of himid tended to be skewed at high concentrations additionally these indices himid hiaich did not consider complex hysteresis effects e g figure of eight shapes with the combination of clockwise and anti clockwise loops lloyd et al 2016a lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 within the same event to overcome these shortcomings lawler et al 2006 suggested that the robustness of hysteresis index could be improved by considering multiple points that would then be averaged this improvement had the potential to change hysteresis indices from a discrete metric only considering one single mid point to an integrated metric subsequently researchers proposed integrative hysteresis metrics using the areas of rising and falling limbs langlois et al 2005 zuecco et al 2016 and averaged differences of constituent concentrations on the rising and falling limbs at different increments of discharge lloyd et al 2016b compared with the integrated metric suggested by langlois et al 2005 denoted as hlanglois eq a4 the indices developed by lloyd et al 2016b hilloyd and zuecco et al 2016 h are more robust due to the normalization of discharge rates and constituent concentrations although there exist some differences in calculations e g in calculating differences in concentrations for hilloyd and in areas for h the underlying ideas to quantify hyseresis effects are identical gramlich et al 2018 in addition both metrics exibited many benefits compared to previous metrics including automatic determination of direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops the ability to quantify complex hysteresis shapes ease of interpreting and comparing between events and study sites baker and showers 2019 birkel et al 2017 guarch ribot and butturini 2016 rose et al 2018 tunaley et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 williams et al 2018 therefore we recommend employing either of these two metrics to quantify the hysteretic behavior of event scale c q relationships 2 2 metrics to quantify chemo dynamic status of hysteresis loops in addition to the direction and magnitude of the hysteresis loops there are metrics to describe the chemo dynamic status slope of event scale c q relationships fig 1 c q relationships can characterize the change of constituent concentrations with varying stream flows and can be quantified as the slope b of the c q regression relationship on logarithmic axes bieroza et al 2018 godsey et al 2009 in studies with long term datasets e g decadal scales these researchers generally separate the chemo dynamic conditions into three categories including flushing enriching b 0 1 dilution b 0 1 and chemostatic b 0 1 bieroza et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhi and li 2020 similarly c q hysteresis analysis may also exhibit different chemo dynamic conditions flushing dilution or chemostatic of constituent concentration in the rising limbs to investigate the chemo dynamic status of constituents during storm events butturini et al 2008 proposed an index δc to describe whether the measured parameter is flushed or diluted for a certain event similarly by normalizing the flow rate and constituent concentrations during one event vaughan et al 2017 developed a flushing index fi to quantify the differences between the constituent concentrations at the beginning and peak of the rising limb at the event scale both δc and fi have been employed by researchers to analyze the chemo dynamic behavior for event scale c q relationships from different perspectives aguilera and melack 2018a hamshaw et al 2018 olshansky et al 2018 ramos et al 2015 rose et al 2018 however neither δc or fi are integrated metrics like hilloyd or h to evaluate the overall chemo dynamic conditions of the c q relationship further studies regarding the development of integrated metrics to quantify the chemo dynamic conditions are still needed 2 3 a recommended approach to calculate event scale hysteresis indices step 1 data normalization among all normalization methods lloyd et al 2016b and zuecco et al 2016 suggested the following method eq 1 2 after normalization the raw flow and constituent data were tranfered into the range between 0 and 1 1 q i n o r m q i q m i n q m a x q m i n 2 c i n o r m c i c m i n c m a x c m i n where q i n o r m c i n o r m are normalized flow rates and constituent concentrations for the i th time step respectively q i c i are the original flow rate and constituent concentrations for the i th time step respectively q m i n c m i n are the minimum flow rate and constituent concentration during the event respectively respectively q m a x c m a x are the maximum flow rate and constituent concentration during the event respectively step 2 the metrics to quantify direction and magnitude we recommend two methods to quantify the direction and magnitude of hysteresis loops specificially hilloyd developed by lloyd et al 2016b and h suggested by zuecco et al 2016 hilloyd is calculated by taking the mean of the differences between concentrations at the rising and falling limbs eq 3 if the concentration values were missing at certain segments it is suggested to estimate the missing data by interpolating the concentrations using neighboring segments i e linear interpretation as the flow and concentration data were normalized hilloyd should range from 1 to 1 3 h i lloyd i 1 n c i r i s i n g c i f a l l i n g n where hilloyd is the proposed hysteresis index ci rising ci falling are normalized concentrations at the ith segment for the rising and falling limbs respectively n is the scaling factor to evenly separate the segments of rising or falling limbs of actual measurements and n is recommended to 20 or higher up to 100 to achieve robust results of hysteresis metrics lloyd et al 2016b the second index h is calculated by the sum of differences in the definite integrals for the concentration functions of cr q and cf q for rising and falling limbs over stream flows first for normalized concentration functions cr norm q and cf norm q for two limbs the differences in definite integrals are calculated for a given interval of i j as eq 4 second the sum of definite integrals is the proposed hysteresis index h eq 5 4 δ a i j a r i j a f i j i j c r n o r m q d q i j c f n o r m q d q where δ a i j is the differences between the definite integrals on the rising and falling curves computed for a certain interval a r i j and a f i j are definite integrals calculated by the rising and falling limbs at certain intervals respectively i j are the lower and upper limits of the integration respectively q is the normalized flow data 5 h k 1 n δ a i j where h is the proposed hysteresis index k is the number of intervals used for the calculation n is the number of the overall intervals step 3 the metric to quantify chemo dynamic conditions for the metric to quantify chemo dynamic conditions the flushing index fi developed by vaughan et al 2017 is recommended as c is not normalized after normalizing the flow and concentration data fi is calculated by the differences of constituent concentration at the peak and the beginning of hydrograph eq 6 6 fi c q p e a k r i s i n g c 0 r i s i n g where fi is the flushing index c0 rising c q p e a k r i s i n g are the normalized concentrations at the beginning and peak of the storm event respectively 3 a typical workflow to analyze hysteresis effects at the event scale according to the existing literature we summarized a typical workflow for analyzing event based hysteresis patterns this workflow might include for instance 1 acquisition of high frequency water quality measurements either collected at the field watershed outlets by the researcher or obtained from open access datasets section 2 1 table 2 2 identification of events to generate event scale hydrographs and chemographs and then the visualization of the hysteresis loops section 2 2 3 quantification and classification of hysteresis patterns using hysteresis metrics e g hi fi 4 estimation of features for individual events including hydrological properties biogeochemical properties antecedent conditions watershed characters and or human activities section 2 4 5 statistical analysis of controls of hysteresis patterns among the event properties section 2 5 6 making the inferences based on identified controls background knowledge regarding hydro biochemical processes and or meta analysis of existing publications section 2 6 3 1 obtaining access to high frequency water quality datasets access to high frequency water quality measurements has been severely restricted in the past because these involved manual or automatic sampling of water later analyzed in the laboratory a method which had many limitations including funding labor and efforts harmel et al 2018 liu et al 2020a pellerin et al 2016 even though mechanical autosamplers are able to collect time or flow proportional water samples such samples are mostly left in the field for a certain period before being analyzed in the lab which can lead to bias in the data harmel et al 2006 vaughan et al 2017 thanks to the development since the 1990s and widespread implementation since the late 2000s of in situ water quality sensors high frequency water quality datasets have become more available and have drawn higher attention blaen et al 2016 the number of publications using high frequency measurements in riverine systems has dramatically increased from 35 in 2000 to 232 in 2020 fig 3 among the publications many critical reviews introduced different types of in situ water quality sensors and provided practical suggestions to conduct continuous measurements for stream chemistry blaen et al 2016 pellerin et al 2016 2014 it is important for potential researchers to select the most appropriate in situ sensors aligned with the setting s of their study site s in addition to field measurements researchers can also take advantage of open access datasets with high frequency water quality measurements provided by the government and or research teams table 2 united states geological survey usgs has been continuously collecting high

research focused on c q relationships at the event scale hansen and singh 2018 williams et al 2018 in addition to datasets collected by government agencies research teams may also share their dataset to help advance our understanding of nutrient dynamics in streams for example bernhardt et al 2018 and project members contributed their field measurements into the streampulse project to compile high frequency datasets focusing on the metabolic regimes of streams from monitoring sites in the u s appling et al 2018 many stations from streampulse equipped with high frequency discharge and nutrients concentrations enable researchers to investigate event scale c q relationships http pulseofstreams weebly com accessed on may 6th 2021 3 2 methods to delineate storm events event delineation involves the identification of the start and the end of an event hysteresis indices appear not to be sensitive to the exact timing of the end of an event but are sensitive to the choice of the beginning points vaughan et al 2017 many researchers treat an abrupt increase of discharge as the indicator of the beginning of an event table 3 lloyd et al 2016a tunaley et al 2017 for example bowes et al 2015 selected 60 increase 40 in dry seasons in flow as the criterion for the start of storm events lin 2017 picked storm events with at least 40 increase in stream flow in addition to the criteria of abrupt increases other researchers first partition the flow into baseflow and quick direct flow using hydrograph separation approaches and then define the beginning point of an event as the appearance or minimal rise of the quick direct flow outram et al 2016 hydrograph separation methods which have been considerably investigated by hydrologists mei and anagnostou 2015 offer a more objective way to detect events start and end hydrograph separation methods used in hysteresis analyses include the constant slope method macrae et al 2010 recursive digital filtering blanco et al 2010 jeong et al 2012 and rainfall as an indicator aubert et al 2013 as c q hysteresis effects can be rapidly changing during storm events the resolution and coverage of constituent measurements may also affect the event delineation zuecco et al 2016 if there are inadequate constituent measurements to capture the changes within events due to either equipment malfunctioning lin 2017 or insufficient measurement frequency such inadequate measurements may involve uncertainties in the results of event delineation vaughan et al 2017 specifically although the measuring frequency is not an urgent issue for existing high frequency measurements up to five minutes using in situ sensors blaen et al 2016 it is important to conduct further studies focusing on the threshold sampling frequency for different watersheds such knowledge will promote the hysteresis analysis in riverine systems by balancing the cost and benefits to increase sampling frequencies burns et al 2019 despite the success in event delineation for existing studies baseflow separation using different methods can impact the results of event delineation and thus propagate uncertainties in hysteresis analysis by evaluating the performances in baseflow separation by different methods in a lowland catchment in holland gonzales et al 2009 reported that tracer based methods were the most accurate methods in describing the groundwater contribution to stream discharge mostly baseflow however the requirement of intensive efforts and funding restricts the long term application of tracer based methods in many places furthermore using tracer based models as the benchmark gonzales et al 2009 found out that process based methods such as rating curve methods performed better than other non tracer based methods furthermore the recursive filtering method is reliable after calibrating the parameters to address the potential uncertainties involved in event delineation evaluation of the impacts of different separation techniques on hysteresis quantification is an interesting subject for future research 3 3 methods to classify and quantify hysteresis patterns following the hydrograph separation in stream discharge researchers have tried to classify hysteresis types with end member mixing analysis emma assuming that constituent concentrations would be constant for certain water sources e g baseflow vs event flow for two component models or baseflow event flow soil water flow for three component models hysteresis effects can be explained by the mixing of different flow components during storm events based on the ranking of constituent concentrations in different sources evans and davies 1998 proposed six types of hysteresis loops with different rotational directions curvatures and trends using end member analysis and proposed hysteresis types the authors were able to classify the events with different hydrochemical relations and thus revealed the runoff generation processes in these streams chanat et al 2002 further tested the variability of this end member analysis and concluded that in addition to the mixing assumptions field hydrological variability along with hysteresis loops inferred how flow components i e event water soil water and groundwater generate the hydro chemical responses to rainfall events in small catchments rose 2003 investigated c q relationships in both an urbanized and a less urbanized watershed for nine chemicals and classified the chemical parameters based on the end member analysis models this classification offered a chance to identify the sources of components and to contrast the differences between the urbanized watershed and the control watershed after identifying the source and transfer pathway of chemicals by interpreting the impacting points in the recessive curves using hydrograph separation and end member analysis loadograph regression analysis lra can also be a potential supplement to extend the research scope of hysteresis analysis fenton et al 2017 mellander et al 2012 first current hysteresis metrics are analyzed by the differences in rising and falling limbs hysteresis indices or only from rising limbs flushing index or δ c for storm events as the regression patterns in the falling limbs can infer much valuable information including metabolism in riverine systems bowes et al 2015 complex activation zones sources and transport pathways for chemicals in rivers blaen et al 2016 various contributing sources and flow components in watersheds with different managing practices mellander et al 2012 and or evaluating the potential performances for different management strategies husic et al 2020 in addition lra is conducted based on the products of event delineation hydrograph separation constant slope method in mellander et al 2012 and end member analysis which can be seemly embedded in the workflow of hysteresis analysis outlined in section 2 2 and this section although end member analysis are useful to identify patterns of hysteresis it is difficult for researchers to compare the hysteresis patterns among different events and or watersheds hysteresis metrics reviewed in section 1 e g hi and fi can be used to quantitatively classify the hysteresis patterns vaughan et al 2017 to combine the metrics of quantifying both hysteresis loops and chemo dynamic status butturini et al 2008 provided a schematic 2 dimentional presentation diagram to reveal the diversity continuum for different types of hysteresis loops fig 2 in butturini et al 2008 this type of plot is informative straightforward and easy to understand as a result this has become a popular way to demonstrate hysteresis patterns aguilera and melack 2018a darwiche criado et al 2015 kämäri et al 2018 liu et al 2020b strohmeier et al 2013 with the increased number of storm events analyzed in recent studies e g 365 events in baker and showers 2019 400 events in aguilera and melack 2018a 600 events in hamshaw et al 2018 more advanced methods are required to automatically classify storm events by their hysteresis patterns hamshaw et al 2018 trained and tested a supervised machine learning algorithm restricted boltzmann machine rbm to automate the classification of hysteresis plots after fine tuning the numbers of nodes and batch size the rbm was able to classify 77 of the hysteresis effects for the training dataset and 53 of the testing dataset specifically only 8 of the events were classified with an incorrect direction considering the benefits of the automated algorithm in saving time efforts high accessibility from open source programing languages and the lowering of uncertainties in classification brought by individuals hamshaw et al 2018 machine learning approaches are promising in the automatic classification of hysteresis patterns 3 4 summarized explanatory variables that could affect hysteresis patterns once event scale hysteresis metrics are calculated the focus becomes unveiling the potential mechanisms and processes that control the dynamics of hysteresis patterns such mechanisms and processes at play are represented and quantified by potential explanatory variables that may explain the variability of hysteresis metrics response variables fovet et al 2018 to better explore the variability it is advised to collect as many available explanatory variables as possible the more explanatory variables included for the coming statistical analysis the higher chance to capture critical explanatory variables affecting the hysteresis patterns such potential explanatory variables can be roughly separated into two categories watersheds characteristics and event scale hydro biogeochemical properties potential watersheds characteristics include land use slope soil types etc aguilera and melack 2018a examined hysteresis patterns from upland streams with different land use stream orders and watershed elevations in coastal california usa their results showed that the responses of nitrate hysteresis in nested catchments were affected by watershed elevations and land use types in addition to watershed characteristics the same researchers also found that hysteresis patterns can be highly influenced by the event scale properties ranging from hydrological biogeochemical and antecedent conditions in this section we summarize widely used potential properties reported by existing studies for each potential property we presented their denotations units descriptions and necessary equations in table 4 although we presented a comprehensive table of suggested event scale properties table 4 this list is still open it is possible and reasonable to add or remove certain properties according to specific studies for example if the site does not include a local rain gage all the properties regarding precipitation may be removed on the contrary bieroza and heathwaite 2015 included the information of ph or dissolved oxygen do to explain the potential hysteresis patterns of nitrate as nitrate dynamics could be altered at different levels of ph and or do 3 5 statistical methods to correlate hysteresis patterns and controlling properties multivariate analysis methods have been widely used to identify potential properties explanatory variables listed in table 4 at play on event scale hysteresis patterns response variables among the common statistical approaches listed in table 5 principal component analysis pca correlation and regression analysis gained more attention pca or similar methods have mostly been used to quantify the variations of response variables explained by linear combinations of explanatory variables and sometimes to reduce the dimensions of explanatory variables for further possible analysis methods many researchers have employed pca to elucidate which factor s could potentially impact the hysteresis patterns in their study site s aguilera and melack 2018a bhurtun et al 2019 keesstra et al 2019 despite the valuable insights obtained using pca attentions are needed to employ pca in the hysteresis analysis first due to the assumption of linear combinations in explanatory variables pca method may not be capable of capturing the non linear but correlated relationships among variables in addition when aggregating the explanatory variables into linear combinations sometimes the aggregation increases the difficulties to interpret the results for correlation analysis methods pearson s correlation has been utilized table 5 however as it was found that the hysteresis metrics often did not meet the normality assumption of pearson s correlations a non parametric method the spearman s rank correlation has become an alternative for pearson s correlation liu et al 2020b williams et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 for either pearson s or spearman s correlation correlation analysis methods have become attractive for two main reasons first explanatory variables with significantly strong correlation generally indicated that such explanatory variables played more critical roles in explaining the variability of hysteresis patterns lloyd et al 2016a second correlation analyses were able to identify the potential collinearity between explanatory variables ni et al 2020 it is recommended to eliminate the collinearity by removing highly correlated variables prior to further analysis lloyd et al 2016a as correlation does not guarantee causation caution does need to be taken when interpreting the results regression methods can provide quantitative evaluations of the contributions from explanatory variables along with their confidence levels α on the response variables according to the way they treat response variables regression methods can be roughly separated into linear regressions treating response variables as continuous variables and logistic regressions treating response variables as category variables for the first method after searching for the optimal model of multiple linear regressions the remaining variables in the optimal model appear to be the critical ones that influence the hysteresis patterns guarch ribot and butturini 2016 by using logistic regression baker and showers 2019 identified that antecedent soil moisture was the most critical factor in controlling the direction of the hysteresis loops special attentions are needed to ensure the assumptions of linear regression are valid including linear relationship normality of residues independence non collinearity can be addressed using correlation analysis mentioned above and homoscedasticity lloyd et al 2016a in addition to the statistical methods introduced in this section the increased numbers of hysteresis events should also encourage the use of well designed machine learning algorithms to identify the key explanatory variables and thus to indicate the controlling processes and mechanisms there are many potential advanced algorithms for multivariate analysis including but not limited to decision tree random forest support vector machine genetic analysis etc applying these machine learning methods on the event scale hysteresis patterns is promising 3 6 making inferences from hysteresis patterns analysis from statistical correlations and analyses researchers need to provide professional judgements to interpret the results and to make inferences such as the identification of critical processes and mechanisms at play spatio temporal dynamics of the corresponding processes and mechanisms and strategies inferred by the hysteresis analysis generally event scale hysteresis effects can be attributed the temporal lags of peaks or troughs in hydrograph and chemograph reflecting relative weights of constituent availability and hydrological connectivity during events outram et al 2016 the term of availability includes the vertical and spatial distribution of certain constituent with respect to its richness in one catchment and the mobile immobile phases of the constituent while the term of connectivity refers to the ability for water flow to transport constituent from its various sources to the point of interest the sampling location during events keesstra et al 2019 for example anti clockwise loops mostly represent that constituent concentrations are higher in falling limbs rather than rising limbs indicating constituents are located in longer delivery pathways and travels slower than the generated event runoff bowes et al 2015 fovet et al 2015 dilution in hysteresis loops generally demonstrates that the constituent concentrations in the fast flow such as surface runoff are lower than the baseflow e g deep groundwater the analyses of hysteresis patterns could infer potential processes and mechanisms controlling constituent export dynamics during events burns et al 2019 for instance williams et al 2018 compared an intensively subsurface drained agricultural watershed in midwestern u s with anti clockwise hysteresis patterns with those catchments that exhibit clockwise loops they found out that although subsurface drainage or tile drainage was more efficient to hydrologically connect distant agricultural fields with large nitrate pool sizes to streams the presence of subsurface drainage may slow down the rising of shallow groundwater table and could eventually delay the nitrate transport from the typical nitrate rich zone in shallower soil profile to streams resulting in anti clockwise hysteresis patterns therefore they concluded that the vertical availability of nitrate for being leached out in the soil profile instead of shallow groundwater was the main source for nitrate export in their study watershed for another study analyzing the phosphorus hysteresis patterns in a groundwater fed watershed bieroza and heathwaite 2015 stated that stream discharge variables and temperature were major controls of the direction of phosphorus hysteresis loops identified by spearman s rank correlation table 5 hysteresis analysis can also be used to explore seasonal patterns controlling processes and mechanisms for watersheds with long term data or effects of watershed characteristics into i e land use hydraulic settings climate conditions on the response of constituent to storms aguilera and melack 2018b baker and showers 2019 bieroza and heathwaite 2015 duncan et al 2017 haddadchi and hicks 2021 by analyzing hysteresis patterns of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus srp using 400 events from three watersheds dominated by different land use types agriculture forest urban kincaid et al 2020 revealed that land use influenced nitrate hysteresis patterns by changing the source and transport pathway among watersheds while land use had limited impacts on srp hysteresis patterns due to srp s lower mobility than nitrate in another study focusing on the intra annual variability of hysteresis patterns of turbidity nitrate and dissolved organic carbon doc fovet et al 2018 reported that different types of hysteretic responses of water quality parameters can be related to precipitation stream and antecedent conditions e g groundwater pre event levels for instance clockwise doc q hysteresis loops with flushing patterns happened when the contribution of rising limbs on doc were richer than the contribution from falling limbs such phenomenon could be caused by either an exhaustion of doc sources during events or a higher contribution of shallow groundwater with less doc concentrations during the falling limb to dilute doc concentrations from top soils by analyzing hysteresis patterns of suspended solid concentrations ssc and their controls at sub watersheds in china cao et al 2021 revealed that different factors regulating ssc q hysteresis patterns were recognized in sub watersheds with different characteristics for a sub watershed composed of peak cluster depression seasonal surface rivers and a developed epikarst zone cq rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions were the main controlling factors while for a sub watershed with more underground water cqdx results indicated that sediment pouring into underground rivers from surface water along with antecedent conditions and maximum discharge rate regulated the ssc hysteresis patterns overall with the increased data availability at both temporal and spatial scales hysteresis analysis can be used as a promising tool to help researchers to enhance the understanding of controlling mechanisms across different spatio temporal scales by gaining knowledge regarding controlling processes and mechanisms and their spatio temporal dynamics hysteresis analysis has facilitated the development of specific strategies to achieve management goals e g improving water quality in streams burns et al 2019 frazar et al 2019 sherriff et al 2016 taking sediment control as an example hysteresis analysis has successfully provided contrasting patterns with different permeability hydrological connectivity and or dominating land uses sherriff et al 2016 reported that the agricultural watershed with high hydrological connectivity generated greater sediment export at low groundcover periods while the grassland watershed only exported sediment with wetter weather therefore they concluded that hydrological connectivity in watersheds need to be managed correspondingly to their specific physical watershed characteristics e g physical conditions land use types and land management pressures to reduce sediment export after identifying the critical factors controlling sediment dynamics in a karst watershed cao et al 2021 recommended that for cq with rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions as controlling factors it was supposed to effectively reduce soil erosion by building drainage facilities along perimeters of farmland to reduce surface water accumulation at heavy rainfall events in agricultural fields on contrary for cqdx with sediment input from surface water they suggested those protective practices to prevent surface runoff from entering sinkholes to underground rivers such as walls around sinkholes 4 challenges and future work despite the considerable efforts invested in the analysis of event scale c q relationships there remain questions and challenges on this topic such challenges include more advanced hysteresis metrics generalized and standardized tools to define events and further integration of insights of hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling to develop management strategies 4 1 advanced quantitative metrics to classify hysteresis patterns 4 1 1 an integrated index to quantify chemo dynamic conditions existing literature indicates that integrated quantitative indices to quantify the direction and strength of hysteresis loops e g hilloyd and h were more robust than semi quantitative and descriptive metrics lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 such benefits included automatic determination of the direction and magnitude of hysteresis effects better representation of loops and robustness to data resolution sampling frequencies and measurement uncertainties for indices describing chemo dynamic conditions however widely used quantitative indices e g δc fi are discrete quantitative indices not integrated metrics table 1 therefore there is potential to develop more advanced indices to quantify chemo dynamic conditions for event scale c q relationships 4 1 2 classification of complex patterns existing studies have reported more than 15 types of complex patterns which exceeds the maximum classification capacity of nine types using the schematic 2 dimentional presentation diagram mentioned in section 2 3 see butturini et al 2008 in some occasions the combination of hysteresis and flushing indices failed to distinguish among different hysteresis patterns mostly in the case of shape of eight loops lloyd et al 2016a unsymmetrical loops and or incomplete loops as there remains unclear knowledge on the effects of watershed characteristics on the appearances of complex hysteresis patterns it is difficult to provide guidelines to identify which type of watersheds are more prone to generate complex patterns in practice many researchers have had to manually distinguish the patterns with visual inspection to conduct their research rose et al 2018 given the time and efforts towards manual classification further efforts are still needed to improve the classification approaches especially automatic classification using quantitative indices table 1 4 2 generalized and standardized tools to define and automatically delineate events given various methods to delineate storm events e g abrupt changes in stream discharge baker and showers 2019 jacobs et al 2018 and digital regression filters blaen et al 2017 a more standardized and objective method s is needed to ease comparison among studies hysteresis metrics and some event descriptors are sensitive to event delineation especially to the choice of the event starting point vaughan et al 2017 for example fi is defined as the differences in constituent concentrations at the starting point and at the peak flow rate eq 6 which can be considerably impacted by the choice of the starting point of events many event descriptors table 4 have either been obtained from the values of initial conditions e g initial flow and initial constituent concentrations or calculated based on the starting points e g event duration and antecedent conditions similar to the detection of event starting points current hydrograph separation methods could also generate uncertainties in event delineation and subsequent hysteresis analysis in many cases one precipitation event may occur in pulses and generate multiple peaks and troughs in the hydrographs and chemographs for hysteresis analysis each peak and trough may be employed as a proxy to infer the controlling mechanisms and processes however many event detection techniques have been developed from large datasets for flood detection purposes where the event starting points and multi peaks may not be as sensitive for the objectives sought mei and anagnostou 2015 shen et al 2017 therefore the investigation of hydro biogeochemical processes using c q analysis requires dedicated standardized and advanced methods to delineate events and or generate event databases for that purpose some researchers have also recognized the issue to separate multi peaks consecutive peaks during one event in hysteresis analysis some researchers treat the responses in c q relationships to one precipitation event as one event no matter how many peaks and troughs may exist in the corresponding hydrograph and chemograph mehdi et al 2021 while others considered one full peak and trough to represent a single event blaen et al 2017 liu et al 2020b regarding the selection of these two methods zuecco et al 2016 demonstrated that both methods were suitable to quantify the multi peak hysteresis effects they also recommended that the indicators used to describe event characteristics should align with the event separation methods in other words if researchers decide to take one single peak and trough as an event event characteristics should also scale to this unit 4 3 integration of insights from hysteresis analysis with numerical modeling and or decision makings there have been efforts to connect long term low frequency datasets with short term high frequency datasets by analyzing overall c q relationships and testing the loadings which has fostered many insightful findings in hydro biogeochemical processes in riverine systems jiang et al 2019 lefrançois et al 2007 webster et al 2019 zimmer et al 2019 unfortunately there are limited studies to link event scale hysteresis patterns to enhance the performances of numerical modeling either statistical modeling or process based modeling possibly because the processes and mechanisms behind the hysteresis patterns are not fully understood a recent study has evaluated the nitrate hysteresis patterns captured by high frequency measurements every five minutes and model simulations soil water assessment tool swat using aggregated daily nitrate measurements in a mixed forest and agricultural catchment after comparing the measured and simulated patterns mehdi et al 2021 demonstrated that numerical modeling failed to reproduce the hysteresis patterns demonstrated by actual high frequency measurements future studies are still needed to address the structural limitations of numerical models jiang et al 2019 mehdi et al 2021 to better represent the rapidly changing hysteresis patterns to effectively compare the inferences from hysteresis analysis with other analytical methods e g numerical modeling and thus to further integrate the insights from hysteresis analysis with modeling and or decision makings 5 conclusion in this critical review of tools and methods used in hysteresis analysis we found that the metrics to quantify hysteresis patterns have evolved several iterations and integrated metrics considering multiple points in hysteresis loops were more robust than other semi quantitative and descriptive metrics in addition according to the existing practices we developed a workflow to conduct hysteresis analysis and provided recommendations for specific methods furthermore this review also discussed several limitations challenges and future work to be addressed in studies focusing on hysteresis analysis last but not the least with the increased data size for hysteresis analysis machine learning algorithms are promising in many aspects such as the classification of hysteresis patterns and the identification of
