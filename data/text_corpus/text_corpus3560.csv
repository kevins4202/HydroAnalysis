17800,green roofs grs have proven to be a sustainable solution to stormwater management in urban areas to boost their adoption at the large scale there is a need to develop numerical models which are accurate computationally cheap and as complex as needed to reproduce the hydrological behavior of grs alternative conceptual and mechanistic approaches have been proposed and tested however the most appropriate level of model complexity for grs analysis is still unknown to cover this scientific gap we provide a bayesian comprehensive perspective of gr hydrological modeling which includes a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of one conceptual and multiple richards based mechanistic gr models and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the analysis of the marginal likelihoods reveals that the conceptual and the unimodal van genuchten mualem models are the most appropriate parameterizations and that further layers of model complexity are not fully supported by the measurements in addition to that the estimated kullback leibler divergences suggest that the measured volumetric water content outperforms the measured subsurface outflow and tracer concentrations in terms of informativeness leading to the lowest model predictive uncertainty for the simulation of water fluxes the findings of this study represent a first step to clarify

introduction in today s world 55 of the population lives in urban areas and the proportion is expected to increase reaching 68 by 2050 united nations et al 2018 while cities have been historically drivers of economic growth and poverty reduction the unplanned urbanization of undeveloped lands leads to rapid sprawl environmental pollution and unsustainable resources consumption european environment agency eea 2015 the progressive sealing of surfaces due to the development of built up areas decreases the infiltration and evapotranspiration capacity of urban catchments thus increasing surface runoff and flooding events güneralp et al 2015 with detrimental economic impacts jongman et al 2014 traditional approaches to stormwater management in urban areas based on grey infrastructures are unlikely to succeed and would be prohibitively costly given the scale of vulnerability it is therefore crucial to invert the paradigm of urban planning and favor the transition towards an integrated and sustainable approach i e mitigate adapt avoid restore which is typical of the green economy green infrastructures gis such as green roofs grs are main actors of this change and can offer multiple environmental benefits though their benefits are more pronounced for small and medium precipitations grs are indeed able to significantly reduce peak rates of storm water runoff brunetti et al 2016 getter et al 2007 and retain rainfall volumes with retention efficiencies ranging from 40 to 80 bengtsson et al 2004 furthermore brunetti et al 2018a demonstrated how grs can significantly mitigate temperatures of the underlining building by exploiting the evaporative cooling effect despite these multifaceted benefits the adoption of such systems in urban areas is still limited among others one of the key limiting factors is the lack of appropriate modeling tools for the analysis and design of grs elliot and trowsdale 2007 roy poirier et al 2010 to have a widespread diffusion among practitioners the model should be accurate computationally cheap and as complex as needed to reproduce the hydrological behavior of grs indeed unjustified model complexity makes the numerical analysis of grs impractical for the broad audience of engineers and urban planners several gr models have been developed and tested in the literature and generally they can be grouped into two categories conceptual and mechanistic the former schematize the gr in multiple conceptual elements such as reservoirs and lumps the hydrological processes in few parameters thus reducing the computational cost and the overall model complexity e g kasmin et al 2010 however such a theoretical representation can potentially reduce the physical meaning of the model parameters thus limiting their generalizability johannessen et al 2019 on the other hand mechanistic models provide a more comprehensive and physically based description of the system although increasing the computational cost and the model complexity e g brunetti et al 2016 typical mechanistic models applied for gr analysis include for example hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 and swap van dam et al 2008 multiple studies have shown that both conceptual e g stovin et al 2015 vesuviano et al 2014 and mechanistic models e g brunetti et al 2016 hilten et al 2008 li and babcock 2015 metselaar 2012 palla et al 2009 when properly calibrated can accurately describe the hydraulic functioning of grs surprisingly only a few studies have focused on gr models comparison haowen et al 2019 palla et al 2012 and concluded that both conceptual and mechanistic models provided satisfactory results nevertheless the model comparison was focused only the fitting quality while the effect of the predictive uncertainty which can undermine the model s general applicability was completely neglected such approach cannot provide meaningful information about the appropriate level of model complexity which is a trade off between quality of fit and complexity indeed the model must be as simple as possible as complex as necessary höge et al 2018 to accurately reproduce observations and limit the predictive uncertainty in this perspective the bayesian model selection provides a statistically rigorous basis to compare alternative models in light of observations and any prior information available the core of the method is the numerical estimation of the bayesian evidence or marginal likelihood which condenses in a single value the fitting quality and the model s general applicability models characterized by high marginal likelihood are preferable however the computation of the marginal likelihood is numerically challenging as it involves a multi dimensional integration over the entire parameter space which is usually carried out using monte carlo techniques to this aim multiple studies have focused on developing or improving algorithms for the monte carlo determination of the marginal likelihood popular methods are based on the reversible jump algorithm green 1995 bridge sampling methods meng and wong 1996 steppinsgstone sampling elshall 2019 and thermodynamic integration friel and pettitt 2008 gelman and meng 1998 the latter has been successfully applied to hydrological problems liu et al 2016 wei et al 2019 though its high computational cost limits its widespread use to reduce the computational cost skilling 2006 proposed a one dimensional re parametrization of the integral of the bayesian model evidence which is at the basis of the nested sampling ns algorithm which has been applied successfully in several research fields elsheikh et al 2014 2013 mukherjee et al 2006 paulson et al 2019 schöniger et al 2014 shaw et al 2007 several variants have been proposed to improve the original algorithm brewer et al 2011 handley et al 2015 higson et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 of particular interest is the ellipsoidal rejection sampling scheme multinest proposed by feroz et al 2009 that allows to identify and isolate near gaussian posterior modes in small overlapping ellipsoids once identified these modes can be evolved independently thereby automatically accommodating posteriors degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems despite its potential the use of ns for hydrological model comparison is only partially exploited while it could be extremely beneficial to clarify the role of model complexity especially for gr numerical analysis another interesting feature of the ns algorithm is the possibility to simultaneously calculate the marginal likelihood the posterior parameters distributions and the kullback leibler kl divergence brewer 2017 skilling 2006 calls the latter the information which indicates how much can be learned about model parameters from observations statistically the kl divergence measures the distance between the prior and the posterior parameter distributions intuitively this distance grows when the observations are highly informative because our confidence in the parameter estimation increases i e uncertainty reduction from priors to posteriors the kl divergence is therefore of great interest because it can be used ex ante or ex post the experiment to evaluate the information content of the measurements for gr analysis it could provide important indications on the type and number of observations i e design of the experiment to be implemented in order to maximize the information and reduce the model predictive uncertainty indeed while it can be generally stated that varied i e different type and high resolution i e in space and time observations lead to informative experiments it must be as well emphasized that other factors such as budget limitation can limit the resources available making the design of the experiments challenging and uncertain such considerations are even more exacerbated when dealing with the investigation of complex physical processes or field scale installations in this perspective the use of alternative measurements such as tracers could be explored natural or artificial tracers are widely used in hydrology and soil science to characterize the water and solute transport at different scales brunetti et al 2020 kirchner 2003 stumpp et al 2009 while their application for gr analysis is completely unexplored therefore we provide for the first time a bayesian comprehensive perspective of gr hydrological modeling which includes a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of multiple conceptual and mechanistic gr models and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the main aim is to elucidate the role of model complexity in gr analysis and to provide meaningful indications on the information of different types of measurements for future gr experimental design the problem is addressed in the following way first one conceptual and three mechanistic models are coupled with multinest algorithm to perform the bayesian analysis measured volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer information from a controlled experiment on an extensive gr in a climate chamber are used for model calibration and uncertainty assessment then a bayesian model selection framework is applied to estimate the marginal likelihood for each model and identify the most justifiable levels of model complexity in light of observations finally the information content of each measurement is calculated by coupling selected gr models with the multinest algorithm to estimate and compare the kl divergences it must be emphasized that this study presents for the first time 1 a bayesian comparison of conceptual and mechanistic gr models 2 a probabilistic assessment of the information of different types of measurements 3 the use of an isotope tracer for the hydraulic characterization of gr 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 green roof description measured data used in the present work belong to a broader experimental campaign on the injection of wastewater on grs the experiment encompassed three testbeds two exposed to wastewater and one to pure water which served as control in the present study we focus only on the latter to avoid the uncertainties stemming from the application of the wastewater on the gr e g bioclogging of the soil surface a schematic of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the testbed consisted of a 15 cm high 57 cm long and 36 cm wide plastic box containing an extensive gr the box was placed on a wood frame to insulate the bottom and minimize the heat transfer from the surrounding environment a slope of 1 was set to convey the subsurface outflow to a circular hole and then to a plastic pipe for measurement and sampling multiple open ended capillary pipes connected to an external pumping system equipped with a reservoir were used to homogenously irrigate the gr which consisted of two layers a 12 cm deep soil substrate with a measured porosity and bulk density of 0 66 and 0 89 g cm3 respectively a 3 cm deep drainage layer consisting of coarse quartz gravel up to 15 mm the drainage layer guarantees the aeration of the roots avoid the saturation of the soil substrate and enhances the thermal attenuation of the gr cascone 2019 a highly permeable geotextile was used to separate the two layers which were carefully compacted during the testbed assembly to simulate real gr conditions and simultaneously minimize soil heterogeneities the vegetation consisted of two species frequently used for extensive grs brunetti et al 2016 alyssum lobularia maritima and cheddar pink dianthus gratianapolitanus both plant species were transplanted after a one week equilibration period in order to characterize the heat transport in the gr two thermocouples measured the temperature in the middle of the soil substrate and at the bottom of the drainage layer before the installation sensors were calibrated against a precision thermometer at the same time a coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometer stevens hydraprobe was used to measure the soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity in the gr substrate as suggested by kargas et al 2013 and seyfried et al 2005 a substrate specific calibration curve was developed in the laboratory to link the measured soil permittivity to the actual soil moisture and guarantee good measurement accuracy calibrated sensors were then installed jointly with gr layers to maximize the adhesion between the soil and the sensor rods a tipping bucket and an evaporation pan to measure the subsurface outflow and the evaporation demand respectively completed the measurement system which was connected to an external data logger the acquisition frequency was set to 1 min the assembled testbed was placed into a climate chamber where spring summer mediterranean climatic conditions were simulated fig 2 in particular the air temperature the relative humidity and the day night alternation were set to replicate measured data from a weather station in southern italy 39 33 n 16 18 e unfortunately no radiation intensity control was available in the chamber therefore only day night alternation was simulated 2 1 2 transient water flow and tracer experiment the experiment lasted one month and encompassed the transient water flow and the tracer injection to characterize the hydraulic behavior of the gr the irrigation schedule blue lines in fig 2 was designed to induce an alternation of wet and dry soil conditions which was expected to maximize the information content of the measured data as well as to minimize the plant water stress each irrigation event lasted 1 h during which 3 l of tap water were distributed on the soil surface except during the tracer experiment as shown in brunetti et al 2018a such irrigation pattern can significantly enhance the evaporative cooling efficiency of the gr the tracer experiment took place in the first week and consisted of the injection of deuterium 2h enriched water into the system with a measured concentration of 38 mg l deuterium in the inflowing water the tracer was injected continuously for 2 h the first day while only pure water was used in the next three days thus reaching a total injected water volume of 24 l during the first week of the experiment the outflow was sampled manually every 15 min and analyzed in the laboratory using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i to reconstruct tracer concentration curves it must be emphasized that while being a common practice in hydrology and soil science this study presents for the first time the use of a tracer for the characterization of the hydraulic behavior of grs 2 2 modeling the water flow and the solute transport in the green roof in this section a mathematical description of both the conceptual and mechanistic models is provided particular emphasis is given to the water flow root water uptake and non reactive solute transport the main assumptions in both models are that the hydraulic effect of the drainage layer is negligible and that the water flow is strictly vertical therefore the description focuses only on the one dimensional vertical water solute transport in the gr soil substrate these hypothesis seem admissible for multiple reasons 1 the coarse quartz gravel d 15 mm has negligible water retention capacity and high permeability naseri et al 2019 2 the low depth of the drainage layer i e 3 cm has small impact on the vertical water fluxes 3 water percolating from the soil substrate quickly infiltrates and accumulates at the bottom where it is immediately routed to the outlet due the limited length of the testbed i e 57 cm a similar assumption was used in brunetti et al 2016 2 2 1 conceptual model conceptual models for gr s hydrological analysis are often indicated in the literature as reservoir routing models e g stovin et al 2015 vesuviano et al 2014 while this definition is intuitively appealing it is mathematically misleading since the schematization of the water flow in multiple reservoirs with parameterized inflow and outflow is a simplification of the finite volume method fvm indeed in the fvm the numerical domain is discretized in multiple cells and for each edge the actual flow which is entering or leaving the cell is approximated using a certain numerical flux function f therefore in the present study the conceptual model is intentionally described in a fvm numerical framework the gr substrate is discretized in n cells of the same size the one dimensional vertical water flow and solute transport can be described as follows 1 u t f z s where u is the vector of the conserved variables t is time t f is the flux vector z is the vertical coordinate l and s is the source sink term vector vectors can be expressed as 2 u θ θ c f q q c s s 0 where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 q is the discharge lt 1 c is the solute concentration in the liquid phase ml 3 and s θ is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake the root solute uptake is considered negligible and the non reactive solute transport is assumed to be purely advective a corrected power law equation describes the discharge q 3 q a θ f c b if θ f c q 0 if θ f c where a and b are routing coefficients and fc is the effective soil field capacity l3l 3 eq 3 is a modification of the tipping bucket approach emerman 1995 schroeder et al 1994 as it assumes that the water flow below the field capacity is negligible while it grows exponentially above this value indeed if a b 1 the model generalizes to the classical tipping bucket approach used in several applications e g scanlon et al 2003 schroeder et al 1994 the coupled water solute transport is solved numerically using the method of lines mol the mol approach replaces the spatial derivatives in the partial differential equations pdes with an algebraic approximation which reduces the pde to an ordinary differential equation central to the mol is the numerical approximation of spatial derivatives in the present study the fvm is used to spatially discretize the subsurface domain the fvm is a well established and widely used numerical solution method for a variety of engineering problems involving pdes mainly because of its conservativeness the integral form of eq 1 is written as 4 t ω u d ω ω f d ω ω s d ω by applying the divergence theorem to the second term in eq 4 becomes 5 t ω u d ω ω f n d ω ω s d ω the contour integral in eq 5 is approximated using numerical fluxes f at the edge of each cell j thus leading to 6 d u j d t 1 δ x f j 1 2 f j 1 2 s j the approximation of the numerical fluxes f is central in the fvm since it affects the accuracy of the solution brufau et al 2002 brunetti et al 2018b van leer 1979 generally conceptual gr models use the simulated water depths in each reservoir to calculate the inflow outflow stovin et al 2012 vesuviano et al 2014 which mathematically corresponds to a first order approximation of the numerical flux in the fvm therefore to guarantee a fair results comparison with other studies the first order upwind scheme is adopted which describes numerical fluxes f as follows 7 f j 1 2 a θ j 1 f c b if θ j 1 f c f j 1 2 0 if θ j 1 f c the actual root water uptake is described as follows 8 s j θ ψ θ j s p where s p is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 and ψ θ is a dimensionless water stress response function that depends on the volumetric water content in the jth cell and ranges between 0 and 1 9 ψ θ j 1 if θ j fc ψ θ j θ j f c if θ j fc the potential transpiration rate s p is calculated from the measured evaporation demand in the chamber using the beer s law detailed explanation of evapotranspiration partitioning is given in sutanto et al 2012 and brunetti et al 2016 2019a the leaf area index lai at each time step is needed to partition evaporation and transpiration fluxes in the present study the plant growth in each compartment is assumed to be logistic therefore the lai can be expressed as 10 l a i t l a i max 1 l a i max l a i 0 1 exp k g r where lai max and lai 0 are the maximum and minimum lai indices in the simulated period respectively and k gr is the growth rate t 1 lai max and lai 0 were assumed to be 3 0 and 1 0 respectively blanusa et al 2013 while k gr was set to 0 15 1 day finally the fourth order explicit runge kutta dormand prince rkdp dormand and prince 1980 is adopted here to solve in time the coupled water solute transport due to its accuracy and computationally efficiency more specifically an rkdp algorithm with an adaptive time stepping strategy based on the truncation error control is used this kind of temporal discretization automatically adjusts the time step depending on the solution thus providing a dense temporal output near discontinuities the conceptual model formulation shares some similarities with the kinematic wave approach beven 1981 which cannot reproduce the effects of a downstream boundary condition bc on the water flow essentially these type of models can only predict the downstream movement of any disturbance on the water flow therefore the use of classical downstream bcs such as seepage face is not mathematically possible but it is partially reproducible by using eq 3 which assumes null water flow until relatively wet conditions i e field capacity are reached the upstream bc is generally set in terms of inflow outflow which is easily handled in fvm models by equaling the numerical flux in the edge cell with the inflow outflow value 2 2 2 mechanistic richards based models the one dimensional richards equation mechanistically describes the variably saturated water flow in the gr 11 θ t z k h h z 1 s h where t is time t z is the vertical coordinate l θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the pressure head l and s h is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake feddes et al 1978 defined s as 12 s h r s h z d z s p r β h z γ z d z where β h z is a dimensionless water stress response function that depends on the soil pressure head h γ z is a distribution function that accounts for root density and growth and s p is the potential transpiration rate as for the lai the root growth was assumed to be logistic and vary between an initial root depth of 4 cm and a final value of 12 cm which is compatible with the homogeneous root distribution observed in the substrate at the end of the experiment a parameterization of the soil hydraulic properties is needed to solve eq 11 in the present study three different mechanistic parameterizations are compared unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm van genuchten 1980 bimodal vgm durner 1994 and dual porosity simunek et al 2003 while the unimodal vgm is mostly suited for homogeneous soils the bimodal vgm and dual porosity account for soil heterogeneities and preferential flow respectively the choice to include these models in the bayesian complexity assessment is justified by both scientific considerations and previous studies in particular brunetti et al 2016 highlighted how both the unimodal and bimodal vgm give a satisfactory description of the hydraulic behavior of a gr substrate by comparing modeling results with observations from a plot scale gr experimental facility the bimodal structure of multiple gr substrates was confirmed also in hill et al 2019 the simultaneous presence of coarse material and high organic matter can trigger highly conductive flow paths and at the same time generate immobile zones in the finer pore regions of the gr substrate where the water could be stored this physical process which was never investigated in the past for grs can be described using the dual porosity approach even though the soil packing in the testbed was carefully conducted the occurrence of heterogeneities in the porous medium cannot be excluded a priori the execution time of a single model run for each mechanistic parameterization was low 5 s thus not posing particular computational issues to the bayesian analysis the unimodal vgm is described as follows 13 θ θ s θ r α h α h α h n m θ r if h 0 θ s if h 0 14 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 15 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 i f h 0 k s i f h 0 16 m 1 1 n where θ r l3l 3 is the residual water content θ s l3l 3 is the saturated water content k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity n is a pore size distribution index α is a parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure l 1 l indicates the tortuosity and θ is the effective saturation on the other hand the bimodal model of durner 1994 which constructs the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions by a linear superposition of two or more van genuchten mualem functions is described as follows 17 θ i 1 2 w i 1 α i h α i h α i h n i m i if h 0 1 if h 0 18 k k s i 1 2 w i θ i l i 1 2 w i α i 1 α i h n i θ i i 1 2 w i α i 2 if h 0 k s if h 0 where w is a weighing factor and i refers to the ith pore system in the dual porosity approach the liquid phase is divided into two domains 19 θ θ f θ i m m where subscript f refers to the mobile fracture system and subscript imm refers to the immobile matrix domain the dual porosity water flow formulation is based on a modified richards equation for flow in fractures and a mass balance equation for moisture dynamics in the matrix 20 θ f z z k h h z 1 s h γ w 21 θ i m m t γ w where γ w is the mass transfer between two domains which is assumed to be proportional to the difference in effective saturations of the two regions simunek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 22 γ w ω θ f θ i m m where ω is a first order coefficient t 1 the tracer transport in the gr is mechanistically described using the advection dispersion equation assuming that solute can exist only in the liquid phase 23 θ c t θ d w c q c where c is the tracer concentration ml 3 d w is the tracer dispersion in water l2t 1 q is the water flux lt 1 the dispersion d w is expressed as 24 θ d w λ q where λ is the dispersivity l the effect of the molecular diffusion is neglected 2 3 bayesian model selection 2 3 1 multinest algorithm in the present study the marginal likelihood is used to compare models the estimation of the marginal likelihood and parameter posterior distributions is carried out by coupling different gr s models with the multinest algorithm which was chosen due to it significant flexibility in the posterior exploration in particular this ellipsoidal decomposition algorithm automatically accommodates elongated curving degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems furthermore it also specifically enables the identification of distinct modes by isolating non overlapping subsets of the ellipsoidal decomposition so identified these distinct modes can then be evolved independently feroz et al 2013 for simplicity only a general overview of the method is provided while detailed descriptions about the theoretical background and numerical implementation can be found in skilling 2006 mukherjee et al 2006 and feroz et al 2009 the bayesian paradigm is a statistical approach for the estimation of a set of parameters ω in a model h for the data d 25 pr ω d h pr d ω h pr ω h pr d h where pr ω d h p ω is the posterior probability of the parameters pr d ω h l ω is the likelihood pr ω h π ω is the prior and pr d h z is the marginal likelihood or bayesian model evidence which can be expressed as 26 z l ω π ω d d ω where d is the dimensionality of the parameter space the bayesian evidence is the average of the likelihood over the prior and it is expected to be smaller for a model with large areas in its parameter space having low likelihood even if the likelihood function is highly peaked and larger for a model with higher likelihood of model parameters in a larger fraction of its parameter space the multinest algorithm belongs to the class of ns estimators the core of the method is the transformation of the multi dimensional integral in eq 26 to a one dimensional integral to this end the prior mass x can be defined as the cumulative prior mass covering all likelihood values greater than the iso likelihood contour ω 27 x ω l ω ω π ω d d ω for the case of normalized prior probability the prior mass x has a value 1 if ω 0 and decreases to 0 as ω approaches 1 defining the inverse function l x as the likelihood which bounds a prior mass x one can simplify eq 26 from a multi dimensional integral over the prior volume to a one dimensional integral over the prior mass 28 z 0 1 l x d x the multinest algorithm provides an iterative process to solve eq 28 at each iteration i n active samples are drawn from the prior samples are then sorted in order of their likelihood and the smallest with likelihood l 0 is removed from the active set and replaced by a point drawn from the prior subject to the constraint that the point has a likelihood l l 0 the iterative process is stopped when the stopping criterion is satisfied the algorithm thus travels through nested shells of likelihood as the prior volume is shrunk once the evidence z is estimated posterior parameter distributions and associated weights can be inferred using the full sequence of discarded points from the nested sampling process the most challenging task is sampling from the prior with the hard constraint l l 0 the multinest algorithm solves this problem by combining the ellipsoidal nested sampling mukherjee et al 2006 with the recursive clustering shaw et al 2007 that is particularly suited for degenerated multimodal posterior distributions which are often encountered when inversely estimating soil hydraulic and transport parameters e g brunetti et al 2019b it can be assumed that the posterior bulk was explored sufficiently when the active points in sum incremented the evidence by only some small fraction of the total accumulated evidence more specifically the currently active point with the highest likelihood gives an estimate of the highest likelihood in the region the remaining evidence at iteration i is estimated according to 29 z e s t l max x i where xi is the remaining prior volume the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence and the current evidence 30 log z i z e s t log z e s t 0 5 furthermore to avoid the premature stopping of the algorithm the maximum number of algorithm iterations is set to 100 000 such threshold value was never reached during the simulations in this study the active set consists of 100 points for all bayesian analyses this value is selected based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis on the effect of active points on the calculated marginal likelihood briefly the coefficient of variation cv of the marginal likelihood is estimated by running the ns algorithm five times using a different number of active points i e 20 50 100 200 as described in zeng et al 2018 only a negligible reduction in the cv is obtained when using more than 100 points this analysis is carried out to assess the stability of the estimator and its potential effect on models ranking 2 3 2 likelihood function and prior distributions if we assume that error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance σ 2 the likelihood function l ω can be written as 31 l ω i 1 k 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 h i ω y i 2 where h i ω and ỹ i are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively for algebraic simplicity the log likelihood ℓ ω is used 32 ℓ ω k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k h i ω y i 2 the measured data used in the bayesian model selection include three different types of measurements volumetric water content θ subsurface outflow q and tracer concentration c therefore the log likelihood function to be maximized is the aggregated sum of single likelihoods 33 ℓ ω ℓ θ ω ℓ q ω ℓ c ω uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in the following sections 2 3 3 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties and solute transport parameters four different model parameterizations are compared in the bayesian model selection framework conceptual m1 unimodal vgm m2 bimodal vgm m3 and dual porosity m4 this models set in combination with different type of measurements i e volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer breakthrough curve is expected to clarify the role of model complexity in gr s hydrological modeling the number of parameters to be estimated ranges between 3 and 9 thus indicating a moderately low dimensionality of the inverse problem the parameter bounds used in the analysis are reported in table 1 and are set based on a careful literature review brunetti et al 2016 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 schaap and leij 1999 and prior information available about soil texture furthermore parameters bounds are intentionally expanded to penalize model complexity the residual water content θ r is fixed to 0 0 which is a common value for coarse textured soils e g brunetti et al 2017 the conceptual model m1 previously described is implemented in the python programming language while the widely used hydrological finite element fe model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 is used for models m2 m3 m4 model m1 is intentionally simplified by discretizing the gr substrate in one single cell e g a single reservoir this spatial discretization reduces both the theoretical complexity of the computational cost of the model making it extremely attractive for a broad variety of users but can introduce significant numerical diffusion in the solution the irrigation rate and the evaporation flux are used as bc the hydrus 1d vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric bc is specified on the top boundary while a seepage face bc is used for the bottom boundary the quality of the fe mesh is assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus at the end of the simulation mass balance errors are constantly monitored for each single model execution during the bayesian analyses a low likelihood value is attributed to numerical simulations affected by mass balance errors higher than 2 or non convergent 2 4 information content of different observations in this section we further extend the analysis and describe the utility function used to assess the information content of the three different set of measurements used in the model selection framework this comparison is expected to provide for the first time statistically meaningful considerations on how different types of observations influence the model predictive uncertainty in gr analysis and can be of great interest to guide future gr experiments 2 4 1 kullback leibler divergence the main concern for any scientist planning an experiment is to optimize the design of a future experiment to achieve the best performance within expected experimental scenarios a utility function h has to be defined which specifies the best performance and evaluate different experimental designs h will depend both on the data d and parameters ω when dealing with model calibration the desired outcome of the experiment is to gain as much information as possible from observations to reduce our prior uncertainties about model properties this information gain is directly related to the distance between the prior and the posterior parameters distributions which can be statistically summarized in the kl divergence 34 h p ω ln p ω π ω d ω by integrating over the parameter space the kl distance measures what we can learn from the experimental data d therefore higher kl values indicate more informative observations 2 4 2 modelling scenarios in the present study the information gain from volumetric water content vwc subsurface outflow out and tracer concentration curve tr is estimated by coupling selected gr models with the multinest algorithm in particular the posterior distributions are estimated for each model selected in the bayesian model selection framework by assimilating in turn the three different data sets finally the kl divergences are calculated and compared to identify the most informative experimental design 3 results and discussion 3 1 green roof hydrological performance as mentioned in the introduction grs are able to retain delay and reduce surface runoff compared to traditional bare roofs hence the main hydrological performance of the testbed are hereby discussed before examining the results of the model complexity assessment which is the core of this work the measured outflow volume reduction during the whole experiment was 38 intuitively the retention efficiency was not constant but depended on the volumetric water content fig 3 on july 2nd the measured substrate moisture was 21 thus resulting in an outflow reduction of 66 conversely the retention efficiency dropped to 13 on july 5th when after three days of irrigation the volumetric water content reached 30 a similar behavior was encountered for the peak flow reduction and delay in particular on july 2nd the peak flow reduction and delay were 42 and 55 min respectively while on july 5th values were reduced to 14 and 25 min comparable results were reported in palermo et al 2019 for the same soil substrate who correlated the hydrological performance of a plot scale extensive gr with multiple factors such as precipitation depth and antecedent dry wet period in another study lee et al 2015 reported a runoff reduction ranging from 13 8 to 34 4 for a 15 cm deep gr 3 2 bayesian model selection 3 2 1 marginal likelihood the multinest algorithm required between 1565 m1 and 4146 m3 iterations to satisfy the convergence criteria the number of iterations increased nonlinearly with the dimensionality of the inverse problem interestingly the conceptual model m1 exhibits the highest marginal likelihood table 2 though the differences with other mechanistic models is very limited among them the dual porosity model m4 shows the best performance followed by the bimodal m3 and unimodal vgm m2 parameterizations however the difference between the estimated marginal likelihood appears not sufficient to justify the use of a dual porosity or bimodal approach for the hydraulic analysis of the gr overall the parameters uncertainty is limited for all models table 2 thus indicating a good information content of the measurements the median effective soil field capacity fc is estimated to be 0 3 cm3 cm3 fc is hereby considered as an effective value which is more compatible with what the forschungsgesellschaft landschaftsentwicklung landschaftsbau guidelines fll 2008 indicates as the soil moisture that is held within the gr soil after 2 h of drainage in this perspective the estimated fc agrees with what was reported in stovin et al 2015 and berretta et al 2014 for similar gr substrates both routing parameters a and b are precisely estimated the estimated saturated water content θ s varies between the mechanistic models m2 m3 m4 for model m2 the median value is 0 52 cm3 cm3 which is in line with what was reported in other studies for similar substrate brunetti et al 2016 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 a similar value is calculated for the dual porosity model m4 for which the sum of the median immobile and mobile saturated water contents yields 0 49 cm3 cm3 it must be emphasized that the contribution of the immobile domain on the water flow is rather limited i e θ s imm 0 05 cm3 cm3 thus suggesting that dual porosity tends to reduce to the single porosity approach of model m2 this is further confirmed by the similarity of the remaining vgm parameters in such circumstances the additional theoretical complexity of model m4 is not justified as demonstrated by the negligible gain in the marginal likelihood compared to model m1 table 2 the estimated median value of the shape parameter n for model m2 and m4 is comparable with what reported in other studies that measured soil hydraulic properties using the simplified evaporation method brunetti et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 conversely α is generally higher and compatible with a coarse textured soil this discrepancy can indicate the presence of film flow during the transient experiment which is not generally appreciable when applying the simplified evaporation method for the analysis of coarse soils under laboratory conditions peters and durner 2008 schelle et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017 the estimated tortuosity l assumes negative values for all mechanistic models this trend was already reported by schaap and leij 1999 in their comprehensive analysis on the hydraulic properties of 235 soil samples in which they concluded that a negative l could be intended as correction factor that causes a more gradual drop in conductivity this behavior is generally concurrent with an underestimation of the real hydraulic conductivity near saturation which is extremely sensitive to macropore and film flow schaap and leij 1999 our results support the presence of such processes as demonstrated by the estimated high α and negative l thus the estimated k s represent effective rather than real values finally the solute dispersivity λ l is similar for all models and characterized by limited uncertainty its values are compatible with the scale of the experiment vanderborght and vereecken 2007 while models m2 and m4 present similar results the model m3 i e bimodal deviates significantly θ s drops to 0 4 cm3 cm3 which appears to be unphysically low compared to models m2 and m3 and to the existing literature body e g brunetti et al 2016 a similar behavior is encountered for the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s this simultaneous reduction in θ s k s is mathematically expected since the model will compensate the lower conductivity values by simulating nearly saturated conditions which however have not been observed during the experiment therefore it can be hypothesized that the bimodal description overfits observations and that its further theoretical and mathematical complexity is not supported by measurements this is again demonstrated by the negligible increase in the estimated marginal likelihood reported in table 2 summarizing the bayesian model selection framework suggests that the parsimonious models m1 and m2 are the most suited to reproduce the hydraulic behavior of the gr with the conceptual being the most performant however the physical meaning of its parameters appears uncertain thus making their generalization difficult 3 2 2 model predictive checks to better investigate the models behavior the parameter uncertainty is propagated to generate posterior predictive checks which are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 thus representing a fundamental tool for model criticism posterior predictive checks grey lines in fig 3 of simulated volumetric water contents subsurface outflow and tracer breakthrough curve for all gr models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions as expected after the analysis of the marginal likelihoods the fitting quality is high and the predictive uncertainty grey lines in fig 3 is limited for all models which exhibit undistinguishable performance indeed all parameterizations well describe the fluctuations of the water content between wet and dry periods mechanistic models i e m2 m3 m4 underestimate the soil moisture at the beginning of the experiment while some bias is evident for the conceptual model m1 at the end of the observed period the former effect which disappears after few days of simulation can be related to some bias in the assumed initial conditions the substrate drying during irrigation events is well reproduced across all the simulated period on the other hand the subsurface outflow is slightly overestimated by all models thus suggesting potential model inaccuracies as well as uncertainties in the measured inflow rate though the discrepancy appears negligible this hypothesis is supported by the overestimation of the soil water content observed after july 16th fig 3 as well as by the bias in the simulated isotope concentrations nevertheless the limited uncertainty and the high fitting quality again support the use of parsimonious models for gr analysis and simultaneously suggest a high information content of the measured data this latter result is not surprising considering the controlled conditions of the experiment and the variety of measurements used in the bayesian framework 3 3 information content of different observations results of the bayesian model selection framework suggest that the conceptual m1 and the mechanistic unimodal vgm m2 models provide the most coherent level of model complexity to reproduce the hydraulic behavior of the gr therefore these two models are in turn coupled with the measured volumetric water content scenario vwc subsurface outflow scenario out and tracer concentrations scenario tr to calculate kl divergences and assess the information content of each measurement the calculated kl divergences for each data set and for the selected gr models are reported in table 3 overall the two models exhibit the same pattern which indicates that the volumetric water content provides the highest information content followed by the subsurface outflow and finally by the tracer breakthrough curve in particular the kl divergence for the vwc scenario for both models is almost six times the kl calculated for the tr this can be related to the high soil moisture variation induced by the alternation of wet and dry period during the experiment fig 3 which improves the information of the measurement on the other hand the high flow velocity in the gr can explain the lower informativeness of the tracer which is immediately routed to the outlet with limited residence time in the gr substrate interestingly the subsurface outflow leads to slightly higher kl values for the mechanistic model m2 and this can indicate that the parameterization of the numerical flux for the model m1 eq 3 underfits the measured data 3 3 1 posterior parameters distributions as mentioned before the kl divergence measures the distance between the prior and the posterior parameter distributions this effect is shown in fig 4 and fig 5 for the conceptual m1 and mechanistic m2 models respectively both figures report the posterior parameter distributions for each modeling scenarios with the axis ranges corresponding to the parameter bounds reported in table 1 as expected by the analysis of the kl divergences the use of the volumetric water content vwc for the inverse estimation leads to narrow posteriors and high parameters identifiability fig 4 at the same time the uncertainty tends to grow when only the measured subsurface outflow out is used and largely when only tracer data tr are assimilated the estimated posterior distributions for the effective field capacity fc exhibit similar patterns with the modes estimated around 0 3 cm3 cm3 the clear physical meaning of fc can explain the similar estimates among different modeling scenarios on the other hand both the routing parameters a and b present mixed posterior distributions patterns in particular both the subsurface outflow and the tracer data lead to significantly higher values of a compared to scenario vwc interestingly b is approximately 1 0 for scenario out this implies that eq 3 mathematically reduces to the typical tipping bucket approach described by emerman 1995 where all the water exceeding the effective field capacity is immediately drained from the soil overall such differences in the estimated routing parameters can be explained by their partial lack of physical meaning as well as by the effect of unpredictable experimental uncertainties the posterior parameters distributions for the unimodal vgm model m2 for different modeling scenarios are reported in fig 5 as for the conceptual model the use of the volumetric water content in the inverse estimation leads to highest uncertainty reduction followed by the subsurface outflow and then by the tracer data the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s exhibits a consistent behavior among models though the posteriors are wider and developed near the boundaries of the parameter space for scenario out and tr overall scenarios vwc and tr present similar estimates while scenario out deviates the modes of the posterior distributions of the vgm shape parameters α and n are both located around 0 6 and 1 4 respectively which are both physically realistic values for gr substrates conversely α and n are significantly higher for scenario out these values describe a fast soil desaturation and drainage which agrees with what observed for the conceptual model and suggests the presence of film flow finally the saturated water content appears underestimated for scenarios out and tr which mathematically counterbalance this effect on the water flux by increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity 3 3 2 model predictive assessment posterior distributions provide a statistical description of the uncertainty however to fully understand its consequences on the model results the uncertainty must be propagated in selected model predictions one of the most important features that a gr model must possess is the ability to correctly reproduce the subsurface outflow which is generally routed into the urban drainage systems an accurate description of the gr outflow summarizes the most important hydrological benefits i e peak delay peak attenuation etc and allows urban hydrologists to upscale predictions at the urban scale by doing so they can for instance estimate the reduction in conduits surcharges and combined sewer overflow which are crucial information in urban planning intuitively the lower is the uncertainty of the gr model predictions the higher is the confidence in the forecasted befits at the larger scale therefore we propagate the calculated posterior distributions in the models predictions to assess the effect of uncertainty on the simulated gr outflow this is done for the three modeling scenarios i e vwc out and tr and for the two selected models i e m1 and m2 posterior predictive checks of simulated gr outflow for the conceptual model m1 for each modeling scenarios are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions and are shown in fig 6 the predictive uncertainty is rather limited when the measured volumetric water content or the subsurface outflow are used to calibrate the model while it increases significantly when the tracer data are assimilated in the latter the simulated outflow can be severely underestimated therefore we can conclude that the tracer data don t have enough information content to constrain the predictions of the conceptual model for water flow still if not only interested in predicting the hydraulic behavior in green roofs but also getting information about solute transport tracers would be the only information content available to constrain a transport model as for the conceptual model we random sampled 100 solutions from the posterior distributions to obtain the predictive checks for the mechanistic model m2 for each modeling scenarios results are shown in fig 7 compared to the conceptual model the predictive model uncertainty remains limited for all modeling scenarios thus suggesting a more robust parameterization of the mechanistic model as expected from the previous analyses the measured volumetric water content and the tracer data lead to lowest and highest predictive uncertainty respectively though the differences are limited 4 conclusions the main aim of the present study was to provide for the first time a bayesian perspective of the model complexity for gr analysis and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different types of observations for gr experimental design to this aim we coupled the multinest algorithm with multiple conceptual and mechanistic models to reproduce the water flow and non reactive solute transport in a laboratory gr testbed measured volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer concentrations were used together and alternatively to calibrate models the multi level bayesian analysis provided meaningful results which can be summarized into two main points of discussion directly linked to the main objectives of the present study 1 a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of multiple conceptual and mechanistic gr models 2 a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the bayesian model selection framework compared four alternative parameterizations of the gr hydraulic behavior including conceptual and mechanistic models the results supported the use of parsimonious models in particular the conceptual and the unimodal vgm on the other hand the increment in the marginal likelihood obtained when using the bimodal vgm and the dual porosity approaches appears not sufficient to justify their use at the same time the bimodal vgm appeared to overfit measured data as demonstrated by the unphysical estimated values of some parameters e g saturated water content statistically the conceptual model exhibited the highest marginal likelihood though the difference was not significant to reject the mechanistic unimodal vgm parameterization which well reproduced measured data furthermore its physically based description increases the model generalizability compared to the conceptual model the comparison of multiple modeling scenarios suggested that the use of the measured volumetric water content in the model calibration leads to a more reliable parameters estimation and to the lowest predictive uncertainty for both the conceptual and mechanistic models this information is of great importance for gr experimental design in order to maximize the information content of the experiment and avoid measurements redundancy tracer data appeared to be less informative and this can mainly stem from the high flow velocity and limited residence time in the gr substrate still tracers are indispensable for also giving information about dispersivities which is crucial when studying transport processes in grs on the other hand parameters estimated using only the measured subsurface outflow tended to assume unrealistic values e g low saturated water content therefore care should be taken during the model calibration to not undermine the model generalizability the analysis of the outflow predictions showed how the conceptual model was more sensitive to the information content of the measured data compared to the mechanistic model this behavior poses some questions about the generalizability of the conceptual model which were already discussed further studies are needed to confirm the key findings of the present study in particular we advocate the use of plot scale data in the bayesian model selection framework to assess the effect of the atmospheric conditions and other plot scale uncertainties on the model selection in addition to that the propagation of the predictive uncertainty in urban scale models e g baek et al 2020 is recommended to assess how gr models uncertainty affect the urban hydrological balance and to provide a urban scale dimension declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to thank mr wolfgang sokol for

17800,green roofs grs have proven to be a sustainable solution to stormwater management in urban areas to boost their adoption at the large scale there is a need to develop numerical models which are accurate computationally cheap and as complex as needed to reproduce the hydrological behavior of grs alternative conceptual and mechanistic approaches have been proposed and tested however the most appropriate level of model complexity for grs analysis is still unknown to cover this scientific gap we provide a bayesian comprehensive perspective of gr hydrological modeling which includes a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of one conceptual and multiple richards based mechanistic gr models and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the analysis of the marginal likelihoods reveals that the conceptual and the unimodal van genuchten mualem models are the most appropriate parameterizations and that further layers of model complexity are not fully supported by the measurements in addition to that the estimated kullback leibler divergences suggest that the measured volumetric water content outperforms the measured subsurface outflow and tracer concentrations in terms of informativeness leading to the lowest model predictive uncertainty for the simulation of water fluxes the findings of this study represent a first step to clarify

are unlikely to succeed and would be prohibitively costly given the scale of vulnerability it is therefore crucial to invert the paradigm of urban planning and favor the transition towards an integrated and sustainable approach i e mitigate adapt avoid restore which is typical of the green economy green infrastructures gis such as green roofs grs are main actors of this change and can offer multiple environmental benefits though their benefits are more pronounced for small and medium precipitations grs are indeed able to significantly reduce peak rates of storm water runoff brunetti et al 2016 getter et al 2007 and retain rainfall volumes with retention efficiencies ranging from 40 to 80 bengtsson et al 2004 furthermore brunetti et al 2018a demonstrated how grs can significantly mitigate temperatures of the underlining building by exploiting the evaporative cooling effect despite these multifaceted benefits the adoption of such systems in urban areas is still limited among others one of the key limiting factors is the lack of appropriate modeling tools for the analysis and design of grs elliot and trowsdale 2007 roy poirier et al 2010 to have a widespread diffusion among practitioners the model should be accurate computationally cheap and as complex as needed to reproduce the hydrological behavior of grs indeed unjustified model complexity makes the numerical analysis of grs impractical for the broad audience of engineers and urban planners several gr models have been developed and tested in the literature and generally they can be grouped into two categories conceptual and mechanistic the former schematize the gr in multiple conceptual elements such as reservoirs and lumps the hydrological processes in few parameters thus reducing the computational cost and the overall model complexity e g kasmin et al 2010 however such a theoretical representation can potentially reduce the physical meaning of the model parameters thus limiting their generalizability johannessen et al 2019 on the other hand mechanistic models provide a more comprehensive and physically based description of the system although increasing the computational cost and the model complexity e g brunetti et al 2016 typical mechanistic models applied for gr analysis include for example hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 and swap van dam et al 2008 multiple studies have shown that both conceptual e g stovin et al 2015 vesuviano et al 2014 and mechanistic models e g brunetti et al 2016 hilten et al 2008 li and babcock 2015 metselaar 2012 palla et al 2009 when properly calibrated can accurately describe the hydraulic functioning of grs surprisingly only a few studies have focused on gr models comparison haowen et al 2019 palla et al 2012 and concluded that both conceptual and mechanistic models provided satisfactory results nevertheless the model comparison was focused only the fitting quality while the effect of the predictive uncertainty which can undermine the model s general applicability was completely neglected such approach cannot provide meaningful information about the appropriate level of model complexity which is a trade off between quality of fit and complexity indeed the model must be as simple as possible as complex as necessary höge et al 2018 to accurately reproduce observations and limit the predictive uncertainty in this perspective the bayesian model selection provides a statistically rigorous basis to compare alternative models in light of observations and any prior information available the core of the method is the numerical estimation of the bayesian evidence or marginal likelihood which condenses in a single value the fitting quality and the model s general applicability models characterized by high marginal likelihood are preferable however the computation of the marginal likelihood is numerically challenging as it involves a multi dimensional integration over the entire parameter space which is usually carried out using monte carlo techniques to this aim multiple studies have focused on developing or improving algorithms for the monte carlo determination of the marginal likelihood popular methods are based on the reversible jump algorithm green 1995 bridge sampling methods meng and wong 1996 steppinsgstone sampling elshall 2019 and thermodynamic integration friel and pettitt 2008 gelman and meng 1998 the latter has been successfully applied to hydrological problems liu et al 2016 wei et al 2019 though its high computational cost limits its widespread use to reduce the computational cost skilling 2006 proposed a one dimensional re parametrization of the integral of the bayesian model evidence which is at the basis of the nested sampling ns algorithm which has been applied successfully in several research fields elsheikh et al 2014 2013 mukherjee et al 2006 paulson et al 2019 schöniger et al 2014 shaw et al 2007 several variants have been proposed to improve the original algorithm brewer et al 2011 handley et al 2015 higson et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 of particular interest is the ellipsoidal rejection sampling scheme multinest proposed by feroz et al 2009 that allows to identify and isolate near gaussian posterior modes in small overlapping ellipsoids once identified these modes can be evolved independently thereby automatically accommodating posteriors degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems despite its potential the use of ns for hydrological model comparison is only partially exploited while it could be extremely beneficial to clarify the role of model complexity especially for gr numerical analysis another interesting feature of the ns algorithm is the possibility to simultaneously calculate the marginal likelihood the posterior parameters distributions and the kullback leibler kl divergence brewer 2017 skilling 2006 calls the latter the information which indicates how much can be learned about model parameters from observations statistically the kl divergence measures the distance between the prior and the posterior parameter distributions intuitively this distance grows when the observations are highly informative because our confidence in the parameter estimation increases i e uncertainty reduction from priors to posteriors the kl divergence is therefore of great interest because it can be used ex ante or ex post the experiment to evaluate the information content of the measurements for gr analysis it could provide important indications on the type and number of observations i e design of the experiment to be implemented in order to maximize the information and reduce the model predictive uncertainty indeed while it can be generally stated that varied i e different type and high resolution i e in space and time observations lead to informative experiments it must be as well emphasized that other factors such as budget limitation can limit the resources available making the design of the experiments challenging and uncertain such considerations are even more exacerbated when dealing with the investigation of complex physical processes or field scale installations in this perspective the use of alternative measurements such as tracers could be explored natural or artificial tracers are widely used in hydrology and soil science to characterize the water and solute transport at different scales brunetti et al 2020 kirchner 2003 stumpp et al 2009 while their application for gr analysis is completely unexplored therefore we provide for the first time a bayesian comprehensive perspective of gr hydrological modeling which includes a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of multiple conceptual and mechanistic gr models and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the main aim is to elucidate the role of model complexity in gr analysis and to provide meaningful indications on the information of different types of measurements for future gr experimental design the problem is addressed in the following way first one conceptual and three mechanistic models are coupled with multinest algorithm to perform the bayesian analysis measured volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer information from a controlled experiment on an extensive gr in a climate chamber are used for model calibration and uncertainty assessment then a bayesian model selection framework is applied to estimate the marginal likelihood for each model and identify the most justifiable levels of model complexity in light of observations finally the information content of each measurement is calculated by coupling selected gr models with the multinest algorithm to estimate and compare the kl divergences it must be emphasized that this study presents for the first time 1 a bayesian comparison of conceptual and mechanistic gr models 2 a probabilistic assessment of the information of different types of measurements 3 the use of an isotope tracer for the hydraulic characterization of gr 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 green roof description measured data used in the present work belong to a broader experimental campaign on the injection of wastewater on grs the experiment encompassed three testbeds two exposed to wastewater and one to pure water which served as control in the present study we focus only on the latter to avoid the uncertainties stemming from the application of the wastewater on the gr e g bioclogging of the soil surface a schematic of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the testbed consisted of a 15 cm high 57 cm long and 36 cm wide plastic box containing an extensive gr the box was placed on a wood frame to insulate the bottom and minimize the heat transfer from the surrounding environment a slope of 1 was set to convey the subsurface outflow to a circular hole and then to a plastic pipe for measurement and sampling multiple open ended capillary pipes connected to an external pumping system equipped with a reservoir were used to homogenously irrigate the gr which consisted of two layers a 12 cm deep soil substrate with a measured porosity and bulk density of 0 66 and 0 89 g cm3 respectively a 3 cm deep drainage layer consisting of coarse quartz gravel up to 15 mm the drainage layer guarantees the aeration of the roots avoid the saturation of the soil substrate and enhances the thermal attenuation of the gr cascone 2019 a highly permeable geotextile was used to separate the two layers which were carefully compacted during the testbed assembly to simulate real gr conditions and simultaneously minimize soil heterogeneities the vegetation consisted of two species frequently used for extensive grs brunetti et al 2016 alyssum lobularia maritima and cheddar pink dianthus gratianapolitanus both plant species were transplanted after a one week equilibration period in order to characterize the heat transport in the gr two thermocouples measured the temperature in the middle of the soil substrate and at the bottom of the drainage layer before the installation sensors were calibrated against a precision thermometer at the same time a coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometer stevens hydraprobe was used to measure the soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity in the gr substrate as suggested by kargas et al 2013 and seyfried et al 2005 a substrate specific calibration curve was developed in the laboratory to link the measured soil permittivity to the actual soil moisture and guarantee good measurement accuracy calibrated sensors were then installed jointly with gr layers to maximize the adhesion between the soil and the sensor rods a tipping bucket and an evaporation pan to measure the subsurface outflow and the evaporation demand respectively completed the measurement system which was connected to an external data logger the acquisition frequency was set to 1 min the assembled testbed was placed into a climate chamber where spring summer mediterranean climatic conditions were simulated fig 2 in particular the air temperature the relative humidity and the day night alternation were set to replicate measured data from a weather station in southern italy 39 33 n 16 18 e unfortunately no radiation intensity control was available in the chamber therefore only day night alternation was simulated 2 1 2 transient water flow and tracer experiment the experiment lasted one month and encompassed the transient water flow and the tracer injection to characterize the hydraulic behavior of the gr the irrigation schedule blue lines in fig 2 was designed to induce an alternation of wet and dry soil conditions which was expected to maximize the information content of the measured data as well as to minimize the plant water stress each irrigation event lasted 1 h during which 3 l of tap water were distributed on the soil surface except during the tracer experiment as shown in brunetti et al 2018a such irrigation pattern can significantly enhance the evaporative cooling efficiency of the gr the tracer experiment took place in the first week and consisted of the injection of deuterium 2h enriched water into the system with a measured concentration of 38 mg l deuterium in the inflowing water the tracer was injected continuously for 2 h the first day while only pure water was used in the next three days thus reaching a total injected water volume of 24 l during the first week of the experiment the outflow was sampled manually every 15 min and analyzed in the laboratory using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i to reconstruct tracer concentration curves it must be emphasized that while being a common practice in hydrology and soil science this study presents for the first time the use of a tracer for the characterization of the hydraulic behavior of grs 2 2 modeling the water flow and the solute transport in the green roof in this section a mathematical description of both the conceptual and mechanistic models is provided particular emphasis is given to the water flow root water uptake and non reactive solute transport the main assumptions in both models are that the hydraulic effect of the drainage layer is negligible and that the water flow is strictly vertical therefore the description focuses only on the one dimensional vertical water solute transport in the gr soil substrate these hypothesis seem admissible for multiple reasons 1 the coarse quartz gravel d 15 mm has negligible water retention capacity and high permeability naseri et al 2019 2 the low depth of the drainage layer i e 3 cm has small impact on the vertical water fluxes 3 water percolating from the soil substrate quickly infiltrates and accumulates at the bottom where it is immediately routed to the outlet due the limited length of the testbed i e 57 cm a similar assumption was used in brunetti et al 2016 2 2 1 conceptual model conceptual models for gr s hydrological analysis are often indicated in the literature as reservoir routing models e g stovin et al 2015 vesuviano et al 2014 while this definition is intuitively appealing it is mathematically misleading since the schematization of the water flow in multiple reservoirs with parameterized inflow and outflow is a simplification of the finite volume method fvm indeed in the fvm the numerical domain is discretized in multiple cells and for each edge the actual flow which is entering or leaving the cell is approximated using a certain numerical flux function f therefore in the present study the conceptual model is intentionally described in a fvm numerical framework the gr substrate is discretized in n cells of the same size the one dimensional vertical water flow and solute transport can be described as follows 1 u t f z s where u is the vector of the conserved variables t is time t f is the flux vector z is the vertical coordinate l and s is the source sink term vector vectors can be expressed as 2 u θ θ c f q q c s s 0 where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 q is the discharge lt 1 c is the solute concentration in the liquid phase ml 3 and s θ is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake the root solute uptake is considered negligible and the non reactive solute transport is assumed to be purely advective a corrected power law equation describes the discharge q 3 q a θ f c b if θ f c q 0 if θ f c where a and b are routing coefficients and fc is the effective soil field capacity l3l 3 eq 3 is a modification of the tipping bucket approach emerman 1995 schroeder et al 1994 as it assumes that the water flow below the field capacity is negligible while it grows exponentially above this value indeed if a b 1 the model generalizes to the classical tipping bucket approach used in several applications e g scanlon et al 2003 schroeder et al 1994 the coupled water solute transport is solved numerically using the method of lines mol the mol approach replaces the spatial derivatives in the partial differential equations pdes with an algebraic approximation which reduces the pde to an ordinary differential equation central to the mol is the numerical approximation of spatial derivatives in the present study the fvm is used to spatially discretize the subsurface domain the fvm is a well established and widely used numerical solution method for a variety of engineering problems involving pdes mainly because of its conservativeness the integral form of eq 1 is written as 4 t ω u d ω ω f d ω ω s d ω by applying the divergence theorem to the second term in eq 4 becomes 5 t ω u d ω ω f n d ω ω s d ω the contour integral in eq 5 is approximated using numerical fluxes f at the edge of each cell j thus leading to 6 d u j d t 1 δ x f j 1 2 f j 1 2 s j the approximation of the numerical fluxes f is central in the fvm since it affects the accuracy of the solution brufau et al 2002 brunetti et al 2018b van leer 1979 generally conceptual gr models use the simulated water depths in each reservoir to calculate the inflow outflow stovin et al 2012 vesuviano et al 2014 which mathematically corresponds to a first order approximation of the numerical flux in the fvm therefore to guarantee a fair results comparison with other studies the first order upwind scheme is adopted which describes numerical fluxes f as follows 7 f j 1 2 a θ j 1 f c b if θ j 1 f c f j 1 2 0 if θ j 1 f c the actual root water uptake is described as follows 8 s j θ ψ θ j s p where s p is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 and ψ θ is a dimensionless water stress response function that depends on the volumetric water content in the jth cell and ranges between 0 and 1 9 ψ θ j 1 if θ j fc ψ θ j θ j f c if θ j fc the potential transpiration rate s p is calculated from the measured evaporation demand in the chamber using the beer s law detailed explanation of evapotranspiration partitioning is given in sutanto et al 2012 and brunetti et al 2016 2019a the leaf area index lai at each time step is needed to partition evaporation and transpiration fluxes in the present study the plant growth in each compartment is assumed to be logistic therefore the lai can be expressed as 10 l a i t l a i max 1 l a i max l a i 0 1 exp k g r where lai max and lai 0 are the maximum and minimum lai indices in the simulated period respectively and k gr is the growth rate t 1 lai max and lai 0 were assumed to be 3 0 and 1 0 respectively blanusa et al 2013 while k gr was set to 0 15 1 day finally the fourth order explicit runge kutta dormand prince rkdp dormand and prince 1980 is adopted here to solve in time the coupled water solute transport due to its accuracy and computationally efficiency more specifically an rkdp algorithm with an adaptive time stepping strategy based on the truncation error control is used this kind of temporal discretization automatically adjusts the time step depending on the solution thus providing a dense temporal output near discontinuities the conceptual model formulation shares some similarities with the kinematic wave approach beven 1981 which cannot reproduce the effects of a downstream boundary condition bc on the water flow essentially these type of models can only predict the downstream movement of any disturbance on the water flow therefore the use of classical downstream bcs such as seepage face is not mathematically possible but it is partially reproducible by using eq 3 which assumes null water flow until relatively wet conditions i e field capacity are reached the upstream bc is generally set in terms of inflow outflow which is easily handled in fvm models by equaling the numerical flux in the edge cell with the inflow outflow value 2 2 2 mechanistic richards based models the one dimensional richards equation mechanistically describes the variably saturated water flow in the gr 11 θ t z k h h z 1 s h where t is time t z is the vertical coordinate l θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the pressure head l and s h is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake feddes et al 1978 defined s as 12 s h r s h z d z s p r β h z γ z d z where β h z is a dimensionless water stress response function that depends on the soil pressure head h γ z is a distribution function that accounts for root density and growth and s p is the potential transpiration rate as for the lai the root growth was assumed to be logistic and vary between an initial root depth of 4 cm and a final value of 12 cm which is compatible with the homogeneous root distribution observed in the substrate at the end of the experiment a parameterization of the soil hydraulic properties is needed to solve eq 11 in the present study three different mechanistic parameterizations are compared unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm van genuchten 1980 bimodal vgm durner 1994 and dual porosity simunek et al 2003 while the unimodal vgm is mostly suited for homogeneous soils the bimodal vgm and dual porosity account for soil heterogeneities and preferential flow respectively the choice to include these models in the bayesian complexity assessment is justified by both scientific considerations and previous studies in particular brunetti et al 2016 highlighted how both the unimodal and bimodal vgm give a satisfactory description of the hydraulic behavior of a gr substrate by comparing modeling results with observations from a plot scale gr experimental facility the bimodal structure of multiple gr substrates was confirmed also in hill et al 2019 the simultaneous presence of coarse material and high organic matter can trigger highly conductive flow paths and at the same time generate immobile zones in the finer pore regions of the gr substrate where the water could be stored this physical process which was never investigated in the past for grs can be described using the dual porosity approach even though the soil packing in the testbed was carefully conducted the occurrence of heterogeneities in the porous medium cannot be excluded a priori the execution time of a single model run for each mechanistic parameterization was low 5 s thus not posing particular computational issues to the bayesian analysis the unimodal vgm is described as follows 13 θ θ s θ r α h α h α h n m θ r if h 0 θ s if h 0 14 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 15 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 i f h 0 k s i f h 0 16 m 1 1 n where θ r l3l 3 is the residual water content θ s l3l 3 is the saturated water content k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity n is a pore size distribution index α is a parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure l 1 l indicates the tortuosity and θ is the effective saturation on the other hand the bimodal model of durner 1994 which constructs the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions by a linear superposition of two or more van genuchten mualem functions is described as follows 17 θ i 1 2 w i 1 α i h α i h α i h n i m i if h 0 1 if h 0 18 k k s i 1 2 w i θ i l i 1 2 w i α i 1 α i h n i θ i i 1 2 w i α i 2 if h 0 k s if h 0 where w is a weighing factor and i refers to the ith pore system in the dual porosity approach the liquid phase is divided into two domains 19 θ θ f θ i m m where subscript f refers to the mobile fracture system and subscript imm refers to the immobile matrix domain the dual porosity water flow formulation is based on a modified richards equation for flow in fractures and a mass balance equation for moisture dynamics in the matrix 20 θ f z z k h h z 1 s h γ w 21 θ i m m t γ w where γ w is the mass transfer between two domains which is assumed to be proportional to the difference in effective saturations of the two regions simunek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 22 γ w ω θ f θ i m m where ω is a first order coefficient t 1 the tracer transport in the gr is mechanistically described using the advection dispersion equation assuming that solute can exist only in the liquid phase 23 θ c t θ d w c q c where c is the tracer concentration ml 3 d w is the tracer dispersion in water l2t 1 q is the water flux lt 1 the dispersion d w is expressed as 24 θ d w λ q where λ is the dispersivity l the effect of the molecular diffusion is neglected 2 3 bayesian model selection 2 3 1 multinest algorithm in the present study the marginal likelihood is used to compare models the estimation of the marginal likelihood and parameter posterior distributions is carried out by coupling different gr s models with the multinest algorithm which was chosen due to it significant flexibility in the posterior exploration in particular this ellipsoidal decomposition algorithm automatically accommodates elongated curving degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems furthermore it also specifically enables the identification of distinct modes by isolating non overlapping subsets of the ellipsoidal decomposition so identified these distinct modes can then be evolved independently feroz et al 2013 for simplicity only a general overview of the method is provided while detailed descriptions about the theoretical background and numerical implementation can be found in skilling 2006 mukherjee et al 2006 and feroz et al 2009 the bayesian paradigm is a statistical approach for the estimation of a set of parameters ω in a model h for the data d 25 pr ω d h pr d ω h pr ω h pr d h where pr ω d h p ω is the posterior probability of the parameters pr d ω h l ω is the likelihood pr ω h π ω is the prior and pr d h z is the marginal likelihood or bayesian model evidence which can be expressed as 26 z l ω π ω d d ω where d is the dimensionality of the parameter space the bayesian evidence is the average of the likelihood over the prior and it is expected to be smaller for a model with large areas in its parameter space having low likelihood even if the likelihood function is highly peaked and larger for a model with higher likelihood of model parameters in a larger fraction of its parameter space the multinest algorithm belongs to the class of ns estimators the core of the method is the transformation of the multi dimensional integral in eq 26 to a one dimensional integral to this end the prior mass x can be defined as the cumulative prior mass covering all likelihood values greater than the iso likelihood contour ω 27 x ω l ω ω π ω d d ω for the case of normalized prior probability the prior mass x has a value 1 if ω 0 and decreases to 0 as ω approaches 1 defining the inverse function l x as the likelihood which bounds a prior mass x one can simplify eq 26 from a multi dimensional integral over the prior volume to a one dimensional integral over the prior mass 28 z 0 1 l x d x the multinest algorithm provides an iterative process to solve eq 28 at each iteration i n active samples are drawn from the prior samples are then sorted in order of their likelihood and the smallest with likelihood l 0 is removed from the active set and replaced by a point drawn from the prior subject to the constraint that the point has a likelihood l l 0 the iterative process is stopped when the stopping criterion is satisfied the algorithm thus travels through nested shells of likelihood as the prior volume is shrunk once the evidence z is estimated posterior parameter distributions and associated weights can be inferred using the full sequence of discarded points from the nested sampling process the most challenging task is sampling from the prior with the hard constraint l l 0 the multinest algorithm solves this problem by combining the ellipsoidal nested sampling mukherjee et al 2006 with the recursive clustering shaw et al 2007 that is particularly suited for degenerated multimodal posterior distributions which are often encountered when inversely estimating soil hydraulic and transport parameters e g brunetti et al 2019b it can be assumed that the posterior bulk was explored sufficiently when the active points in sum incremented the evidence by only some small fraction of the total accumulated evidence more specifically the currently active point with the highest likelihood gives an estimate of the highest likelihood in the region the remaining evidence at iteration i is estimated according to 29 z e s t l max x i where xi is the remaining prior volume the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence and the current evidence 30 log z i z e s t log z e s t 0 5 furthermore to avoid the premature stopping of the algorithm the maximum number of algorithm iterations is set to 100 000 such threshold value was never reached during the simulations in this study the active set consists of 100 points for all bayesian analyses this value is selected based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis on the effect of active points on the calculated marginal likelihood briefly the coefficient of variation cv of the marginal likelihood is estimated by running the ns algorithm five times using a different number of active points i e 20 50 100 200 as described in zeng et al 2018 only a negligible reduction in the cv is obtained when using more than 100 points this analysis is carried out to assess the stability of the estimator and its potential effect on models ranking 2 3 2 likelihood function and prior distributions if we assume that error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance σ 2 the likelihood function l ω can be written as 31 l ω i 1 k 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 h i ω y i 2 where h i ω and ỹ i are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively for algebraic simplicity the log likelihood ℓ ω is used 32 ℓ ω k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k h i ω y i 2 the measured data used in the bayesian model selection include three different types of measurements volumetric water content θ subsurface outflow q and tracer concentration c therefore the log likelihood function to be maximized is the aggregated sum of single likelihoods 33 ℓ ω ℓ θ ω ℓ q ω ℓ c ω uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in the following sections 2 3 3 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties and solute transport parameters four different model parameterizations are compared in the bayesian model selection framework conceptual m1 unimodal vgm m2 bimodal vgm m3 and dual porosity m4 this models set in combination with different type of measurements i e volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer breakthrough curve is expected to clarify the role of model complexity in gr s hydrological modeling the number of parameters to be estimated ranges between 3 and 9 thus indicating a moderately low dimensionality of the inverse problem the parameter bounds used in the analysis are reported in table 1 and are set based on a careful literature review brunetti et al 2016 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 schaap and leij 1999 and prior information available about soil texture furthermore parameters bounds are intentionally expanded to penalize model complexity the residual water content θ r is fixed to 0 0 which is a common value for coarse textured soils e g brunetti et al 2017 the conceptual model m1 previously described is implemented in the python programming language while the widely used hydrological finite element fe model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 is used for models m2 m3 m4 model m1 is intentionally simplified by discretizing the gr substrate in one single cell e g a single reservoir this spatial discretization reduces both the theoretical complexity of the computational cost of the model making it extremely attractive for a broad variety of users but can introduce significant numerical diffusion in the solution the irrigation rate and the evaporation flux are used as bc the hydrus 1d vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric bc is specified on the top boundary while a seepage face bc is used for the bottom boundary the quality of the fe mesh is assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus at the end of the simulation mass balance errors are constantly monitored for each single model execution during the bayesian analyses a low likelihood value is attributed to numerical simulations affected by mass balance errors higher than 2 or non convergent 2 4 information content of different observations in this section we further extend the analysis and describe the utility function used to assess the information content of the three different set of measurements used in the model selection framework this comparison is expected to provide for the first time statistically meaningful considerations on how different types of observations influence the model predictive uncertainty in gr analysis and can be of great interest to guide future gr experiments 2 4 1 kullback leibler divergence the main concern for any scientist planning an experiment is to optimize the design of a future experiment to achieve the best performance within expected experimental scenarios a utility function h has to be defined which specifies the best performance and evaluate different experimental designs h will depend both on the data d and parameters ω when dealing with model calibration the desired outcome of the experiment is to gain as much information as possible from observations to reduce our prior uncertainties about model properties this information gain is directly related to the distance between the prior and the posterior parameters distributions which can be statistically summarized in the kl divergence 34 h p ω ln p ω π ω d ω by integrating over the parameter space the kl distance measures what we can learn from the experimental data d therefore higher kl values indicate more informative observations 2 4 2 modelling scenarios in the present study the information gain from volumetric water content vwc subsurface outflow out and tracer concentration curve tr is estimated by coupling selected gr models with the multinest algorithm in particular the posterior distributions are estimated for each model selected in the bayesian model selection framework by assimilating in turn the three different data sets finally the kl divergences are calculated and compared to identify the most informative experimental design 3 results and discussion 3 1 green roof hydrological performance as mentioned in the introduction grs are able to retain delay and reduce surface runoff compared to traditional bare roofs hence the main hydrological performance of the testbed are hereby discussed before examining the results of the model complexity assessment which is the core of this work the measured outflow volume reduction during the whole experiment was 38 intuitively the retention efficiency was not constant but depended on the volumetric water content fig 3 on july 2nd the measured substrate moisture was 21 thus resulting in an outflow reduction of 66 conversely the retention efficiency dropped to 13 on july 5th when after three days of irrigation the volumetric water content reached 30 a similar behavior was encountered for the peak flow reduction and delay in particular on july 2nd the peak flow reduction and delay were 42 and 55 min respectively while on july 5th values were reduced to 14 and 25 min comparable results were reported in palermo et al 2019 for the same soil substrate who correlated the hydrological performance of a plot scale extensive gr with multiple factors such as precipitation depth and antecedent dry wet period in another study lee et al 2015 reported a runoff reduction ranging from 13 8 to 34 4 for a 15 cm deep gr 3 2 bayesian model selection 3 2 1 marginal likelihood the multinest algorithm required between 1565 m1 and 4146 m3 iterations to satisfy the convergence criteria the number of iterations increased nonlinearly with the dimensionality of the inverse problem interestingly the conceptual model m1 exhibits the highest marginal likelihood table 2 though the differences with other mechanistic models is very limited among them the dual porosity model m4 shows the best performance followed by the bimodal m3 and unimodal vgm m2 parameterizations however the difference between the estimated marginal likelihood appears not sufficient to justify the use of a dual porosity or bimodal approach for the hydraulic analysis of the gr overall the parameters uncertainty is limited for all models table 2 thus indicating a good information content of the measurements the median effective soil field capacity fc is estimated to be 0 3 cm3 cm3 fc is hereby considered as an effective value which is more compatible with what the forschungsgesellschaft landschaftsentwicklung landschaftsbau guidelines fll 2008 indicates as the soil moisture that is held within the gr soil after 2 h of drainage in this perspective the estimated fc agrees with what was reported in stovin et al 2015 and berretta et al 2014 for similar gr substrates both routing parameters a and b are precisely estimated the estimated saturated water content θ s varies between the mechanistic models m2 m3 m4 for model m2 the median value is 0 52 cm3 cm3 which is in line with what was reported in other studies for similar substrate brunetti et al 2016 hill et al 2019 sandoval et al 2017 a similar value is calculated for the dual porosity model m4 for which the sum of the median immobile and mobile saturated water contents yields 0 49 cm3 cm3 it must be emphasized that the contribution of the immobile domain on the water flow is rather limited i e θ s imm 0 05 cm3 cm3 thus suggesting that dual porosity tends to reduce to the single porosity approach of model m2 this is further confirmed by the similarity of the remaining vgm parameters in such circumstances the additional theoretical complexity of model m4 is not justified as demonstrated by the negligible gain in the marginal likelihood compared to model m1 table 2 the estimated median value of the shape parameter n for model m2 and m4 is comparable with what reported in other studies that measured soil hydraulic properties using the simplified evaporation method brunetti et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 conversely α is generally higher and compatible with a coarse textured soil this discrepancy can indicate the presence of film flow during the transient experiment which is not generally appreciable when applying the simplified evaporation method for the analysis of coarse soils under laboratory conditions peters and durner 2008 schelle et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017 the estimated tortuosity l assumes negative values for all mechanistic models this trend was already reported by schaap and leij 1999 in their comprehensive analysis on the hydraulic properties of 235 soil samples in which they concluded that a negative l could be intended as correction factor that causes a more gradual drop in conductivity this behavior is generally concurrent with an underestimation of the real hydraulic conductivity near saturation which is extremely sensitive to macropore and film flow schaap and leij 1999 our results support the presence of such processes as demonstrated by the estimated high α and negative l thus the estimated k s represent effective rather than real values finally the solute dispersivity λ l is similar for all models and characterized by limited uncertainty its values are compatible with the scale of the experiment vanderborght and vereecken 2007 while models m2 and m4 present similar results the model m3 i e bimodal deviates significantly θ s drops to 0 4 cm3 cm3 which appears to be unphysically low compared to models m2 and m3 and to the existing literature body e g brunetti et al 2016 a similar behavior is encountered for the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s this simultaneous reduction in θ s k s is mathematically expected since the model will compensate the lower conductivity values by simulating nearly saturated conditions which however have not been observed during the experiment therefore it can be hypothesized that the bimodal description overfits observations and that its further theoretical and mathematical complexity is not supported by measurements this is again demonstrated by the negligible increase in the estimated marginal likelihood reported in table 2 summarizing the bayesian model selection framework suggests that the parsimonious models m1 and m2 are the most suited to reproduce the hydraulic behavior of the gr with the conceptual being the most performant however the physical meaning of its parameters appears uncertain thus making their generalization difficult 3 2 2 model predictive checks to better investigate the models behavior the parameter uncertainty is propagated to generate posterior predictive checks which are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 thus representing a fundamental tool for model criticism posterior predictive checks grey lines in fig 3 of simulated volumetric water contents subsurface outflow and tracer breakthrough curve for all gr models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions as expected after the analysis of the marginal likelihoods the fitting quality is high and the predictive uncertainty grey lines in fig 3 is limited for all models which exhibit undistinguishable performance indeed all parameterizations well describe the fluctuations of the water content between wet and dry periods mechanistic models i e m2 m3 m4 underestimate the soil moisture at the beginning of the experiment while some bias is evident for the conceptual model m1 at the end of the observed period the former effect which disappears after few days of simulation can be related to some bias in the assumed initial conditions the substrate drying during irrigation events is well reproduced across all the simulated period on the other hand the subsurface outflow is slightly overestimated by all models thus suggesting potential model inaccuracies as well as uncertainties in the measured inflow rate though the discrepancy appears negligible this hypothesis is supported by the overestimation of the soil water content observed after july 16th fig 3 as well as by the bias in the simulated isotope concentrations nevertheless the limited uncertainty and the high fitting quality again support the use of parsimonious models for gr analysis and simultaneously suggest a high information content of the measured data this latter result is not surprising considering the controlled conditions of the experiment and the variety of measurements used in the bayesian framework 3 3 information content of different observations results of the bayesian model selection framework suggest that the conceptual m1 and the mechanistic unimodal vgm m2 models provide the most coherent level of model complexity to reproduce the hydraulic behavior of the gr therefore these two models are in turn coupled with the measured volumetric water content scenario vwc subsurface outflow scenario out and tracer concentrations scenario tr to calculate kl divergences and assess the information content of each measurement the calculated kl divergences for each data set and for the selected gr models are reported in table 3 overall the two models exhibit the same pattern which indicates that the volumetric water content provides the highest information content followed by the subsurface outflow and finally by the tracer breakthrough curve in particular the kl divergence for the vwc scenario for both models is almost six times the kl calculated for the tr this can be related to the high soil moisture variation induced by the alternation of wet and dry period during the experiment fig 3 which improves the information of the measurement on the other hand the high flow velocity in the gr can explain the lower informativeness of the tracer which is immediately routed to the outlet with limited residence time in the gr substrate interestingly the subsurface outflow leads to slightly higher kl values for the mechanistic model m2 and this can indicate that the parameterization of the numerical flux for the model m1 eq 3 underfits the measured data 3 3 1 posterior parameters distributions as mentioned before the kl divergence measures the distance between the prior and the posterior parameter distributions this effect is shown in fig 4 and fig 5 for the conceptual m1 and mechanistic m2 models respectively both figures report the posterior parameter distributions for each modeling scenarios with the axis ranges corresponding to the parameter bounds reported in table 1 as expected by the analysis of the kl divergences the use of the volumetric water content vwc for the inverse estimation leads to narrow posteriors and high parameters identifiability fig 4 at the same time the uncertainty tends to grow when only the measured subsurface outflow out is used and largely when only tracer data tr are assimilated the estimated posterior distributions for the effective field capacity fc exhibit similar patterns with the modes estimated around 0 3 cm3 cm3 the clear physical meaning of fc can explain the similar estimates among different modeling scenarios on the other hand both the routing parameters a and b present mixed posterior distributions patterns in particular both the subsurface outflow and the tracer data lead to significantly higher values of a compared to scenario vwc interestingly b is approximately 1 0 for scenario out this implies that eq 3 mathematically reduces to the typical tipping bucket approach described by emerman 1995 where all the water exceeding the effective field capacity is immediately drained from the soil overall such differences in the estimated routing parameters can be explained by their partial lack of physical meaning as well as by the effect of unpredictable experimental uncertainties the posterior parameters distributions for the unimodal vgm model m2 for different modeling scenarios are reported in fig 5 as for the conceptual model the use of the volumetric water content in the inverse estimation leads to highest uncertainty reduction followed by the subsurface outflow and then by the tracer data the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s exhibits a consistent behavior among models though the posteriors are wider and developed near the boundaries of the parameter space for scenario out and tr overall scenarios vwc and tr present similar estimates while scenario out deviates the modes of the posterior distributions of the vgm shape parameters α and n are both located around 0 6 and 1 4 respectively which are both physically realistic values for gr substrates conversely α and n are significantly higher for scenario out these values describe a fast soil desaturation and drainage which agrees with what observed for the conceptual model and suggests the presence of film flow finally the saturated water content appears underestimated for scenarios out and tr which mathematically counterbalance this effect on the water flux by increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity 3 3 2 model predictive assessment posterior distributions provide a statistical description of the uncertainty however to fully understand its consequences on the model results the uncertainty must be propagated in selected model predictions one of the most important features that a gr model must possess is the ability to correctly reproduce the subsurface outflow which is generally routed into the urban drainage systems an accurate description of the gr outflow summarizes the most important hydrological benefits i e peak delay peak attenuation etc and allows urban hydrologists to upscale predictions at the urban scale by doing so they can for instance estimate the reduction in conduits surcharges and combined sewer overflow which are crucial information in urban planning intuitively the lower is the uncertainty of the gr model predictions the higher is the confidence in the forecasted befits at the larger scale therefore we propagate the calculated posterior distributions in the models predictions to assess the effect of uncertainty on the simulated gr outflow this is done for the three modeling scenarios i e vwc out and tr and for the two selected models i e m1 and m2 posterior predictive checks of simulated gr outflow for the conceptual model m1 for each modeling scenarios are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions and are shown in fig 6 the predictive uncertainty is rather limited when the measured volumetric water content or the subsurface outflow are used to calibrate the model while it increases significantly when the tracer data are assimilated in the latter the simulated outflow can be severely underestimated therefore we can conclude that the tracer data don t have enough information content to constrain the predictions of the conceptual model for water flow still if not only interested in predicting the hydraulic behavior in green roofs but also getting information about solute transport tracers would be the only information content available to constrain a transport model as for the conceptual model we random sampled 100 solutions from the posterior distributions to obtain the predictive checks for the mechanistic model m2 for each modeling scenarios results are shown in fig 7 compared to the conceptual model the predictive model uncertainty remains limited for all modeling scenarios thus suggesting a more robust parameterization of the mechanistic model as expected from the previous analyses the measured volumetric water content and the tracer data lead to lowest and highest predictive uncertainty respectively though the differences are limited 4 conclusions the main aim of the present study was to provide for the first time a bayesian perspective of the model complexity for gr analysis and a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different types of observations for gr experimental design to this aim we coupled the multinest algorithm with multiple conceptual and mechanistic models to reproduce the water flow and non reactive solute transport in a laboratory gr testbed measured volumetric water content subsurface outflow and tracer concentrations were used together and alternatively to calibrate models the multi level bayesian analysis provided meaningful results which can be summarized into two main points of discussion directly linked to the main objectives of the present study 1 a statistically rigorous bayesian comparison of multiple conceptual and mechanistic gr models 2 a probabilistic assessment of the information content of different observations the bayesian model selection framework compared four alternative parameterizations of the gr hydraulic behavior including conceptual and mechanistic models the results supported the use of parsimonious models in particular the conceptual and the unimodal vgm on the other hand the increment in the marginal likelihood obtained when using the bimodal vgm and the dual porosity approaches appears not sufficient to justify their use at the same time the bimodal vgm appeared to overfit measured data as demonstrated by the unphysical estimated values of some parameters e g saturated water content statistically the conceptual model exhibited the highest marginal likelihood though the difference was not significant to reject the mechanistic unimodal vgm parameterization which well reproduced measured data furthermore its physically based description increases the model generalizability compared to the conceptual model the comparison of multiple modeling scenarios suggested that the use of the measured volumetric water content in the model calibration leads to a more reliable parameters estimation and to the lowest predictive uncertainty for both the conceptual and mechanistic models this information is of great importance for gr experimental design in order to maximize the information content of the experiment and avoid measurements redundancy tracer data appeared to be less informative and this can mainly stem from the high flow velocity and limited residence time in the gr substrate still tracers are indispensable for also giving information about dispersivities which is crucial when studying transport processes in grs on the other hand parameters estimated using only the measured subsurface outflow tended to assume unrealistic values e g low saturated water content therefore care should be taken during the model calibration to not undermine the model generalizability the analysis of the outflow predictions showed how the conceptual model was more sensitive to the information content of the measured data compared to the mechanistic model this behavior poses some questions about the generalizability of the conceptual model which were already discussed further studies are needed to confirm the key findings of the present study in particular we advocate the use of plot scale data in the bayesian model selection framework to assess the effect of the atmospheric conditions and other plot scale uncertainties on the model selection in addition to that the propagation of the predictive uncertainty in urban scale models e g baek et al 2020 is recommended to assess how gr models uncertainty affect the urban hydrological balance and to provide a urban scale dimension declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

et al 2017 laura et al 2014 gabhi et al 2017 chen et al 2019 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi fe 0 is another newly developed material with high specific surface area and strong reducibility and has extensive environmental application in water treatment to remove organic compounds such as azo dyes chlorinated hydrocarbons and pharmaceutical wastewater nguyen et al 2018 segura et al 2013 in addition nzvi is a potential material for organic chloride treatment owing to its excellent dechlorination performance eq 3 lien and zhang 2001 lowry and johnson 2004 therefore nzvi bc integrates their advantages to improve conductivity and sorption performance jiang et al 2018 as a carrier bc can effectively reduce the agglomeration of nzvi in aqueous media guan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 however limited research involves electrodes modified by nzvi bc in the ef system for pollutant degradation 3 fe rcl h fe2 rh c1 the nzvi bc electrodes in 3d ice ef system can effectively solve problems of the traditional fenton system by its excellent adsorption nzvi bc can effectively concentrate pollutants on electrodes eliminate pollutants with anodic oxidation and oh produced on cathode and achieve self cleaning effect nzvi bc covered on anode can also consistently provide fe2 for 3d ice ef system eq 4 in addition persistent free radicals pfrs of bc can significantly promote h2o2 activation in the ef system fang et al 2014 excellent adsorption of bc is presented in alkaline conditions xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore even in alkaline conditions adsorption of electrodes and anodic oxidation of 3d ice ef system can also play important roles in elimination of contaminants 4 fe 2e fe2 the circular utilization of fe is of potential significance to economize materials and costs in the fenton system zhou et al 2016 li et al 2016 fe3 and h2o2 can react to reproduce fe2 by eq 6 but its reaction rate is considerably less than that of eq 2 as a result residual fe3 in aqueous solution can accumulate convert into fe oh 3 known as iron mud and deposit on electrode to slow or inhibit reactions hydroquinone hq and 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq on the cathode can create the circulations of fe and quinone eq 7 10 to continually generate oh zhou et al 2016 hydroperoxyl radical ho2 plays a significant role in the quinone cycle of 3d ice ef system produced by eq 5 in situ which can convert 1 4 bq into hq at the rate of 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 9 and 10 the reaction process is as follows hq can function as reductants to fe3 and the reaction products are 1 4 bq and fe2 eq 7 and 8 the produced fe2 continues to activate h2o2 but 1 4 bq is converted into hq eq 9 and 10 with hydroperoxyl radical ho2 produced by eqs 5 and 6 as reductant quinone cycle can effectively deal with the problems of the circular utilization of fe and iron mud deposition at the same time in addition the removal efficiency of pollutants under alkaline conditions in 3d ice ef system can be considerably improved by the application of hq and nzvi bc because of the reproduction of fe2 and effective adsorption 5 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h k 0 02 m 1 s 1 7 c6h6o2

utilization of waste biomass has always been considered an important international issue in the environment field such as the preparation and modification of bc in this work the adsorption property and performance in 3d ice ef system of bamboo waste bc and its modified version by nzvi bc are measured using clo as the target contaminant degradation products of clo are identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms to determine the degradation mechanisms of clo in 3d ice ef system the possible degradation pathways and plausible mechanisms are speculated on the basis of the synthetic analysis of functional group changes and quantitative analysis of degradation products the ecotoxicity to the aquatic organisms by degradation products of clo in 3d ice ef system is also evaluated in detail to our best knowledge this is the first systematic study associated with degradation products mechanism and toxicity variation of neos in the electrochemical system 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bc and nzvi bc bamboo waste block phyllostachys pubescens was rinsed by milli q water for three times and dried to be constant weight in an air circulating oven at 105 c after being transferred in a porcelain boat the dried bamboo was pyrolyzed in nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h in a tube furnace at 800 c the pyrolyzed bamboo was powdered by a disintegrator and sieved by 120 mesh sieves bc powder was deashed by 1 mol l of hcl solution for 4 h when the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 0 1 with naoh and hcl bc was repeatedly flushed and filtrated and then dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven for 4 h the final bc powder was preserved under dried condition and marked as bc feso4 7h2o 2 g was dissolved in an ethanol water solvent v v 7 3 with 0 5 g of polyethylene glycol 400 and 4 g of bc before the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 25 c in a flask with three necks nabh4 solution 50 ml 1 mol l was slowly dripped into the mixture in nitrogen atmosphere and then stirred together for 30 min eq 11 the bc was washed by milli q water and absolute ethanol for three times and freeze dried for 12 h the bc powder was preserved under dried condition and marked as nzvi bc 11 fe2 bh4 fe b oh 3 h2o 2 2 apparatus the 3d ice ef system was utilized in a divided cell with an upper reaction chamber 3 cm 5 cm 6 cm and a lower air chamber 3 cm 5 cm 2 cm fig s1 nzvi bc 0 3 g was used as anode covering on ruo2 ti mesh with 1 ml of ptfe 30 for uniform current distribution the air diffusion cathode was divided into two layers namely conductive carbon fabric and nickel screen one side of the carbon fabric was uniformly covered with 0 3 g of nzvi bc 15 mg of hq and 1 ml of ptfe the nzvi bc particles were attached to the ruo2 ti mesh and carbon fabric by ptfe ptfe is a type of cementing material with high corrosion resistance it is widely used in the preparation of composite electrodes zhang et al 2015 garcia rodriguez et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 hq was directly dissolved in the mixture of ptfe and milli q water prior to the preparation of nzvi bc cathode the identification experiment of degradation products was conducted without hq on cathode to avoid interference of impurities 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nzvi bc and bc the characterization results of nzvi bc and bc are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the morphology of bc and nzvi bc was characterized by fe sem analysis as shown in fig 1a b bc made from waste bamboo has a compact skeletal structure and tiny honeycombed multipore particles which are considered potential electrochemical adsorption structures chen et al 2019 after modification nzvi was deposited on the surface of the multipore structure by liquid phase reduction as shown in fig 1c by comparison with the length scale the diameter of nzvi particles was distributed in the range of 10 100 nm the formation of nzvi was further confirmed by the characterization of xps and xrd in fig 2b and c respectively the surface chemical composition of bc and nzvi bc was studied by xps analysis except for c and o elements si element was observed on the surface of bc and nzvi bc probably due to silica contents in bamboo plants the peaks of fe 2p ranging from 702 ev to 725 ev and fe 3p ranging from 50 ev to 60 ev indicate the simultaneous presence of nzvi and its oxidation products zhang et al 2015 similarly the higher peaks of o element in the spectra of nzvi bc compared with those of bc also demonstrate that nzvi bc were partially oxidized in the preparation or storage process however the xrd spectra of nzvi bc abundantly indicate that oxidized nzvi only accounts for a tiny percentage and most nzvi exists as elementary substance the phase structure of bc and nzvi bc were studied by xrd analysis the highest peak at 44 9 in the nzvi bc spectra belongs to nzvi indicating that elemental fe has high crystallinity and content in the nzvi bc particles a wide diffraction peak at 24 3 in the bc spectra indicates the presence of amorphous carbon phase structure c element the spectra indicate relatively high graphitization degree of bc which is highly related to good electric conductivity raj and joy 2015 the surface functional group of bc and nzvi bc was studied by ftir analysis a stronger stretching vibration was observed at 3200 3600 cm 1 o h and n h groups of nzvi bc absorption band than that of bc indicating that stronger adsorption capacity of nzvi bc lead to more adsorbed water chen et al 2019 diversity of functional groups including cc aromatic cooh and c n o explains that bc and nzvi bc can be utilized for the adsorption removal of multiple contaminants mayakaduwa et al 2016 nzvi and bc are excellent adsorbents with good conductivity gabhi et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yao et al 2012 bc was carbonized at 800 c for 4 h in nitrogen atmosphere protection and had an upper extent of carbonization degree fig 2b and c the adsorption of clo and production of oh eq 2 and 6 can simultaneously occur on the surface of nzvi and bc in 3d ice ef system the nzvi attached on bc can enhance the electrode capability for adsorbing clo fig 3 and can provide fe2 from anode eq 4 3 2 adsorbability of nzvi bc the adsorption capacities of bc and nzvi bc were investigated at ph 7 0 and 25 c the results of the clo concentration reduction and fitting results of adsorption kinetic models in different adsorption systems are shown in fig 3 bc and nzvi bc can effectively eliminate clo from aqueous solution 41 0 of clo were removed in 30 min and 45 5 in 120 min by only 0 6 g of bc in 50 mg l of clo solution modification by nzvi can significantly improve the adsorption performance of bc in terms of capacity and velocity under the identical conditions of adsorbent dosage and target contaminant concentration 50 1 and 60 2 of clo were eliminated by nzvi bc in 30 and 120 min respectively kinetic analysis shows that the pseudo second order and elovich models were provn to be relatively appropriate in simulating adsorption processes of bc and nzvi bc r 2 0 97 this finding indicates that the adsorption of clo onto bc and nzvi bc belongs to the chemisorption process kumar et al 2011 on the basis of kinetic results of the pseudo second order model the equilibration sorption capacity q e of bc was extended from 3 452 mg g to 4 441 mg g by the modification of nzvi this indicates that adsorption capacity of bc is improved by 28 7 after modification by nzvi the initial adsorption rate constant h k2 q e 2 of nzvi bc was higher than that of bc 3 3 electrochemical performance of 3d ice ef system the h2o2 accumulation and concentration variation of fe2 in different 3d ice ef systems were evaluated with the application of different electrode materials fig 4 ruo2 ti anode and carbon fabric cathode were used in system a as nzvi bc anode and cathode in system b in addition 15 mg of hq were mixed in cathode materials in system c assembled as 2 2 apparatus on the basis of system b carbon fabric cathode of system a was modified by acetylene black 0 3 g and ptfe 1 ml system c is the major target system 3d ice ef system of the present study fig 4a illustrates the h2o2 accumulation at the current of 150 ma at ph 7 0 in different 3d ice ef systems no source of fe2 existed in system a therefore h2o2 accumulation was sustained during the electrolysis period the h2o2 concentration was up to 593 mg l after continuous electrolysis for 120 min as presented in fig 4b h2o2 accumulation went through a stagnancy phase between 40 and 80 min possibly due to h2o2 activation by pfrs of bc fang et al 2014 and fe2 provided by nzvi on anode in system c h2o2 was effectively activated by bc and fe2 reproduced effectively by quinone cycle according to the variation of oh in the electrolyte shown in fig s40 the accumulation of oh in 3d ice ef system after 120 min treatment was improved by approximately 21 7 compared with that in the similar ef system study by zhang et al 2015 the hq residue on cathode after 120 min treatment and the concentration variations of hq and 1 4 bq in the electrolyte are shown in fig s30 the quantitative results showed that concentrations of hq and 1 4 bq were stabilized at approximately 15 and 9 mg l after 30 min in the system respectively hq and 1 4 bq left on the cathode were kept at 7 76 and 0 33 mg respectively indicating that 51 7 of hq on the cathode was dissolved and degraded in 120 min as shown in fig s39 considering the important role of fe2 supply in 3d ice ef system nzvi residue on anode remains relatively high level 18 9 mg after 120 min treatment fe2 level in system c was stabilized at 0 5 mg l after 60 min these results indicated that ptfe plays a significant role in the dissolution control of hq and fe2 and proved the importance of hq in the circular utilization of fe however further studies required to be conducted to fully determine the most appropriate proportion of ptfe in the dissolution control of nzvi fe and hq on electrodes nzvi bc catalyst cubes cemented with ptfe is a better approach to providing fe2 and catalysis of dechlorination for 3d ice ef system because nzvi and bc can generate fe c micro electrolysis in electrolyte zhang et al 2015 by this way nzvi bc anode shall not need replacement after exhaustion of nzvi on the anode in addition considering the long term operation hq are regularly added as good alternatives to hq on cathode in 3d ice ef system the contributions of hq can play an important role in efficient utilization of fe to effectively reduce deposition of iron mud this approach can also modify the traditional ef system and reduce costs on fe consumption in industrial practice 3 4 degradation performance of 3d ice ef system the degradation performance of 3d ice ef system was characterized by control experiments as follows 1 system a ef system with ruo2 ti anode and carbon fabric cathode 2 system b ef system with nzvi bc anode and cathode 3 system c 3d ice ef system ef system with nzvi bc anode and cathode with 15 mg hq mixed in cathode materials 4 system d 3d ice ef system without influence from anode with addition of 0 5 g feso4 5 system e 3d ice ef system without influence from cathode 6 system f traditional ef system with regular addition of feso4 and no additions of nzvi bc and hq 7 system g 3d ice ef system without air flow near the cathode 8 system h 3d ice ef system without power supply 9 system i 3d ice ef system with nitrogen flow 10 system j ef system with bc anode and nzvi bc cathode 11 system k ef system with nzvi bc anode and bc cathode 12 system l ef system with bc electrodes 13 system m 3d ice ef system with quenching agents 2 5 ml methanol and 14 system n ef system with carbon fabric cathode and quenching agents 2 5 ml methanol and without influence from anode without addition of feso4 the surface area of the anode and cathode ruo2 ti material wrapped in dialysis bag mw 100d soaked in electrolyte was minimized 1 mm 2 mm 1 mm to reduce the influence from anode and cathode in systems d and e respectively similar method was used to reduce the influence from anode in system n as illustrated in fig s35 the clo residual variation on electrodes went through a reduction process after increasing therefore adsorption by nzvi bc electrodes plays a primary role in clo elimination during the initial stages however clo on electrodes was the first to oxidize because of the anodic oxidation and oh produced on the cathode clo residual on electrodes was generally reduced and finally dropped to near zero six consecutive degradation experiments in the identical 3d ice ef system show that the degradation efficiency of the sixth experiment was 93 5 in 120 min treatment fig s34 indicating relatively good recyclability of nzvi bc electrodes on the basis of clo residual variation and recyclability of nzvi bc electrodes the excellent adsorption performance of nzvi bc in 3d ice ef system could concentrate target contaminants on electrodes and effectively eliminate them to achieve self cleaning effect in addition as shown in fig s37 toc removal was achieved at 99 8 in 120 min treatment indicating that mineralization of clo is relatively complete and 3d ice ef system is useful in practice the degradation performance of 3d ice ef system is shown in fig 5 a b and 5c system c is the major target system 3d ice ef system of the present study in system a a relatively gradual reduction of clo concentration was detected in comparison with other systems clo was degraded by only 19 1 after 120 min treatment without adsorption by nzvi bc and catalysis of bc and fe2 the oxidation of anode and h2o2 was probably the main contributor to the degradation of clo in system a in comparison with system b the promotional role of hq on the circulation of fe in system c 3d ice ef system became prominent quinone cycle in system c can effectively reproduce fe2 and activate h2o2 to oh therefore system c 3d ice ef system was maintained at high efficiency of clo degradation and 99 7 of clo were degraded in 120 min electrolysis clo 68 4 was eliminated after 120 min treatment in system b the comparative result of systems d and e showed that clo removal effect of nzvi bc cathode is more effective than that of nzvi bc anode considering the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes the reaction processes in systems e and d indicated that approximately 54 1 and 71 7 of clo was eliminated by anodic oxidation both direct and indirect and indirect oxidation by fenton reaction respectively system f is the traditional ef system with air diffusion cathode a total 5g feso4 was added into the electrolyte at 10 min intervals however only 57 3 of clo were eliminated after 120 min treatment in system f and large quantities of refractory iron mud fe oh 3 was generated on the cathode due to large addition amount of feso4 the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes and comparison between system c and f indicate that nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in the promotion of clo degradation the most probable reason is that nzvi bc can concentrate clo on electrodes and take full advantage of the oxidation of anode and oh with a half life of 10 9 s produced on cathode to eliminate clo effectively in system g 62 3 of clo was eliminated after 120 min treatment nzvi bc electrodes and quinone cycle led to higher clo degradation efficiency of system g comparing to that of system f however lack of air flow resulted in the lower adsorption efficiency by nzvi bc dotto and pinto 2011 and lower h2o2 generation compared with system c the variation of clo concentration in system h was similar to the adsorption process of clo by nzvi bc 0 6 g indicating that adsorption by nzvi bc plays a major role in clo elimination by 3d ice ef system without power supply in three similar systems the order of clo degradation efficiency was system k system j system l indicating that the fe2 leaching from nzvi bc anode plays an important role in h2o2 activation and clo degradation the quenching agent 2 5 ml methanol in system m preceded clo to be oxidized by oh and anode because of the strong reducibility therefore the trend of clo removal was similar to adsorption process of clo by nzvi bc the comparative results between system d and n indicated that 68 0 of clo was eliminated by oxidative free radicals oh and other reactive species because there is no anodic oxidation and the promotion role of nzvi bc for clo degradation is taken into consideration the fitting results of the kinetic models of 3d ice ef system figs 5d and s39 show that elovich and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics provide a more accurate response than the other kinetics in clo degradation process thus the adsorption of nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in clo removal in 3d ice ef system considering no adsorption in the traditional ef system and poor fitting results of the second order kinetics in 3d ice ef system the reaction rate constants k 1 of first order kinetics were used to compare the degradation efficiencies of the two ef systems the higher reaction rate k 1 0 041 of 3d ice ef system than that of traditional ef system k 1 0 008 figs s39a and s39c indicated that the degradation efficiency of the traditional ef system is remarkably promoted by 3d ice ef system 3 5 influence factors the influences of initial ph current intensity and air flow rate loading on 3d ice ef system for clo degradation were investigated and the results are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a clo elimination was over 99 8 after 80 and 100 min treatment at initial ph of 3 0 and 5 0 respectively clo elimination at an initial ph of 7 0 99 7 was much higher than that at ph 7 0 with buffer solution 90 9 on the basis of the ph variation in the system at an initial ph of 7 0 high clo elimination was probably due to an increase in the acidity of electrolyte similarly 96 9 of clo was eliminated in 120 min electrolysis at an initial ph of 9 0 which achieved higher elimination than that of the system at ph 9 0 with buffer solution 70 1 in the identical period in addition the ph dropped to approximately 4 0 from 9 0 in 120 min which is considered to be the primary reason of the high degradation efficiency at an initial ph of 9 0 initial ph has always been an unresolved difficulty of fenton system because of the extremely low degradation efficiency of contaminants under alkaline condition wu et al 2016 the elimination efficiency of clo under alkaline condition was significantly enhanced by 3d ice ef system in comparison with the conventional modified ef system zhang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 an alkaline environment tends to result in the formation of fe oh 3 from fe2 which leads to low h2o2 activation efficiency excellent adsorption of bc is presented in alkaline conditions xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore even in alkaline conditions the adsorption of electrodes and anodic oxidation of 3d ice ef system can also play important roles in the elimination of contaminants organic acids and hcl derived from enhanced oxidation and dechlorination of clo by nzvi bc electrodes can rapidly neutralize excess hydroxyl ions oh in 3d ice ef system and make electrolyte neutral and even acidic moreover the addition of hq can significantly enhance the transformation from fe3 to fe2 and reduce fe oh 3 precipitation which can effectively promote the activation of h2o2 even under neutral conditions current intensity plays a decisive role in the degradation efficiency of 3d ice ef system the comparison of the elimination processes of clo under different currents in fig 6b indicated that the efficiency was significantly enhanced with an increase in current intensity in the first 20 min treatment adsorption by nzvi bc was the main mechanism of clo elimination based on the comparison result of the progress curves of adsorption and electrolysis in 3d ice ef system approximately 59 7 of clo was removed from the initial clo concentration of 50 mg l with an operation condition of the current intensity of 0 ma indicating that only adsorption acted in the system elevated current intensity gradually enhanced clo reduction and more than 75 8 88 5 and 99 7 of clo was removed in 120 min at current intensities of 50 100 and 150 ma respectively air flow was provided for h2o2 production by eq 3 and induced the internal agitation of electrolysis to promote the adsorption of clo by nzvi bc when no inlet air flow occurred 0 l min oxidation by oh and adsorption by nzvi bc were substantially lowered followed by reduced anodic oxidation as a result only 62 2 of clo was removed after 120 min treatment a small difference was observed among clo elimination processes at air flow rates of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 l min therefore 0 2 l min of air was sufficient to supply h2o2 production but elevated air flow can promote adsorption to an extent the air flow in the system works on the same principle as stirring in the adsorption experiments adsorption capacity and rate can be increased with increasing stirring rate dotto and pinto 2011 similarly elevated air flow can promote adsorption by inducing the internal agitation of electrolyte considering the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes strong agitation can play a significant role in the enhancement of adsorption capacity and rate of nzvi bc electrodes to accelerate clo degradation 3 6 degradation product identification and plausible mechanism the reaction solution of clo at ph 7 0 was subjected to the analysis of degradation products at different reaction times 150 min by uplc q tof ms method esi pos neg degradation products were identified without hq to avoid impurity interference as the judgment basis of degradation product identification the product ion mass spectra of clo and its possible intermediates are shown in figs s3 s29 clo belongs to halogenated organic contaminants halogen atoms on compounds can play an important role in the biological toxicity of these chemicals morrison 1946 eske et al 2014 as three secondary reactions of clo degradation pathways 1 2 and 3 as shown in figs 7 9 are separated to evaluate the toxicity variation of intermediate products in three mechanisms of no substitution of cl hydroxylation of cl and dechlorination in 3d ice ef system to summarize the plausible mechanisms in clo degradation by 3d ice ef system consist of ⅰ hydroxylation ⅱ carboxylation ⅲ carbonylation of cn bond ⅳ oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle ⅴ c n bond hydrolysis ⅵ c c bond hydrolysis and ⅶ dechlorination the mechanisms involved in every step of clo degradation in pathways 1 2 and 3 are marked in figs 7 9 respectively pathway 1 is based on the mechanism of no substitution of cl except for dechlorination six other plausible mechanisms were identified in pathway 1 hydroxylation ⅰ is one of the main mechanisms in 3d ice ef system because oh play a major role in clo oxidation h atoms attached to c atoms in the middle and end of the branched chain are also easily disrupted by oh such as the formation of op 242 and op 224 m z 242 13 and 224 93 after the hydrolysis of c n ⅴ and c c bonds ⅵ original chemical groups can be substituted by oh for the formation of op 149a op 153 op 210 and op 208 m z 149 95 153 96 210 92 and 208 94 carbonylation of cn bond ⅲ and carboxylation ⅱ in the clo oxidation process is based on the hydroxylation of h atoms and chemical groups attached to c atoms indicating that oh are still the main oxidative radicals in the carboxylation of 3d ice ef system the selective neurotoxicity pharmacophore of clo is a cn no2 therefore the carbonylation of the cn bond plays a significant role in the neurotoxicity attenuation of clo the formation of op 251 op 208 and op 224 m z 251 94 208 94 and 224 93 in pathway 1 was the probable result of the carbonylation of cn bond the formation of op 251 m z 251 94 was observed as a result of the carboxylation of methyl at the end of the branched chain thiazoles play an important role in medical and pharmaceutical fields with promising biological activity on the central nervous system agarwal et al 2018 however the heterocyclic structures of thiazoles are difficult to destroy with an increased difficulty of wastewater treatment the oxidation reaction of thiazoles can be completed by 3d ice ef system with the high standard potential of oh the formation of op 242 and op 210 m z 242 13 and 210 92 was involved in the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle ⅳ the first step in the clo oxidation of pathway 2 that is the chemical conversion from clo to intermediate 2 was based on the hydroxylation of cl atom at the c 2 position of heterocycle in addition the formation of op 204 op 234 and op 222 op 117 op 165 and op 131a in pathway 2 m z 204 12 234 13 222 11 117 93 165 09 and 131 96 was associated with hydroxylation the formation of op 262 m z 262 13 was also observed as a probable result of the carboxylation and the carbonylation of cn bond was considered the main mechanism of the formation of op 187 in pathway 2 the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle played an important role in the formation of op 165 and op 222 m z 165 09 and 222 11 in pathway 2 dechlorination is the foundation of pathway 3 it is an important mechanism for the toxicity attenuation of chlorinated organic contaminants bedard et al 2005 maccrehan et al 1998 eske et al 2014 kaya et al 2016 nzvi is proven to be an efficient catalyst with an excellent dechlorination property the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle was considered one of the main mechanisms in the formation of op 149b op 282 op 268 and op 298 m z 149 02 282 18 268 15 and 298 14 the formation of op 282 and op 298 was also observed as a probable result of the carboxylation 3 7 ecotoxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of degradation products in pathways 1 2 and 3 was evaluated by ecosar program u s epa and the results are shown in fig 10 table 1 and table s1 respectively toxicity classification was based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals van zelm et al 2010 table s2 daphnia and green algae as experimental aquatic invertebrate and hydrophyte respectively are often used to indicate water quality and contaminant toxicity the toxicity of clo is identified in the category of toxic 1 chronic toxicity 10 mg l to daphnia and green algae whereas the evaluated toxicity of most degradation products is far below their parent compound clo pathways 1 2 and 3 show the biotoxicity variation of degradation products with mechanisms of no substitution of cl hydroxylation of cl and dechlorination respectively for daphnia all intermediate products in the three pathways tend to reduce toxicity in 3d ice ef system except for op 265 and op 131b the temporary intermediates the comparison results presented in table 1 indicated that the acute and chronic toxicities of degradation products in different pathways share the same order of pathway 1 pathway 2 pathway 3 similarly intermediates except for op 242 and op 222 have lower toxicity than clo for green algae the evaluation results revealed the order of pathway 1 pathway 2 pathway 3 for acute toxicity and pathway 2 pathway 1 pathway 3 for chronic toxicity therefore dechlorination by nzvi in pathway 3 is of great importance to reduce the ecotoxicity of clo as shown in fig s36 the terminal products of organic contaminants with n s cl and h elements in fenton system consist of no3 nh4 so4 2 and cl in addition clo was treated as a model contaminant with standard toxicity to calculate toxicity variation caused by the change in intermediate products according to the simulation results by ecosar as shown in fig s35 remarkable decreases of acute toxicity equivalence variation of cloeq were observed in the oxidation process of 3d ice ef accordingly 3d ice ef system can effectively convert clo into completely nontoxic inorganic compounds in spite of the transient toxicity elevation of a few intermediate products urea the identified terminal organic product was also identified in the category of non harmful compound toxicity 100 mg l excessive reaction time can ensure that toxic intermediates are completely converted into non harmful products in conclusion clo degradation in 3d ice ef system showed a remarkable tendency to lower the toxicity levels however considering the speculative results of toxicity simulation further experimental studies concerning the acute and chronic toxicity of intermediate products of clo are urgently required in a laboratory condition using daphnia and green algae 4 conclusions nzvi bc in 3d ice ef system can concentrate clo on electrodes by excellent adsorption and effectively eliminate it to achieve self cleaning effect adsorption of nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in the promotion of clo removal in 3d ice ef system the addition of hq on cathode significantly enhanced the reproduction efficiency of fe2 to maximize the utilization of fe and decrease the deposition of iron mud the low elimination efficiency of contaminants under alkaline condition in traditional fenton reaction was effectively resolved by 3d ice ef system clo 96 9 was eliminated in 120 min electrolysis at initial ph 9 0 the plausible mechanisms in clo degradation by 3d ice ef system comprise 1 hydroxylation 2 carboxylation 3 carbonylation of cn bond 4 oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle 5 c n bond hydrolysis 6 c c bond hydrolysis and 7 dechlorination the ecotoxicity evaluation of degradation products indicated that a

17801,neonicotinoids neos as the most widely used pesticides pose a serious threat to water ecosystems especially clothianidin clo however the degradation behavior of clo as a new type of persistent organic pollutant is rarely studied in wastewater treatment to bridge this gap heterogeneous electro fenton system using three dimension electrodes made of biochar supported zero valent iron nanoparticle hybrid material nzvi bc abbreviated as 3d ice ef system is invented and initially applied in clo wastewater degradation without the addition of fenton reagent nzvi bc in 3d ice ef system can concentrate clo on electrodes by excellent adsorption and effectively eliminate it to achieve self cleaning effect in addition the deposition of iron mud fe oh 3 and the circular utilization of fe in fenton system is effectively improved by the addition of hydroquinone hq in 3d ice ef system the ph applicable scope of fenton system is extended to alkaline condition by the applications of nzvi bc electrodes the increase in the acidity of electrolyte is considered the primary reason of the high degradation efficiency of clo in 3d ice ef system at an initial ph of 9 0 the degradation performance of 3d ice ef system tends to be promoted by the increase of current intensity and air flow rate seven plausible mechanisms of clo degradation were identified in 3d ice ef system the ecotoxicity evaluation of degradation products indicated that clo degradation in 3d ice ef system exhibits a remarkable tendency to reduce toxicity levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords neonicotinoids biochar supported zero valent iron nanoparticles electro fenton system 1 introduction clothianidin clo as the second generation of neonicotinoids neos which are the most widely used pesticide on the global scale approximately 30 of agrochemical market zhang et al 2020 song et al 2020 is extensively applied in agricultural production such as foliar sprays and soil drenches because of its strong neurotoxicity persistent effect and high target specificity to insects baron et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yi et al 2019 however the overuse of clo coupled with the lack of effective regulation leads to the decline of wild bees and other pollinators georgiadis et al 2011 lentola et al 2017 yi et al 2020 research reveals that clo has an additional mechanism to downregulate genes related to neuronal differentiation such as increased neurite length hirano et al 2019 in spite of its relatively low risk for non target mammalian species due to the poor penetration of blood brain barrier in mammals rose 2012 international organizations and countries such as europe union eu and france have issued relevant laws and regulations to ban the use of clo due to various reasons jactel et al 2019 nevertheless clo is still widely detected in effluent from wastewater treatment plants and surface water due to its stronger hydrophilicity than that of other neos which are closely related to human activities and ecological balance zhang et al 2019 yi et al 2019 niu et al 2020 degradation behavior of clo as a new type of persistent organic pollutants pops is rarely studied in wastewater treatment in addition a new wastewater treatment technology should be developed to effectively eliminate these refractory contaminants electro fenton ef system as a promising advanced oxidation process can utilize hydroxyl radicals oh with high standard potential e 2 80 v she produced in situ by fe2 and electro generated h2o2 at the cathode eq 1 and 2 to remedy wastewater contaminated by organic pollutants labiadh et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the application of air diffusion cathode can significantly improve h2o2 production efficiency borràs et al 2013 however oh has a short lifespan with a half life of 10 9 s in aqueous environment cheng et al 2002 most oh are hydrolyzed during the transfer process and the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants can be reduced in addition the traditional ef system has many unresolved problems such as strict applicable scope of ph zhang et al 2015 and deposition of iron mud duarte et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 therefore heterogeneous ef system using three dimension nzvi bc electrodes 3d ice ef is invented to solve these problems 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k 76 m 1 s 1 2 o2 h 2e h2o2 biochar bc is a large category of environment friendly materials which are made of solid biomass waste by o2 limited thermal treatment with excellent performance of sorption capacity redox property water holding capacity and electric conductivity hagemann et al 2017 laura et al 2014 gabhi et al 2017 chen et al 2019 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi fe 0 is another newly developed material with high specific surface area and strong reducibility and has extensive environmental application in water treatment to remove organic compounds such as azo dyes chlorinated hydrocarbons and pharmaceutical wastewater nguyen et al 2018 segura et al 2013 in addition nzvi is a potential material for organic chloride treatment owing to its excellent dechlorination performance eq 3 lien and zhang 2001 lowry and johnson 2004 therefore nzvi bc integrates their advantages to improve conductivity and sorption performance jiang et al 2018 as a carrier bc can effectively reduce the agglomeration of nzvi in aqueous media guan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 however limited research involves electrodes modified by nzvi bc in the ef system for pollutant degradation 3 fe rcl h fe2 rh c1 the nzvi bc electrodes in 3d ice ef system can effectively solve problems of the traditional fenton system by its excellent adsorption nzvi bc can effectively concentrate pollutants on electrodes eliminate pollutants with anodic oxidation and oh produced on cathode and achieve self cleaning effect nzvi bc covered on anode can also consistently provide fe2 for 3d ice ef system eq 4 in addition persistent free radicals pfrs of bc can significantly promote h2o2 activation in the ef system fang et al 2014 excellent adsorption of bc is presented in alkaline conditions xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore even in alkaline conditions adsorption of electrodes and anodic oxidation of 3d ice ef system can also play important roles in elimination of contaminants 4 fe 2e fe2 the circular utilization of fe is of potential significance to economize materials and costs in the fenton system zhou et al 2016 li et al 2016 fe3 and h2o2 can react to reproduce fe2 by eq 6 but its reaction rate is considerably less than that of eq 2 as a result residual fe3 in aqueous solution can accumulate convert into fe oh 3 known as iron mud and deposit on electrode to slow or inhibit reactions hydroquinone hq and 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq on the cathode can create the circulations of fe and quinone eq 7 10 to continually generate oh zhou et al 2016 hydroperoxyl radical ho2 plays a significant role in the quinone cycle of 3d ice ef system produced by eq 5 in situ which can convert 1 4 bq into hq at the rate of 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq 9 and 10 the reaction process is as follows hq can function as reductants to fe3 and the reaction products are 1 4 bq and fe2 eq 7 and 8 the produced fe2 continues to activate h2o2 but 1 4 bq is converted into hq eq 9 and 10 with hydroperoxyl radical ho2 produced by eqs 5 and 6 as reductant quinone cycle can effectively deal with the problems of the circular utilization of fe and iron mud deposition at the same time in addition the removal efficiency of pollutants under alkaline conditions in 3d ice ef system can be considerably improved by the application of hq and nzvi bc because of the reproduction of fe2 and effective adsorption 5 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h k 0 02 m 1 s 1 7 c6h6o2

utilization of waste biomass has always been considered an important international issue in the environment field such as the preparation and modification of bc in this work the adsorption property and performance in 3d ice ef system of bamboo waste bc and its modified version by nzvi bc are measured using clo as the target contaminant degradation products of clo are identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms to determine the degradation mechanisms of clo in 3d ice ef system the possible degradation pathways and plausible mechanisms are speculated on the basis of the synthetic analysis of functional group changes and quantitative analysis of degradation products the ecotoxicity to the aquatic organisms by degradation products of clo in 3d ice ef system is also evaluated in detail to our best knowledge this is the first systematic study associated with degradation products mechanism and toxicity variation of neos in the electrochemical system 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of bc and nzvi bc bamboo waste block phyllostachys pubescens was rinsed by milli q water for three times and dried to be constant weight in an air circulating oven at 105 c after being transferred in a porcelain boat the dried bamboo was pyrolyzed in nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h in a tube furnace at 800 c the pyrolyzed bamboo was powdered by a disintegrator and sieved by 120 mesh sieves bc powder was deashed by 1 mol l of hcl solution for 4 h when the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 0 1 with naoh and hcl bc was repeatedly flushed and filtrated and then dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven for 4 h the final bc powder was preserved under dried condition and marked as bc feso4 7h2o 2 g was dissolved in an ethanol water solvent v v 7 3 with 0 5 g of polyethylene glycol 400 and 4 g of bc before the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 25 c in a flask with three necks nabh4 solution 50 ml 1 mol l was slowly dripped into the mixture in nitrogen atmosphere and then stirred together for 30 min eq 11 the bc was washed by milli q water and absolute ethanol for three times and freeze dried for 12 h the bc powder was preserved under dried condition and marked as nzvi bc 11 fe2 bh4 fe b oh 3 h2o 2 2 apparatus the 3d ice ef system was utilized in a divided cell with an upper reaction chamber 3 cm 5 cm 6 cm and a lower air chamber 3 cm 5 cm 2 cm fig s1 nzvi bc 0 3 g was used as anode covering on ruo2 ti mesh with 1 ml of ptfe 30 for uniform current distribution the air diffusion cathode was divided into two layers namely conductive carbon fabric and nickel screen one side of the carbon fabric was uniformly covered with 0 3 g of nzvi bc 15 mg of hq and 1 ml of ptfe the nzvi bc particles were attached to the ruo2 ti mesh and carbon fabric by ptfe ptfe is a type of cementing material with high corrosion resistance it is widely used in the preparation of composite electrodes zhang et al 2015 garcia rodriguez et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 hq was directly dissolved in the mixture of ptfe and milli q water prior to the preparation of nzvi bc cathode the identification experiment of degradation products was conducted without hq on cathode to avoid interference of impurities 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nzvi bc and bc the characterization results of nzvi bc and bc are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the morphology of bc and nzvi bc was characterized by fe sem analysis as shown in fig 1a b bc made from waste bamboo has a compact skeletal structure and tiny honeycombed multipore particles which are considered potential electrochemical adsorption structures chen et al 2019 after modification nzvi was deposited on the surface of the multipore structure by liquid phase reduction as shown in fig 1c by comparison with the length scale the diameter of nzvi particles was distributed in the range of 10 100 nm the formation of nzvi was further confirmed by the characterization of xps and xrd in fig 2b and c respectively the surface chemical composition of bc and nzvi bc was studied by xps analysis except for c and o elements si element was observed on the surface of bc and nzvi bc probably due to silica contents in bamboo plants the peaks of fe 2p ranging from 702 ev to 725 ev and fe 3p ranging from 50 ev to 60 ev indicate the simultaneous presence of nzvi and its oxidation products zhang et al 2015 similarly the higher peaks of o element in the spectra of nzvi bc compared with those of bc also demonstrate that nzvi bc were partially oxidized in the preparation or storage process however the xrd spectra of nzvi bc abundantly indicate that oxidized nzvi only accounts for a tiny percentage and most nzvi exists as elementary substance the phase structure of bc and nzvi bc were studied by xrd analysis the highest peak at 44 9 in the nzvi bc spectra belongs to nzvi indicating that elemental fe has high crystallinity and content in the nzvi bc particles a wide diffraction peak at 24 3 in the bc spectra indicates the presence of amorphous carbon phase structure c element the spectra indicate relatively high graphitization degree of bc which is highly related to good electric conductivity raj and joy 2015 the surface functional group of bc and nzvi bc was studied by ftir analysis a stronger stretching vibration was observed at 3200 3600 cm 1 o h and n h groups of nzvi bc absorption band than that of bc indicating that stronger adsorption capacity of nzvi bc lead to more adsorbed water chen et al 2019 diversity of functional groups including cc aromatic cooh and c n o explains that bc and nzvi bc can be utilized for the adsorption removal of multiple contaminants mayakaduwa et al 2016 nzvi and bc are excellent adsorbents with good conductivity gabhi et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yao et al 2012 bc was carbonized at 800 c for 4 h in nitrogen atmosphere protection and had an upper extent of carbonization degree fig 2b and c the adsorption of clo and production of oh eq 2 and 6 can simultaneously occur on the surface of nzvi and bc in 3d ice ef system the nzvi attached on bc can enhance the electrode capability for adsorbing clo fig 3 and can provide fe2 from anode eq 4 3 2 adsorbability of nzvi bc the adsorption capacities of bc and nzvi bc were investigated at ph 7 0 and 25 c the results of the clo concentration reduction and fitting results of adsorption kinetic models in different adsorption systems are shown in fig 3 bc and nzvi bc can effectively eliminate clo from aqueous solution 41 0 of clo were removed in 30 min and 45 5 in 120 min by only 0 6 g of bc in 50 mg l of clo solution modification by nzvi can significantly improve the adsorption performance of bc in terms of capacity and velocity under the identical conditions of adsorbent dosage and target contaminant concentration 50 1 and 60 2 of clo were eliminated by nzvi bc in 30 and 120 min respectively kinetic analysis shows that the pseudo second order and elovich models were provn to be relatively appropriate in simulating adsorption processes of bc and nzvi bc r 2 0 97 this finding indicates that the adsorption of clo onto bc and nzvi bc belongs to the chemisorption process kumar et al 2011 on the basis of kinetic results of the pseudo second order model the equilibration sorption capacity q e of bc was extended from 3 452 mg g to 4 441 mg g by the modification of nzvi this indicates that adsorption capacity of bc is improved by 28 7 after modification by nzvi the initial adsorption rate constant h k2 q e 2 of nzvi bc was higher than that of bc 3 3 electrochemical performance of 3d ice ef system the h2o2 accumulation and concentration variation of fe2 in different 3d ice ef systems were evaluated with the application of different electrode materials fig 4 ruo2 ti anode and carbon fabric cathode were used in system a as nzvi bc anode and cathode in system b in addition 15 mg of hq were mixed in cathode materials in system c assembled as 2 2 apparatus on the basis of system b carbon fabric cathode of system a was modified by acetylene black 0 3 g and ptfe 1 ml system c is the major target system 3d ice ef system of the present study fig 4a illustrates the h2o2 accumulation at the current of 150 ma at ph 7 0 in different 3d ice ef systems no source of fe2 existed in system a therefore h2o2 accumulation was sustained during the electrolysis period the h2o2 concentration was up to 593 mg l after continuous electrolysis for 120 min as presented in fig 4b h2o2 accumulation went through a stagnancy phase between 40 and 80 min possibly due to h2o2 activation by pfrs of bc fang et al 2014 and fe2 provided by nzvi on anode in system c h2o2 was effectively activated by bc and fe2 reproduced effectively by quinone cycle according to the variation of oh in the electrolyte shown in fig s40 the accumulation of oh in 3d ice ef system after 120 min treatment was improved by approximately 21 7 compared with that in the similar ef system study by zhang et al 2015 the hq residue on cathode after 120 min treatment and the concentration variations of hq and 1 4 bq in the electrolyte are shown in fig s30 the quantitative results showed that concentrations of hq and 1 4 bq were stabilized at approximately 15 and 9 mg l after 30 min in the system respectively hq and 1 4 bq left on the cathode were kept at 7 76 and 0 33 mg respectively indicating that 51 7 of hq on the cathode was dissolved and degraded in 120 min as shown in fig s39 considering the important role of fe2 supply in 3d ice ef system nzvi residue on anode remains relatively high level 18 9 mg after 120 min treatment fe2 level in system c was stabilized at 0 5 mg l after 60 min these results indicated that ptfe plays a significant role in the dissolution control of hq and fe2 and proved the importance of hq in the circular utilization of fe however further studies required to be conducted to fully determine the most appropriate proportion of ptfe in the dissolution control of nzvi fe and hq on electrodes nzvi bc catalyst cubes cemented with ptfe is a better approach to providing fe2 and catalysis of dechlorination for 3d ice ef system because nzvi and bc can generate fe c micro electrolysis in electrolyte zhang et al 2015 by this way nzvi bc anode shall not need replacement after exhaustion of nzvi on the anode in addition considering the long term operation hq are regularly added as good alternatives to hq on cathode in 3d ice ef system the contributions of hq can play an important role in efficient utilization of fe to effectively reduce deposition of iron mud this approach can also modify the traditional ef system and reduce costs on fe consumption in industrial practice 3 4 degradation performance of 3d ice ef system the degradation performance of 3d ice ef system was characterized by control experiments as follows 1 system a ef system with ruo2 ti anode and carbon fabric cathode 2 system b ef system with nzvi bc anode and cathode 3 system c 3d ice ef system ef system with nzvi bc anode and cathode with 15 mg hq mixed in cathode materials 4 system d 3d ice ef system without influence from anode with addition of 0 5 g feso4 5 system e 3d ice ef system without influence from cathode 6 system f traditional ef system with regular addition of feso4 and no additions of nzvi bc and hq 7 system g 3d ice ef system without air flow near the cathode 8 system h 3d ice ef system without power supply 9 system i 3d ice ef system with nitrogen flow 10 system j ef system with bc anode and nzvi bc cathode 11 system k ef system with nzvi bc anode and bc cathode 12 system l ef system with bc electrodes 13 system m 3d ice ef system with quenching agents 2 5 ml methanol and 14 system n ef system with carbon fabric cathode and quenching agents 2 5 ml methanol and without influence from anode without addition of feso4 the surface area of the anode and cathode ruo2 ti material wrapped in dialysis bag mw 100d soaked in electrolyte was minimized 1 mm 2 mm 1 mm to reduce the influence from anode and cathode in systems d and e respectively similar method was used to reduce the influence from anode in system n as illustrated in fig s35 the clo residual variation on electrodes went through a reduction process after increasing therefore adsorption by nzvi bc electrodes plays a primary role in clo elimination during the initial stages however clo on electrodes was the first to oxidize because of the anodic oxidation and oh produced on the cathode clo residual on electrodes was generally reduced and finally dropped to near zero six consecutive degradation experiments in the identical 3d ice ef system show that the degradation efficiency of the sixth experiment was 93 5 in 120 min treatment fig s34 indicating relatively good recyclability of nzvi bc electrodes on the basis of clo residual variation and recyclability of nzvi bc electrodes the excellent adsorption performance of nzvi bc in 3d ice ef system could concentrate target contaminants on electrodes and effectively eliminate them to achieve self cleaning effect in addition as shown in fig s37 toc removal was achieved at 99 8 in 120 min treatment indicating that mineralization of clo is relatively complete and 3d ice ef system is useful in practice the degradation performance of 3d ice ef system is shown in fig 5 a b and 5c system c is the major target system 3d ice ef system of the present study in system a a relatively gradual reduction of clo concentration was detected in comparison with other systems clo was degraded by only 19 1 after 120 min treatment without adsorption by nzvi bc and catalysis of bc and fe2 the oxidation of anode and h2o2 was probably the main contributor to the degradation of clo in system a in comparison with system b the promotional role of hq on the circulation of fe in system c 3d ice ef system became prominent quinone cycle in system c can effectively reproduce fe2 and activate h2o2 to oh therefore system c 3d ice ef system was maintained at high efficiency of clo degradation and 99 7 of clo were degraded in 120 min electrolysis clo 68 4 was eliminated after 120 min treatment in system b the comparative result of systems d and e showed that clo removal effect of nzvi bc cathode is more effective than that of nzvi bc anode considering the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes the reaction processes in systems e and d indicated that approximately 54 1 and 71 7 of clo was eliminated by anodic oxidation both direct and indirect and indirect oxidation by fenton reaction respectively system f is the traditional ef system with air diffusion cathode a total 5g feso4 was added into the electrolyte at 10 min intervals however only 57 3 of clo were eliminated after 120 min treatment in system f and large quantities of refractory iron mud fe oh 3 was generated on the cathode due to large addition amount of feso4 the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes and comparison between system c and f indicate that nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in the promotion of clo degradation the most probable reason is that nzvi bc can concentrate clo on electrodes and take full advantage of the oxidation of anode and oh with a half life of 10 9 s produced on cathode to eliminate clo effectively in system g 62 3 of clo was eliminated after 120 min treatment nzvi bc electrodes and quinone cycle led to higher clo degradation efficiency of system g comparing to that of system f however lack of air flow resulted in the lower adsorption efficiency by nzvi bc dotto and pinto 2011 and lower h2o2 generation compared with system c the variation of clo concentration in system h was similar to the adsorption process of clo by nzvi bc 0 6 g indicating that adsorption by nzvi bc plays a major role in clo elimination by 3d ice ef system without power supply in three similar systems the order of clo degradation efficiency was system k system j system l indicating that the fe2 leaching from nzvi bc anode plays an important role in h2o2 activation and clo degradation the quenching agent 2 5 ml methanol in system m preceded clo to be oxidized by oh and anode because of the strong reducibility therefore the trend of clo removal was similar to adsorption process of clo by nzvi bc the comparative results between system d and n indicated that 68 0 of clo was eliminated by oxidative free radicals oh and other reactive species because there is no anodic oxidation and the promotion role of nzvi bc for clo degradation is taken into consideration the fitting results of the kinetic models of 3d ice ef system figs 5d and s39 show that elovich and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics provide a more accurate response than the other kinetics in clo degradation process thus the adsorption of nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in clo removal in 3d ice ef system considering no adsorption in the traditional ef system and poor fitting results of the second order kinetics in 3d ice ef system the reaction rate constants k 1 of first order kinetics were used to compare the degradation efficiencies of the two ef systems the higher reaction rate k 1 0 041 of 3d ice ef system than that of traditional ef system k 1 0 008 figs s39a and s39c indicated that the degradation efficiency of the traditional ef system is remarkably promoted by 3d ice ef system 3 5 influence factors the influences of initial ph current intensity and air flow rate loading on 3d ice ef system for clo degradation were investigated and the results are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a clo elimination was over 99 8 after 80 and 100 min treatment at initial ph of 3 0 and 5 0 respectively clo elimination at an initial ph of 7 0 99 7 was much higher than that at ph 7 0 with buffer solution 90 9 on the basis of the ph variation in the system at an initial ph of 7 0 high clo elimination was probably due to an increase in the acidity of electrolyte similarly 96 9 of clo was eliminated in 120 min electrolysis at an initial ph of 9 0 which achieved higher elimination than that of the system at ph 9 0 with buffer solution 70 1 in the identical period in addition the ph dropped to approximately 4 0 from 9 0 in 120 min which is considered to be the primary reason of the high degradation efficiency at an initial ph of 9 0 initial ph has always been an unresolved difficulty of fenton system because of the extremely low degradation efficiency of contaminants under alkaline condition wu et al 2016 the elimination efficiency of clo under alkaline condition was significantly enhanced by 3d ice ef system in comparison with the conventional modified ef system zhang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 an alkaline environment tends to result in the formation of fe oh 3 from fe2 which leads to low h2o2 activation efficiency excellent adsorption of bc is presented in alkaline conditions xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore even in alkaline conditions the adsorption of electrodes and anodic oxidation of 3d ice ef system can also play important roles in the elimination of contaminants organic acids and hcl derived from enhanced oxidation and dechlorination of clo by nzvi bc electrodes can rapidly neutralize excess hydroxyl ions oh in 3d ice ef system and make electrolyte neutral and even acidic moreover the addition of hq can significantly enhance the transformation from fe3 to fe2 and reduce fe oh 3 precipitation which can effectively promote the activation of h2o2 even under neutral conditions current intensity plays a decisive role in the degradation efficiency of 3d ice ef system the comparison of the elimination processes of clo under different currents in fig 6b indicated that the efficiency was significantly enhanced with an increase in current intensity in the first 20 min treatment adsorption by nzvi bc was the main mechanism of clo elimination based on the comparison result of the progress curves of adsorption and electrolysis in 3d ice ef system approximately 59 7 of clo was removed from the initial clo concentration of 50 mg l with an operation condition of the current intensity of 0 ma indicating that only adsorption acted in the system elevated current intensity gradually enhanced clo reduction and more than 75 8 88 5 and 99 7 of clo was removed in 120 min at current intensities of 50 100 and 150 ma respectively air flow was provided for h2o2 production by eq 3 and induced the internal agitation of electrolysis to promote the adsorption of clo by nzvi bc when no inlet air flow occurred 0 l min oxidation by oh and adsorption by nzvi bc were substantially lowered followed by reduced anodic oxidation as a result only 62 2 of clo was removed after 120 min treatment a small difference was observed among clo elimination processes at air flow rates of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 l min therefore 0 2 l min of air was sufficient to supply h2o2 production but elevated air flow can promote adsorption to an extent the air flow in the system works on the same principle as stirring in the adsorption experiments adsorption capacity and rate can be increased with increasing stirring rate dotto and pinto 2011 similarly elevated air flow can promote adsorption by inducing the internal agitation of electrolyte considering the self cleaning effect of nzvi bc electrodes strong agitation can play a significant role in the enhancement of adsorption capacity and rate of nzvi bc electrodes to accelerate clo degradation 3 6 degradation product identification and plausible mechanism the reaction solution of clo at ph 7 0 was subjected to the analysis of degradation products at different reaction times 150 min by uplc q tof ms method esi pos neg degradation products were identified without hq to avoid impurity interference as the judgment basis of degradation product identification the product ion mass spectra of clo and its possible intermediates are shown in figs s3 s29 clo belongs to halogenated organic contaminants halogen atoms on compounds can play an important role in the biological toxicity of these chemicals morrison 1946 eske et al 2014 as three secondary reactions of clo degradation pathways 1 2 and 3 as shown in figs 7 9 are separated to evaluate the toxicity variation of intermediate products in three mechanisms of no substitution of cl hydroxylation of cl and dechlorination in 3d ice ef system to summarize the plausible mechanisms in clo degradation by 3d ice ef system consist of ⅰ hydroxylation ⅱ carboxylation ⅲ carbonylation of cn bond ⅳ oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle ⅴ c n bond hydrolysis ⅵ c c bond hydrolysis and ⅶ dechlorination the mechanisms involved in every step of clo degradation in pathways 1 2 and 3 are marked in figs 7 9 respectively pathway 1 is based on the mechanism of no substitution of cl except for dechlorination six other plausible mechanisms were identified in pathway 1 hydroxylation ⅰ is one of the main mechanisms in 3d ice ef system because oh play a major role in clo oxidation h atoms attached to c atoms in the middle and end of the branched chain are also easily disrupted by oh such as the formation of op 242 and op 224 m z 242 13 and 224 93 after the hydrolysis of c n ⅴ and c c bonds ⅵ original chemical groups can be substituted by oh for the formation of op 149a op 153 op 210 and op 208 m z 149 95 153 96 210 92 and 208 94 carbonylation of cn bond ⅲ and carboxylation ⅱ in the clo oxidation process is based on the hydroxylation of h atoms and chemical groups attached to c atoms indicating that oh are still the main oxidative radicals in the carboxylation of 3d ice ef system the selective neurotoxicity pharmacophore of clo is a cn no2 therefore the carbonylation of the cn bond plays a significant role in the neurotoxicity attenuation of clo the formation of op 251 op 208 and op 224 m z 251 94 208 94 and 224 93 in pathway 1 was the probable result of the carbonylation of cn bond the formation of op 251 m z 251 94 was observed as a result of the carboxylation of methyl at the end of the branched chain thiazoles play an important role in medical and pharmaceutical fields with promising biological activity on the central nervous system agarwal et al 2018 however the heterocyclic structures of thiazoles are difficult to destroy with an increased difficulty of wastewater treatment the oxidation reaction of thiazoles can be completed by 3d ice ef system with the high standard potential of oh the formation of op 242 and op 210 m z 242 13 and 210 92 was involved in the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle ⅳ the first step in the clo oxidation of pathway 2 that is the chemical conversion from clo to intermediate 2 was based on the hydroxylation of cl atom at the c 2 position of heterocycle in addition the formation of op 204 op 234 and op 222 op 117 op 165 and op 131a in pathway 2 m z 204 12 234 13 222 11 117 93 165 09 and 131 96 was associated with hydroxylation the formation of op 262 m z 262 13 was also observed as a probable result of the carboxylation and the carbonylation of cn bond was considered the main mechanism of the formation of op 187 in pathway 2 the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle played an important role in the formation of op 165 and op 222 m z 165 09 and 222 11 in pathway 2 dechlorination is the foundation of pathway 3 it is an important mechanism for the toxicity attenuation of chlorinated organic contaminants bedard et al 2005 maccrehan et al 1998 eske et al 2014 kaya et al 2016 nzvi is proven to be an efficient catalyst with an excellent dechlorination property the oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle was considered one of the main mechanisms in the formation of op 149b op 282 op 268 and op 298 m z 149 02 282 18 268 15 and 298 14 the formation of op 282 and op 298 was also observed as a probable result of the carboxylation 3 7 ecotoxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of degradation products in pathways 1 2 and 3 was evaluated by ecosar program u s epa and the results are shown in fig 10 table 1 and table s1 respectively toxicity classification was based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals van zelm et al 2010 table s2 daphnia and green algae as experimental aquatic invertebrate and hydrophyte respectively are often used to indicate water quality and contaminant toxicity the toxicity of clo is identified in the category of toxic 1 chronic toxicity 10 mg l to daphnia and green algae whereas the evaluated toxicity of most degradation products is far below their parent compound clo pathways 1 2 and 3 show the biotoxicity variation of degradation products with mechanisms of no substitution of cl hydroxylation of cl and dechlorination respectively for daphnia all intermediate products in the three pathways tend to reduce toxicity in 3d ice ef system except for op 265 and op 131b the temporary intermediates the comparison results presented in table 1 indicated that the acute and chronic toxicities of degradation products in different pathways share the same order of pathway 1 pathway 2 pathway 3 similarly intermediates except for op 242 and op 222 have lower toxicity than clo for green algae the evaluation results revealed the order of pathway 1 pathway 2 pathway 3 for acute toxicity and pathway 2 pathway 1 pathway 3 for chronic toxicity therefore dechlorination by nzvi in pathway 3 is of great importance to reduce the ecotoxicity of clo as shown in fig s36 the terminal products of organic contaminants with n s cl and h elements in fenton system consist of no3 nh4 so4 2 and cl in addition clo was treated as a model contaminant with standard toxicity to calculate toxicity variation caused by the change in intermediate products according to the simulation results by ecosar as shown in fig s35 remarkable decreases of acute toxicity equivalence variation of cloeq were observed in the oxidation process of 3d ice ef accordingly 3d ice ef system can effectively convert clo into completely nontoxic inorganic compounds in spite of the transient toxicity elevation of a few intermediate products urea the identified terminal organic product was also identified in the category of non harmful compound toxicity 100 mg l excessive reaction time can ensure that toxic intermediates are completely converted into non harmful products in conclusion clo degradation in 3d ice ef system showed a remarkable tendency to lower the toxicity levels however considering the speculative results of toxicity simulation further experimental studies concerning the acute and chronic toxicity of intermediate products of clo are urgently required in a laboratory condition using daphnia and green algae 4 conclusions nzvi bc in 3d ice ef system can concentrate clo on electrodes by excellent adsorption and effectively eliminate it to achieve self cleaning effect adsorption of nzvi bc electrodes play an important role in the promotion of clo removal in 3d ice ef system the addition of hq on cathode significantly enhanced the reproduction efficiency of fe2 to maximize the utilization of fe and decrease the deposition of iron mud the low elimination efficiency of contaminants under alkaline condition in traditional fenton reaction was effectively resolved by 3d ice ef system clo 96 9 was eliminated in 120 min electrolysis at initial ph 9 0 the plausible mechanisms in clo degradation by 3d ice ef system comprise 1 hydroxylation 2 carboxylation 3 carbonylation of cn bond 4 oxidization of 1 3 thiazole heterocycle 5 c n bond hydrolysis 6 c c bond hydrolysis and 7 dechlorination the ecotoxicity evaluation of degradation products indicated that a remarkable tendency to reduce toxicity levels was shown in the clo degradation by 3d ice ef system dechlorination of clo by nzvi was proven productive to toxicity reduction declaration of competing

17802,as endocrine disruptors natural estrogens including estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 in wastewaters of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp as well as other environmental matrix have been widely studied however the far less studied natural estrogens such as 2 hydroxyestrone 2ohe1 16α hydroxyestrone 16α ohe1 4 hydroxyestrone 4ohe1 etc found in human urine have been almost ignored therefore it is important to investigate the occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp and other environment in this study a gc ms analytical method was firstly established and validated for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens in waste and surface waters including e1 e2 e3 2ohe1 16α ohe1 4ohe1 2 hydroxyestradiol 2ohe2 4 hydroxyestradiol 4ohe2 17 epiestriol 17epie3 16 epiestriol 16epie3 and 16keto estradiol 16ketoe2 all the eleven natural estrogens were detected in the influent of one municipal wwtp which ranged from 7 9 to 62 9 ng l the top five natural estrogens in the influent were e1 e3 16α ohe1 16ketoe2 and 2ohe1 with respective concentrations of 62 9 62 6 46 9 32 7 and 28 8 ng l most of them were detected in both the effluent and river water in which their detected concentrations were n d 14 7 and n d 51 7 ng l respectively this work is the first to indicate that the so far less commonly studied natural estrogens in the environment likely pose adverse health effect on humans and wildlife due to their relative strong estrogenic potencies and high levels in wastewater and river water more work should be done to understand their removals in municipal wwtps and their occurrence in surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords gc ms 16α hydroxyestrone 16keto estadiol wastewater river water endocrine disruption 1 introduction endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are chemicals with the potential to elicit negative effects on the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife campbell et al 2006 liu et al 2009a as early as 1970 american researchers studied the biodegradability of steroidal hormones in activated sludge and primary settling sewage which can be considered as the first research in wastewater treatment removal of edcs tabak and bunch 1970 eleven years later the same research group studied the removal performances of 11 large scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps on steroidal hormones tabaka et al 1981 however the term of edcs didn t become the hot research topic in the environmental field until 1990s when more and more publications indicated that edcs could elicit adverse effects on humans and wildlife colborn et al 1993 bergeron et al 1994 baldwin et al 1995 with increasing attention on the adverse effects of edcs investigation campaigns around the world on occurrence and fate of edcs in municipal wwtps as well as other environmental media have been immediately followed desbrow et al 1998 routledge et al 1998 ternes et al 1999a johnson and sumpter 2001 lee and liu 2002 isobe et al 2003 with great efforts in the last decades a wide range of different chemicals have been included into the category of edcs which include but not limited to natural estrogens androgens phytoestrogens mycoestrogens progestins phthalates bisphenol analogues and some other industrial chemicals caliman and gavrilescu 2009 liu et al 2010a 2011a chang et al 2017 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 among these natural estrogens are the most investigated because of their strong estrogenic potencies johnson and williams 2004 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015a natural estrogens in the environmental field mainly refer to estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 there have been lots of studies relating their removals in municipal wwtps nie et al 2009 gomez et al 2012 belhaj et al 2015 liu et al 2015b ben et al 2017 2018 based on the summarized work of liu et al 2015c the global average removals of e1 e2 and e3 by municipal wwtps were 37 8 75 9 and 74 8 respectively which indicated that the removal performances of the global municipal wwtps for e1 e2 and e3 were not excellent there have also been many studies relating their biodegradation based on bench experiments with which the theoretical removals of e1 e2 and e3 by municipal wwtps can be easily calculated ternes et al 1999b onda et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 joss et al 2004 shi et al 2004 li et al 2005 2008 petrie et al 2014 wang et al 2013 the theoretically calculated removals showed that the three natural estrogens could be easily removed by municipal wwtps which was conflict to those of on site investigations liu et al 2015c further analysis showed that natural estrogen conjugates were likely the main reason that why municipal wwtps showed no excellent removal performances on the three natural estrogens and accelerating the deconjugation rate of these estrogen conjugates is the key to obtain better removal of the three natural estrogens liu et al 2015c therefore except natural estrogens it is quite important to monitor natural estrogen conjugates in municipal wwtps which was ignored to some extent although there have been a few related studies on natural estrogen conjugates d ascenzo et al 2003 reddy et al 2005 chen and hu 2009 gomes et al 2009 kumar et al 2011 liu et al 2015d to avoid possible adverse effects on human e2 has been listed as one restricted item in the latest japanese drinking water quality standard yuan et al 2018 natural estrogens in effluents of municipal wwtps are one of the main sources to river waters thus improving the removal performance of municipal wwtps is a crucial step to reduce the occurrence of natural estrogens in the natural environment although physical means and advance chemical oxidation can effectively remove natural estrogens liu et al 2009a biological degradation is still the most desirable solution as it is cost effective which still need to be further studied the main source of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater is human excretion including urine and feces and eleven natural estrogens with estrogenic activities have been commonly found in human urine fotsis and adlercreutz 1987 toniolo et al 1995 liu et al 2009b therefore all these natural estrogens likely exist in municipal wastewater however most studies on occurrence and fate of natural estrogens in municipal wwtp were limited to e1 e2 and e3 while the other natural estrogens were far less studied based on human excretion data and their estrogenic activities our previous work has indicated that these far less studied natural estrogens possessed 18 34 of the total estrogen equivalence eeq in urines of different human populations which evidently suggested that occurrence and fate of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wastewater should be investigated liu et al 2009b very limited studies have shown that four far less studied natural estrogens i e 2 hydroxy estrone 2ohe1 4 hydroxy estrone 4ohe1 2 hydroxy 17β estradiol 2ohe2 and 16α hydroxy estrone 16α ohe1 have been found in influents of municipal wastewaters ternes et al 1999a xiao et al 2001 gentili et al 2002 jiang et al 2005 schlusener and bester 2008 which partially support the theoretical estimation in liu et al 2009b therefore it is very important to investigate the occurrence and fate of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp as well as other environment as natural estrogens exist at extremely low concentration level in environment one of the key points is to develop a sensitive and accurate analytical method unlike e1 e2 and e3 analytical method of these far less studied natural estrogens for waste and surface water is hardly available compared to lc ms ms the gc ms method requires derivatization but is more widely available to researchers as the instrument is generally less costly to purchase and maintain liu et al 2010b therefore the main objectives of this work are to 1 establish an effective and sensitive analytical method with gc ms for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens which can be applicable to wastewater and water samples 2 investigate the occurrence of the eleven natural estrogens in one municipal wwtp and river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents in total 11 natural estrogens were selected as the target compounds which included e1 e2 e3 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 2ohe2 4 hydroxyestradiol 4ohe2 17 epiestriol 17epie3 16 epiestriol 16epie3 and 16 ketoestradiol 16ketoe2 e1 e2 and e3 were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 17β estradiol d4 e2 d4 was used as the internal standard is which was also purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 2ohe2 2ohe2 17epie3 16epie3 16ketoe2 were bought from steraloids inc usa each targeted natural estrogen had a purity of at least 98 the basic information of the eleven target natural estrogens was summarized in table s1 which showed all of them possess estrogenic potencies derivative reagent bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide with 1 chlorotrimethylsilane bstfa with 1 tmcs was purchased from regis technologies usa inc n n dimethylformamide dmf and ethyl acetate etac were obtained from anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china inc methanol meoh was obtained from fisher chemical shanghai china all solvents were of hplc grade stock solution 50 μg ml of each compound was prepared with meoh and stored at 20 c 2 2 sample collection and sample preparation grab wastewater samples were collected in a municipal wwtp which locates in guangzhou guangdong province china and the wwtp is running with anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process the municipal wwtp has a daily treatment capability of 500 000 m3 and the serving population is about 1 350 000 raw and secondary settling wastewater samples were collected on november 20th 2019 river sample was collected from the pearl river located in guangzhou higher education mega center on november 1 2019 before extraction these water samples were filtered under vacuum with a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter according to walker and watson 2010 the loss of natural estrogens during the above filtration was negligible which represented their aqueous concentrations after the filtration the filtered water was ready for extraction the extraction column oasis hlb cartridge 225 mg waters usa was sequentially preconditioned with 6 ml of etac 6 ml of methanol and 10 ml of ultrapure water at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min in each extraction 1000 ml of filtered wastewater or water sample was loaded to the oasis hlb cartridge by aqual loader iii sample concentrator gl science japan at a flow rate of 10 ml min after the loading the cartridge was sequentially washed with 10 ml of 10 methanol 10 ml of ultrapure water and 10 ml of 10 methanol solution containing 2 nh4oh then the washed column was dried for 60 min under vacuum finally the target natural estrogens were sequentially eluted with 8 ml meoh etac solution 2 8 v v and 2 ml etac solution which was collected with a brown glass tube after the elution 50 ng is was added to the eluate thereafter the eluate was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 c and the eluate was ready for derivatization after the derivatization the sample was re dried under a gently stream of nitrogen and re dissolved with 1 ml of etac the enrichment factor for each water sample was 1000 blank control was performed with ultrapure water for quality control and each blank control or water sample was performed in triplicate 2 3 derivatization procedure fifty microliter of dmf and 50 μl of bstfa 1 tmcs were sequentially added to the glass tube with the standard natural estrogens or the above dried extract the tube was firmly capped mixed and heated in a temperature adjustable oven at 80 c for 1 h after the derivatization the tube was naturally cooled down to room temperature and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen finally 1 ml of etac was added then the tube was well mixed and the etac solution was transferred to a 2 ml amber vial for gc ms analysis 2 4 gc ms analysis gc ms analysis was performed using an agilent 7890b series gas chromatograph with a 5977a single quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent usa separation was accomplished with a hp 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa the oven temperature program was initial temperature at 100 c rising at 10 c min to 200 c then 8 c min to 260 c then 3 c min to 310 c and finally held at 310 c for 2 min helium purity 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0 85 ml min the injector transfer line and ion source were set at 280 c 250 c and 230 c respectively sample injection at 1 μl was in splitless mode the mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 ev the time for solvent delay was set to 4 min the whole gc ms analysis time was about 37 min for each injection fig 1 showed the chromatogram of the eleven target compounds at a concentration of 100 μg l which showed that these target compounds were all well separated except for 2ohe2 and 4ohe1 nevertheless due to their different confirmative ions and quantitative ions 2ohe2 and 4ohe1 could still be distinguished well and gave no influence in their quantification the target natural estrogens were determined using selected ion monitoring sim mode with the retention time confirmation ions and quantitative ions being listed in table 1 2 5 validation of the developed method standard calibration curves were established at six different standard concentration levels 10 200 ng ml which was based on the internal standard method lod and limit of quantification loq for different matrix were calculated based on three times and ten times the standard deviation sd in which the sd was calculated by spiking the eleven standard natural estrogens at a concentration of 10 ng l equally to the lowest concentration of 10 ng ml for the standard calibration n 7 into different water matrix liu et al 2010b yuan et al 2017 recovery experiments were performed by spiking three known concentrations 20 100 and 200 ng l into different water matrix including ultrapure water influent and effluent of a municipal wwtp and the pearl river water meanwhile the same sample without spiking was also analyzed and any detected background concentration was deducted 2 6 potential estrogenic effects of natural estrogens in real samples to evaluate the potential estrogenic effects of these natural estrogens in real environmental samples the chemically calculated eeq was adopted previously luo et al 2020 i e 1 e e q r b a i c i where rbai means the relative binding affinity of an individual natural estrogen which is determined from an estrogen receptor competitive ligand binding assay er binding assay ci is the concentration of an individual natural estrogen in real water wastewater sample e2 the strongest natural estrogenic compound is often selected as the standard estrogenic compound for which its rba is arbitrarily set to 1 therefore the unit of eeq is expressed as nge2 l each natural estrogen analyzed with different bioassays showed different rba liu et al 2009b to avoid possible underestimation of estrogenic effects the maximum rba of each natural estrogen in table s1 was selected for the above calculation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the analytical method the developed method was validated with respect to linear range coefficient of determination limit of detection and recovery as shown in table 2 all the eleven target natural estrogens showed satisfactory linearity r2 0 983 the lod and loq of all the eleven target compounds for ultrapure water were 1 4 2 9 and 4 8 10 1 ng l respectively for influent the corresponding lod and loq were 2 3 5 9 and 7 7 19 6 ng l respectively the lod and loq for the pearl river water were 2 4 6 0 and 7 9 19 8 ng l respectively the sensitivity of this developed method was compared with other studies based on gc ms for analysis of natural estrogens as shown in table 3 the loq values of this developed method for the eleven natural estrogens were a little higher than those of most other studies however it should be noted that our method covered much more natural estrogens most of which were never analyzed by others meanwhile the loq calculated with 10 times that of the standard deviation for multiple injections is likely larger than that based on 10 times the ratio of the signal to noise s n which can also be seen in other studies liu et al 2010b 2010c atkinson et al 2012 in addition the calculation of our method accounted the influence of both sample extraction and matrix interference of influent or river water which likely led to higher loq for natural estrogens the lc ms based method normally shows more sensitivity to that of gc ms liu et al 2009b however the sensitivity of this developed method showed better performance to that of the lc time of flight ms method as shown in honda et al 2018 which covered eight natural estrogens with loq values of 6 58 ng l for wastewater effluent sample in short our developed gc ms method showed satisfactory sensitivity the average recovery efficiencies of all the eleven natural estrogens for ultrapure water varied from 54 4 to 101 8 with relative standard deviation rsd ranging from 2 1 to 17 1 table 4 the average recovery efficiencies of all the target natural estrogens except 4ohe2 for influent effluent and pearl river water samples ranged from 59 5 to 114 9 60 8 112 5 and 67 4 116 9 respectively the precision of the established method expressed as rsd ranged from 2 1 to 19 2 in all samples except for 2ohe2 the recovery efficiencies of the other ten natural estrogens satisfied the requirements of the wastewater analytical manual of japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlitt in which recovery efficiency between 50 and 120 and rsd within 20 are regarded as acceptable liu et al 2011b yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the recovery efficiencies of 2ohe2 in influent effluent and pearl river water samples ranged from 32 0 to 57 2 which were relative low in the work of ashfaq et al 2018 based on gc ms the recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 for wastewater sample was 72 3 which was higher than that of this study but 17epie3 was not included in the above mentioned work the reason for the relative low recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 is likely the co elution of 17epie3 which interferes with the analysis of 4ohe2 fotsis and adlercreuz 1987 likely encountered the same problem who analyzed as many as fourteen natural estrogens in human urine with gc ms but 4ohe2 was not included so did lee et al 2003 who also analyzed fourteen natural estrogens in urines of female cancer patient with gc ms leaving 4ohe2 not included further work is needed to eliminate the interference so as satisfactory recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 can be obtained except 2ohe2 with poor recovery all parameters including linearity sensitivity recovery and precision suggest that the developed method is reliable and appropriate for trace determination of the eleven natural estrogens in wastewater and river water samples 3 2 eleven natural estrogens in municipal wastewaters and river water the established method was applied to determine the concentrations of the eleven natural estrogens in influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as one pearl river water sample their occurrence in wastewater and river water is shown in table 5 all the target eleven natural estrogens were detected in wastewater influent which ranged from 7 9 to 62 9 ng l among the three most studied natural estrogens e1 and e3 in the influent showed evident higher concentrations than that of e2 which was similar to those of other studies schlusener and bester 2008 liu et al 2011b ye et al 2012 wu et al 2017 the concentration of e2 in the influent was 16 3 ng l which was a normal level to most municipal wastewaters liu et al 2015c however the concentrations of six out of the eight far less studied natural estrogens in the influent were unexpectedly higher than that of e2 among these the respective concentrations of 16αohe1 and 16ketoe2 in the influent were 46 9 and 32 7 ng l which were 2 9 and 2 times that of e2 respectively the corresponding concentrations of 2ohe2 4ohe2 17epie3 and 16epie3 in the influent were 19 1 7 9 16 3 and 13 9 ng l respectively considering their concentration levels and relative high estrogenic potencies of these far less studied natural estrogens table s1 they would give an important contribution to the total eeq of the influent as shown in table 5 the total calculated natural estrogens derived eeq in the influent was 140 5 ng e2 l while the total far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq was 74 7 ng e2 l the latter contributed to 53 2 of the total natural estrogens derived eeq of the influent in previous studies the chemically calculated eeq via chemical analysis only contributed to 10 52 4 of the eeq via er binding assays which suggested that there were many unknown estrogenic compounds existed in the raw municipal wastewaters murk et al 2002 liu et al 2009c 2011b this study clearly suggested that these far less studied natural estrogens likely be the main unknown estrogenic compounds existed in the raw municipal wastewaters in the effluent six out of the eleven target natural estrogens were detected these detected natural estrogens were e1 e3 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 and their respective concentrations were 14 7 7 2 6 6 6 3 14 4 and 5 1 ng l the concentration levels of e1 and e3 in the effluent were similar to the work of ben et al 2018 who reported the corresponding concentrations were 0 1 15 3 and 0 4 6 8 ng l in 14 municipal wwtps in china e1 and 16α ohe1 were the two most abundantly detected natural estrogens in the effluent and both of them were detected at a concentration of around 14 ng l it is not surprising that e1 was detected as one of the dominant natural estrogens in the effluent which has been proven by lots of studies liu et al 2015b this work suggest that 16α ohe1 likely be another main natural estrogen in effluent of municipal wwtp which agreed well with the work of schlusener and bester 2008 who found that 16αohe1 was frequently detected in both the influent and effluent of three municipal wwtps similar to the influent the far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq contributed to 43 8 of the total natural estrogens derived eeq one river water sample was collected from the pearl river and analyzed with the developed analytical method seven out of the eleven detected natural estrogens were detected in the river water sample 16α ohe1 16ketoe2 e1 and 4ohe1 were the four most dominant natural estrogens in the river water sample and their respective concentrations were 51 7 16 6 11 4 and 10 3 ng l while the other three far less studied natural estrogens were detected with relative low concentrations ranging from 3 9 to 7 6 ng l it is interesting to find that the concentrations of 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 in the pearl river water were higher than their corresponding concentrations in the effluent of the municipal wwtp and the 16α ohe1 concentration in the pearl river water was even higher than that of the influent as all effluents of municipal wwtps in guangzhou city were discharged into pearl river water two possible reasons may explain the above investigated result one possible reason is that the removal performance of 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 by the local municipal wwtps was not stable and varied greatly with time another possible reason is that some untreated municipal wastewater was directly discharged into pearl river water it should be pointed out that the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the pearl river water sample was as high as 37 7 ng e2 l which was over 2 3 times that of the effluent sample the high contribution ratio of 62 6 for the far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq to the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the pearl river water sample suggest that the far less studied natural estrogens in the river water should also be paid with more attention as shown above in this study many far less studied natural estrogens besides e1 e2 and e3 were detected in the influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as the pearl river water which suggested that they should be studied with more attention to provide a thorough comparison all related studies on occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in different environmental samples were summarized in table 6 it is not difficult to conclude that there are only very limited studies available on the occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in wastewater and surface water among which 16α ohe1 is the most studied there is seriously lack of investigation in their occurrence and removals in municipal wwtps and their occurrence in surface water as well 3 3 significance of this work it was reported that estrogenic compounds at environmentally relevant concentration including natural estrogens could affect fish and other animals such as collapse of a fish population intersex and reproductive disorder hotchkiss et al 2008 lange and katsu 2012 adeel et al 2017 therefore occurrence and fate of natural estrogens in different environment have been extensively studied however most studies only focused on e1 e2 and e3 and the other natural estrogens have been almost ignored this study is the first to find that all the eleven studied natural estrogens occurred in the influent of one municipal wwtp and most of them also exist in the corresponding effluent as well as river water meanwhile these far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq contributed a big proportion to that of the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as the pearl river water it has been reported that 16α ohe1 might act as an initiator of preneoplastic transformation telang et al 1992 16α ohe1 has also been reported that it functioned as a modulator of human breast tumor cell growth suto et al 1999 lee et al 2008 similar to 16α ohe1 4ohe1 and 4ohe2 could stimulate growth of human breast cell line mcf 7 lippert et al 2000 therefore the potential risk of these far less studied natural estrogens to humans via exogenous exposure cannot be ignored there have been no endocrine disrupting data of these far less studied natural estrogens available on fish or other wildlife yet however studies have shown that e1 e2 and e3 could cause vitellogenin induction in different fishes kang et al 2002 brion et al 2004 lange and katsu 2012 urbatzka et al 2012 moreover it was further confirmed that the vitellogenin inductions of fishes in vivo by estrogens were strongly relevant to their estrogenic potencies in vitro lange and katsu 2012 therefore existence of the far less studied natural estrogens in different environment at relative high concentrations may also pose potential adverse effects to fish and other wildlife zhu et al 2006 liu et al 2009b kidd et al 2007 2014 in order to protect our humans and wildlife it is necessary to decrease the input of these far less studied natural estrogens besides e1 e2 and e3 into the environment it is well known that municipal wwtp has played an important role on reduction of e1 e2 and e3 into the receiving bodies hence it is necessary and urgent to investigate the occurrence and removals of these far less studied natural estrogens by different municipal wwtps which can provide useful reference to judge whether further treatment such as physical adsorption or chemical advance oxidation is necessary or not meanwhile in order to accurately evaluate their ecological risks researches in their toxicity and endocrine disruption on different fishes and other animal models are urgently to be performed 4 conclusions occurrence of major natural estrogens including e1 e2 and e3 in municipal wwtp and other environment has been extensively investigated however the other natural estrogens may also exist in municipal wwtp and other environment based on their human urinary excretions which have been hardly performed this study is the first to develop an effective gc ms analytical method for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens in municipal wastewater and river water our result showed that all of the far less studied natural estrogens were detected in the influent of one municipal wwtp and most of them existed both in the effluent and river water based on the relative strong estrogenic potencies and high concentrations of these far less studied natural estrogens in different waters they may pose adverse health effects to humans and wildlife due to limited wastewater water sample size in this study more work should be performed to investigate the removals of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp and their occurrence in other environments meanwhile their toxicity and endocrine disruption on different fishes and other animal

17802,as endocrine disruptors natural estrogens including estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 in wastewaters of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp as well as other environmental matrix have been widely studied however the far less studied natural estrogens such as 2 hydroxyestrone 2ohe1 16α hydroxyestrone 16α ohe1 4 hydroxyestrone 4ohe1 etc found in human urine have been almost ignored therefore it is important to investigate the occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp and other environment in this study a gc ms analytical method was firstly established and validated for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens in waste and surface waters including e1 e2 e3 2ohe1 16α ohe1 4ohe1 2 hydroxyestradiol 2ohe2 4 hydroxyestradiol 4ohe2 17 epiestriol 17epie3 16 epiestriol 16epie3 and 16keto estradiol 16ketoe2 all the eleven natural estrogens were detected in the influent of one municipal wwtp which ranged from 7 9 to 62 9 ng l the top five natural estrogens in the influent were e1 e3 16α ohe1 16ketoe2 and 2ohe1 with respective concentrations of 62 9 62 6 46 9 32 7 and 28 8 ng l most of them were detected in both the effluent and river water in which their detected concentrations were n d 14 7 and n d 51 7 ng l respectively this work is the first to indicate that the so far less commonly studied natural estrogens in the environment likely pose adverse health effect on humans and wildlife due to their relative strong estrogenic potencies and high levels in wastewater and river water more work should be done to understand their removals in municipal wwtps and their occurrence in surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords gc ms 16α hydroxyestrone 16keto estadiol wastewater river water endocrine disruption 1 introduction endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are chemicals with the potential to elicit negative effects on the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife campbell et al 2006 liu et al 2009a as early as 1970 american researchers studied the biodegradability of steroidal hormones in activated sludge and primary settling sewage which can be considered as the first research in wastewater treatment removal of edcs tabak and bunch 1970 eleven years later the same research group studied the removal performances of 11 large scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps on steroidal hormones tabaka et al 1981 however the term of edcs didn t become the hot research topic in the environmental field until 1990s when more and more publications indicated that edcs could elicit adverse effects on humans and wildlife colborn et al 1993 bergeron et al 1994 baldwin et al 1995 with increasing attention on the adverse effects of edcs investigation campaigns around the world on occurrence and fate of edcs in municipal wwtps as well as other environmental media have been immediately followed desbrow et al 1998 routledge et al 1998 ternes et al 1999a johnson and sumpter 2001 lee and liu 2002 isobe et al 2003 with great efforts in the last decades a wide range of different chemicals have been included into the category of edcs which include but not limited to natural estrogens androgens phytoestrogens mycoestrogens progestins phthalates bisphenol analogues and some other industrial chemicals caliman and gavrilescu 2009 liu et al 2010a 2011a chang et al 2017 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 among these natural estrogens are the most investigated because of their strong estrogenic potencies johnson and williams 2004 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015a natural estrogens in the environmental field mainly refer to estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 there have been lots of studies relating their removals in municipal wwtps nie et al 2009 gomez et al 2012 belhaj et al 2015 liu et al 2015b ben et al 2017 2018 based on the summarized work of liu et al 2015c the global average removals of e1 e2 and e3 by municipal wwtps were 37 8 75 9 and 74 8 respectively which indicated that the removal performances of the global municipal wwtps for e1 e2 and e3 were not excellent there have also been many studies relating their biodegradation based on bench experiments with which the theoretical removals of e1 e2 and e3 by municipal wwtps can be easily calculated ternes et al 1999b onda et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 joss et al 2004 shi et al 2004 li et al 2005 2008 petrie et al 2014 wang et al 2013 the theoretically calculated removals showed that the three natural estrogens could be easily removed by municipal wwtps which was conflict to those of on site investigations liu et al 2015c further analysis showed that natural estrogen conjugates were likely the main reason that why municipal wwtps showed no excellent removal performances on the three natural estrogens and accelerating the deconjugation rate of these estrogen conjugates is the key to obtain better removal of the three natural estrogens liu et al 2015c therefore except natural estrogens it is quite important to monitor natural estrogen conjugates in municipal wwtps which was ignored to some extent although there have been a few related studies on natural estrogen conjugates d ascenzo et al 2003 reddy et al 2005 chen and hu 2009 gomes et al 2009 kumar et al 2011 liu et al 2015d to avoid possible adverse effects on human e2 has been listed as one restricted item in the latest japanese drinking water quality standard yuan et al 2018 natural estrogens in effluents of municipal wwtps are one of the main sources to river waters thus improving the removal performance of municipal wwtps is a crucial step to reduce the occurrence of natural estrogens in the natural environment although physical means and advance chemical oxidation can effectively remove natural estrogens liu et al 2009a biological degradation is still the most desirable solution as it is cost effective which still need to be further studied the main source of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater is human excretion including urine and feces and eleven natural estrogens with estrogenic activities have been commonly found in human urine fotsis and adlercreutz 1987 toniolo et al 1995 liu et al 2009b therefore all these natural estrogens likely exist in municipal wastewater however most studies on occurrence and fate of natural estrogens in municipal wwtp were limited to e1 e2 and e3 while the other natural estrogens were far less studied based on human excretion data and their estrogenic activities our previous work has indicated that these far less studied natural estrogens possessed 18 34 of the total estrogen equivalence eeq in urines of different human populations which evidently suggested that occurrence and fate of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wastewater should be investigated liu et al 2009b very limited studies have shown that four far less studied natural estrogens i e 2 hydroxy estrone 2ohe1 4 hydroxy estrone 4ohe1 2 hydroxy 17β estradiol 2ohe2 and 16α hydroxy estrone 16α ohe1 have been found in influents of municipal wastewaters ternes et al 1999a xiao et al 2001 gentili et al 2002 jiang et al 2005 schlusener and bester 2008 which partially support the theoretical estimation in liu et al 2009b therefore it is very important to investigate the occurrence and fate of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp as well as other environment as natural estrogens exist at extremely low concentration level in environment one of the key points is to develop a sensitive and accurate analytical method unlike e1 e2 and e3 analytical method of these far less studied natural estrogens for waste and surface water is hardly available compared to lc ms ms the gc ms method requires derivatization but is more widely available to researchers as the instrument is generally less costly to purchase and maintain liu et al 2010b therefore the main objectives of this work are to 1 establish an effective and sensitive analytical method with gc ms for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens which can be applicable to wastewater and water samples 2 investigate the occurrence of the eleven natural estrogens in one municipal wwtp and river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents in total 11 natural estrogens were selected as the target compounds which included e1 e2 e3 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 2ohe2 4 hydroxyestradiol 4ohe2 17 epiestriol 17epie3 16 epiestriol 16epie3 and 16 ketoestradiol 16ketoe2 e1 e2 and e3 were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 17β estradiol d4 e2 d4 was used as the internal standard is which was also purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 2ohe2 2ohe2 17epie3 16epie3 16ketoe2 were bought from steraloids inc usa each targeted natural estrogen had a purity of at least 98 the basic information of the eleven target natural estrogens was summarized in table s1 which showed all of them possess estrogenic potencies derivative reagent bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide with 1 chlorotrimethylsilane bstfa with 1 tmcs was purchased from regis technologies usa inc n n dimethylformamide dmf and ethyl acetate etac were obtained from anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china inc methanol meoh was obtained from fisher chemical shanghai china all solvents were of hplc grade stock solution 50 μg ml of each compound was prepared with meoh and stored at 20 c 2 2 sample collection and sample preparation grab wastewater samples were collected in a municipal wwtp which locates in guangzhou guangdong province china and the wwtp is running with anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process the municipal wwtp has a daily treatment capability of 500 000 m3 and the serving population is about 1 350 000 raw and secondary settling wastewater samples were collected on november 20th 2019 river sample was collected from the pearl river located in guangzhou higher education mega center on november 1 2019 before extraction these water samples were filtered under vacuum with a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter according to walker and watson 2010 the loss of natural estrogens during the above filtration was negligible which represented their aqueous concentrations after the filtration the filtered water was ready for extraction the extraction column oasis hlb cartridge 225 mg waters usa was sequentially preconditioned with 6 ml of etac 6 ml of methanol and 10 ml of ultrapure water at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min in each extraction 1000 ml of filtered wastewater or water sample was loaded to the oasis hlb cartridge by aqual loader iii sample concentrator gl science japan at a flow rate of 10 ml min after the loading the cartridge was sequentially washed with 10 ml of 10 methanol 10 ml of ultrapure water and 10 ml of 10 methanol solution containing 2 nh4oh then the washed column was dried for 60 min under vacuum finally the target natural estrogens were sequentially eluted with 8 ml meoh etac solution 2 8 v v and 2 ml etac solution which was collected with a brown glass tube after the elution 50 ng is was added to the eluate thereafter the eluate was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 c and the eluate was ready for derivatization after the derivatization the sample was re dried under a gently stream of nitrogen and re dissolved with 1 ml of etac the enrichment factor for each water sample was 1000 blank control was performed with ultrapure water for quality control and each blank control or water sample was performed in triplicate 2 3 derivatization procedure fifty microliter of dmf and 50 μl of bstfa 1 tmcs were sequentially added to the glass tube with the standard natural estrogens or the above dried extract the tube was firmly capped mixed and heated in a temperature adjustable oven at 80 c for 1 h after the derivatization the tube was naturally cooled down to room temperature and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen finally 1 ml of etac was added then the tube was well mixed and the etac solution was transferred to a 2 ml amber vial for gc ms analysis 2 4 gc ms analysis gc ms analysis was performed using an agilent 7890b series gas chromatograph with a 5977a single quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent usa separation was accomplished with a hp 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa the oven temperature program was initial temperature at 100 c rising at 10 c min to 200 c then 8 c min to 260 c then 3 c min to 310 c and finally held at 310 c for 2 min helium purity 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0 85 ml min the injector transfer line and ion source were set at 280 c 250 c and 230 c respectively sample injection at 1 μl was in splitless mode the mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 ev the time for solvent delay was set to 4 min the whole gc ms analysis time was about 37 min for each injection fig 1 showed the chromatogram of the eleven target compounds at a concentration of 100 μg l which showed that these target compounds were all well separated except for 2ohe2 and 4ohe1 nevertheless due to their different confirmative ions and quantitative ions 2ohe2 and 4ohe1 could still be distinguished well and gave no influence in their quantification the target natural estrogens were determined using selected ion monitoring sim mode with the retention time confirmation ions and quantitative ions being listed in table 1 2 5 validation of the developed method standard calibration curves were established at six different standard concentration levels 10 200 ng ml which was based on the internal standard method lod and limit of quantification loq for different matrix were calculated based on three times and ten times the standard deviation sd in which the sd was calculated by spiking the eleven standard natural estrogens at a concentration of 10 ng l equally to the lowest concentration of 10 ng ml for the standard calibration n 7 into different water matrix liu et al 2010b yuan et al 2017 recovery experiments were performed by spiking three known concentrations 20 100 and 200 ng l into different water matrix including ultrapure water influent and effluent of a municipal wwtp and the pearl river water meanwhile the same sample without spiking was also analyzed and any detected background concentration was deducted 2 6 potential estrogenic effects of natural estrogens in real samples to evaluate the potential estrogenic effects of these natural estrogens in real environmental samples the chemically calculated eeq was adopted previously luo et al 2020 i e 1 e e q r b a i c i where rbai means the relative binding affinity of an individual natural estrogen which is determined from an estrogen receptor competitive ligand binding assay er binding assay ci is the concentration of an individual natural estrogen in real water wastewater sample e2 the strongest natural estrogenic compound is often selected as the standard estrogenic compound for which its rba is arbitrarily set to 1 therefore the unit of eeq is expressed as nge2 l each natural estrogen analyzed with different bioassays showed different rba liu et al 2009b to avoid possible underestimation of estrogenic effects the maximum rba of each natural estrogen in table s1 was selected for the above calculation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the analytical method the developed method was validated with respect to linear range coefficient of determination limit of detection and recovery as shown in table 2 all the eleven target natural estrogens showed satisfactory linearity r2 0 983 the lod and loq of all the eleven target compounds for ultrapure water were 1 4 2 9 and 4 8 10 1 ng l respectively for influent the corresponding lod and loq were 2 3 5 9 and 7 7 19 6 ng l respectively the lod and loq for the pearl river water were 2 4 6 0 and 7 9 19 8 ng l respectively the sensitivity of this developed method was compared with other studies based on gc ms for analysis of natural estrogens as shown in table 3 the loq values of this developed method for the eleven natural estrogens were a little higher than those of most other studies however it should be noted that our method covered much more natural estrogens most of which were never analyzed by others meanwhile the loq calculated with 10 times that of the standard deviation for multiple injections is likely larger than that based on 10 times the ratio of the signal to noise s n which can also be seen in other studies liu et al 2010b 2010c atkinson et al 2012 in addition the calculation of our method accounted the influence of both sample extraction and matrix interference of influent or river water which likely led to higher loq for natural estrogens the lc ms based method normally shows more sensitivity to that of gc ms liu et al 2009b however the sensitivity of this developed method showed better performance to that of the lc time of flight ms method as shown in honda et al 2018 which covered eight natural estrogens with loq values of 6 58 ng l for wastewater effluent sample in short our developed gc ms method showed satisfactory sensitivity the average recovery efficiencies of all the eleven natural estrogens for ultrapure water varied from 54 4 to 101 8 with relative standard deviation rsd ranging from 2 1 to 17 1 table 4 the average recovery efficiencies of all the target natural estrogens except 4ohe2 for influent effluent and pearl river water samples ranged from 59 5 to 114 9 60 8 112 5 and 67 4 116 9 respectively the precision of the established method expressed as rsd ranged from 2 1 to 19 2 in all samples except for 2ohe2 the recovery efficiencies of the other ten natural estrogens satisfied the requirements of the wastewater analytical manual of japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlitt in which recovery efficiency between 50 and 120 and rsd within 20 are regarded as acceptable liu et al 2011b yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the recovery efficiencies of 2ohe2 in influent effluent and pearl river water samples ranged from 32 0 to 57 2 which were relative low in the work of ashfaq et al 2018 based on gc ms the recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 for wastewater sample was 72 3 which was higher than that of this study but 17epie3 was not included in the above mentioned work the reason for the relative low recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 is likely the co elution of 17epie3 which interferes with the analysis of 4ohe2 fotsis and adlercreuz 1987 likely encountered the same problem who analyzed as many as fourteen natural estrogens in human urine with gc ms but 4ohe2 was not included so did lee et al 2003 who also analyzed fourteen natural estrogens in urines of female cancer patient with gc ms leaving 4ohe2 not included further work is needed to eliminate the interference so as satisfactory recovery efficiency of 4ohe2 can be obtained except 2ohe2 with poor recovery all parameters including linearity sensitivity recovery and precision suggest that the developed method is reliable and appropriate for trace determination of the eleven natural estrogens in wastewater and river water samples 3 2 eleven natural estrogens in municipal wastewaters and river water the established method was applied to determine the concentrations of the eleven natural estrogens in influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as one pearl river water sample their occurrence in wastewater and river water is shown in table 5 all the target eleven natural estrogens were detected in wastewater influent which ranged from 7 9 to 62 9 ng l among the three most studied natural estrogens e1 and e3 in the influent showed evident higher concentrations than that of e2 which was similar to those of other studies schlusener and bester 2008 liu et al 2011b ye et al 2012 wu et al 2017 the concentration of e2 in the influent was 16 3 ng l which was a normal level to most municipal wastewaters liu et al 2015c however the concentrations of six out of the eight far less studied natural estrogens in the influent were unexpectedly higher than that of e2 among these the respective concentrations of 16αohe1 and 16ketoe2 in the influent were 46 9 and 32 7 ng l which were 2 9 and 2 times that of e2 respectively the corresponding concentrations of 2ohe2 4ohe2 17epie3 and 16epie3 in the influent were 19 1 7 9 16 3 and 13 9 ng l respectively considering their concentration levels and relative high estrogenic potencies of these far less studied natural estrogens table s1 they would give an important contribution to the total eeq of the influent as shown in table 5 the total calculated natural estrogens derived eeq in the influent was 140 5 ng e2 l while the total far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq was 74 7 ng e2 l the latter contributed to 53 2 of the total natural estrogens derived eeq of the influent in previous studies the chemically calculated eeq via chemical analysis only contributed to 10 52 4 of the eeq via er binding assays which suggested that there were many unknown estrogenic compounds existed in the raw municipal wastewaters murk et al 2002 liu et al 2009c 2011b this study clearly suggested that these far less studied natural estrogens likely be the main unknown estrogenic compounds existed in the raw municipal wastewaters in the effluent six out of the eleven target natural estrogens were detected these detected natural estrogens were e1 e3 2ohe1 4ohe1 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 and their respective concentrations were 14 7 7 2 6 6 6 3 14 4 and 5 1 ng l the concentration levels of e1 and e3 in the effluent were similar to the work of ben et al 2018 who reported the corresponding concentrations were 0 1 15 3 and 0 4 6 8 ng l in 14 municipal wwtps in china e1 and 16α ohe1 were the two most abundantly detected natural estrogens in the effluent and both of them were detected at a concentration of around 14 ng l it is not surprising that e1 was detected as one of the dominant natural estrogens in the effluent which has been proven by lots of studies liu et al 2015b this work suggest that 16α ohe1 likely be another main natural estrogen in effluent of municipal wwtp which agreed well with the work of schlusener and bester 2008 who found that 16αohe1 was frequently detected in both the influent and effluent of three municipal wwtps similar to the influent the far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq contributed to 43 8 of the total natural estrogens derived eeq one river water sample was collected from the pearl river and analyzed with the developed analytical method seven out of the eleven detected natural estrogens were detected in the river water sample 16α ohe1 16ketoe2 e1 and 4ohe1 were the four most dominant natural estrogens in the river water sample and their respective concentrations were 51 7 16 6 11 4 and 10 3 ng l while the other three far less studied natural estrogens were detected with relative low concentrations ranging from 3 9 to 7 6 ng l it is interesting to find that the concentrations of 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 in the pearl river water were higher than their corresponding concentrations in the effluent of the municipal wwtp and the 16α ohe1 concentration in the pearl river water was even higher than that of the influent as all effluents of municipal wwtps in guangzhou city were discharged into pearl river water two possible reasons may explain the above investigated result one possible reason is that the removal performance of 16α ohe1 and 16ketoe2 by the local municipal wwtps was not stable and varied greatly with time another possible reason is that some untreated municipal wastewater was directly discharged into pearl river water it should be pointed out that the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the pearl river water sample was as high as 37 7 ng e2 l which was over 2 3 times that of the effluent sample the high contribution ratio of 62 6 for the far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq to the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the pearl river water sample suggest that the far less studied natural estrogens in the river water should also be paid with more attention as shown above in this study many far less studied natural estrogens besides e1 e2 and e3 were detected in the influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as the pearl river water which suggested that they should be studied with more attention to provide a thorough comparison all related studies on occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in different environmental samples were summarized in table 6 it is not difficult to conclude that there are only very limited studies available on the occurrence of these far less studied natural estrogens in wastewater and surface water among which 16α ohe1 is the most studied there is seriously lack of investigation in their occurrence and removals in municipal wwtps and their occurrence in surface water as well 3 3 significance of this work it was reported that estrogenic compounds at environmentally relevant concentration including natural estrogens could affect fish and other animals such as collapse of a fish population intersex and reproductive disorder hotchkiss et al 2008 lange and katsu 2012 adeel et al 2017 therefore occurrence and fate of natural estrogens in different environment have been extensively studied however most studies only focused on e1 e2 and e3 and the other natural estrogens have been almost ignored this study is the first to find that all the eleven studied natural estrogens occurred in the influent of one municipal wwtp and most of them also exist in the corresponding effluent as well as river water meanwhile these far less studied natural estrogens derived eeq contributed a big proportion to that of the total natural estrogens derived eeq in the influent and effluent of one municipal wwtp as well as the pearl river water it has been reported that 16α ohe1 might act as an initiator of preneoplastic transformation telang et al 1992 16α ohe1 has also been reported that it functioned as a modulator of human breast tumor cell growth suto et al 1999 lee et al 2008 similar to 16α ohe1 4ohe1 and 4ohe2 could stimulate growth of human breast cell line mcf 7 lippert et al 2000 therefore the potential risk of these far less studied natural estrogens to humans via exogenous exposure cannot be ignored there have been no endocrine disrupting data of these far less studied natural estrogens available on fish or other wildlife yet however studies have shown that e1 e2 and e3 could cause vitellogenin induction in different fishes kang et al 2002 brion et al 2004 lange and katsu 2012 urbatzka et al 2012 moreover it was further confirmed that the vitellogenin inductions of fishes in vivo by estrogens were strongly relevant to their estrogenic potencies in vitro lange and katsu 2012 therefore existence of the far less studied natural estrogens in different environment at relative high concentrations may also pose potential adverse effects to fish and other wildlife zhu et al 2006 liu et al 2009b kidd et al 2007 2014 in order to protect our humans and wildlife it is necessary to decrease the input of these far less studied natural estrogens besides e1 e2 and e3 into the environment it is well known that municipal wwtp has played an important role on reduction of e1 e2 and e3 into the receiving bodies hence it is necessary and urgent to investigate the occurrence and removals of these far less studied natural estrogens by different municipal wwtps which can provide useful reference to judge whether further treatment such as physical adsorption or chemical advance oxidation is necessary or not meanwhile in order to accurately evaluate their ecological risks researches in their toxicity and endocrine disruption on different fishes and other animal models are urgently to be performed 4 conclusions occurrence of major natural estrogens including e1 e2 and e3 in municipal wwtp and other environment has been extensively investigated however the other natural estrogens may also exist in municipal wwtp and other environment based on their human urinary excretions which have been hardly performed this study is the first to develop an effective gc ms analytical method for trace determination of eleven natural estrogens in municipal wastewater and river water our result showed that all of the far less studied natural estrogens were detected in the influent of one municipal wwtp and most of them existed both in the effluent and river water based on the relative strong estrogenic potencies and high concentrations of these far less studied natural estrogens in different waters they may pose adverse health effects to humans and wildlife due to limited wastewater water sample size in this study more work should be performed to investigate the removals of these far less studied natural estrogens in municipal wwtp and their occurrence in other environments meanwhile their toxicity and endocrine disruption on different fishes and other animal models are urgently to be established in order to accurately evaluate their potential ecological risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

the induced colloidal steric hindrance for example the aggregate sizes of 500 nm np decreased from 1740 87 nm to 765 8 nm at 40 min which resulted in the enhanced transportation of np the calculated interaction energies indicated the bsa corona induced high energy barriers 104 kbt between 1000 nm nps and sand surface demonstrating the bsa enhanced transport of 1000 nm nps the mass percentage recovered from the effluent meff increased from 33 4 to 61 7 inversely the lsz corona triggered the aggregation of 200 nm nps into the large aggregates via electrostatic adsorption and bridging effect thereby inhibiting the transport of 200 nm nps nevertheless no lsz corona was formed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps due to extremely low protein adsorption accordingly lsz cannot affect the stability and transport of these nps in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu the strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged lsz and 500 nm nps significantly increased and the lsz corona formed which induced the aggregation of 500 nm nps the meff of nps therefore decreased from 53 1 to 11 2 overall the protein corona mediated transport of nps in seawater saturated porous media depends on protein type np size and seawater salinity graphical abstract image 1 keywords protein corona nanoplastic transport seawater saturated porous media 1 introduction as observed on a global scale offshore aquaculture is a minor contributor of microplastic mp and nanoplastic np less than 1 μm in size dawson et al 2018 gonzalezpleiter et al 2019 pollution in oceans bouwmeester et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 however high levels of plastic pollution have been documented in over exploited aquacultural water environments chen et al 2018 curren and leong 2018 mps probably originate from aquaculture operations because of the physical abrasion and breakdown of fishing gears fishery products and aquaculture facilities chen et al 2018 covernton et al 2019 whereas nps might be generated from the further fragmentation and degradation of mps lehner et al 2019 these tiny particles could ultimately become the part of the marine sediment due to the salt induced aggregation settlement and tidal process wagner and reemtsma 2019 xue et al 2020 fishmeal which is made from the flesh of forage fish is another potential source of minute plastic particles zhang et al 2019 mps that adhered to phytoplankton and or ingested by zooplankton could be transferred to forage fish long et al 2017 wieczorek et al 2019 meanwhile lysozyme lsz a type of enzymatic protein with antibacterial activity saurabh and sahoo 2008 often serves as feed additive to reduce the bacterial pathogens in fish and shrimp choudhury et al 2019 mateus et al 2014 therefore the interaction between nps and proteins in coastal aquaculture systems which may change the fate of nps in mariculture zones should not be ignored the formation of protein corona a cloud of aggregated proteins on nanoparticle surface results from the interaction between nanoparticles and proteins ke et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shakiba et al 2018 protein corona could modify the original properties of nanoparticles such as particle size composition and surface chemistry piella et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the characteristics of protein corona depend on the intrinsic properties charge size and hydrophilicity of nanocolloids and proteins kumar et al 2018 pino et al 2014 wang et al 2011a for example the thickness of positively charged lsz corona on negatively charged multiwalled carbon nanotube surface is greater than that of negatively charged bovine serum albumin bsa corona kumar et al 2018 in low salt solutions 10 25 mmol l nacl and 1 2 5 mmol l cacl2 the bsa corona enhanced the transport of negatively charged bacteria and decreased the bacterial deposition in quartz sand via steric repulsion by contrast trypsin inhibited bacterial transport due to the formation of attractive patch charged interaction of trypsin with bacteria and quartz sand wu et al 2018 protein corona has been studied to explore its influence on the biocompatibility and drug targeting capability of nanocarriers under the physiological environment in vitro and in vivo lundqvist et al 2008 monopoli et al 2011 murali et al 2015 the salinity of natural seawater is approximately 35 expressed as 35 practical salinity units psu which is considerably higher than the salt concentration in biological microenvironments levak et al 2017 monopoli et al 2011 thus the formation of protein corona in high salt seawater systems and its effect on the stabilization and transport of nps should be investigated the present study aimed to explore the potential effects and the associated mechanisms of proteins on the transport and retention of nps in an one dimensional column packed with seawater saturated natural sea sand negatively charged bsa and positively charged lsz were used as the model proteins bsa is a multipurpose animal protein which has been widely employed as model protein due to its stability and strong activity under harsh conditions kumar et al 2018 wu et al 2018 lsz is an antimicrobial enzyme and often serves as feed additive in the aquaculture of fish and shrimp both of them may interact with plastic particles in the seawater of marine fisheries choudhury et al 2019 mateus et al 2014 commercial polystyrene spheres were used as model nps because they are widely applied in drug delivery medical imaging and regenerative medicine and are released in near shore environments wright and kelly 2017 yap and zhang 2007 the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps of nps in a simulated marine environment were obtained via column experiments the potential mechanism through which lsz and bsa affected np aggregation and transportation was proposed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the natural porous media sea sand were collected from the seafloor of pingtan strait in fujian province china sand pretreatment has been described in our previous study dong et al 2019a 2019b in brief sand was air dried and sifted to remove large particles and impurities the collector was cleaned with deionized water to maintain the environmentally relevant characteristics natural iron oxide layer of the sand surface the porosity and size of sand were 44 88 and 0 45 0 03 mm respectively dong et al 2019a nano sized polystyrene spheres with diameters of 200 500 and 1000 nm were obtained from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the air dried np suspension 5 w w was compressed to tablets and contact angles were measured via dataphysics oca20 dataphysics instruments germany bsa 96 and lsz 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich inc shanghai china the stock solutions of bsa and lsz 10 g l were prepared with deionized water and stored at 4 c to prevent degradation li et al 2018 artificial seawater 35 psu was prepared by dissolving various salts with deionized water in accordance with the method of kester et al 1967 2 2 aggregation and sedimentation experiments the aggregation curves of nps with and without protein were obtained via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements by a zetasizer nano instrument malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the 30 ppm np suspensions with and without 10 ppm protein were prepared and sonicated for 20 min to break possible aggregates perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2012b dls measurements were immediately started after sonication the data of the intensity averaged hydrodynamic radius were collected at 2 min intervals for 40 min the aggregation of nps with and without proteins at 40 min was further measured using a transmission electron microscope jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan operated at 200 kv the zeta ζ potential of the nps with and without proteins in seawater was obtained by a zetasizer nano instrument via electrophoretic mobility analyses sedimentation experiments were conducted by measuring the ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance 350 nm of nps uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md at 1 min interval for 40 min for each dispersion system the aggregation and sedimentation experiments were conducted in triplicate at 25 c and the presented data corresponded to the average of the runs 2 3 transport and retention experiments the treated sand 11 00 0 20 g dry weight was wet packed vertically into layers in glass columns 1 cm inner diameter and 10 cm length to limit air entrapment the 50 μm stainless steel screens were placed on both ends to avoid sand loss the column information is shown in table s1 and is similar to that of previous studies dong et al 2018 2019 approximately 100 ml seawater background solution was initially passed through the column from the bottom at a rate of 2 20 0 10 ml min using a syringe pump and the column was vigorously tapped with a rubber mallet to prevent it from capturing air bubbles subsequently the 30 ppm np suspensions with and without protein were injected into the column by an upward flow for 40 min followed by elution with background solution i e artificial seawater for 10 min the 10 ml glass vials were utilized to collect the effluent samples from the column every 2 min nearly 1 467 pore volume pv thereafter sand was carefully extruded from the column under gravity and dissected into nine segments each was 1 cm long for sample concentration analysis and to obtain the rps of nps and proteins the concentrations of the nps were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md at 350 nm optical absorbance table 1 lists the mass balance of nps and proteins for each transport experiment the sand samples at the inlet of the column were collected to directly present the state of nps in sand columns via scanning electron microscopy sem image hitachi s 4800 japan the column experiments were repeated more than three times 2 4 calculation of interaction energies between nps and sands the extended derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek xdlvo theory including the van der waals forces electrostatic double layer interactions and lewis acid base interaction energy one type of non dlvo interaction was used to estimate the np sand interaction energy in seawater without protein wang et al 2011b xia et al 2015 when proteins coexist the protein corona formed on the np surface triggers the steric repulsion between nps and sand which might be incorporated into xdlvo calculation wang et al 2011b wu et al 2018 xdlvo theory was employed in semiquantitative mathematical analysis in the present study to calculate the total energy of colloids given the high salinity 536 mmol l nacl of the seawater system peijnenburg et al 2015 stuart et al 2013 wang et al 2015b the calculation of interaction energies is shown in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of protein corona formation on np stability fig 1 presents the aggregation and sedimentation curves of nps 200 500 and 1000 nm with and without proteins lsz and bsa in seawater nps 200 and 500 nm showed remarkable aggregation and sedimentation characteristics for example the ddls of 200 nm nps without protein gradually increased over 40 min reaching 485 25 nm and the c c0 value in the supernatant dropped to 0 85 at 40 min however no obvious change was observed in the hydrodynamic size of 1000 nm nps within 40 min the 1000 nm nps possessed a more negative ζ potential 29 2 1 0 mv than 200 and 500 mm nps 21 6 1 8 mv and 23 6 1 7 mv respectively in seawater table 1 the low more negative surface charge of the small nps would result in the instability of suspension under the seawater system dong et al 2018 the 10 ppm bsa improved the stability of 200 and 500 nm nps in seawater fig 1a and 1c indicate that the small sized nps were well dispersed in bsa containing seawater and their c c0 ratios were higher than those without bsa at 40 min fig 1b and 1d bsa dramatically decreased the ζ potentials of 200 nm nps from 21 6 1 8 mv to 12 8 2 6 mv and that of 500 nm nps from 23 6 1 7 mv to 11 3 0 7 mv table 1 according to the classical dlvo theory a low surface charge predicts the decreased stability of nps due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion in the presence of bsa wu et al 2018 however the change in the ζ potentials of nps could not explain the increased stability of nps 200 and 500 nm with 10 ppm bsa pristine nanoparticle surfaces are typically highly reactive toward biomolecules especially proteins wang et al 2019 the adsorption experiment indicated that 7 26 13 27 of bsa was adsorbed onto np surfaces table s2 resulting in the formation of a protein corona an adsorption layer of proteins enshrouding the nanoparticle surfaces the hypothesis was verified by the transmission electron microscopy tem images where bsa coronas were observed on the surface of nps fig 2 b 2e and 2h the 200 nm or 500 nm nps interacted with the other 200 nm or 500 nm nps via this corona layer rather than the nps original surface fig 2b and 2e the protein corona can alter electrostatic interactions and steric repulsion a non dlvo interaction between colloid particles in a suspension huangfu et al 2018 levak et al 2017 liu et al 2018 bsa corona might increase colloidal steric hindrance thereby disfavoring the physical contact between nanoparticles to form agglomerates levak et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the xdlvo result showed that the interaction energy of nps 200 nm and 500 nm increased from 16 kbt and 75 kbt respectively to larger than 2000 kbt and 5000 kbt respectively fig s1 the protein corona could not affect the aggregation of 1000 nm nps that were originally well dispersed in seawater fig 1e in comparison with 10 ppm bsa 10 ppm lsz dramatically increased the aggregation of 200 nm nps and decreased their stability in seawater the ddls and c c0 values of 200 nm nps at 40 min were 2237 71 nm and 0 75 respectively fig 1a and 1b meanwhile large np aggregates were observed via tem analysis fig 2c the ph of seawater was 8 0 0 2 and the isoelectric point of lsz was 11 forov et al 2018 hence lsz was positively charged in seawater which is opposite of the negatively charged nps 21 6 1 8 mv table 1 the attractive electrical fields caused the strong adsorption 20 56 of lsz on 200 nm nps table s2 and formed the lsz protein corona fig 2c which neutralized a large quantity of negatively charged nps 7 1 0 8 mv table 1 and served as a bridge to attach other nps with sufficient unoccupied space i e bridging flocculation thus the aggregation of colloid in seawater was accelerated philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2015a however lsz can hardly prompt the aggregation of large sized np 500 and 1000 nm in seawater fig 1c and 1e and barely form the lsz corona on the surface of the nps fig 2f and 2i the nps 500 and 1000 nm contained a hydrophobic surface contact angle 90 fig s2 and were mutually exclusive with the hydrophilic lsz li et al 2018 moringo et al 2017 if the repulsion effect exceeded the electrostatic attraction between lsz and nps the adsorption of lsz on the np surface would be inhibited table s2 shows that a minimal amount of lsz adsorbed on the surface of 500 nm nps 0 31 indicating that lsz corona on the 500 nm np surface might not form in seawater consequently lsz had a negligible effect on the stability of 500 nm nps as verified by the aggregation and sedimentation curves of 500 nm nps with lsz similar to those without lsz fig 1c and 1d further investigation revealed that the formation of lsz corona was salinity dependent at 3 5 psu the 500 nm nps with lsz rapidly aggregated fig s3a and the lsz corona was observed on the np surface thus promoting np aggregation fig s3c the large nps showed high hydrophobicity hence no lsz corona emerged on the surface of 1000 nm nps fig 2i and lsz caused no effect on the aggregation and sedimentation of 1000 nm nps 3 2 np transport and retention the transport and rps of pristine nps in natural sea sand were measured via 1d column experiments the preliminary experiment showed that the relative mass concentration of injected nps was consistent 0 94 1 04 during transport experiments because of the continuous flow via a bump fig s4 the total mass percentage recovery of nps and proteins ranged from 88 3 to 107 9 table 1 indicating that column experiments possessed a high mass percentage recovery fig 3 shows the transport and retention of nps with different sizes in the absence of proteins nps 200 and 500 nm exhibited low maximum effluent concentration mec 0 19 and 0 22 and m eff 15 3 and 15 0 fig 3 and table 1 due to their aggregation in seawater fig 1a and 1c the btc of 200 nm nps displayed a blocking phenomenon with a rising plateau i e c c0 gradually increased over time fig 3a whereas that of 500 nm nps exhibited a repining phenomenon c c0 gradually decreased over time fig 3c the difference in the btcs shape was due to the different aggregate sizes of 200 and 500 nm nps babakhani et al 2017 dong et al 2018 the size of 200 nm nps was 485 25 nm at 40 min fig 1a and considerably smaller than that 1740 87 nm of 500 nm nps fig 1c in brief the large size of 500 nm np aggregates could reduce the volume of void space accessible to nps and inhibit the mobility in porous media chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the attached nps could present a rough morphology and several attachment sites leading to the multilayer accumulation of the particles on sand babakhani et al 2017 nascimento et al 2006 this phenomenon was verified by sem results fig 4 d the rp of 500 nm nps exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 3d indicating that retention occurred mostly in the column inlet and rapidly decreased with increasing transport distance conversely 1000 nm nps existed as well dispersed particles in seawater fig 1e and produced a high transportability of nps in the sand column xdlvo calculation further showed that the repulsive energy barrier between 1000 nm nps and sand 189 kbt was higher than that between the small nps 200 and 500 nm and sand 29 and 79 kbt respectively fig 5 a hence the mec 0 36 and m eff 33 4 of 1000 nm nps were higher than those of 200 and 500 nm nps table 1 3 3 transport and retention of nps with bsa fig 3 shows the effect of proteins on the transport and retention of nps in the sand column regardless of np particle size bsa could significantly enhance the transport and inhibit the retention of nps in a seawater system as influenced by 10 ppm bsa the m eff of 200 500 and 1000 nm nps increased from 15 3 15 0 and 33 4 23 0 61 5 and 61 7 respectively table 1 the results contradicted the alteration in the ζ potentials of the colloid table 1 and collector table s1 table 1 shows that nps with bsa had less negative charge compared with nps without bsa this phenomenon would theoretically lead to the low electrostatic repulsion between nps and sea sand thereby reducing the np transport in the column pelley and tufenkji 2008 wang et al 2012a wu and cheng 2016 another possible explanation is competition attachment the colloids would compete with the deposition sites on the collector increasing nanoparticle transport in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 a validation experiment was conducted to determine the btcs of nps 200 and 500 nm after pre equilibrating the columns by 10 ppm bsa if the bsa triggered competition phenomenon in the column the deposition sites on sand would be preferentially occupied by bsa during pre equilibration thereby creating several sites available for np deposition however the results showed that the breakthrough of bsa reached 100 fig s5 and the btc of nps in pre equilibration experiments was similar to that of nps without pre equilibration fig s6 hence the enhanced transport of nps was not due to the deposition competition of bsa in addition bsa corona can induce the original aggregates of nps 200 and 500 nm to disperse in seawater with ddls of 200 and 770 nm respectively fig 1a and 1c an effective porosity is available for small colloids chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 therefore the retention of these nps with bsa was lower than that without bsa at the inlet of the sand column fig 1b and 1d the attenuation or disappearance of the hyper exponential characteristics of rp was a key indicator for identifying the inhibition effect of bsa corona on straining babakhani et al 2017 the btc of 200 nm nps with bsa showed a gradually rising plateau fig 3a and that of 500 nm nps with bsa exhibited an evident blocking behavior as a substitute for the pristine ripening phenomenon fig 3c thus the bsa corona induced site blocking effect contributed to the promotion of np transport babakhani et al 2017 becker et al 2015 the sand surface has a limited capacity for the attachment of nps because the attachment sites may be hindered by the previously attached nps babakhani et al 2017 bsa corona increased the repulsion 2000 kbt between nps and nps fig s1 which could enhance the blocking phenomena wu et al 2018 babakhani et al 2017 the sem results further revealed that the attached nps on sand with bsa surface exhibited a highly dispersed distribution fig 4b and 4e compared with those without bsa fig 4a and 4d thus the protein corona induced disaggregation of 200 and 500 nm nps would be an important factor for enhancing np mobility in column in the presence or absence of bsa 1000 nm nps are monodispersed in seawater and their size is constant fig 1e thus the corona enhanced transport of 1000 nm nps was independent of the alteration in colloid size fig 3e organic macromolecules e g protein and humic substances could improve the transportability of colloids in porous media via the steric repulsion between a colloid and a collector wang et al 2012a wu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the calculation of xdlvo interaction energies fig 5b involved in steric forces showed the high energy barrier 104 kbt between sand and 1000 nm nps with bsa corona the extremely high energy barriers induced by bsa corona between colloids and sand were also documented in previous reports wu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 in general the colloidal mobility in porous media would increase with the decrease in colloid size due to the diminished straining effect bradford et al 2007 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 however in seawater with 10 ppm bsa the m eff and mec of 500 nm nps 61 5 and 0 74 respectively were higher than those of 200 nm nps 23 0 and 0 32 table 1 thus the transportability of 500 nm nps is higher than that of 200 nm nps in column which deviates from the theory especially for straining effect about the size dependent transport of colloids in previous studies bradford et al 2003 2007 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 an abnormal trend could occur when the small nps are more unstable than the large ones in this case the evident aggregates or agglomerates of 200 nm nps would form in the sand column resulting in a relatively low breakthrough in seawater saturated porous media dong et al 2018 however the aggregation and sedimentation curves showed that all nps exhibited high stability with 10 ppm bsa in seawater fig 1a d furthermore the sem images showed no np aggregates or agglomerates on the sand surface fig 4b and 4e thus the high mobility of 500 nm nps in porous media may be due to other reasons the adsorption experiment showed that although the percentage of bsa adsorbed α in 500 nm np suspension 11 05 was similar to that in 200 nm nps 13 27 the coating percentages of bsa θ on single 500 nm np 123 24 was almost twice higher than that on single 200 nm np 58 26 table s2 corona partially occupied the surface of 200 nm nps fig 2b and completely covered the surface of 500 nm nps fig 2e this result is attributed to 500 nm nps with a lower number of particles than 200 nm nps under the same mass concentration 30 ppm the 500 nm nps fig s2b could also form stronger hydrophobic interactions with bsa protein than 200 nm nps fig s2a due to the higher unfolding degree of bsa than 500 nm nps on flat surfaces mahmoudi et al 2011 wang et al 2011a the xdlvo calculation further demonstrated that the energy barriers of 500 nm nps were higher than those of 200 nm nps with 10 ppm bsa in the column fig 5b these mechanisms finally resulted in the high mobility of 500 nm nps with bsa corona although 1000 nm nps with bsa corona presented a high energy barrier with sand fig 5b the m eff 61 7 of 1000 nm nps was equal to that 61 5 of 500 nm nps table 1 this observation might be attributed to the strong straining effect of 1000 nm nps which hindered the transport of 1000 nm nps bradford et al 2007 3 4 transport and retention of nps with lsz in contrast to bsa lsz corona significantly inhibited the mobility of 200 nm nps and enhanced their retention in seawater saturated sand column fig 3a and 3b as influenced by lsz corona mec and m eff declined from 0 19 to 15 3 0 06 and 5 4 respectively table 1 the btc of 200 nm nps showed no gradual climb toward the peak ascending plateau but maintained a plateau fig 3a meanwhile rp exhibited an evident hyper exponential shape fig 3b the enhanced retention probably occurred at the inlet 0 1 cm of the sand column this phenomenon was further verified by the sem results in which the multilayer accumulation aggregates and agglomerates of particles was observed on the sand surface at the inlet of the column fig 4c in 35 psu seawater the positively charged lsz was adsorbed on the 200 nm nps to form protein corona fig 2c this condition induced the increase in the colloidal size of 200 nm nps from 485 25 nm to 2237 71 nm fig 1a and partially neutralized the surface negative charge of 200 nm nps table 1 according to dlvo theory the decreased less negative ζ potentials of colloid and collector predicts a decreased repulsive interaction between nps and sea sand torkzaban et al 2007 thus the change in electrostatic property also contributed to the decreased np mobility in the column in addition the pre attached protein onto the collector would provide additional deposition sites for colloid attachment via the bridging effect or change the chemical heterogeneity of sand surfaces resulting in the increased colloid retention in the column wu et al 2018 an additional transport experiment of 200 nm nps was conducted to test this hypothesis and sand was pre covered with 10 ppm lsz for 40 min the result showed that the btc of 200 nm nps in lsz coated sand column was similar to that in the bare sand column fig s6a indicating that lsz had a negligible effect on altering the surface chemical heterogeneity of sand accordingly the corona reduced transport of nps in the column was due to the enhanced aggregation of 200 nm nps and the decreased electrostatic repulsion between sand and nps unexpectedly the btcs and rps of 500 and 1000 nm nps completely overlapped regardless of lsz coexistence fig 3c f implying that lsz caused no effect on the np mobility in the seawater saturated sand column this result was consistent with the finding on colloidal stability of 500 and 1000 nm nps in lsz containing seawater fig 1a f however the ζ potential of nps 500 and 1000 nm with lsz was less negative than that without lsz table 1 which would theoretically result in a low electrostatic repulsion thereby hindering colloid transportability bradford et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2007 therefore the dlvo theory fails to predict the behavior of nps with lsz in the column no lsz corona formed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps in 35 psu seawater fig 2f and 2i resulting in negligible effects on np transport fig 3c and 3d in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu lsz corona on 500 nm nps triggered the apparent aggregation fig s3 and restrained the transport of nps in the column fig s7 the inhibition mechanism of lsz on np mobility was suggested to occur through corona induced aggregation 4 conclusions the effects of proteins bsa and lsz on the transport and retention of nps were investigated to understand the potential fate of nps coexisting with feeding proteins in marine aquaculture environment np transport is dependent on the electrical characteristics of proteins np size and salinity the negatively charged bsa disaggregated the 200 and 500 nm nps by enhancing steric repulsion and significantly improved the transportability of nps given the strong steric repulsion and high adsorption of bsa on the single large sized np suspension the m eff of 500 and 1000 nm nps 61 5 and 61 7 respectively was considerably higher than that of 200 nm nps 23 0 with 10 ppm bsa the formation of lsz corona dramatically increased the aggregation of 200 nm nps and inhibited their transport by contrast lsz scarcely adsorbed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps therefore lsz might hardly alter the transport of large sized nps however as seawater salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu lsz could induce the aggregation of 500 nm nps thereby inhibiting their transport nevertheless the interaction of proteins and nps in real marine environment is complicated the transport of nps with various types of proteins at different salinity levels should be further explored based on the 2 d and 3 d model investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

17803,the offshore aquaculture environment is a potential water area with high concentrations of tiny plastics and feeding proteins in this study the negatively charged bovine serum albumin bsa and the positively charged lysozyme lsz were used to explore the effects of protein corona on the aggregation transport and retention of polystyrene nanoplastics nps 200 500 and 1000 nm in sea sand saturated with seawater of 35 practical salinity units psu the bsa corona which was formed by the adsorption of bsa on the surface of nps drove the dispersion of nps 200 and 500 nm due dominantly to the induced colloidal steric hindrance for example the aggregate sizes of 500 nm np decreased from 1740 87 nm to 765 8 nm at 40 min which resulted in the enhanced transportation of np the calculated interaction energies indicated the bsa corona induced high energy barriers 104 kbt between 1000 nm nps and sand surface demonstrating the bsa enhanced transport of 1000 nm nps the mass percentage recovered from the effluent meff increased from 33 4 to 61 7 inversely the lsz corona triggered the aggregation of 200 nm nps into the large aggregates via electrostatic adsorption and bridging effect thereby inhibiting the transport of 200 nm nps nevertheless no lsz corona was formed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps due to extremely low protein adsorption accordingly lsz cannot affect the stability and transport of these nps in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu the strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged lsz and 500 nm nps significantly increased and the lsz corona formed which induced the aggregation of 500 nm nps the meff of nps therefore decreased from 53 1 to 11 2 overall the protein corona mediated transport of nps in seawater saturated porous media depends on protein type np size and seawater salinity graphical abstract image 1 keywords protein corona nanoplastic transport seawater saturated porous media 1 introduction as observed on a global scale offshore aquaculture is a minor contributor of microplastic mp and nanoplastic np less than 1 μm in size dawson et al 2018 gonzalezpleiter et al 2019 pollution in oceans bouwmeester et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 however high levels of plastic pollution have been documented in over exploited aquacultural water environments chen et al 2018 curren and leong 2018 mps probably originate from aquaculture operations because of the physical abrasion and breakdown of fishing gears fishery products and aquaculture facilities chen et al 2018 covernton et al 2019 whereas nps might be generated from the further fragmentation and degradation of mps lehner et al 2019 these tiny particles could ultimately become the part of the marine sediment due to the salt induced aggregation settlement and tidal process wagner and reemtsma 2019 xue et al 2020 fishmeal which is made from the flesh of forage fish is another potential source of minute plastic particles zhang et al 2019 mps that adhered to phytoplankton and or ingested by zooplankton could be transferred to forage fish long et al 2017 wieczorek et al 2019 meanwhile lysozyme lsz a type of enzymatic protein with antibacterial activity saurabh and sahoo 2008 often serves as feed additive to reduce the bacterial pathogens in fish and shrimp choudhury et al 2019 mateus et al 2014 therefore the interaction between nps and proteins in coastal aquaculture systems which may change the fate of nps in mariculture zones should not be ignored the formation of protein corona a cloud of aggregated proteins on nanoparticle surface results from the interaction between nanoparticles and proteins ke et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shakiba et al 2018 protein corona could modify the original properties of nanoparticles such as particle size composition and surface chemistry piella et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the characteristics of protein corona depend on the intrinsic properties charge size and hydrophilicity of nanocolloids and proteins kumar et al 2018 pino et al 2014 wang et al 2011a for example the thickness of positively charged lsz corona on negatively charged multiwalled carbon nanotube surface is greater than that of negatively charged bovine serum albumin bsa corona kumar et al 2018 in low salt solutions 10 25 mmol l nacl and 1 2 5 mmol l cacl2 the bsa corona enhanced the transport of negatively charged bacteria and decreased the bacterial deposition in quartz sand via steric repulsion by contrast trypsin inhibited bacterial transport due to the formation of attractive patch charged interaction of trypsin with bacteria and quartz sand wu et al 2018 protein corona has been studied to explore its influence on the biocompatibility and drug targeting capability of nanocarriers under the physiological environment in vitro and in vivo lundqvist et al 2008 monopoli et al 2011 murali et al 2015 the salinity of natural seawater is approximately 35 expressed as 35 practical salinity units psu which is considerably higher than the salt concentration in biological microenvironments levak et al 2017 monopoli et al 2011 thus the formation of protein corona in high salt seawater systems and its effect on the stabilization and transport of nps should be investigated the present study aimed to explore the potential effects and the associated mechanisms of proteins on the transport and retention of nps in an one dimensional column packed with seawater saturated natural sea sand negatively charged bsa and positively charged lsz were used as the model proteins bsa is a multipurpose animal protein which has been widely employed as model protein due to its stability and strong activity under harsh conditions kumar et al 2018 wu et al 2018 lsz is an antimicrobial enzyme and often serves as feed additive in the aquaculture of fish and shrimp both of them may interact with plastic particles in the seawater of marine fisheries choudhury et al 2019 mateus et al 2014 commercial polystyrene spheres were used as model nps because they are widely applied in drug delivery medical imaging and regenerative medicine and are released in near shore environments wright and kelly 2017 yap and zhang 2007 the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps of nps in a simulated marine environment were obtained via column experiments the potential mechanism through which lsz and bsa affected np aggregation and transportation was proposed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the natural porous media sea sand were collected from the seafloor of pingtan strait in fujian province china sand pretreatment has been described in our previous study dong et al 2019a 2019b in brief sand was air dried and sifted to remove large particles and impurities the collector was cleaned with deionized water to maintain the environmentally relevant characteristics natural iron oxide layer of the sand surface the porosity and size of sand were 44 88 and 0 45 0 03 mm respectively dong et al 2019a nano sized polystyrene spheres with diameters of 200 500 and 1000 nm were obtained from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the air dried np suspension 5 w w was compressed to tablets and contact angles were measured via dataphysics oca20 dataphysics instruments germany bsa 96 and lsz 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich inc shanghai china the stock solutions of bsa and lsz 10 g l were prepared with deionized water and stored at 4 c to prevent degradation li et al 2018 artificial seawater 35 psu was prepared by dissolving various salts with deionized water in accordance with the method of kester et al 1967 2 2 aggregation and sedimentation experiments the aggregation curves of nps with and without protein were obtained via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements by a zetasizer nano instrument malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk the 30 ppm np suspensions with and without 10 ppm protein were prepared and sonicated for 20 min to break possible aggregates perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2012b dls measurements were immediately started after sonication the data of the intensity averaged hydrodynamic radius were collected at 2 min intervals for 40 min the aggregation of nps with and without proteins at 40 min was further measured using a transmission electron microscope jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan operated at 200 kv the zeta ζ potential of the nps with and without proteins in seawater was obtained by a zetasizer nano instrument via electrophoretic mobility analyses sedimentation experiments were conducted by measuring the ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance 350 nm of nps uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md at 1 min interval for 40 min for each dispersion system the aggregation and sedimentation experiments were conducted in triplicate at 25 c and the presented data corresponded to the average of the runs 2 3 transport and retention experiments the treated sand 11 00 0 20 g dry weight was wet packed vertically into layers in glass columns 1 cm inner diameter and 10 cm length to limit air entrapment the 50 μm stainless steel screens were placed on both ends to avoid sand loss the column information is shown in table s1 and is similar to that of previous studies dong et al 2018 2019 approximately 100 ml seawater background solution was initially passed through the column from the bottom at a rate of 2 20 0 10 ml min using a syringe pump and the column was vigorously tapped with a rubber mallet to prevent it from capturing air bubbles subsequently the 30 ppm np suspensions with and without protein were injected into the column by an upward flow for 40 min followed by elution with background solution i e artificial seawater for 10 min the 10 ml glass vials were utilized to collect the effluent samples from the column every 2 min nearly 1 467 pore volume pv thereafter sand was carefully extruded from the column under gravity and dissected into nine segments each was 1 cm long for sample concentration analysis and to obtain the rps of nps and proteins the concentrations of the nps were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md at 350 nm optical absorbance table 1 lists the mass balance of nps and proteins for each transport experiment the sand samples at the inlet of the column were collected to directly present the state of nps in sand columns via scanning electron microscopy sem image hitachi s 4800 japan the column experiments were repeated more than three times 2 4 calculation of interaction energies between nps and sands the extended derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek xdlvo theory including the van der waals forces electrostatic double layer interactions and lewis acid base interaction energy one type of non dlvo interaction was used to estimate the np sand interaction energy in seawater without protein wang et al 2011b xia et al 2015 when proteins coexist the protein corona formed on the np surface triggers the steric repulsion between nps and sand which might be incorporated into xdlvo calculation wang et al 2011b wu et al 2018 xdlvo theory was employed in semiquantitative mathematical analysis in the present study to calculate the total energy of colloids given the high salinity 536 mmol l nacl of the seawater system peijnenburg et al 2015 stuart et al 2013 wang et al 2015b the calculation of interaction energies is shown in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of protein corona formation on np stability fig 1 presents the aggregation and sedimentation curves of nps 200 500 and 1000 nm with and without proteins lsz and bsa in seawater nps 200 and 500 nm showed remarkable aggregation and sedimentation characteristics for example the ddls of 200 nm nps without protein gradually increased over 40 min reaching 485 25 nm and the c c0 value in the supernatant dropped to 0 85 at 40 min however no obvious change was observed in the hydrodynamic size of 1000 nm nps within 40 min the 1000 nm nps possessed a more negative ζ potential 29 2 1 0 mv than 200 and 500 mm nps 21 6 1 8 mv and 23 6 1 7 mv respectively in seawater table 1 the low more negative surface charge of the small nps would result in the instability of suspension under the seawater system dong et al 2018 the 10 ppm bsa improved the stability of 200 and 500 nm nps in seawater fig 1a and 1c indicate that the small sized nps were well dispersed in bsa containing seawater and their c c0 ratios were higher than those without bsa at 40 min fig 1b and 1d bsa dramatically decreased the ζ potentials of 200 nm nps from 21 6 1 8 mv to 12 8 2 6 mv and that of 500 nm nps from 23 6 1 7 mv to 11 3 0 7 mv table 1 according to the classical dlvo theory a low surface charge predicts the decreased stability of nps due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion in the presence of bsa wu et al 2018 however the change in the ζ potentials of nps could not explain the increased stability of nps 200 and 500 nm with 10 ppm bsa pristine nanoparticle surfaces are typically highly reactive toward biomolecules especially proteins wang et al 2019 the adsorption experiment indicated that 7 26 13 27 of bsa was adsorbed onto np surfaces table s2 resulting in the formation of a protein corona an adsorption layer of proteins enshrouding the nanoparticle surfaces the hypothesis was verified by the transmission electron microscopy tem images where bsa coronas were observed on the surface of nps fig 2 b 2e and 2h the 200 nm or 500 nm nps interacted with the other 200 nm or 500 nm nps via this corona layer rather than the nps original surface fig 2b and 2e the protein corona can alter electrostatic interactions and steric repulsion a non dlvo interaction between colloid particles in a suspension huangfu et al 2018 levak et al 2017 liu et al 2018 bsa corona might increase colloidal steric hindrance thereby disfavoring the physical contact between nanoparticles to form agglomerates levak et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the xdlvo result showed that the interaction energy of nps 200 nm and 500 nm increased from 16 kbt and 75 kbt respectively to larger than 2000 kbt and 5000 kbt respectively fig s1 the protein corona could not affect the aggregation of 1000 nm nps that were originally well dispersed in seawater fig 1e in comparison with 10 ppm bsa 10 ppm lsz dramatically increased the aggregation of 200 nm nps and decreased their stability in seawater the ddls and c c0 values of 200 nm nps at 40 min were 2237 71 nm and 0 75 respectively fig 1a and 1b meanwhile large np aggregates were observed via tem analysis fig 2c the ph of seawater was 8 0 0 2 and the isoelectric point of lsz was 11 forov et al 2018 hence lsz was positively charged in seawater which is opposite of the negatively charged nps 21 6 1 8 mv table 1 the attractive electrical fields caused the strong adsorption 20 56 of lsz on 200 nm nps table s2 and formed the lsz protein corona fig 2c which neutralized a large quantity of negatively charged nps 7 1 0 8 mv table 1 and served as a bridge to attach other nps with sufficient unoccupied space i e bridging flocculation thus the aggregation of colloid in seawater was accelerated philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2015a however lsz can hardly prompt the aggregation of large sized np 500 and 1000 nm in seawater fig 1c and 1e and barely form the lsz corona on the surface of the nps fig 2f and 2i the nps 500 and 1000 nm contained a hydrophobic surface contact angle 90 fig s2 and were mutually exclusive with the hydrophilic lsz li et al 2018 moringo et al 2017 if the repulsion effect exceeded the electrostatic attraction between lsz and nps the adsorption of lsz on the np surface would be inhibited table s2 shows that a minimal amount of lsz adsorbed on the surface of 500 nm nps 0 31 indicating that lsz corona on the 500 nm np surface might not form in seawater consequently lsz had a negligible effect on the stability of 500 nm nps as verified by the aggregation and sedimentation curves of 500 nm nps with lsz similar to those without lsz fig 1c and 1d further investigation revealed that the formation of lsz corona was salinity dependent at 3 5 psu the 500 nm nps with lsz rapidly aggregated fig s3a and the lsz corona was observed on the np surface thus promoting np aggregation fig s3c the large nps showed high hydrophobicity hence no lsz corona emerged on the surface of 1000 nm nps fig 2i and lsz caused no effect on the aggregation and sedimentation of 1000 nm nps 3 2 np transport and retention the transport and rps of pristine nps in natural sea sand were measured via 1d column experiments the preliminary experiment showed that the relative mass concentration of injected nps was consistent 0 94 1 04 during transport experiments because of the continuous flow via a bump fig s4 the total mass percentage recovery of nps and proteins ranged from 88 3 to 107 9 table 1 indicating that column experiments possessed a high mass percentage recovery fig 3 shows the transport and retention of nps with different sizes in the absence of proteins nps 200 and 500 nm exhibited low maximum effluent concentration mec 0 19 and 0 22 and m eff 15 3 and 15 0 fig 3 and table 1 due to their aggregation in seawater fig 1a and 1c the btc of 200 nm nps displayed a blocking phenomenon with a rising plateau i e c c0 gradually increased over time fig 3a whereas that of 500 nm nps exhibited a repining phenomenon c c0 gradually decreased over time fig 3c the difference in the btcs shape was due to the different aggregate sizes of 200 and 500 nm nps babakhani et al 2017 dong et al 2018 the size of 200 nm nps was 485 25 nm at 40 min fig 1a and considerably smaller than that 1740 87 nm of 500 nm nps fig 1c in brief the large size of 500 nm np aggregates could reduce the volume of void space accessible to nps and inhibit the mobility in porous media chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the attached nps could present a rough morphology and several attachment sites leading to the multilayer accumulation of the particles on sand babakhani et al 2017 nascimento et al 2006 this phenomenon was verified by sem results fig 4 d the rp of 500 nm nps exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 3d indicating that retention occurred mostly in the column inlet and rapidly decreased with increasing transport distance conversely 1000 nm nps existed as well dispersed particles in seawater fig 1e and produced a high transportability of nps in the sand column xdlvo calculation further showed that the repulsive energy barrier between 1000 nm nps and sand 189 kbt was higher than that between the small nps 200 and 500 nm and sand 29 and 79 kbt respectively fig 5 a hence the mec 0 36 and m eff 33 4 of 1000 nm nps were higher than those of 200 and 500 nm nps table 1 3 3 transport and retention of nps with bsa fig 3 shows the effect of proteins on the transport and retention of nps in the sand column regardless of np particle size bsa could significantly enhance the transport and inhibit the retention of nps in a seawater system as influenced by 10 ppm bsa the m eff of 200 500 and 1000 nm nps increased from 15 3 15 0 and 33 4 23 0 61 5 and 61 7 respectively table 1 the results contradicted the alteration in the ζ potentials of the colloid table 1 and collector table s1 table 1 shows that nps with bsa had less negative charge compared with nps without bsa this phenomenon would theoretically lead to the low electrostatic repulsion between nps and sea sand thereby reducing the np transport in the column pelley and tufenkji 2008 wang et al 2012a wu and cheng 2016 another possible explanation is competition attachment the colloids would compete with the deposition sites on the collector increasing nanoparticle transport in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 a validation experiment was conducted to determine the btcs of nps 200 and 500 nm after pre equilibrating the columns by 10 ppm bsa if the bsa triggered competition phenomenon in the column the deposition sites on sand would be preferentially occupied by bsa during pre equilibration thereby creating several sites available for np deposition however the results showed that the breakthrough of bsa reached 100 fig s5 and the btc of nps in pre equilibration experiments was similar to that of nps without pre equilibration fig s6 hence the enhanced transport of nps was not due to the deposition competition of bsa in addition bsa corona can induce the original aggregates of nps 200 and 500 nm to disperse in seawater with ddls of 200 and 770 nm respectively fig 1a and 1c an effective porosity is available for small colloids chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 therefore the retention of these nps with bsa was lower than that without bsa at the inlet of the sand column fig 1b and 1d the attenuation or disappearance of the hyper exponential characteristics of rp was a key indicator for identifying the inhibition effect of bsa corona on straining babakhani et al 2017 the btc of 200 nm nps with bsa showed a gradually rising plateau fig 3a and that of 500 nm nps with bsa exhibited an evident blocking behavior as a substitute for the pristine ripening phenomenon fig 3c thus the bsa corona induced site blocking effect contributed to the promotion of np transport babakhani et al 2017 becker et al 2015 the sand surface has a limited capacity for the attachment of nps because the attachment sites may be hindered by the previously attached nps babakhani et al 2017 bsa corona increased the repulsion 2000 kbt between nps and nps fig s1 which could enhance the blocking phenomena wu et al 2018 babakhani et al 2017 the sem results further revealed that the attached nps on sand with bsa surface exhibited a highly dispersed distribution fig 4b and 4e compared with those without bsa fig 4a and 4d thus the protein corona induced disaggregation of 200 and 500 nm nps would be an important factor for enhancing np mobility in column in the presence or absence of bsa 1000 nm nps are monodispersed in seawater and their size is constant fig 1e thus the corona enhanced transport of 1000 nm nps was independent of the alteration in colloid size fig 3e organic macromolecules e g protein and humic substances could improve the transportability of colloids in porous media via the steric repulsion between a colloid and a collector wang et al 2012a wu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the calculation of xdlvo interaction energies fig 5b involved in steric forces showed the high energy barrier 104 kbt between sand and 1000 nm nps with bsa corona the extremely high energy barriers induced by bsa corona between colloids and sand were also documented in previous reports wu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 in general the colloidal mobility in porous media would increase with the decrease in colloid size due to the diminished straining effect bradford et al 2007 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 however in seawater with 10 ppm bsa the m eff and mec of 500 nm nps 61 5 and 0 74 respectively were higher than those of 200 nm nps 23 0 and 0 32 table 1 thus the transportability of 500 nm nps is higher than that of 200 nm nps in column which deviates from the theory especially for straining effect about the size dependent transport of colloids in previous studies bradford et al 2003 2007 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 an abnormal trend could occur when the small nps are more unstable than the large ones in this case the evident aggregates or agglomerates of 200 nm nps would form in the sand column resulting in a relatively low breakthrough in seawater saturated porous media dong et al 2018 however the aggregation and sedimentation curves showed that all nps exhibited high stability with 10 ppm bsa in seawater fig 1a d furthermore the sem images showed no np aggregates or agglomerates on the sand surface fig 4b and 4e thus the high mobility of 500 nm nps in porous media may be due to other reasons the adsorption experiment showed that although the percentage of bsa adsorbed α in 500 nm np suspension 11 05 was similar to that in 200 nm nps 13 27 the coating percentages of bsa θ on single 500 nm np 123 24 was almost twice higher than that on single 200 nm np 58 26 table s2 corona partially occupied the surface of 200 nm nps fig 2b and completely covered the surface of 500 nm nps fig 2e this result is attributed to 500 nm nps with a lower number of particles than 200 nm nps under the same mass concentration 30 ppm the 500 nm nps fig s2b could also form stronger hydrophobic interactions with bsa protein than 200 nm nps fig s2a due to the higher unfolding degree of bsa than 500 nm nps on flat surfaces mahmoudi et al 2011 wang et al 2011a the xdlvo calculation further demonstrated that the energy barriers of 500 nm nps were higher than those of 200 nm nps with 10 ppm bsa in the column fig 5b these mechanisms finally resulted in the high mobility of 500 nm nps with bsa corona although 1000 nm nps with bsa corona presented a high energy barrier with sand fig 5b the m eff 61 7 of 1000 nm nps was equal to that 61 5 of 500 nm nps table 1 this observation might be attributed to the strong straining effect of 1000 nm nps which hindered the transport of 1000 nm nps bradford et al 2007 3 4 transport and retention of nps with lsz in contrast to bsa lsz corona significantly inhibited the mobility of 200 nm nps and enhanced their retention in seawater saturated sand column fig 3a and 3b as influenced by lsz corona mec and m eff declined from 0 19 to 15 3 0 06 and 5 4 respectively table 1 the btc of 200 nm nps showed no gradual climb toward the peak ascending plateau but maintained a plateau fig 3a meanwhile rp exhibited an evident hyper exponential shape fig 3b the enhanced retention probably occurred at the inlet 0 1 cm of the sand column this phenomenon was further verified by the sem results in which the multilayer accumulation aggregates and agglomerates of particles was observed on the sand surface at the inlet of the column fig 4c in 35 psu seawater the positively charged lsz was adsorbed on the 200 nm nps to form protein corona fig 2c this condition induced the increase in the colloidal size of 200 nm nps from 485 25 nm to 2237 71 nm fig 1a and partially neutralized the surface negative charge of 200 nm nps table 1 according to dlvo theory the decreased less negative ζ potentials of colloid and collector predicts a decreased repulsive interaction between nps and sea sand torkzaban et al 2007 thus the change in electrostatic property also contributed to the decreased np mobility in the column in addition the pre attached protein onto the collector would provide additional deposition sites for colloid attachment via the bridging effect or change the chemical heterogeneity of sand surfaces resulting in the increased colloid retention in the column wu et al 2018 an additional transport experiment of 200 nm nps was conducted to test this hypothesis and sand was pre covered with 10 ppm lsz for 40 min the result showed that the btc of 200 nm nps in lsz coated sand column was similar to that in the bare sand column fig s6a indicating that lsz had a negligible effect on altering the surface chemical heterogeneity of sand accordingly the corona reduced transport of nps in the column was due to the enhanced aggregation of 200 nm nps and the decreased electrostatic repulsion between sand and nps unexpectedly the btcs and rps of 500 and 1000 nm nps completely overlapped regardless of lsz coexistence fig 3c f implying that lsz caused no effect on the np mobility in the seawater saturated sand column this result was consistent with the finding on colloidal stability of 500 and 1000 nm nps in lsz containing seawater fig 1a f however the ζ potential of nps 500 and 1000 nm with lsz was less negative than that without lsz table 1 which would theoretically result in a low electrostatic repulsion thereby hindering colloid transportability bradford et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2007 therefore the dlvo theory fails to predict the behavior of nps with lsz in the column no lsz corona formed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps in 35 psu seawater fig 2f and 2i resulting in negligible effects on np transport fig 3c and 3d in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu lsz corona on 500 nm nps triggered the apparent aggregation fig s3 and restrained the transport of nps in the column fig s7 the inhibition mechanism of lsz on np mobility was suggested to occur through corona induced aggregation 4 conclusions the effects of proteins bsa and lsz on the transport and retention of nps were investigated to understand the potential fate of nps coexisting with feeding proteins in marine aquaculture environment np transport is dependent on the electrical characteristics of proteins np size and salinity the negatively charged bsa disaggregated the 200 and 500 nm nps by enhancing steric repulsion and significantly improved the transportability of nps given the strong steric repulsion and high adsorption of bsa on the single large sized np suspension the m eff of 500 and 1000 nm nps 61 5 and 61 7 respectively was considerably higher than that of 200 nm nps 23 0 with 10 ppm bsa the formation of lsz corona dramatically increased the aggregation of 200 nm nps and inhibited their transport by contrast lsz scarcely adsorbed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm nps therefore lsz might hardly alter the transport of large sized nps however as seawater salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu lsz could induce the aggregation of 500 nm nps thereby inhibiting their transport nevertheless the interaction of proteins and nps in real marine environment is complicated the transport of nps with various types of proteins at different salinity levels should be further explored based on the 2 d

17804,current h2s treatment methods for sour gases require considerable amounts of chemicals and energy or in case of biological treatment unwanted diluents such as oxygen or nitrogen may be introduced in order to reduce those requirements the viability of an anaerobic biological h2s removal process using purple phototrophic bacteria ppb was investigated in this study ppb can use sunlight and centrate as nutrient source thus potentially reducing energy and chemical requirements an added benefit is the production of biomass with potential uses such as single cell protein an inoculum of ppb enriched from domestic wastewater was grown photoautotrophically with sulfide as the electron donor and inorganic carbon in a mixed culture additionally synthetic medium and centrate as well as high 56 11 wm 2 and low 27 3 wm 2 ir irradiation were trialled finally a process model was developed to study biomass specific removal rates and yield the results showed that a mixed culture of ppb removed sulfide completely in synthetic media 121 9 mg s l 1 at a maximum rate of 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 low irradiance and 2 9 mg s lh 1 high irradiance the ph increased in both experiments from about 8 5 to 9 sulfide removal rates using centrate and low irradiance were similar however fe and mn were found to be limiting growth and sulfide removal in all experiments chromatiaceae purple sulfur bacteria were most abundant at the end of the experiment while at the start purple non sulfur bacteria were most abundant from the inoculum process modelling and experimental work identified the sulfide oxidation to be a multi step process with accumulation of intermediates specific rates were directly dependent on light input doubling at high irradiance sulfide oxidation was estimated at 0 100 0 014 h 1 0 085 0 012 g s g vs h 1 at low irradiance and the biomass yield at 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 this process model enables the virtual evaluation of autotrophic sulfide removal by ppb in a continuous scaled up process overall the photoautotrophic removal of sulfide seems to be a viable option especially because of the possibility of using sunlight as an energy source and centrate as a

7300 ppmv from anaerobic digesters beil and beyrich 2013 petersson 2013 due to the corrosive nature of h2s it has to be removed before these gases can be beneficially used abatzoglou and boivin 2009 different desulfurisation technologies are available and they mostly rely on the h2s transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase where it can be removed as sulfide lens 2000 absorption is improved by increasing the liquid ph due to the equilibrium shifting with pka1 7 and pka2 13 where pka2 is associated with large uncertainty perrin 1982 chemical removal of sulfide can also be achieved with regenerable absorbents in an amine solution with a multistep regeneration process huertas et al 2011 beil and beyrich 2013 other removal methods are non regenerable absorbents e g fe zn oxidation or direct conversion of sulfide to elemental sulfur via combustion lens 2000 however all chemical removal technologies require large amounts of chemicals and energy with chemical input costs scaling with size petersson and wellinger 2009 biological sulfide oxidation with sulfide oxidising bacteria sob in a micro aerated tank after absorption in a separate column is also commercially applied as a h2s removal technology e g thiopaq janssen et al 2000 however the capital costs of such a two column system can be significant because the regeneration reactions for elemental sulfur are highly exothermic and the value of elemental sulfur as a commodity chemical is low micro aeration applied directly to the anaerobic digester oxidises sulfide to elemental sulfur with low operating costs but introduces nitrogen as a contaminant into the treated gas skerman et al 2018 phototrophic microorganisms such as algae bahr et al 2013 and green sulfur bacteria gsb have been used to remove sulfide from sour gases wherein oxygenic algae introduce oxygen into the treated gas for sulfide oxidation anoxygenic gsb have been investigated extensively for their ability to remove sulfide from liquid or gaseous streams mainly for odour control purposes syed et al 2006 however removal rates differed noticeably between the different systems and biomass specific removal rates have not been previously compared this makes an assessment of process feasibility at larger scale difficult both organisms require irradiation in the visible light spectrum which depending on reactor footprint contributes to high energy costs for treatment posten 2009 recently anoxygenic purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have gained attention for complete nutrient recovery from wastewater and have been found to be versatile in terms of metabolism and robust in process applications hülsen et al 2014 2016 many species of ppb can grow photoautotrophically using sulfide as electron donor to reduce inorganic carbon for biomass growth pfennig 1975 hunter et al 2009 brune 1989 frigaard 2016 making ppb an interesting candidate for an h2s removal process with simultaneous stoichiometric co2 removal in a ratio of 0 5 s c theoretical molar ratio syed et al 2006 in contrast to algae and gsb ppb absorb in the infra red ir spectrum potentially lowering the energy requirements of irradiation for example applying ir light marín et al 2019 successfully used ppb to simultaneously treat piggery effluent and upgrade biogas including complete sulfide removal however this process is partially heterotrophic as well as autotrophic fully autotrophic ppb using h2s only as electron donor have a number of potential advantages including lower light energy inputs compared to phototrophic processes using the visual spectrum with potential to instead use the ir spectrum of sunlight recovery of a pure ppb product and maximal removal of co2 from the gas stream in addition anoxygenic photosytnthesis does not generate oxygen in practice this would involve a reactor fed with high sulfide feed streams for sulfide removal but it is necessary to identify the basic capability and removal mechanism of mixed culture ppb on autotrophic sulfide feeds the aim of this study is to investigate a fully autotrophic process for sulfide removal via ppb and to estimate sulfide removal rates as well as biomass yield being important design parameters for a full scale process also the study explored the potential of reducing chemical inputs into the process by solely providing digester centrate as nitrogen and phosphorus source for biomass growth in regards to energy requirements of the process different ir irradiation intensities are trialled and the potential of using sunlight is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles wheaton illinois usa in triplicates plus one dark control wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude any light input the bottles were agitated in a temperature controlled maxq4000 incubator shaker thermo fisher scientific massachusetts usa with the temperature set at 24 c and the shaking speed at 200 rpm the shaker hood was covered in aluminium foil to exclude any external light input from the environment inside the shaker infra red light emitting diode ir led spotlights peak λ 850 nm were installed at two different distances from the serum bottles to create two different irradiation intensities in order to quantify the intensity the irradiance density emitted by the spotlights was measured with a radiometer stellarnet tampa florida usa over a wavelength spectrum λ 300 1000 nm at 21 grid points of the projected area of light incidence into the bottles the obtained grid point values were interpolated cubically over the irradiated area to calculate the incident irradiance 2 2 materials a synthetic medium was used in two separate batch tests to obtain growth dynamics without micro or macro nutrient limitation for the quantification of sulfide removal a modified ormerod medium ormerod et al 1961 was used where all sulfate salts were replaced with chloride salts in order not to interfere with sulfate measurements the modified medium composition was 900 mgl 1 k2hpo4 600 mgl 1 kh2po4 338 mgl 1 m g c l 2 6 h 2 o 75 mgl 1 c a c l 2 2 h 2 o 15 4 mgl 1 f e c l 2 4 h 2 o 20 mgl 1 edta 20 mgl 1

inorganic carbon as carbon source were added separately to the modified ormerod medium in all experiments sulfide was added as na2s 9 h2o 1 125 gl 1 equivalent to 150 mg s l 1 this high concentration of sulfide was chosen to examine the assumed maximum sulfide uptake rates without sulfide limitation inorganic carbon was added as nahco3 at 350 mgl 1 in the first experiment with low irradiance and 700 mgl 1 in the second experiment with low irradiance to confirm that the sulfide removal rate was not being limited by inorganic carbon substrate availability accordingly for the high irradiance case 960 mgl 1 nahco3 was added to ensure that the sulfide uptake rate was not limited by uptake of inorganic carbon the nitrogen source was added as nh4cl at 405 mgl 1 equivalent to 105 mg n l 1 in all experiments with the synthetic medium anaerobic digester centrate was collected from the centrifuge liquid return line of a local wastewater treatment facility in south east queensland australia and contained 427 4 mg c l 1 inorganic carbon 503 28 mg n l 1 ammonium and 29 3 mg p l 1 inorganic phosphate also the centrate contained 143 30 mg cod l 1 total chemical oxygen demand tcod and 106 17 mg cod l 1 soluble cod scod all values are given with 95 confidence intervals the centrate was diluted 50 50 with milli q water to lower the risk of microbial inhibition due to humic substances in the experiment using centrate as nutrient source only the electron donor sulfide was added as na2s 9 h2o 1 125 gl 1 equivalent to 150 mg s l 1 and 8 5 mg fe l 1 as fecl2 4 h2o to partly supplement micro nutrients the bottles were irradiated with the low irradiation intensity see section 2 1 all batch tests were inoculated with a mixed ppb culture enriched from domestic wastewater and maintained at anaerobic conditions in modified ormerod medium hülsen et al 2014 with weekly acetic acid addition as well as incandescent infra red irradiation the inoculum concentration was adjusted to 128 15 mg cod l 1 for all experiments the microbial community of the inoculum was not adapted to sulfide loading prior to the experiment 2 3 experimental procedure the bottles in most of the experiments were irradiated with the low irradiation intensity for a low irradiation case with the bottles at approximately 20 cm distance to the light source the overall irradiance incident on the bottle surface was 27 3 wm 2 and the irradiated area 0 012 m2 this irradiance was the same for two batch tests with synthetic medium and one test with digester centrate another experiment with higher irradiance using synthetic medium was conducted with the bottles at approximately 3 cm distance to the light source and the measured irradiance was 56 11 wm 2 and the irradiated area 0 012 m2 the bottles were filled with the mixed medium inoculum the carbon electron and nitrogen source the bottles were closed with a gas tight rubber septum and the headspace sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to assure anaerobic conditions liquid samples were taken from all serum bottles to quantify rates of sulfide removal biomass growth and accumulation of by products as well as consumption of macro nutrients prior to sampling in order to keep anaerobic conditions a syringe was sparged with nitrogen and an equal gas volume of nitrogen gas was injected into the serum bottle prior to taking the liquid sample in this way the risk of oxygen ingress through the pierced septum was minimised the samples were taken following inoculation plus an adaptation period of about 60 h every 5 8 h until the concentration of sulfide was low and a final sample was also collected after 260 h each sample was analysed for cod sulfur species dissolved inorganic carbon co2 c and the macro nutrients nh4 n and po4 p section 2 4 additionally elemental analysis was conducted for the batch test with digester centrate in order to determine the concentration of certain micro nutrients fe mn in the centrate to assess if the centrate was suitable as a medium for sulfide removal 2 4 chemical analysis methods cod was determined according to standard methods 5220d apha 2017 with a test kit merck spectroquant 114541 quantifying the tcod and scod for the scod samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter merck millipore darmstadt germany samples for the measurement of the soluble sulfur species sulfide sulfite sulfate and thiosulfate were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and preserved with a sulfide antioxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 using the method described by pozo et al 2016 these sulfur samples were analysed by ion exchange chromatography with a dionex ics 2000 system equipped with a ag18 dionex column iex dionex sunnyvale usa and detected with a flame ionisation detector fid and spectrophotometrical measurement with a uv vis detector pozo et al 2016 for the measurement of dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and analysed using a shimadzu toc analyser shimadzu kyoto japan pozo et al 2016 dissolved ammonium and phosphate concentrations in the medium were measured with a lachat quickchem800 flow injection analyser fia lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin usa after filtering the sample through a 0 45 μm filter elemental analysis was conducted on a filtered 0 45 μm and non filtered sample after digestion with 10 nitric acid and using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkinelmer with optima 7300 dv waltham massachusetts usa the concentration of acetic acid was measured through gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector agilent technologies 7890a gc system measurements of inorganic n and p elemental analysis and acetic acid analysis were conducted according to the methods described by hülsen et al 2014 2 5 microbiological composition analysis microbial composition was analysed via genomic sequencing by the australian centre for ecogenomics ace dna extraction and amplification was conducted by ace the universal primer pair univ ssu 926f 1392wr was used targeting regions of the 16s and 18s rrna genes sequencing was conducted using the illumina platform reads identified as a single read with relative abundance of less than 0 05 or sequence identity less than 60 were discarded 5198 organisational taxonomic units otus were identified sequences were aligned using blast altschul 1997 the resulting otu table was analysed in r using ampvis2 albertsen et al 2015 2 6 process modelling and panm extension in order to quantify the rates of sulfide uptake and associated biomass growth and to compare these to other autotrophic uptake rates and heterotrophic rates processes for photoautotrophic uptake of sulfide were added to panm puyol et al 2017 flores alsina et al 2016 batstone et al 2002b the additional processes required an extension of the physico chemical model to include gas liquid mass transfer sulfide and carbonate speciation as well as an updated ph model all implemented according to the methods described elsewhere batstone et al 2002a the gas liquid mass transfer was modelled as gas film controlled using gas liquid mass transfer coefficients k l a i reported elsewhere rosen et al 2006 the gas liquid mass transfer of elemental nitrogen n2 was also added to verify the gas phase mass balance and the direction of gas liquid mass transfer the ph and the speciation calculation were modelled as equilibrium processes after adm1 using a charge balance approach batstone et al 2002a and using equilibrium constants reported elsewhere flores alsina et al 2015 as for biochemical equations the ppb biomass was split into autotrophic x p b a mg cod l 1 and heterotrophic biomass x p b h mg cod l 1 to reflect a mixed culture environment and the preferential uptake of sulfide by specific bacterial communities dahl and trüper 1994 hunter et al 2009 purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb are usually associated with the uptake of organics and are therefore classified as heterotrophic biomass in this model albeit that pnsb have also been shown to take up sulfide dahl 2017 the mechanism of sulfide oxidation was modelled partly using the pathways of the purple sulfur bacteria psb model organism allochromatium vinosum grimm et al 2008 weissgerber et al 2014 and in response to experimental observations see below accordingly the model described fig 1 sulfide s is mg cod l 1 polysulfide as elemental sulfur x s 0 mg cod l 1 an intermediate in sulfide oxidation stored intracellularly thus belonging to the particulate phase however considered as subject to substrate affinity constraints as has been done for other storage compounds as per asm2d henze et al 1999 thiosulfate s s 2 o 3 mg cod l 1 sulfate s s o 4 mgso4 2 s l 1 in this reaction scheme sulfide is either oxidised to elemental sulfur rate parameter k 0 and then to sulfate weissgerber et al 2014 rate parameter k 1 yielding 8 electrons for growth or to thiosulfate dahl and trüper 1994 rate parameter k 2 which is then oxidised to elemental sulfur and sulfate proportionately in one reaction yielding 1 mol each of sulfate and elemental sulfur per mole of thiosulfate weissgerber et al 2014 rate parameter k 3 the elemental sulfur eventually is oxidised to sulfate as well this overall reaction path also yields 8 electrons the stoichiometry for this proposed model is summarised in fig 2 and a full stoichiometry matrix is also available in the supplementary material figure s3 as per the adm1 a balanced multi substrate limitation was included for the three sulfur containing substrates sulfide thiosulfate elemental sulfur inorganic carbon inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus the latter three were usually supplied in excess so half saturation constants k s j for these were taken from puyol et al 2017 sulfur substrate competition was modelled with the following expression 1 c j s i s i s s s 2 o 3 x s 0 b where c j is the competition term for the active substrate a fraction and s i the active substrate either s is or s s 2 o 3 or x s 0 b where b stands for autotrophic biomass a or heterotrophic biomass h biomass accumulation was dependent on substrate uptake rates via the biomass yield y p b i mg cod mg cod 1 the process model was developed as a set of differential algebraic equations dae with state equations as ordinary differential equations odes and the equations for ph and aqueous phase speciation reactions as algebraic equations 2 6 1 parameter estimation the model was implemented in matlab and all subsequent calculations were performed using matlab available in uq e space for this the mechanistic model fig 1 was used to estimate the rates k 0 to k 3 and the net yield y pb net with data from the low irradiance experiments and the rates k 0 to k 3 for the high irradiance case using the respective data and the previously estimated yield the rate parameters of the sulfide oxidation model k 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 and a net biomass yield y p b n e t for the autotrophic biomass x p b a were most critical to identify and relevant to the novel components of the model these parameters were estimated with their respective 95 confidence interval using the experimental data low irradiance data points n 11 parameters to identify p 5 degrees of freedom df 6 high irradiance n 8 p 4 df 4 however affinity for sulfur compounds was very high which meant that the half saturation coefficients could not be estimated except identifying that they were relatively low instead the half saturation constants k s j for all the biochemical rates j in the sulfide oxidation model were instead set based on experimental findings table s1 similarly the rate parameters of the sulfide oxidation model for the heterotrophic biomass x p b h were not the focus of this investigation and were set to reduce the number of unknown parameters table s1 the kinetic rate parameters for heterotrophic biomass were chosen based on experimental results or set to a smaller value than the autotrophic rates to allow autotrophic processes to dominate since there was no relevant substrate for heterotrophic growth all other parameters in the model were taken from previous investigations puyol et al 2017 batstone et al 2002a rosen et al 2006 as an initial condition the initial measured experimental values were taken for all state variables the value for the pcod was distributed amongst intracellularly stored elemental sulfur x s 0 active biomass x p b a x p b h dead biomass and other particulate substrates x s and particulate inerts x i the initial condition for biomass x pb ini was set at the initial pcod weighted with the relative abundance of the respective biomass psb or pnsb in the inoculum as determined by sequencing secondly it was assumed that 10 of the biomass was viable at the start of the experiment which was chosen by observation of the raw data the remainder of the initial pcod was attributed to soluble particulate inerts x i estimating the parameters for the low irradiance case 94 2 of the measured initial pcod was particulate inerts x i x p b a i n i was 1 6 and x p b h i n i was 4 2 in the low irradiance case serving as a validation x i ini was 96 0 x p b a i n i was 0 8 and x p b h i n i was 3 2 for the high irradiance case x i ini was 97 85 x p b a i n i was 0 01 and x p b h i n i was 2 14 which was based on the experimental findings of the microbial community analysis the parameter estimation was carried out using the lsqnonlin routine in matlab matlab r2018b the mathworks inc natick ma the experimental mean values for measured sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate concentrations as well as pcod concentration were considered as fit objectives with the aim to find the corresponding rates and biomass yields the objective function subject to minimisation using multiple objectives including sulfide cod etc was the weighted sum of squares 2 f i x i x ˆ 2 s x where s x were the standard deviations for observation i x ˆ i were the model values and x i the experimental values for observation i for the low irradiance data sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and pcod were considered for x i in order to estimate the respective specific rates and the biomass yield in case of the high irradiance the pcod concentration was omitted for the objective function as the biomass yield had already been estimated to prevent issues with model stiffness non relevant rates of the model concerning organic electron donors and hydrolysis rates were set to 0 this is a reasonable assumption as no acetic acid was added in the experiments and the considered time frame for hydrolysis was expected to have a negligible impact on the solution the parameter estimation was repeated for the low and the high irradiation case in order to examine if the increased irradiance has an effect on the kinetic rate parameters however for the high irradiation case only the kinetic parameters k i were estimated using the previously estimated biomass yield because irradiance was only expected to affect process rates and not biomass yield for the high irradiation case the objective function was adjusted by removing the standard deviation term because due to failure of one treatment no meaningful standard deviation could be calculated the estimation was therefore considered to be more rigorous in both cases using 95 confidence intervals in parameters were determined using the nlparci routine in matlab calculated from the parameter objective jacobian as an output from the optimisation routine bates and watts 1988 parameter independence was assessed via correlation matrixes calculated from the parameter objective jacobian as well 3 results 3 1 mixed culture ppb remove sulfide quicker with higher irradiance fig 3 a shows time trends of measured sulfide concentrations for the experiments with low irradiance and high irradiance in ormerod medium and the observations were in agreement with that in a second experiment at low irradiance in ormerod medium figure s1 supplementary material initially the sulfide was removed at a lower rate due to an adaptation period of the microbial community after about 60 h the removal of sulfide became considerably faster and all sulfide was completely removed after 125 h in both experiments in the experiment with higher irradiation complete sulfide removal was achieved about 24 h earlier than in the experiment with lower irradiation indicating that the irradiation intensity affects reaction rate in both experiments a black precipitate was observed at the beginning of the experiment indicating formation of iron sulfide both experiments showed no activity in the dark control fig 3a the average volumetric sulfide removal rate after 60 h was 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 in the lower irradiance experiment simultaneously inorganic carbon was removed at an average rate of 1 6 1 3 mg c lh 1 and pcod accumulated at an average rate of 2 5 1 9 mg cod lh 1 the average molar s cremoved ratio was 0 42 which is close to the expected ratio of 0 5 inorganic nitrogen was removed at a rate of 0 22 0 19 mg n lh 1 implying minimal net nitrogen removal and inorganic phosphate was removed at a rate of 0 2 0 6 mg p lh 1 implying no significant net phosphate removal a high variability in the p removal is likely due to a high initial concentration of inorganic phosphate in the medium in the higher irradiance experiment n 2 due to failure of one of the triplicates fig 3a the removal rate of sulfide was 2 9 mg s lh 1 while pcod was accumulated at an average rate of 6 3 mg cod lh 1 and inorganic carbon was removed at a rate of 2 1 mg c lh 1 here the average molar s cremoved ratio was 0 52 which was expected simultaneously inorganic nitrogen was removed at an average rate of 0 4 mg n lh 1 and inorganic phosphate at an average rate of 0 4 mg p lh 1 the average removal rates are given without confidence intervals because of the failure of one replicate in the triplicate experiment however variation between the successful duplicates was similar the removal of inorganic phosphate in the high irradiance experiment was more than double that in the low irradiance experiment in previous studies scod n premoved ratios of 100 22 6 2 9 have been reported for logarithmic growth of ppb and 100 3 9 0 29 during the stationary phase hülsen et al 2014 in this study the observed ratio was 100 12 6 for the low irradiance experiment at the end of the entire experimental run for the high irradiance experiment the observed ratio was 100 14 16 which may indicate that intracellular phosphate accumulation was occurring following the uptake and removal of sulfide various oxidation products of higher oxidation state formed fig 3b and c in both experiments the sulfide is simultaneously oxidised to thiosulfate and sulfate and a lack of balance of dissolved sulfur components indicated that an insoluble sulfur component had formed fig 3b and c likely intracellular elemental sulfur weissgerber et al 2014 specifically in the experiment with lower irradiance fig 3b the total s concentration decreased at about 100 h relative to t 0 h indicating intracellular sulfur accumulation however due to further oxidation to sulfate all s present at the start of the experiment was recovered after about 150 h leading up to the end of the experiment fig 3b within the bounds of the confidence intervals the concentration of sulfite was observed to be negligible over most of the experimental period as it was likely oxidised to sulfate dahl 2017 in the higher irradiance experiment fig 3c sulfide is oxidised in a similar way except that the formation of thiosulfate occurred at a higher rate at higher irradiance so that the initial concentration of s was fully recovered within 100 h the initial sum of soluble sulfur components was exceeded by the end of the experiment which might indicate recovery of intracellularly stored sulfur initially present in the inoculum however this could have also been due to experimental uncertainty sulfide and inorganic carbon removal caused the ph to increase from an initial 8 7 to 9 3 in the low irradiance experiment and an initial 8 5 to 9 0 in the high irradiance experiment the high initial ph was caused by the addition of sodium sulfide the subsequent increase was caused by the production of biomass despite the formation of sulfuric acid residual acetic acid was low at the start of all experiments with synthetic medium with the low irradiance experiment being less than 9 7 mg l 1 and less than 3 4 mg l 1 for the high irradiance experiment for these low organic electron donor concentrations the extent of photoheterotrophic growth was likely negligible 3 2 ppb can remove sulfide and grow with centrate as nutrient source similar to the synthetic media the autotrophic growth and sulfide removal in centrate was found to be initially slow and faster near the end of the experiment becoming similar to the rate observed using synthetic medium fig 4 this was likely due to the adaptation and subsequent shift of the microbial community from pnsb to psb section 3 3 after inoculation the measured concentration of acetic acid was 131 11 mgl 1 as compared to the initially measured concentration of scod section 2 2 likely due to hydrolysis and fermentation processes in the centrate converting particulate substrates into soluble substrates and acetate this acetate was almost fully consumed after about 70 h 45 mgl 1 after 90 h 3 mgl 1 the low removal rates at the start of the experiment are consistent with the experiments in synthetic media likely due to microbial adaptation and community shift however in centrate the sulfide concentration increased towards the end of the experiment indicating that sulfide removal was incomplete and was instead being re released which might have been due to uptake of sulfide by viable biomass and re release due to incomplete enzymatic reactions as a consequence of lacking micro nutrients and potential biomass decay examining the centrate for micro nutrients through icp oes analysis identified a lack of manganese undetectable in solution or in the biomass at the start and end of the experiment the concentration of fe was measured at 0 62 0 14 mg fe l 1 at inoculation in the particulate phase likely due to incomplete dissolution and 0 58 0 09 mg fe l 1 in the particulate phase at the end of the experiment iron was added to enable the enzymatic cascade of sulfide oxidation which is dependent on fe and mn grimm et al 2008 hensen et al 2006 the lack of manganese was believed to be a plausible cause for the incomplete sulfide oxidation as in the previous experiments the ph progressively increased from 8 9 to 9 4 in addition to sulfide average removal rate 1 5 0 4 mg s lh 1 the ppb removed 0 5 0 3 mg c lh 1 inorganic carbon 0 17 0 17 mg n lh 1 inorganic nitrogen and 0 04 0 02 mg p lh 1 inorganic phosphorus in centrate the high variability in inorganic nitrogen removal could have been due to a relatively high initial inorganic nitrogen concentration as compared to that in the synthetic medium the average removal of inorganic carbon was lower than expected which could also have been due to a high initial concentration of inorganic carbon in the centrate and due to a low number of replicates the ratio of scod n premoved with tests on centrate was observed to be 100 9 3 which is lower than that in the synthetic medium experiments this removal of p was similar to reported values for logarithmic growth hülsen et al 2014 whereas the removal of n was lower than previously reported hülsen et al 2014 plausibly due to the incomplete oxidation of sulfide 3 3 sulfide exposure shifts the microbial community from pnsb to psb an initial slow sulfide removal rate followed by a higher rate subsequently figs 3 and 4 was attributed to microbial community changes specifically the analysis showed that communities were mainly shifting towards an increasing abundance of species of the chromatiaceae family fig 5 the relative abundance of chromatiaceae at the end of the experiments with low irradiation and synthetic medium was 45 whereas initially it was 16 4 under the high irradiation regime it was found that chromatiaceae accounted for 26 8 as compared to in the inoculum where its abundance was 0 1 also in the experiment with centrate as nutrient source chromatiaceae were most abundant at the end of the experiment with 20 5 as compared to 14 3 in the inoculum here the increase in psb is less than in the other experiments likely due to the high initial acetate concentration in the centrate which might have favoured photoheterotrophic growth of pnsb the results confirm that mostly psb performed the sulfide oxidation with the most abundant identifiable chromatiaceae species in all experiments being allochromatium sp this particular genus has been previously reported to withstand up to 300 mg s l 1 sulfide before notable inhibition brune 1989 other families typically classified as pnsb were also identified but with much lower abundance at the end of the experiment than in the inoculum pnsb containing families such as bradyrhizobiaceae rhodobactereaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were found with rhodobactereaceae and bradyrhizobiaceae being generally more abundant these organisms have been reported to be more abundant in the treatment of waters with organic electron donors predominantly utilising heterotrophic pathways hülsen et al 2016a b additional results for the second experiment with synthetic medium at low irradiance are also available and consistent figure s2 supplementary material 3 4 sulfide removal model successfully estimated kinetic parameters and yield the data from the batch experiments were used to estimate biological parameters of the photoautotrophic sulfide oxidation fig 6 fig 6a shows the model fitted to the data from the low irradiance experiment with synthetic medium and fig 6c shows the fit to the high irradiance data according to the methods described in section 2 6 1 another set of data from a separate low irradiance experiment was used to validate the estimated rates by inserting the identified rates into the model and comparing model predictions with experimental measurements for the low irradiance case fig 6b the model was simulated with the respective initial conditions and the identified parameters the model results were observed to be within the 95 confidence of the data representing a good fit and meaningful estimations for the parameters the 95 uncertainty in the parameter values in table 1 also indicated that the parameter values were significant i e values were significantly different from zero parameter independence was assessed via the correlation matrixes all correlation coefficients for the low irradiance case were less than 0 8 and commonly less than 0 3 for the high irradiance case only k 0 and k 2 were correlated with a coefficient of 0 98 correlation matrixes are provided in the supplementary information tables s2 and s3 for the low irradiance case the rates were estimated with sufficient confidence however in the high irradiance case the large uncertainty in k 1 may have been due to data variability and the estimation being without weighting with standard deviations because of fewer measurement replicates generally all rates were increased with higher irradiation which can be seen in the time series data in fig 6 as well specifically k 0 and k 3 at high irradiance are double the respective values at low irradiance and rates k 1 and k 2 at high irradiance increased 4 8 and 6 3 fold in comparison to the respective rates at low irradiance however this 4 8 fold increase of k 1 may not be so meaningful due to the large confidence interval for k 1 at high irradiance mostly due to less data being available for the estimation of the high irradiance parameters the biomass yield with y pb net 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 is comparatively high for an autotrophic process as a yield of y pb a 0 42 mg cod mg cod 1 was previously estimated for the autotrophic growth of ppb puyol et al 2017 however this yield in our study is still less than the biomass yield for relevant heterotrophic processes y pb ph 1 13 mg cod mg cod 1 puyol et al 2017 the model was used to estimate three biomass specific rates and the biomass yield for the autotrophic biomass the experimental data was sufficient for the estimation of these parameters however the half saturation constants for the autotrophic biomass could not be estimated due to high parameter correlation and a lack of data around the time when limitation could have occurred when concentration approaches 0 other than the model parameters associated with the autotrophic biomass parameters associated with the heterotrophic biomass were set as constants in the estimation this was due to the heterotrophic biomass not being the focus of investigation also the microbial community shifted towards autotrophic biomass during the experiment therefore estimating model parameters for the heterotrophic biomass is less relevant the assumption of a constant biomass yield regardless of the process rate seems to be valid as the kinetic parameters were identifiable for the case with higher irradiation and the pcod concentration was estimated reasonably well however the measured values after 100 h were larger than the model estimation 4 discussion 4 1 comparing ppb with other phototrophic sulfide removal systems the presented results show that a mixed ppb culture is capable of removing dissolved sulfide the removal performance increased with increasing irradiance section 3 1 the average volumetric removal rates in the low 0 004 g cod lh 1 and the high irradiance case 0 006 g cod lh 1 were relatively small compared to average removal in photoheterotrophic growth mode 0 07 g cod lh 1 hülsen et al 2014 this might have been due to a low initial biomass concentration in the experiments and the suspended growth biomass specific rates for low and high irradiance were estimated at 0 085 g s g vs h 1 and 0 2 g s g vs h 1 respectively using a cod vs ratio of 1 7 section 3 4 previously gsb phototrophic organisms similar to ppb have been studied for sulfide removal from gaseous and liquid waste streams similar to the metabolism of the autotrophic ppb gsb use co2 and h2s for biomass growth in contrast to ppb that absorb ir light zuber and cogdell 1995 gsb contain bacteriochlorophylls with absorption peaks in the visible spectrum blankenship et al 1995 many studies mainly focused on using c limicola in pure culture for the removal of sulfide from synthetic medium henshaw and zhu 2001 kim et al 1992 syed and henshaw 2003 or for the removal of sulfide from wastewater mainly for odour control purposes syed and henshaw 2005 takashima et al 2000 hurse and keller 2004 in these studies the bacteria grew in biofilms rather than suspended and residual organic compounds in the wastewater could have promoted heterotrophic growth high volumetric removal rates were found utilising a biofilm and mixotrophic growth modes the volumetric removal ranged from 286 to 1451 mg s lh 1 where rates were negatively correlated to the reactor volumes and positively correlated to irradiance suggesting that small reactor volumes facilitate high sulfide removal due to increased irradiance and biomass concentration in the biofilm syed and henshaw 2005 2003 henshaw and zhu 2001 syed et al 2006 the volumetric rates observed in our study seemed to be lower however assuming a biomass concentration of 3 g vs l 1 the volumetric rates would have been comparable ranging from 255 to 599 mg s lh 1 at low and high irradiance this biomass concentration has previously been achieved in ppb systems hülsen et al 2018 2016 in contrast to pure cultures mixed cultures dominated by gsb removed sulfide in a range of 0 5 3 3 mg s lh 1 kobayashi et al 1983 hurse and keller 2004 garcia et al 2017 syed et al 2006 which is similar to the volumetric sulfide removal found in our study 1 79 2 9 mg s lh 1 and might also be due to lower biomass concentrations section 3 1 similar to our observations section 3 3 garcia et al 2017 and quiroz et al 2018 found an increase in psb particularly chromatiaceae in a mixed culture community with pnsb removing sulfide as well as acetate in mixotrophic growth conditions even though sulfide loadings in their studies were low in all reported systems the removal rates for gsb differed widely depending on the system and the biomass content in the system syed et al 2006 mostly continuous sulfide removal was studied and often the biomass concentration was not accounted for this is likely due to the emphasis on reducing odour emissions from wastewater instead of processing of gas streams for h2s removal in contrast with process engineering applications transport limitations of substrate to the biofilm saturation of sulfide in the bulk liquid phase different growth kinetics of different bacteria and light attenuation due to biofilm formation are all important for the process performance 4 2 process modelling and scale estimation the process model section 3 4 identified the multi step sulfide oxidation with intermediate substrate accumulation and consumption as rate limiting steps sulfide was oxidised more rapidly to intracellular elemental sulfur than to thiosulfate k 0 k 2 the subsequent oxidation of intracellular elemental sulfur to sulfate occurred rapidly as long as trace elements were supplied implying that the limiting step in this reaction is the sulfide oxidation to intracellular elemental sulfur the principal sulfide removal rate k 0 estimated here was 6 25 fold higher than previously estimated puyol et al 2017 which might be due to the modelling approach we used splitting the mixed culture into autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass by doing this we were able to perform a more accurate rate estimation for the specific biomass gemerden 1984 reported specific growth rates for allochromatium vinosum averaging at μ 0 098 h 1 with a maximum of 70 wm 2 irradiance this rate was estimated based on monod kinetics including inhibition haldane equation on a molar basis converting this rate to a cod basis with m pb 192 g cod mol 1 the molecular mass of biomass batstone et al 2002a the average growth rate estimated by gemerden 1984 is μ 0 294 h 1 the growth rate estimated in this study the product of k 0 and the yield y pb net was 0 086 h 1 and 0 172 h 1 for low and high irradiance respectively this suggests that at low irradiance the rate was about 29 and at high irradiance the rate was about 58 of the reported value other than that the increased irradiance increased the rate of sulfide oxidation to thiosulfate this might have been due to an increased production of adenosine tri phosphate atp niederman 2017 which in turn might have accelerated cellular processes however due to the regulation of light harvesting complexes and less expression of light harvesting complexes at higher irradiation cogdell et al 2006 a further increase in irradiation might not scale linearly with the removal rates in comparison to a single step process model this multi step model accounted for intermediates accumulation suggesting that biomass likely continues to accumulate after sulfide depletion due to consumption of intermediates in a full scale system sufficient biomass is likely to accumulate ensuring continuous sulfide removal as long as light is supplied the model and the estimated parameters specifically the kinetics for sulfide oxidation k 0 has been used for the prediction and scaling of a practical application of the process the process could treat 1 nm3 biogas per day containing 2000 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 or 10 nm3 sour gas per day containing 200 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 in a 10l reactor assuming no limitation due to gas liquid mass transfer processes e g highly turbulent systems micro bubbles and 12 h per day available irradiance at least 27 wm 2 a residual liquid concentration of 0 1 mg s l 1 sulfide was assumed acceptable where in equilibrium the corresponding gas phase concentration would be 30 ppmv sander 2015 the required biomass concentration for the process would be 0 5 g cod l 1 0 3 g vs l 1 with cod vs ratio 1 7 this biomass concentration was observed in this study and is therefore achievable at 3 g vs l 1 biomass concentration the system could treat 10 nm3 biogas 2000 ppmv h2s 40 vol co2 per day in a 10l reactor in either case the treatable gas could be doubled at double the irradiance due to the increased biomass specific sulfide removal rate which is more likely under sun light conditions a scaled up system is reliant on the gas liquid mass transfer of h2s into the liquid phase in case the biomass specific sulfide uptake rate is higher than the gas liquid mass transfer rate the mass transfer will be the limiting step depending on the effectiveness of the mass transfer the concentration of available sulfide could be limiting to the biomass uptake the relevant half saturation concentration for a scaled up sour gas treatment application is k s s i s associated with sulfide uptake other half saturation constants are less relevant the sulfide affinity which is directly associated with the half saturation constant was reported as 0 224 mg s l 1 for allochromatium vinosum dsm 185 gemerden 1984 the half saturation used here was more conservative at about double the reported value k s 0 5 mg s l 1 used 4 3 process limitations centrate as a low cost source of the macro nutrients nh4 n and po4 p is readily available at the anaerobic digestion facilities where biogas desulfurisation is required the centrate used in the presented research proved to be an adequate source of macro nutrients for the photoautotrophic growth and sulfide removal by ppb even though the observed sulfide oxidation in centrate was incomplete section 3 2 however the addition of fe and mn might have been required centrate has been applied successfully as a source of macro nutrients in a number of photoautotrophic applications growing microalgae however growth has typically been lower in centrate than in a synthetic medium due to undesirable nutrient ratios erkelens et al 2014 del mar morales amaral et al 2015 uggetti et al 2014 posadas et al 2013 bahr et al 2013 found that using diluted digester centrate in a continuous sulfide removal process using a consortium of microalgae the biomass concentration was decreased in comparison to a synthetic medium and attributed this to a decrease in gas liquid mass transfer in centrate affecting overall growth sulfide removal however was found to be consistent indicating that the centrate was a suitable nutrient source for sulfide removal a potential limitation of digester centrate as nutrient source is the colour and the turbidity of the centrate coloured components absorb radiation and could decrease the available irradiance for ppb growth the absorption of digester centrate has been reported to be strong in the lower half of the visible spectrum 475 800 nm and less in the upper half and this was dependant on the origin of the centrate and the conditions of digestion marcilhac et al 2014 however only the absorption of ir radiation is of interest for ppb other than colour particulate turbidity can decrease light penetration akhiar et al 2017 which is partially avoidable by pre treatment of the centrate such as by settling centrifugation or even micro filtration tait et al 2013 4 4 process benefits the rate of sulfide removal was not dependant on the concentration of inorganic carbon present in the medium however the inorganic carbon was supplied in excess in all experiments so that carbon limitation did not occur the carbon limitation is less relevant for a scaled sour gas processing system as the sour gas commonly contains a much higher percentage of co2 as compared to h2s also a high concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is expected with centrate as nutrient source the growth at a high ph is beneficial for the scaled process application with gas liquid mass transfer because gaseous h2s dissolves more efficiently in a higher ph liquid the system is robust enough to remove sulfide and accumulate biomass even under less favourable conditions for photoautotrophs in the presence of organic electron donors in a scaled application using centrate as a nutrient source acetate will likely be consumed rapidly with enough residual inorganic nitrogen inorganic phosphorus and inorganic carbon remaining to facilitate the sulfide removal so there would be minimal need for additional centrate it is expected that photoautotrophic organisms would dominate the microbial community as evidenced by the microbial community analysis at the end of the centrate experiments a continuous influx of bacteria from the centrate might disturb the microbial community in a continuous biogas desulfurisation process however in this study we found that the community shifted mostly to psb even with the non pretreated centrate as nutrient source irradiation with ir as energy source and exclusion of uv vis light likely excludes growth of other photoautotrophic organisms hülsen et al 2014 irradiating a full scale process with ir and providing sulfide as well as inorganic carbon with low concentrations of organic electron donors in the centrate the microbial community is expected to be relatively stable with on going operation the low and high irradiation experiments section 3 1 are indicative of a process application with sunlight as energy source which would make the application more cost effective however only the ir fraction of sunlight would be important for the process reported to be about 40 of the irradiation at sea level barolet et al 2016 and estimated at a value of about 80 100 w m 2 about 50 of this irradiation is estimated to reach the process liquid after applying a uv vis absorbing filter and accounting for the absorption of a typical perspex reactor with 15 mm wall thickness the resulting value could therefore be similar to the irradiance applied in the high irradiance experiment uyar et al 2007 found that the hydrogen production of r sphaeroides a member of the pnsb was inhibited at an irradiance of 270 w m 2 and above indicating the occurrence of photo inhibition compared to the estimated irradiance under natural sun light conditions the proposed sulfide removal process would unlikely suffer from photo inhibition the goal of the process is to produce desulfurised sour gas and an additional benefit is the production of biomass ppb biomass can be a source of protein and has been used in fish feed replacing fish meal delamare deboutteville et al 2019 in this way the biomass is a high value product besides the desulfurised gas resulting from the process commercial desulfurisation processes with added value generation produce elemental sulfur as a side product valued at about 80 usd per tonne chauhan 2016 in contrast the value of ppb biomass and other single cell protein biomass has been estimated at 10 14 usd per kg protein dry mass replacing fish meal and 1 1 usd per kg protein dry mass replacing soybean meal matassa et al 2016 the autotrophic process requires roughly 400 nm3 biogas 2000 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 to produce 1 kg vs ppb biomass the large amount of gas required is due to the low concentration of h2s practical application of the process would be in a dedicated gas fed bioreactor with sulfide removed to sulfate by oxidation as well as removal of co2 centrate or media would be continuously fed in the liquid stream harvesting a relatively pure biomass product for subsequent use this requires a number of future development steps including optimising reactor design to achieve optimal gas liquid transfer and irradiance and optimising further energy transfer in a bubble column where the irradiation could interact with this polydisperse media the high value of the biomass product ability to obtain a relatively pure gas stream and widespread availability of high sulfide gas streams mean that the process concept would have broad future application potential to desulfurise sour gas or biogas while producing a valuable biomass product 5 conclusion ppb removed sulfide autotrophically at a maximum rate of 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 at 27 wm 2 infra red irradiation in batch tests formation of intermediates particularly thiosulfate and elemental sulfur was an important mechanism with particularly sulfide to thiosulfate being a rate limiting step as determined by model based analysis net biomass yield was estimated at y pb 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 sulfide oxidation was accompanied by a shift from heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass mostly chromatiaceae allochromatium sp increasing irradiance to 56 wm 2 doubled all relative rates removal from k 0 0 100 0 014 h 1 0 085 g s g vs h 1 at 27 wm 2 to 0 235 0 009 h 1 0 200 g s g vs h 1 at 56 wm 2 digester centrate was an effective growth media with similar removal rates to synthetic media as long as micro nutrients specifically fe and mn were supplied because these elements were thought to be limiting the presented research identifies that biological single step anaerobic desulfurisation can be applied for

17804,current h2s treatment methods for sour gases require considerable amounts of chemicals and energy or in case of biological treatment unwanted diluents such as oxygen or nitrogen may be introduced in order to reduce those requirements the viability of an anaerobic biological h2s removal process using purple phototrophic bacteria ppb was investigated in this study ppb can use sunlight and centrate as nutrient source thus potentially reducing energy and chemical requirements an added benefit is the production of biomass with potential uses such as single cell protein an inoculum of ppb enriched from domestic wastewater was grown photoautotrophically with sulfide as the electron donor and inorganic carbon in a mixed culture additionally synthetic medium and centrate as well as high 56 11 wm 2 and low 27 3 wm 2 ir irradiation were trialled finally a process model was developed to study biomass specific removal rates and yield the results showed that a mixed culture of ppb removed sulfide completely in synthetic media 121 9 mg s l 1 at a maximum rate of 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 low irradiance and 2 9 mg s lh 1 high irradiance the ph increased in both experiments from about 8 5 to 9 sulfide removal rates using centrate and low irradiance were similar however fe and mn were found to be limiting growth and sulfide removal in all experiments chromatiaceae purple sulfur bacteria were most abundant at the end of the experiment while at the start purple non sulfur bacteria were most abundant from the inoculum process modelling and experimental work identified the sulfide oxidation to be a multi step process with accumulation of intermediates specific rates were directly dependent on light input doubling at high irradiance sulfide oxidation was estimated at 0 100 0 014 h 1 0 085 0 012 g s g vs h 1 at low irradiance and the biomass yield at 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 this process model enables the virtual evaluation of autotrophic sulfide removal by ppb in a continuous scaled up process overall the photoautotrophic removal of sulfide seems to be a viable option especially because of the possibility of using sunlight as an energy source and centrate as a

7300 ppmv from anaerobic digesters beil and beyrich 2013 petersson 2013 due to the corrosive nature of h2s it has to be removed before these gases can be beneficially used abatzoglou and boivin 2009 different desulfurisation technologies are available and they mostly rely on the h2s transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase where it can be removed as sulfide lens 2000 absorption is improved by increasing the liquid ph due to the equilibrium shifting with pka1 7 and pka2 13 where pka2 is associated with large uncertainty perrin 1982 chemical removal of sulfide can also be achieved with regenerable absorbents in an amine solution with a multistep regeneration process huertas et al 2011 beil and beyrich 2013 other removal methods are non regenerable absorbents e g fe zn oxidation or direct conversion of sulfide to elemental sulfur via combustion lens 2000 however all chemical removal technologies require large amounts of chemicals and energy with chemical input costs scaling with size petersson and wellinger 2009 biological sulfide oxidation with sulfide oxidising bacteria sob in a micro aerated tank after absorption in a separate column is also commercially applied as a h2s removal technology e g thiopaq janssen et al 2000 however the capital costs of such a two column system can be significant because the regeneration reactions for elemental sulfur are highly exothermic and the value of elemental sulfur as a commodity chemical is low micro aeration applied directly to the anaerobic digester oxidises sulfide to elemental sulfur with low operating costs but introduces nitrogen as a contaminant into the treated gas skerman et al 2018 phototrophic microorganisms such as algae bahr et al 2013 and green sulfur bacteria gsb have been used to remove sulfide from sour gases wherein oxygenic algae introduce oxygen into the treated gas for sulfide oxidation anoxygenic gsb have been investigated extensively for their ability to remove sulfide from liquid or gaseous streams mainly for odour control purposes syed et al 2006 however removal rates differed noticeably between the different systems and biomass specific removal rates have not been previously compared this makes an assessment of process feasibility at larger scale difficult both organisms require irradiation in the visible light spectrum which depending on reactor footprint contributes to high energy costs for treatment posten 2009 recently anoxygenic purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have gained attention for complete nutrient recovery from wastewater and have been found to be versatile in terms of metabolism and robust in process applications hülsen et al 2014 2016 many species of ppb can grow photoautotrophically using sulfide as electron donor to reduce inorganic carbon for biomass growth pfennig 1975 hunter et al 2009 brune 1989 frigaard 2016 making ppb an interesting candidate for an h2s removal process with simultaneous stoichiometric co2 removal in a ratio of 0 5 s c theoretical molar ratio syed et al 2006 in contrast to algae and gsb ppb absorb in the infra red ir spectrum potentially lowering the energy requirements of irradiation for example applying ir light marín et al 2019 successfully used ppb to simultaneously treat piggery effluent and upgrade biogas including complete sulfide removal however this process is partially heterotrophic as well as autotrophic fully autotrophic ppb using h2s only as electron donor have a number of potential advantages including lower light energy inputs compared to phototrophic processes using the visual spectrum with potential to instead use the ir spectrum of sunlight recovery of a pure ppb product and maximal removal of co2 from the gas stream in addition anoxygenic photosytnthesis does not generate oxygen in practice this would involve a reactor fed with high sulfide feed streams for sulfide removal but it is necessary to identify the basic capability and removal mechanism of mixed culture ppb on autotrophic sulfide feeds the aim of this study is to investigate a fully autotrophic process for sulfide removal via ppb and to estimate sulfide removal rates as well as biomass yield being important design parameters for a full scale process also the study explored the potential of reducing chemical inputs into the process by solely providing digester centrate as nitrogen and phosphorus source for biomass growth in regards to energy requirements of the process different ir irradiation intensities are trialled and the potential of using sunlight is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles wheaton illinois usa in triplicates plus one dark control wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude any light input the bottles were agitated in a temperature controlled maxq4000 incubator shaker thermo fisher scientific massachusetts usa with the temperature set at 24 c and the shaking speed at 200 rpm the shaker hood was covered in aluminium foil to exclude any external light input from the environment inside the shaker infra red light emitting diode ir led spotlights peak λ 850 nm were installed at two different distances from the serum bottles to create two different irradiation intensities in order to quantify the intensity the irradiance density emitted by the spotlights was measured with a radiometer stellarnet tampa florida usa over a wavelength spectrum λ 300 1000 nm at 21 grid points of the projected area of light incidence into the bottles the obtained grid point values were interpolated cubically over the irradiated area to calculate the incident irradiance 2 2 materials a synthetic medium was used in two separate batch tests to obtain growth dynamics without micro or macro nutrient limitation for the quantification of sulfide removal a modified ormerod medium ormerod et al 1961 was used where all sulfate salts were replaced with chloride salts in order not to interfere with sulfate measurements the modified medium composition was 900 mgl 1 k2hpo4 600 mgl 1 kh2po4 338 mgl 1 m g c l 2 6 h 2 o 75 mgl 1 c a c l 2 2 h 2 o 15 4 mgl 1 f e c l 2 4 h 2 o 20 mgl 1 edta 20 mgl 1

inorganic carbon as carbon source were added separately to the modified ormerod medium in all experiments sulfide was added as na2s 9 h2o 1 125 gl 1 equivalent to 150 mg s l 1 this high concentration of sulfide was chosen to examine the assumed maximum sulfide uptake rates without sulfide limitation inorganic carbon was added as nahco3 at 350 mgl 1 in the first experiment with low irradiance and 700 mgl 1 in the second experiment with low irradiance to confirm that the sulfide removal rate was not being limited by inorganic carbon substrate availability accordingly for the high irradiance case 960 mgl 1 nahco3 was added to ensure that the sulfide uptake rate was not limited by uptake of inorganic carbon the nitrogen source was added as nh4cl at 405 mgl 1 equivalent to 105 mg n l 1 in all experiments with the synthetic medium anaerobic digester centrate was collected from the centrifuge liquid return line of a local wastewater treatment facility in south east queensland australia and contained 427 4 mg c l 1 inorganic carbon 503 28 mg n l 1 ammonium and 29 3 mg p l 1 inorganic phosphate also the centrate contained 143 30 mg cod l 1 total chemical oxygen demand tcod and 106 17 mg cod l 1 soluble cod scod all values are given with 95 confidence intervals the centrate was diluted 50 50 with milli q water to lower the risk of microbial inhibition due to humic substances in the experiment using centrate as nutrient source only the electron donor sulfide was added as na2s 9 h2o 1 125 gl 1 equivalent to 150 mg s l 1 and 8 5 mg fe l 1 as fecl2 4 h2o to partly supplement micro nutrients the bottles were irradiated with the low irradiation intensity see section 2 1 all batch tests were inoculated with a mixed ppb culture enriched from domestic wastewater and maintained at anaerobic conditions in modified ormerod medium hülsen et al 2014 with weekly acetic acid addition as well as incandescent infra red irradiation the inoculum concentration was adjusted to 128 15 mg cod l 1 for all experiments the microbial community of the inoculum was not adapted to sulfide loading prior to the experiment 2 3 experimental procedure the bottles in most of the experiments were irradiated with the low irradiation intensity for a low irradiation case with the bottles at approximately 20 cm distance to the light source the overall irradiance incident on the bottle surface was 27 3 wm 2 and the irradiated area 0 012 m2 this irradiance was the same for two batch tests with synthetic medium and one test with digester centrate another experiment with higher irradiance using synthetic medium was conducted with the bottles at approximately 3 cm distance to the light source and the measured irradiance was 56 11 wm 2 and the irradiated area 0 012 m2 the bottles were filled with the mixed medium inoculum the carbon electron and nitrogen source the bottles were closed with a gas tight rubber septum and the headspace sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to assure anaerobic conditions liquid samples were taken from all serum bottles to quantify rates of sulfide removal biomass growth and accumulation of by products as well as consumption of macro nutrients prior to sampling in order to keep anaerobic conditions a syringe was sparged with nitrogen and an equal gas volume of nitrogen gas was injected into the serum bottle prior to taking the liquid sample in this way the risk of oxygen ingress through the pierced septum was minimised the samples were taken following inoculation plus an adaptation period of about 60 h every 5 8 h until the concentration of sulfide was low and a final sample was also collected after 260 h each sample was analysed for cod sulfur species dissolved inorganic carbon co2 c and the macro nutrients nh4 n and po4 p section 2 4 additionally elemental analysis was conducted for the batch test with digester centrate in order to determine the concentration of certain micro nutrients fe mn in the centrate to assess if the centrate was suitable as a medium for sulfide removal 2 4 chemical analysis methods cod was determined according to standard methods 5220d apha 2017 with a test kit merck spectroquant 114541 quantifying the tcod and scod for the scod samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter merck millipore darmstadt germany samples for the measurement of the soluble sulfur species sulfide sulfite sulfate and thiosulfate were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and preserved with a sulfide antioxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 using the method described by pozo et al 2016 these sulfur samples were analysed by ion exchange chromatography with a dionex ics 2000 system equipped with a ag18 dionex column iex dionex sunnyvale usa and detected with a flame ionisation detector fid and spectrophotometrical measurement with a uv vis detector pozo et al 2016 for the measurement of dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and analysed

lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin usa after filtering the sample through a 0 45 μm filter elemental analysis was conducted on a filtered 0 45 μm and non filtered sample after digestion with 10 nitric acid and using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkinelmer with optima 7300 dv waltham massachusetts usa the concentration of acetic acid was measured through gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector agilent technologies 7890a gc system measurements of inorganic n and p elemental analysis and acetic acid analysis were conducted according to the methods described by hülsen et al 2014 2 5 microbiological composition analysis microbial composition was analysed via genomic sequencing by the australian centre for ecogenomics ace dna extraction and amplification was conducted by ace the universal primer pair univ ssu 926f 1392wr was used targeting regions of the 16s and 18s rrna genes sequencing was conducted using the illumina platform reads identified as a single read with relative abundance of less than 0 05 or sequence identity less than 60 were discarded 5198 organisational taxonomic units otus were identified sequences were aligned using blast altschul 1997 the resulting otu table was analysed in r using ampvis2 albertsen et al 2015 2 6 process modelling and panm extension in order to quantify the rates of sulfide uptake and associated biomass growth and to compare these to other autotrophic uptake rates and heterotrophic rates processes for photoautotrophic uptake of sulfide were added to panm puyol et al 2017 flores alsina et al 2016 batstone et al 2002b the additional processes required an extension of the physico chemical model to include gas liquid mass transfer sulfide and carbonate speciation as well as an updated ph model all implemented according to the methods described elsewhere batstone et al 2002a the gas liquid mass transfer was modelled as gas film controlled using gas liquid mass transfer coefficients k l a i reported elsewhere rosen et al 2006 the gas liquid mass transfer of elemental nitrogen n2 was also added to verify the gas phase mass balance and the direction of gas liquid mass transfer the ph and the speciation calculation were modelled as equilibrium processes after adm1 using a charge balance approach batstone et al 2002a and using equilibrium constants reported elsewhere flores alsina et al 2015 as for biochemical equations the ppb biomass was split into autotrophic x p b a mg cod l 1 and heterotrophic biomass x p b h mg cod l 1 to reflect a mixed culture environment and the preferential uptake of sulfide by specific bacterial communities dahl and trüper 1994 hunter et al 2009 purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb are usually associated with the uptake of organics and are therefore classified as heterotrophic biomass in this model albeit that pnsb have also been shown to take up sulfide dahl 2017 the mechanism of sulfide oxidation was modelled partly using the pathways of the purple sulfur bacteria psb model organism allochromatium vinosum grimm et al 2008 weissgerber et al 2014 and in response to experimental observations see below accordingly the model described fig 1 sulfide s is mg cod l 1 polysulfide as elemental sulfur x s 0 mg cod l 1 an intermediate in sulfide oxidation stored intracellularly thus belonging to the particulate phase however considered as subject to substrate affinity constraints as has been done for other storage compounds as per asm2d henze et al 1999 thiosulfate s s 2 o 3 mg cod l 1 sulfate s s o 4 mgso4 2 s l 1 in this reaction scheme sulfide is either oxidised to elemental sulfur rate parameter k 0 and then to sulfate weissgerber et al 2014 rate parameter k 1 yielding 8 electrons for growth or to thiosulfate dahl and trüper 1994 rate parameter k 2 which is then oxidised to elemental sulfur and sulfate proportionately in one reaction yielding 1 mol each of sulfate and elemental sulfur per mole of thiosulfate weissgerber et al 2014 rate parameter k 3 the elemental sulfur eventually is oxidised to sulfate as well this overall reaction path also yields 8 electrons the stoichiometry for this proposed model is summarised in fig 2 and a full stoichiometry matrix is also available in the supplementary material figure s3 as per the adm1 a balanced multi substrate limitation was included for the three sulfur containing substrates sulfide thiosulfate elemental sulfur inorganic carbon inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus the latter three were usually supplied in excess so half saturation constants k s j for these were taken from puyol et al 2017 sulfur substrate competition was modelled with the following expression 1 c j s i s i s s s 2 o 3 x s 0 b where c j is the competition term for the active substrate a fraction and s i the active substrate either s is or s s 2 o 3 or x s 0 b where b stands for autotrophic biomass a or heterotrophic biomass h biomass accumulation was dependent on substrate uptake rates via the biomass yield y p b i mg cod mg cod 1 the process model was developed as a set of differential algebraic equations dae with state equations as ordinary differential equations odes and the equations for ph and aqueous phase speciation reactions as algebraic equations 2 6 1 parameter estimation the model was implemented in matlab and all subsequent calculations were performed using matlab available in uq e space for this the mechanistic model fig 1 was used to estimate the rates k 0 to k 3 and the net yield y pb net with data from the low irradiance experiments and the rates k 0 to k 3 for the high irradiance case using the respective data and the previously estimated yield the rate parameters of the sulfide oxidation model k 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 and a net biomass yield y p b n e t for the autotrophic biomass x p b a were most critical to identify and relevant to the novel components of the model these parameters were estimated with their respective 95 confidence interval using the experimental data low irradiance data points n 11 parameters to identify p 5 degrees of freedom df 6 high irradiance n 8 p 4 df 4 however affinity for sulfur compounds was very high which meant that the half saturation coefficients could not be estimated except identifying that they were relatively low instead the half saturation constants k s j for all the biochemical rates j in the sulfide oxidation model were instead set based on experimental findings table s1 similarly the rate parameters of the sulfide oxidation model for the heterotrophic biomass x p b h were not the focus of this investigation and were set to reduce the number of unknown parameters table s1 the kinetic rate parameters for heterotrophic biomass were chosen based on experimental results or set to a smaller value than the autotrophic rates to allow autotrophic processes to dominate since there was no relevant substrate for heterotrophic growth all other parameters in the model were taken from previous investigations puyol et al 2017 batstone et al 2002a rosen et al 2006 as an initial condition the initial measured experimental values were taken for all state variables the value for the pcod was distributed amongst intracellularly stored elemental sulfur x s 0 active biomass x p b a x p b h dead biomass and other particulate substrates x s and particulate inerts x i the initial condition for biomass x pb ini was set at the initial pcod weighted with the relative abundance of the respective biomass psb or pnsb in the inoculum as determined by sequencing secondly it was assumed that 10 of the biomass was viable at the start of the experiment which was chosen by observation of the raw data the remainder of the initial pcod was attributed to soluble particulate inerts x i estimating the parameters for the low irradiance case 94 2 of the measured initial pcod was particulate inerts x i x p b a i n i was 1 6 and x p b h i n i was 4 2 in the low irradiance case serving as a validation x i ini was 96 0 x p b a i n i was 0 8 and x p b h i n i was 3 2 for the high irradiance case x i ini was 97 85 x p b a i n i was 0 01 and x p b h i n i was 2 14 which was based on the experimental findings of the microbial community analysis the parameter estimation was carried out using the lsqnonlin routine in matlab matlab r2018b the mathworks inc natick ma the experimental mean values for measured sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate concentrations as well as pcod concentration were considered as fit objectives with the aim to find the corresponding rates and biomass yields the objective function subject to minimisation using multiple objectives including sulfide cod etc was the weighted sum of squares 2 f i x i x ˆ 2 s x where s x were the standard deviations for observation i x ˆ i were the model values and x i the experimental values for observation i for the low irradiance data sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and pcod were considered for x i in order to estimate the respective specific rates and the biomass yield in case of the high irradiance the pcod concentration was omitted for the objective function as the biomass yield had already been estimated to prevent issues with model stiffness non relevant rates of the model concerning organic electron donors and hydrolysis rates were set to 0 this is a reasonable assumption as no acetic acid was added in the experiments and the considered time frame for hydrolysis was expected to have a negligible impact on the solution the parameter estimation was repeated for the low and the high irradiation case in order to examine if the increased irradiance has an effect on the kinetic rate parameters however for the high irradiation case only the kinetic parameters k i were estimated using the previously estimated biomass yield because irradiance was only expected to affect process rates and not biomass yield for the high irradiation case the objective function was adjusted by removing the standard deviation term because due to failure of one treatment no meaningful standard deviation could be calculated the estimation was therefore considered to be more rigorous in both cases using 95 confidence intervals in parameters were determined using the nlparci routine in matlab calculated from the parameter objective jacobian as an output from the optimisation routine bates and watts 1988 parameter independence was assessed via correlation matrixes calculated from the parameter objective jacobian as well 3 results 3 1 mixed culture ppb remove sulfide quicker with higher irradiance fig 3 a shows time trends of measured sulfide concentrations for the experiments with low irradiance and high irradiance in ormerod medium and the observations were in agreement with that in a second experiment at low irradiance in ormerod medium figure s1 supplementary material initially the sulfide was removed at a lower rate due to an adaptation period of the microbial community after about 60 h the removal of sulfide became considerably faster and all sulfide was completely removed after 125 h in both experiments in the experiment with higher irradiation complete sulfide removal was achieved about 24 h earlier than in the experiment with lower irradiation indicating that the irradiation intensity affects reaction rate in both experiments a black precipitate was observed at the beginning of the experiment indicating formation of iron sulfide both experiments showed no activity in the dark control fig 3a the average volumetric sulfide removal rate after 60 h was 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 in the lower irradiance experiment simultaneously inorganic carbon was removed at an average rate of 1 6 1 3 mg c lh 1 and pcod accumulated at an average rate of 2 5 1 9 mg cod lh 1 the average molar s cremoved ratio was 0 42 which is close to the expected ratio of 0 5 inorganic nitrogen was removed at a rate of 0 22 0 19 mg n lh 1 implying minimal net nitrogen removal and inorganic phosphate was removed at a rate of 0 2 0 6 mg p lh 1 implying no significant net phosphate removal a high variability in the p removal is likely due to a high initial concentration of inorganic phosphate in the medium in the higher irradiance experiment n 2 due to failure of one of the triplicates fig 3a the removal rate of sulfide was 2 9 mg s lh 1 while pcod was accumulated at an average rate of 6 3 mg cod lh 1 and inorganic carbon was removed at a rate of 2 1 mg c lh 1 here the average molar s cremoved ratio was 0 52 which was expected simultaneously inorganic nitrogen was removed at an average rate of 0 4 mg n lh 1 and inorganic phosphate at an average rate of 0 4 mg p lh 1 the average removal rates are given without confidence intervals because of the failure of one replicate in the triplicate experiment however variation between the successful duplicates was similar the removal of inorganic phosphate in the high irradiance experiment was more than double that in the low irradiance experiment in previous studies scod n premoved ratios of 100 22 6 2 9 have been reported for logarithmic growth of ppb and 100 3 9 0 29 during the stationary phase hülsen et al 2014 in this study the observed ratio was 100 12 6 for the low irradiance experiment at the end of the entire experimental run for the high irradiance experiment the observed ratio was 100 14 16 which may indicate that intracellular phosphate accumulation was occurring following the uptake and removal of sulfide various oxidation products of higher oxidation state formed fig 3b and c in both experiments the sulfide is simultaneously oxidised to thiosulfate and sulfate and a lack of balance of dissolved sulfur components indicated that an insoluble sulfur component had formed fig 3b and c likely intracellular elemental sulfur weissgerber et al 2014 specifically in the experiment with lower irradiance fig 3b the total s concentration decreased at about 100 h relative to t 0 h indicating intracellular sulfur accumulation however due to further oxidation to sulfate all s present at the start of the experiment was recovered after about 150 h leading up to the end of the experiment fig 3b within the bounds of the confidence intervals the concentration of sulfite was observed to be negligible over most of the experimental period as it was likely oxidised to sulfate dahl 2017 in the higher irradiance experiment fig 3c sulfide is oxidised in a similar way except that the formation of thiosulfate occurred at a higher rate at higher irradiance so that the initial concentration of s was fully recovered within 100 h the initial sum of soluble sulfur components was exceeded by the end of the experiment which might indicate recovery of intracellularly stored sulfur initially present in the inoculum however this could have also been due to experimental uncertainty sulfide and inorganic carbon removal caused the ph to increase from an initial 8 7 to 9 3 in the low irradiance experiment and an initial 8 5 to 9 0 in the high irradiance experiment the high initial ph was caused by the addition of sodium sulfide the subsequent increase was caused by the production of biomass despite the formation of sulfuric acid residual acetic acid was low at the start of all experiments with synthetic medium with the low irradiance experiment being less than 9 7 mg l 1 and less than 3 4 mg l 1 for the high irradiance experiment for these low organic electron donor concentrations the extent of photoheterotrophic growth was likely negligible 3 2 ppb can remove sulfide and grow with centrate as nutrient source similar to the synthetic media the autotrophic growth and sulfide removal in centrate was found to be initially slow and faster near the end of the experiment becoming similar to the rate observed using synthetic medium fig 4 this was likely due to the adaptation and subsequent shift of the microbial community from pnsb to psb section 3 3 after inoculation the measured concentration of acetic acid was 131 11 mgl 1 as compared to the initially measured concentration of scod section 2 2 likely due to hydrolysis and fermentation processes in the centrate converting particulate substrates into soluble substrates and acetate this acetate was almost fully consumed after about 70 h 45 mgl 1 after 90 h 3 mgl 1 the low removal rates at the start of the experiment are consistent with the experiments in synthetic media likely due to microbial adaptation and community shift however in centrate the sulfide concentration increased towards the end of the experiment indicating that sulfide removal was incomplete and was instead being re released which might have been due to uptake of sulfide by viable biomass and re release due to incomplete enzymatic reactions as a consequence of lacking micro nutrients and potential biomass decay examining the centrate for micro nutrients through icp oes analysis identified a lack of manganese undetectable in solution or in the biomass at the start and end of the experiment the concentration of fe was measured at 0 62 0 14 mg fe l 1 at inoculation in the particulate phase likely due to incomplete dissolution and 0 58 0 09 mg fe l 1 in the particulate phase at the end of the experiment iron was added to enable the enzymatic cascade of sulfide oxidation which is dependent on fe and mn grimm et al 2008 hensen et al 2006 the lack of manganese was believed to be a plausible cause for the incomplete sulfide oxidation as in the previous experiments the ph progressively increased from 8 9 to 9 4 in addition to sulfide average removal rate 1 5 0 4 mg s lh 1 the ppb removed 0 5 0 3 mg c lh 1 inorganic carbon 0 17 0 17 mg n lh 1 inorganic nitrogen and 0 04 0 02 mg p lh 1 inorganic phosphorus in centrate the high variability in inorganic nitrogen removal could have been due to a relatively high initial inorganic nitrogen concentration as compared to that in the synthetic medium the average removal of inorganic carbon was lower than expected which could also have been due to a high initial concentration of inorganic carbon in the centrate and due to a low number of replicates the ratio of scod n premoved with tests on centrate was observed to be 100 9 3 which is lower than that in the synthetic medium experiments this removal of p was similar to reported values for logarithmic growth hülsen et al 2014 whereas the removal of n was lower than previously reported hülsen et al 2014 plausibly due to the incomplete oxidation of sulfide 3 3 sulfide exposure shifts the microbial community from pnsb to psb an initial slow sulfide removal rate followed by a higher rate subsequently figs 3 and 4 was attributed to microbial community changes specifically the analysis showed that communities were mainly shifting towards an increasing abundance of species of the chromatiaceae family fig 5 the relative abundance of chromatiaceae at the end of the experiments with low irradiation and synthetic medium was 45 whereas initially it was 16 4 under the high irradiation regime it was found that chromatiaceae accounted for 26 8 as compared to in the inoculum where its abundance was 0 1 also in the experiment with centrate as nutrient source chromatiaceae were most abundant at the end of the experiment with 20 5 as compared to 14 3 in the inoculum here the increase in psb is less than in the other experiments likely due to the high initial acetate concentration in the centrate which might have favoured photoheterotrophic growth of pnsb the results confirm that mostly psb performed the sulfide oxidation with the most abundant identifiable chromatiaceae species in all experiments being allochromatium sp this particular genus has been previously reported to withstand up to 300 mg s l 1 sulfide before notable inhibition brune 1989 other families typically classified as pnsb were also identified but with much lower abundance at the end of the experiment than in the inoculum pnsb containing families such as bradyrhizobiaceae rhodobactereaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were found with rhodobactereaceae and bradyrhizobiaceae being generally more abundant these organisms have been reported to be more abundant in the treatment of waters with organic electron donors predominantly utilising heterotrophic pathways hülsen et al 2016a b additional results for the second experiment with synthetic medium at low irradiance are also available and consistent figure s2 supplementary material 3 4 sulfide removal model successfully estimated kinetic parameters and yield the data from the batch experiments were used to estimate biological parameters of the photoautotrophic sulfide oxidation fig 6 fig 6a shows the model fitted to the data from the low irradiance experiment with synthetic medium and fig 6c shows the fit to the high irradiance data according to the methods described in section 2 6 1 another set of data from a separate low irradiance experiment was used to validate the estimated rates by inserting the identified rates into the model and comparing model predictions with experimental measurements for the low irradiance case fig 6b the model was simulated with the respective initial conditions and the identified parameters the model results were observed to be within the 95 confidence of the data representing a good fit and meaningful estimations for the parameters the 95 uncertainty in the parameter values in table 1 also indicated that the parameter values were significant i e values were significantly different from zero parameter independence was assessed via the correlation matrixes all correlation coefficients for the low irradiance case were less than 0 8 and commonly less than 0 3 for the high irradiance case only k 0 and k 2 were correlated with a coefficient of 0 98 correlation matrixes are provided in the supplementary information tables s2 and s3 for the low irradiance case the rates were estimated with sufficient confidence however in the high irradiance case the large uncertainty in k 1 may have been due to data variability and the estimation being without weighting with standard deviations because of fewer measurement replicates generally all rates were increased with higher irradiation which can be seen in the time series data in fig 6 as well specifically k 0 and k 3 at high irradiance are double the respective values at low irradiance and rates k 1 and k 2 at high irradiance increased 4 8 and 6 3 fold in comparison to the respective rates at low irradiance however this 4 8 fold increase of k 1 may not be so meaningful due to the large confidence interval for k 1 at high irradiance mostly due to less data being available for the estimation of the high irradiance parameters the biomass yield with y pb net 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 is comparatively high for an autotrophic process as a yield of y pb a 0 42 mg cod mg cod 1 was previously estimated for the autotrophic growth of ppb puyol et al 2017 however this yield in our study is still less than the biomass yield for relevant heterotrophic processes y pb ph 1 13 mg cod mg cod 1 puyol et al 2017 the model was used to estimate three biomass specific rates and the biomass yield for the autotrophic biomass the experimental data was sufficient for the estimation of these parameters however the half saturation constants for the autotrophic biomass could not be estimated due to high parameter correlation and a lack of data around the time when limitation could have occurred when concentration approaches 0 other than the model parameters associated with the autotrophic biomass parameters associated with the heterotrophic biomass were set as constants in the estimation this was due to the heterotrophic biomass not being the focus of investigation also the microbial community shifted towards autotrophic biomass during the experiment therefore estimating model parameters for the heterotrophic biomass is less relevant the assumption of a constant biomass yield regardless of the process rate seems to be valid as the kinetic parameters were identifiable for the case with higher irradiation and the pcod concentration was estimated reasonably well however the measured values after 100 h were larger than the model estimation 4 discussion 4 1 comparing ppb with other phototrophic sulfide removal systems the presented results show that a mixed ppb culture is capable of removing dissolved sulfide the removal performance increased with increasing irradiance section 3 1 the average volumetric removal rates in the low 0 004 g cod lh 1 and the high irradiance case 0 006 g cod lh 1 were relatively small compared to average removal in photoheterotrophic growth mode 0 07 g cod lh 1 hülsen et al 2014 this might have been due to a low initial biomass concentration in the experiments and the suspended growth biomass specific rates for low and high irradiance were estimated at 0 085 g s g vs h 1 and 0 2 g s g vs h 1 respectively using a cod vs ratio of 1 7 section 3 4 previously gsb phototrophic organisms similar to ppb have been studied for sulfide removal from gaseous and liquid waste streams similar to the metabolism of the autotrophic ppb gsb use co2 and h2s for biomass growth in contrast to ppb that absorb ir light zuber and cogdell 1995 gsb contain bacteriochlorophylls with absorption peaks in the visible spectrum blankenship et al 1995 many studies mainly focused on using c limicola in pure culture for the removal of sulfide from synthetic medium henshaw and zhu 2001 kim et al 1992 syed and henshaw 2003 or for the removal of sulfide from wastewater mainly for odour control purposes syed and henshaw 2005 takashima et al 2000 hurse and keller 2004 in these studies the bacteria grew in biofilms rather than suspended and residual organic compounds in the wastewater could have promoted heterotrophic growth high volumetric removal rates were found utilising a biofilm and mixotrophic growth modes the volumetric removal ranged from 286 to 1451 mg s lh 1 where rates were negatively correlated to the reactor volumes and positively correlated to irradiance suggesting that small reactor volumes facilitate high sulfide removal due to increased irradiance and biomass concentration in the biofilm syed and henshaw 2005 2003 henshaw and zhu 2001 syed et al 2006 the volumetric rates observed in our study seemed to be lower however assuming a biomass concentration of 3 g vs l 1 the volumetric rates would have been comparable ranging from 255 to 599 mg s lh 1 at low and high irradiance this biomass concentration has previously been achieved in ppb systems hülsen et al 2018 2016 in contrast to pure cultures mixed cultures dominated by gsb removed sulfide in a range of 0 5 3 3 mg s lh 1 kobayashi et al 1983 hurse and keller 2004 garcia et al 2017 syed et al 2006 which is similar to the volumetric sulfide removal found in our study 1 79 2 9 mg s lh 1 and might also be due to lower biomass concentrations section 3 1 similar to our observations section 3 3 garcia et al 2017 and quiroz et al 2018 found an increase in psb particularly chromatiaceae in a mixed culture community with pnsb removing sulfide as well as acetate in mixotrophic growth conditions even though sulfide loadings in their studies were low in all reported systems the removal rates for gsb differed widely depending on the system and the biomass content in the system syed et al 2006 mostly continuous sulfide removal was studied and often the biomass concentration was not accounted for this is likely due to the emphasis on reducing odour emissions from wastewater instead of processing of gas streams for h2s removal in contrast with process engineering applications transport limitations of substrate to the biofilm saturation of sulfide in the bulk liquid phase different growth kinetics of different bacteria and light attenuation due to biofilm formation are all important for the process performance 4 2 process modelling and scale estimation the process model section 3 4 identified the multi step sulfide oxidation with intermediate substrate accumulation and consumption as rate limiting steps sulfide was oxidised more rapidly to intracellular elemental sulfur than to thiosulfate k 0 k 2 the subsequent oxidation of intracellular elemental sulfur to sulfate occurred rapidly as long as trace elements were supplied implying that the limiting step in this reaction is the sulfide oxidation to intracellular elemental sulfur the principal sulfide removal rate k 0 estimated here was 6 25 fold higher than previously estimated puyol et al 2017 which might be due to the modelling approach we used splitting the mixed culture into autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass by doing this we were able to perform a more accurate rate estimation for the specific biomass gemerden 1984 reported specific growth rates for allochromatium vinosum averaging at μ 0 098 h 1 with a maximum of 70 wm 2 irradiance this rate was estimated based on monod kinetics including inhibition haldane equation on a molar basis converting this rate to a cod basis with m pb 192 g cod mol 1 the molecular mass of biomass batstone et al 2002a the average growth rate estimated by gemerden 1984 is μ 0 294 h 1 the growth rate estimated in this study the product of k 0 and the yield y pb net was 0 086 h 1 and 0 172 h 1 for low and high irradiance respectively this suggests that at low irradiance the rate was about 29 and at high irradiance the rate was about 58 of the reported value other than that the increased irradiance increased the rate of sulfide oxidation to thiosulfate this might have been due to an increased production of adenosine tri phosphate atp niederman 2017 which in turn might have accelerated cellular processes however due to the regulation of light harvesting complexes and less expression of light harvesting complexes at higher irradiation cogdell et al 2006 a further increase in irradiation might not scale linearly with the removal rates in comparison to a single step process model this multi step model accounted for intermediates accumulation suggesting that biomass likely continues to accumulate after sulfide depletion due to consumption of intermediates in a full scale system sufficient biomass is likely to accumulate ensuring continuous sulfide removal as long as light is supplied the model and the estimated parameters specifically the kinetics for sulfide oxidation k 0 has been used for the prediction and scaling of a practical application of the process the process could treat 1 nm3 biogas per day containing 2000 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 or 10 nm3 sour gas per day containing 200 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 in a 10l reactor assuming no limitation due to gas liquid mass transfer processes e g highly turbulent systems micro bubbles and 12 h per day available irradiance at least 27 wm 2 a residual liquid concentration of 0 1 mg s l 1 sulfide was assumed acceptable where in equilibrium the corresponding gas phase concentration would be 30 ppmv sander 2015 the required biomass concentration for the process would be 0 5 g cod l 1 0 3 g vs l 1 with cod vs ratio 1 7 this biomass concentration was observed in this study and is therefore achievable at 3 g vs l 1 biomass concentration the system could treat 10 nm3 biogas 2000 ppmv h2s 40 vol co2 per day in a 10l reactor in either case the treatable gas could be doubled at double the irradiance due to the increased biomass specific sulfide removal rate which is more likely under sun light conditions a scaled up system is reliant on the gas liquid mass transfer of h2s into the liquid phase in case the biomass specific sulfide uptake rate is higher than the gas liquid mass transfer rate the mass transfer will be the limiting step depending on the effectiveness of the mass transfer the concentration of available sulfide could be limiting to the biomass uptake the relevant half saturation concentration for a scaled up sour gas treatment application is k s s i s associated with sulfide uptake other half saturation constants are less relevant the sulfide affinity which is directly associated with the half saturation constant was reported as 0 224 mg s l 1 for allochromatium vinosum dsm 185 gemerden 1984 the half saturation used here was more conservative at about double the reported value k s 0 5 mg s l 1 used 4 3 process limitations centrate as a low cost source of the macro nutrients nh4 n and po4 p is readily available at the anaerobic digestion facilities where biogas desulfurisation is required the centrate used in the presented research proved to be an adequate source of macro nutrients for the photoautotrophic growth and sulfide removal by ppb even though the observed sulfide oxidation in centrate was incomplete section 3 2 however the addition of fe and mn might have been required centrate has been applied successfully as a source of macro nutrients in a number of photoautotrophic applications growing microalgae however growth has typically been lower in centrate than in a synthetic medium due to undesirable nutrient ratios erkelens et al 2014 del mar morales amaral et al 2015 uggetti et al 2014 posadas et al 2013 bahr et al 2013 found that using diluted digester centrate in a continuous sulfide removal process using a consortium of microalgae the biomass concentration was decreased in comparison to a synthetic medium and attributed this to a decrease in gas liquid mass transfer in centrate affecting overall growth sulfide removal however was found to be consistent indicating that the centrate was a suitable nutrient source for sulfide removal a potential limitation of digester centrate as nutrient source is the colour and the turbidity of the centrate coloured components absorb radiation and could decrease the available irradiance for ppb growth the absorption of digester centrate has been reported to be strong in the lower half of the visible spectrum 475 800 nm and less in the upper half and this was dependant on the origin of the centrate and the conditions of digestion marcilhac et al 2014 however only the absorption of ir radiation is of interest for ppb other than colour particulate turbidity can decrease light penetration akhiar et al 2017 which is partially avoidable by pre treatment of the centrate such as by settling centrifugation or even micro filtration tait et al 2013 4 4 process benefits the rate of sulfide removal was not dependant on the concentration of inorganic carbon present in the medium however the inorganic carbon was supplied in excess in all experiments so that carbon limitation did not occur the carbon limitation is less relevant for a scaled sour gas processing system as the sour gas commonly contains a much higher percentage of co2 as compared to h2s also a high concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is expected with centrate as nutrient source the growth at a high ph is beneficial for the scaled process application with gas liquid mass transfer because gaseous h2s dissolves more efficiently in a higher ph liquid the system is robust enough to remove sulfide and accumulate biomass even under less favourable conditions for photoautotrophs in the presence of organic electron donors in a scaled application using centrate as a nutrient source acetate will likely be consumed rapidly with enough residual inorganic nitrogen inorganic phosphorus and inorganic carbon remaining to facilitate the sulfide removal so there would be minimal need for additional centrate it is expected that photoautotrophic organisms would dominate the microbial community as evidenced by the microbial community analysis at the end of the centrate experiments a continuous influx of bacteria from the centrate might disturb the microbial community in a continuous biogas desulfurisation process however in this study we found that the community shifted mostly to psb even with the non pretreated centrate as nutrient source irradiation with ir as energy source and exclusion of uv vis light likely excludes growth of other photoautotrophic organisms hülsen et al 2014 irradiating a full scale process with ir and providing sulfide as well as inorganic carbon with low concentrations of organic electron donors in the centrate the microbial community is expected to be relatively stable with on going operation the low and high irradiation experiments section 3 1 are indicative of a process application with sunlight as energy source which would make the application more cost effective however only the ir fraction of sunlight would be important for the process reported to be about 40 of the irradiation at sea level barolet et al 2016 and estimated at a value of about 80 100 w m 2 about 50 of this irradiation is estimated to reach the process liquid after applying a uv vis absorbing filter and accounting for the absorption of a typical perspex reactor with 15 mm wall thickness the resulting value could therefore be similar to the irradiance applied in the high irradiance experiment uyar et al 2007 found that the hydrogen production of r sphaeroides a member of the pnsb was inhibited at an irradiance of 270 w m 2 and above indicating the occurrence of photo inhibition compared to the estimated irradiance under natural sun light conditions the proposed sulfide removal process would unlikely suffer from photo inhibition the goal of the process is to produce desulfurised sour gas and an additional benefit is the production of biomass ppb biomass can be a source of protein and has been used in fish feed replacing fish meal delamare deboutteville et al 2019 in this way the biomass is a high value product besides the desulfurised gas resulting from the process commercial desulfurisation processes with added value generation produce elemental sulfur as a side product valued at about 80 usd per tonne chauhan 2016 in contrast the value of ppb biomass and other single cell protein biomass has been estimated at 10 14 usd per kg protein dry mass replacing fish meal and 1 1 usd per kg protein dry mass replacing soybean meal matassa et al 2016 the autotrophic process requires roughly 400 nm3 biogas 2000 ppmv h2s and 40 vol co2 to produce 1 kg vs ppb biomass the large amount of gas required is due to the low concentration of h2s practical application of the process would be in a dedicated gas fed bioreactor with sulfide removed to sulfate by oxidation as well as removal of co2 centrate or media would be continuously fed in the liquid stream harvesting a relatively pure biomass product for subsequent use this requires a number of future development steps including optimising reactor design to achieve optimal gas liquid transfer and irradiance and optimising further energy transfer in a bubble column where the irradiation could interact with this polydisperse media the high value of the biomass product ability to obtain a relatively pure gas stream and widespread availability of high sulfide gas streams mean that the process concept would have broad future application potential to desulfurise sour gas or biogas while producing a valuable biomass product 5 conclusion ppb removed sulfide autotrophically at a maximum rate of 1 79 0 16 mg s lh 1 at 27 wm 2 infra red irradiation in batch tests formation of intermediates particularly thiosulfate and elemental sulfur was an important mechanism with particularly sulfide to thiosulfate being a rate limiting step as determined by model based analysis net biomass yield was estimated at y pb 0 86 0 05 mg cod mg cod 1 sulfide oxidation was accompanied by a shift from heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass mostly chromatiaceae allochromatium sp increasing irradiance to 56 wm 2 doubled all relative rates removal from k 0 0 100 0 014 h 1 0 085 g s g vs h 1 at 27 wm 2 to 0 235 0 009 h 1 0 200 g s g vs h 1 at 56 wm 2 digester centrate was an effective growth media with similar removal rates to synthetic media as long as micro nutrients specifically fe and mn were supplied because these elements were thought to be limiting the presented research identifies that biological single step anaerobic desulfurisation can be applied for
