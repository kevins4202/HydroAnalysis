21725,the drag and added mass coefficients of a flexible pipe undergoing vortex induced vibration viv in an oscillatory flow are investigated experimentally with maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 7 9 and keulegan carpenter kc numbers ranging from 10 to 178 the strain responses are measured by fiber bragg grating sensors by using displacement reconstruction and inverse analysis methods displacement response and hydrodynamic force are identified then through least square method drag and added mass coefficients are extracted the results show that drag coefficient varies with both the maximum reduced velocity and kc number it is stable in cases with large kc numbers but significantly amplified in the cases of small kc numbers the maximum value of the drag coefficient can reach 3 5 at kc 30 a comparison with the results of a stationary cylinder without viv in an oscillatory flow demonstrates that viv can amplify the drag coefficient and reduce the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients to the stokes number based on the experimental results an empirical formula for predicting the drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow is proposed that accounts for the viv response and kc number and its applicability is effectively verified via a comparison between the predicted and experimental results keywords vortex induced vibration drag coefficient added mass

action of unsteady oscillatory flow induced by wave and vessel motions the hydrodynamic forces acting on a flexible riser in the in line il flow direction can be divided into two parts the drag force and inertia force these two force components can induce relatively large deformations and stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue life of the riser sumer and fredsøe 1988 in the global analysis of a riser the morison equation is usually used to calculate these components of the hydrodynamic force acting on the riser when using the morison formula to calculate these hydrodynamic force components the drag and added mass coefficients are two key factors that affect the predicted results in practical engineering projects values of the drag coefficient ranging from 0 6 to 1 0 and values of the added mass coefficient ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 are recommended by most design specifications api 1998 based on experiments of stationary rigid cylinders however vortices will be generated and alternately shed from the sides of flexible slender risers in an incoming flow resulting in a periodic excitation force if the frequency of the vortex induced force is close to the natural frequencies of the risers a resonance vibration will occur this is the so called vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 which has been studied in depth over the last three decades and and govardhan 2004 chang et al 2018 fang et al 2014 gopalkrishnan 1993 govardhan and williamson 2000 khalak and williamson 1999 mengmeng et al ren et al 2018 shan et al 2011 tie et al wang et al 2014a 2015a wang et al 2017b wang et al 2016 viv can significantly amplify the drag forces on flexible risers resulting in a greater drag coefficient than the recommend value chaplin et al 2005 huijsmans et al 2001 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 moreover since the hydrodynamics of risers are not well understood risers are constantly at risk of significant security threats to their safety api 1998 blevins and saunders 1977 especially as oil and gas production moves into deeper waters the structural strength of risers cannot be ensured simply by increasing their safety factors therefore investigations on the hydrodynamic coefficients of flexible risers undergoing viv in both steady and unsteady flows have become very important and have attracted increasing attention from industry and academia over the past half century investigations on the viv of risers have mainly focused on the vibration features in steady flow schewe 1983 williamson 1988 achenbach and heinecke 1981 hallam and etc 1977 and blevins and saunders 1977 first described the relationship among the flow region the hydrodynamic load and the reynolds re number through a rigid stationary cylinder towed in a tank however these studies did not consider viv and its three dimensional effects in steady flow furthermore vandiver 1985 investigated the amplification phenomenon of the drag coefficient through experiments with a flexible riser in uniform flow and found that the drag coefficient depends nonlinearly on the root mean square of the viv displacement in the cross flow cf direction y rms in contrast blevins and saunders 1977 reported that the drag coefficient depends linearly on y rms chaplin et al 2005 performed model tests and found that the mean drag coefficient is a quadratic function of the standard deviation of the viv displacement of a flexible riser in the cf direction in a stepped current song et al 2016 2017 conducted a series of experiments involving flexible pipes in uniform and linear sheared flows an inverse method was proposed to identify the hydrodynamic force as well as the drag force coefficients at each section along the axis of the pipe subsequently an improved formula was proposed to predict the mean drag coefficient which accounts for the effects of the flow velocity the viv dominant mode number and the dominant frequency however the drag and added mass coefficients in unsteady oscillatory flows have never been evaluated in oscillatory flows induced by wave and vessel motions morison et al 1950 1953 first proposed the morison formula to describe the hydrodynamic force components in the il direction the drag coefficient c d and added mass coefficient c m were preliminary found to be 1 7 and 0 4 respectively through experiments conducted on stationary rigid piles under wave actions keulegan 1958 further determined the values of c d and c m for a cylinder exposed to real waves through fourier analysis and found that these coefficients are very sensitive to the stokes parameters subsequently sarpkaya 1976 conducted a more extensive experimental investigation of the forces on cylinders in sinusoidally varying oscillatory flows by using an oscillatory u shaped tube accordingly the features of the hydrodynamic coefficients as functions of the keulegan carpenter kc number and re number as well as the relative roughness of the cylinder were systematically determined justesen 1989 andsarpkaya 2006 focused on the effects of the re number at low kc numbers through experiments on a rigid stationarycylinder exposed to an oscillatory flow although these researches provide a basic understanding on the hydrodynamic coefficients in an oscillatory flow the effects of viv in the cf direction on these coefficients in an oscillatory flow have not been considered recent studies have found that the wave induced periodic motion of a platform and the wave itself always result in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around risers the oscillatory flow induced by the pure motion of a platform can also excite viv in the sag bend region of a steel catenary riser scr wang et al 2015b 2017a this phenomenon is known as vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 vmi viv can induce serious fatigue damage in risers wang et al 2014b to improve the understanding of this phenomenon fu et al 2014 conducted a flexible riser model test in an oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a viv development process for a flexible riser in an oscillatory flow was first proposed that includes the building up lock in and dying out phases this novel viv phenomenon has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia however the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction of a flexible pipe undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow are still unknown thus further research is required to reveal the features of the drag and added mass coefficients of flexible pipes undergoing this novel type of viv in an oscillatory flow in this paper viv model tests under an equivalent oscillatory flow were conducted in an ocean basin the flexible pipe model was forced to harmonically oscillate under various combinations of amplitudes and periods with kc numbers varying between 10 and 178 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 7 9 after describing the experiments the methods of reconstructing the displacement and identifying the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction are introduced and established then the forces and coefficients of the flexible pipe model undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow are revealed compared with the results of a stationary rigid cylinder in an oscillatory flow the effects of viv on the drag and added mass coefficients of the flexible pipe are further studied finally an empirical drag coefficient prediction formula which is feasible for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow is proposed based on the experimental results 2 experimental setup 2 1 test apparatus the experiments were performed in the ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university the whole experimental setup primarily contains two horizontal tracks two vertical tracks and the flexible pipe model the setup was installed under the bottom of the carriage as shown in fig 1 the vertical tracks and horizontal tracks were driven by servo motors as illustrated in fig 2 the details of the connection frame on both ends of the experimental apparatus are shown in fig 3 the pipe model was connected to a force sensor through a universal joint and the force transducer was connected to a tensioner which was fixed on the side support a pretension force of 500 n was applied to the flexible pipe through the tensioner to avoid perturbations caused by the movement of the side supports two endplates were installed at the ends of the test model the flexible pipe model was constructed with a polypropylene random ppr pipe on the exterior and a copper cable within silicone gel was placed between the different layers to avoid relative slippage the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the 1st and 2nd order eigen frequencies of the flexible pipe in still water are 2 68 hz and 5 46 hz respectively the added mass coefficient is assumed to be 1 0 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed along the surface of the model to measure the strain responses in both the cf direction and the il direction the fbg groups in the cf and il directions cf a cf c il b and il d have 7 and 11 measurement points along the pipe respectively as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 4 the details of the sensor arrangement are given in table 2 2 2 test arrangement to simulate an oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motion under various combinations of amplitudes and periods in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as 1 x t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are the oscillation amplitude and period respectively the main parameters for drag and added mass coefficients are the kc number re number and stokes number β sarpkaya 1976 which can be expressed as 3 k c 2 π a m d 4 re 2 π a m d t υ 5 β re k c d 2 υ t where υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient υ 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 in addition the drag and added mass coefficient are related to the viv response the kc number and maximum reduced velocity vr are considered the two main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under an oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 as well as the hydrodynamic coefficient vr can be presented as 6 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 is used here considering that the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all test cases notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation period will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity from the definitions of the four parameters in eqs 3 6 conflicts are evident between the maximum reduced velocity vr and stokes number β to study the performance of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the flexible pipe undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow the test cases were divided into three groups according to their maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 3 each test group maintained the same maximum reduced velocities and had test cases with kc numbers ranging from approximately 10 to 178 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for the convenience of description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one of the ending points of the pipe and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the pipe the il direction and the cf direction respectively as shown in fig 2 at the start of the experiment a constant pretension of 500 n was exerted at the ends of the flexible pipe however this pretension periodically varied with the oscillation of the pipe thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain caused by pretension the varying axial strain caused by varying tension and the bending strain caused by vortex induced vibration therefore the pure viv strain at position z ε cf z t can be calculated by 7 ε c f z t ε c f a z t ε c f c z t 2 where ε cf a z t and ε cf c z t are the original strain time histories at position z sampled by the cf a and cf c measurement points respectively at the same time the bending strain ε il z t caused by the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be calculated by eq 8 8 ε i l z t ε i l b z t ε i l d z t 2 where ε il b z t and ε il d z t are the original strain time histories at position z sampled by the il b and il d measurement points respectively then a band pass filter was utilized to eliminate the higher frequency noise in the il direction and to remove corresponding higher frequency noise and effects of pendulum motion caused by forced motion in the cf direction the cutoff frequencies of the band pass filter were 0 hz and 25 hz for the il direction and 2 5f o f o is the forced oscillation frequency and 15 hz for the cf direction 3 2 displacement reconstruction according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the viv displacement response of a flexible pipe under an external load can be expressed as the sum of the modal shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values at each step taking the response in the cf direction as an example the viv displacement response y z t can be expressed as 9 y z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement value at time t and ϕ i z is the displacement at position z in the ith modal shape based on an assumption of small deformation the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 10 κ z t 2 y z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 11 ε z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at position z in the flexible pipe model the modal shape of the displacement is sinusoidal and thus can be expressed as 12 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 10 the modal shape of the curvature is also sinusoidal after obtaining the modal shapes of the displacement and curvature the generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 11 then the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be calculated by eq 9 using the same method the displacement response of the il direction can also be obtained 3 3 inverse identification of the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients the flexible pipe model in the test is modeled as a tensioned euler bernoulli beam with negligible torsional deformation according to the governing equation of the vibration in the il direction the force can be inversely identified as 13 f z t m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f t t 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 where m is the mass per unit length in air c is the damping of the pipe c 4 π ζ m f 1 f t t is the time varying axial tension force ei is the bending stiffness f z t is the hydrodynamic force at position z at time t in the il direction 2 x z t t 2 and x z t t represent the acceleration and velocity responses in the il direction respectively 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 are the second and fourth order spatial derivatives of the displacement in the il direction respectively after obtaining the displacement response the velocity and acceleration responses can be calculated by using the central difference method to compute the first and second order partial derivatives of the displacement respectively with respect to t 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 can also be calculated by using the central difference method to compute the second and fourth order partial derivatives of the displacement respectively with respect to z finally the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be identified through eq 13 according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 1953 the total force in the il direction can be decomposed into two components i e the drag force related to the square of the velocity and the inertial force proportional to the acceleration thus the total force can be expressed as 14 f z t 1 2 ρ d c d z u t x z t t u t x z t t c m z ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 where f z t represents the force predicted by the morison formula at position z at time t c d z and c m z are the drag and added mass coefficients at position z respectively ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 for convenience it is assumed that 15 c 1 z t 1 2 ρ d u t x z t t u t x z t t c 2 z t ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 then eq 14 can be simplified as 16 f z t c d z c 1 z t c m z c 2 z t the least square method is utilized to fit the drag and added mass coefficients in the il direction c d z and c m z can be obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference j 1 c d z c m z between the predicted and identified force which can be expressed as 17 c ˆ d z c ˆ m z argmin j 1 c d z c m z w h e r e j 1 c d z c m z i 1 n f z t f z t 2 where n is the sample number to minimize the difference between the identified and predicted values of the hydrodynamic force eq 18 should be satisfied as 18 j 1 c d z c m z c d z 0 j 1 c d z c m z c m z 0 transforming eq 18 into matrix form 19 h h t c d z c m z h f where 20 h c 1 z t 1 c 1 z t 2 c 1 z t n c 2 z t 1 c 2 z t 2 c 2 z t n f f z t 1 f z t 2 f z t n the drag and added mass coefficients can be expressed as 21 c d z c m z h h t 1 h f in this paper more than 20 oscillation periods are used to reconstruct the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients 3 4 time frequency analysis in an oscillatory flow the shedding frequency changes with the periodic oscillation velocity of the model which can be written as 22 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number typically st 0 2 and f st is the vortex shedding frequency under the effect of a periodically varying shedding frequency the viv characteristics in the cf direction vary with time this time varying feature has been reported to be the major difference between the viv in steady flow and that in an oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 to investigate the effects of this time varying feature on the hydrodynamic force and coefficients the wavelet transform is introduced to analyze the time frequency distribution of viv in an oscillatory flow the continuous wavelet transform equation is expressed as 23 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where wt f a τ is the coefficient of the time domain signal f t after the wavelet transform representing the frequency variation at that time scale the parameter a is the scale factor τ is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet in this paper the morlet wavelet equation is employed as the mother wavelet and this wavelet can be defined as 24 ψ t ce t 2 2 cos 5 t where c is the wavelet transform coefficient 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the flexible pipe fig 5 shows the distribution of the root mean square rms displacement and strain responses along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 as shown in fig 5 a and b the blue and red lines represent the displacement responses under kc 31 and 178 respectively the displacement responses under kc 31 in both the cf direction and the il direction are larger than those under kc 178 to verify the displacement reconstruction method the identified bending strain was recalculated based on the reconstructed displacement response through eq 10 curvature can be obtained by the second order difference of displacement response to position z then identified strain values are further calculated by eq 11 the identified bending strain is compared with the measured strain as presented in fig 5 c and d the blue solid line and red dashed line are the identified bending strains under kc 31 and 178 respectively the blue circle and red square symbols represent the corresponding measured bending strains under kc 31 and 178 respectively on the basis of fig 5 c and d the identified values are in good agreement with the measured values demonstrating the validity of the displacement reconstruction method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow fig 6 and fig 7 show the time histories of the viv displacement responses and time frequency distributions at the 4th gauge point in the cf direction for vr 6 5 under a small kc number kc 31 and a large kc number kc 178 respectively each figure contains four subplots a shows the time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated based on eq 22 b illustrates the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method proposed in section 3 2 c presents the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the intensity of the color indicates the level of concentration of the strain the blue and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequencies respectively while the black line refers to the dominant frequency d shows the time history of the modal weight p t of the displacement it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequencies f 1 and f 2 have been considered the measured time varying tension f t t assuming that the added mass coefficient c m is equal to 1 the eigen frequencies can be calculated by 25 f n t n 2 l f t t m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 as shown in fig 6 the shedding frequency varies from 0 to 3 53 hz the viv displacement amplitude is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 60d as seen from the wavelet analysis results shown in fig 6 c although the response at the 4th gauge point is dominated by the 1st natural mode higher harmonics also occur under the small kc number kc 31 meanwhile under the large kc number kc 178 as shown in fig 7 a strong amplitude modulation phenomenon appears and the viv development process is composed of three phases namely the building up lock in and dying out phases the maximum viv displacement amplitude reaches 0 54d other features such as the hysteresis of the displacement response observed under the large kc number were previously revealed by fu et al 2014 and wang et al 2014b recently through experiments with flexible pipes in uniform flow researchers song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 have found that the drag force and coefficients in the il direction are greatly affected by the viv response the significant differences in the viv responses between the small and large kc numbers may lead to different performances of the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction which requires further investigation 4 2 hydrodynamic force distributions based on the measured strains the displacement responses and hydrodynamic forces in the il direction can be calculated the processed data for vr 6 5 and kc 31 are presented in fig 8 fig 8 a presents the strain time history at the position of sensor il6 fig 8 b illustrates the displacement response which is reconstructed by the method proposed in section 3 2 fig 8 c identifies the hydrodynamic force which is computed through eq 13 in fig 8 the waveforms in the three subplots are consistent this indicates the feasibility of the hydrodynamic force identification method to some extent to further verify the proposed hydrodynamic force identification method a finite element model of the flexible pipe with a pretension force is built with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 by using ansys 12 5 the strain response in the il direction is calculated by applying the same time history of the identified hydrodynamic force to the flexible pipe fig 9 presents the time histories of the measured and calculated strains with vr 6 5 for kc 31 and 178 at the position of the 6th gauge point in the il direction the blue and red lines represent the measured and calculated strains respectively fig 10 and fig 11 show the distributions of the measured and calculated strains relative error between two values along flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 for kc 31 and 178 respectively the relative error e 1 is defined as eq 26 the calculated strain values are in good agreement with the measured values as shown in figs 9 and 10 a and fig 11 a the relative errors in the case of kc 31 and 178 under vr 6 5 are around 5 as illustrated in figs 10 b and fig 11 b this consistency demonstrates the validity of this hydrodynamic identification method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow 26 e 1 ε m ε c ε m 100 where ε m and ε c are the root mean square values of measured and calculated strain respectively using the hydrodynamic force identification method proposed in section 3 3 the force in each case with a different reduced velocity and a different kc number can be obtained fig 12 presents the hydrodynamic forces on the flexible pipe in the time space domain and the time histories of the force at the 6th gauge point in the il direction for two cases as shown in fig 12 a the hydrodynamic forces along the length of the flexible pipe vary synchronously and periodically under both small and large kc numbers a high frequency component of the hydrodynamic force appears when the forced oscillation velocity reaches the maximum value these force components can be attributed to the high harmonic response performance in the cf direction as shown in fig 6 c the relatively high harmonic vibration in the cf direction may be caused by different shedding patterns denoted 2 t fu et al 2014 williamson and jauvtis 2004 therefore these patterns will also lead to a correspondingly high frequency hydrodynamic force component and response in the il direction in an oscillatory flow each half period of the oscillation motion contains the acceleration and deceleration stages the asymmetry of the hydrodynamic force in these two stages can be clearly seen from fig 12 b which is similar to the hysteresis of the viv response reported by fu et al 2014 to reveal the relationship between the force in the il direction and the response in the cf direction the hilbert transform is used to obtain the amplitude envelope of the viv displacement response as shown in fig 13 then it is easy to analyze the relationship among y d f and the instant reduced velocity u f 1 d as shown in fig 14 the red solid lines and green dotted lines represent the acceleration and deceleration stages respectively it is clear that the hysteresis of the viv response and the asymmetry of the force coexist at all kc numbers the maximum amplitude differences in the viv response are approximately 0 15d for both kc 31 and 178 the viv response in the acceleration stage is smaller than that in the deceleration stage while this behavior is the opposite for the hydrodynamic force in the two stages based on the experimental results for a flexible pipe in steady flow a larger viv response will lead to a larger drag force chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 however the hydrodynamic force and viv response during the half cycle of the oscillation motion are not consistent with these beliefs these unexpected results may be closely related to the interaction between the vortex shedding derived forth and the backward motion of the flexible pipe fig 15 presents the sketch of this interaction in the deceleration phase the pipe drives the attached water to the right when pipe accelerates back to the left it will encounter former water body moving to the right this makes the effective velocity in acceleration phase faster than that in deceleration phase resulting in corresponding former hydrodynamic force is larger than the latter one this is called wake effects williamson 2006 more insightful experiments and cfd simulations will be carried out in the near future to further investigate this interesting phenomenon 4 3 drag and added mass coefficients after obtaining the viv response and hydrodynamic force in the il direction the drag coefficient c d z and added mass coefficient c m z at each node can be calculated by using the method proposed in section 3 3 fig 16 presents the hydrodynamic coefficients along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 under different kc numbers this figure shows that the distribution of drag coefficients is relatively constant along the spanwise direction the maximum drag coefficient reaches 3 15 and 2 3 for kc 31 and 178 respectively the values of c d for kc 31 are larger than those for kc 178 which is consistent with the displacement response shown in fig 5 b this indicates that the drag coefficient is magnified in the case of the small kc number compared with the distribution of the drag coefficient the added mass coefficients vary greatly under a small kc number the maximum added mass coefficient is approximately 2 5 at z 0 35 m while the value of c m is approximately 0 7 at the center of the flexible pipe for kc 178 the maximum added mass coefficient is approximately 1 2 to check the reliability of these results the drag and added mass coefficients at each node are used to calculate the corresponding hydrodynamic forces fig 17 illustrates the measured and calculated hydrodynamic forces at approximately the 1st z 0 35 m and 6th z 2 0 m gauge points for kc 31 and 178 fig 18 and fig 19 present the distributions of the measured and calculated forces relative error between two force values along the flexible pipe in the case of kc 31 and 178 under vr 6 5 respectively the similar relative error e 2 is also defined and expressed as eq 27 the measured and calculated forces are in good agreement in the cases with different kc numbers these indicate that the identified hydrodynamic coefficients are correct 27 e 2 f m f c f m 100 where f m is the root mean square value of identified force derived from measured strain through eq 13 f c is the root mean square value of force recalculated by using identified hydrodynamic force coefficients through eq 14 to further reveal the effects of the aforementioned key parameters on the hydrodynamic coefficients in the il direction the mean coefficients are introduced here the mean drag coefficient c d and mean added mass coefficient c m are defined as 28 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z 29 c m 1 l 0 l c m z d z where l is the length of the flexible pipe model upon averaging the hydrodynamic coefficients through eqs 28 and 29 the mean drag and added mass coefficients under different kc numbers can be summarized fig 20 shows the distributions of drag coefficients versus kc numbers under different reduced velocities an obvious phenomenon is that the drag coefficients are significantly amplified in the cases with a small kc number the maximum value of the drag coefficient can reach up to 3 5 which is approximately 3 times the typical value of c d 1 2 for a stationary cylinder in uniform flow as the kc number increases the drag coefficients gradually stabilize at 1 45 1 85 and 1 7 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively such large drag coefficients at small kc numbers should be taken more into consideration in practical projects to further reveal the effects of viv on the drag coefficient the results for a rigid cylinder without viv from published studies keulegan 1958 sarpkaya 1976 are collected and plotted as shown by the dashed lines in figs 20 and 21 it should be noted that keulegan 1958 found that the drag coefficient is very sensitive to the stokes number β hence the parameters of the collected results are the same as our experiments for each case compared with the collected results the drag coefficients of the flexible pipe undergoing viv are much larger this indicates that viv can significantly amplify the drag coefficient in an oscillatory flow this is consistent with the results reported by vandiver 1985 according to experiments of a flexible pipe in steady flow in the case of a large kc number the stable values of the drag coefficient do not increase with the maximum reduced velocity although the viv amplitudes at vr 7 9 are slightly larger than those at vr 6 5 for kc 60 the drag coefficients in the former cases are smaller than those in the latter cases this phenomenon can be attributed to the effects of the stokes number in our experiments the value of β at vr 7 9 is larger than that at vr 6 5 under the same kc numbers the expected drag coefficients for the flexible pipe are in good agreement insomuch that larger values of β should lead to smaller drag coefficients as predicted by sarpkaya 1976 although the presence of viv also affects the drag coefficient β plays the dominant role in the case of the large kc number in which the viv response amplitudes are close moreover in the cases with vr 6 5 and 7 9 at kc 60 the values of β change with the kc numbers in our experiments the viv amplitudes and drag coefficients of the flexible pipe remain almost constant while an obvious downward trend in the drag coefficient is observed in the collected results in other words the effects of the stokes number on the drag coefficients of a flexible pipe undergoing viv are not observed this means that the occurrence of viv can reduce the sensitivity of the drag coefficient to β to some extent the reason for the abovementioned magnification of the drag coefficients under a small kc number seems to be relatively complex in the cases with vr 4 0 and 6 5 the viv amplitude increases and then decreases with the kc number as shown in fig 22 the kc number at the inflection point is approximately 25 the viv response for a small kc number close to 20 is more obvious than that for a large kc number the maximum viv displacement response is about 0 36d at kc 20 while the response gradually falls and stabilizes at 0 12d with an increasing kc number at the same time the drag coefficients reduce to 1 45 from approximately 2 5 when kc 20 it seems that the amplification of the drag coefficients at around kc 20 can be attributed to the viv displacement response obvious viv responses appear at a kc number of approximately 20 and the larger response in the cf direction causes the incident area to increase leading to greater drag coefficients however it is difficult to explain the amplification phenomenon of the drag coefficients using the same reasons for the cases with kc 20 for vr 4 0 although the viv displacement amplitude is not very obvious the maximum drag coefficients are observed in this region moreover as the reduced velocity increases to 6 5 and 7 9 the decreasing tendency of the maximum viv displacement response vanishes under vr 7 9 the maximum values of y rms d remain stable at approximately 0 3 d the decreasing trend of the viv amplitude with the kc number disappears in the cases with vr 7 9 this downward trend still remains in the drag coefficient distribution this means that the amplification of drag coefficients is not dependent only on the viv response amplitude to further investigate the reasons for this phenomenon in detail the results of a rigid cylinder without viv for β 497 similar to the value of β under the small kc number in our experiments reported by sarpkaya 1976 are shown in fig 20 the magnification phenomenon under a small kc number and the decreasing trend of the drag coefficient with the kc number can similarly be found in these results through observations of the flow field williamson 2006 revealed that the magnification of the drag coefficient under a small kc number can be attributed to the wake effect he found that the wake could flow back toward the cylinder under a small kc number and cause the effective velocity to become larger than the actual oscillation velocity as the kc number increases the period of oscillation motion becomes longer and the wake effect consequently weakens in summary two reasons can explain the significant magnification of the drag coefficient at a small kc number the effects of the wake amplify the drag coefficients and the occurrence of viv further intensifies this magnification in addition the drag coefficient distributes discretely with the kc number under low reduced velocities vr 4 0 and 6 5 in the cases with small kc numbers while the scatter disappears gradually as the maximum reduced velocity increases to 7 9 this can be attributed to the viv response there are some similarities in the scatter features between the drag coefficients and the viv response as seen in figs 20 and 22 in the cases with small kc numbers kc 60 these scatter features can be found in the distributions of both the drag coefficient and the viv response at vr 4 0 and 6 5 while relatively aggregated distributions of the responses and coefficients are observed for vr 7 9 under larger kc numbers kc 60 the trends of the viv responses and drag coefficients under all reduced velocities are both observed to be stable therefore it can be reasonably inferred that the features of the drag coefficient distributions under different reduced velocities may depend on the corresponding viv displacement distributions fig 21 presents the variations in the added mass coefficients versus kc numbers under different reduced velocities there are no obvious differences in the added mass coefficients among the various maximum reduced velocities in the cases with small kc numbers kc 60 the distributions of the added mass coefficients are slightly discrete combined with the viv response amplitude distributions presented in fig 22 the potential reasons for this discreteness may be the more variable distributions of the viv response amplitude in the cases with large kc numbers kc 60 the added mass coefficients almost do not change with the kc numbers the values of c m stabilize at 0 75 0 75 and 0 85 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively in comparison with the collected results the added mass coefficients of the flexible pipe undergoing viv are amplified under small kc numbers the specific reason for this amplification cannot be reasonably explained more insightful experimental and cfd simulations should be conducted in future work in addition the added mass coefficients in the literature increase with the kc number this is caused by changes in the stokes number β in our experiments the stokes number changes with the kc number keulegan 1958 and sarpkaya 1976 found that the effects of β on the added mass coefficient are significant however these upward trends disappear when the flexible pipe undergoes viv this indicates that viv can also effectively reduce the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient to the stokes number 4 4 prediction of the drag and added mass coefficients fig 21 shows that the distributions of the added mass coefficient are relatively stable with the kc number and are not related to the maximum reduced velocity vr therefore a constant value of c m can be selected as a recommended value in practical design compared with the results derived from our model test the recommended values of the added mass coefficient ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 api 1998 are feasible however the added mass coefficients at high reynolds numbers and high stokes numbers need to be investigated further different from the added mass coefficient the drag coefficient changes with the kc number and vr therefore a method for predicting the drag coefficient should be developed for engineering applications the relationships between the mean drag coefficients and viv responses of a bare pipe in steady flow have been previously studied blevins and saunders 1977 chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 vandiver 1985 proposed a formula to calculate the mean drag coefficient for a flexible smooth pipe 30 c d c d 0 1 1 043 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c d0 is the drag coefficient for a rigid cylinder in steady flow usually taken to be 1 20 as previously mentioned the viv responses amplify the mean drag coefficients by broadening the incident flow area however the viv response features of a flexible pipe are very different between steady and oscillatory flows in steady flow the viv response amplitude modulation is very weak in an oscillatory flow the viv response at small kc numbers is similar to that in steady flow as shown in fig 6 while a strong amplitude modulation occurs intermittently at large kc numbers as shown in fig 7 although the viv response at small kc numbers is the same as that at large kc numbers as shown in fig 23 only the lock in phase with a greater response amplitude may lead to an effective magnification of the drag coefficients in addition the effects of the wake play an important role in amplifying the drag coefficients at small kc numbers therefore the sensitivity of the mean drag coefficients to the viv response may not be the same at different kc numbers this means that a constant value of 1 043 will not be appropriate for predicting the mean drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow for convenience the temporary parameter k is used instead of the constant value of 1 043 and the prediction formula is modified as 31 c d c d 0 1 k 2 y r m s d 0 65 to further verify the above analysis the drag coefficients calculated by using the prediction formula proposed by vandiver 1985 are presented in fig 25 compared with the measured results the predicted results are relatively small at small kc numbers and excessively conservative at large kc numbers this indicates that the value of k is greater than 1 043 at small kc numbers and less than 1 043 at large kc numbers this confirms that the above analysis is reasonable this indicates that the drag coefficient is more sensitive to the viv response at smaller kc numbers and that k is inversely proportional to the kc number to determine the relationship between k and the kc number under different maximum reduced velocities the measured drag coefficient c d corresponding viv displacement response yrms d and c d0 1 20 are substituted into eq 31 fig 24 presents the values of k versus 1 kc under different maximum reduced velocities linear relationships are clearly seen at all reduced velocities especially for large kc numbers in the cases with vr 4 and 7 9 these linear relationships slightly worsen when kc 25 and kc 23 respectively the main reasons for this phenomenon may be the unclear effects of the wake which leads to an uncertain relation between k and the kc number as shown in fig 24 the values of the parameter k are not the same under different maximum reduced velocities it indicates that k may also be affected by vr or even the stokes number β therefore after obtaining the relationships between the parameter k and various kc numbers the prediction formula for the drag coefficient is modified as 32 c d c d 0 1 j 2 v r β k c j 3 v r β 2 y r m s d 0 65 where k j 2 vr β kc j 3 vr β the values of j 2 vr β and j 3 vr β are listed in table 4 using the modified prediction formula for the drag coefficient in an oscillatory flow presented above the values of c d for each case are calculated and shown in fig 25 apart from the range shown in the gray area the present results are consistent with the measured results especially for large kc numbers the feasible and applicable ranges for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 are kc 25 kc 15 and kc 23 respectively the proposed method for predicting the drag coefficients at small kc numbers should be investigated more thoroughly in the future nevertheless compared with the prediction formula proposed by vandiver 1985 the prediction accuracy has been greatly improved this demonstrates that the proposed formula is more reasonable in an oscillatory flow although the relationship among k v r and β cannot be obtained due to the limitations of these experimental results the work in this paper is a preliminary attempt to predict the drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow to present a general drag coefficient prediction formula in an oscillatory flow additional flexible pipe experiments with different reduced velocities should be conducted in future works to establish a simple function of j 2 vr β and j 3 vr β this would be helpful for predicting the global hydrodynamic responses of risers in ocean engineering applications 5 conclusions in this paper the drag and added mass coefficients of a riser undergoing vortex induced vibration in an oscillatory flow are studied through experiments with a flexible pipe the maximum reduced velocities vr range from 4 to 7 9 and the kc numbers range from 10 to 178 the hydrodynamic force and coefficients are first revealed by using inverse and least square methods the relationships among the hydrodynamic coefficients viv response vr and kc number are further investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 similar to the viv response in the cf direction in an oscillatory flow the high frequency components and hysteresis of the hydrodynamic force are first revealed however in contrast to the viv response the force in the acceleration stage is more obvious than that in the deceleration stage 2 the occurrence of viv and the wake effects lead to a significant magnification of the drag coefficients in cases with small kc numbers the maximum values can reach 3 5 the drag coefficients vary with the maximum reduced velocities and gradually stabilize at 1 45 1 85 and 1 7 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively as the kc number increases there is no clear relationship between the added mass coefficients and maximum reduced velocity 3 compared with the results for a stationary cylinder without viv in an oscillatory flow the occurrence of viv can reduce the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients to the stokes number 4 based on the experimental results an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow that accounts for the viv response and kc number is proposed a comparison

21725,the drag and added mass coefficients of a flexible pipe undergoing vortex induced vibration viv in an oscillatory flow are investigated experimentally with maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 7 9 and keulegan carpenter kc numbers ranging from 10 to 178 the strain responses are measured by fiber bragg grating sensors by using displacement reconstruction and inverse analysis methods displacement response and hydrodynamic force are identified then through least square method drag and added mass coefficients are extracted the results show that drag coefficient varies with both the maximum reduced velocity and kc number it is stable in cases with large kc numbers but significantly amplified in the cases of small kc numbers the maximum value of the drag coefficient can reach 3 5 at kc 30 a comparison with the results of a stationary cylinder without viv in an oscillatory flow demonstrates that viv can amplify the drag coefficient and reduce the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients to the stokes number based on the experimental results an empirical formula for predicting the drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow is proposed that accounts for the viv

action of unsteady oscillatory flow induced by wave and vessel motions the hydrodynamic forces acting on a flexible riser in the in line il flow direction can be divided into two parts the drag force and inertia force these two force components can induce relatively large deformations and stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue life of the riser sumer and fredsøe 1988 in the global analysis of a riser the morison equation is usually used to calculate these components of the hydrodynamic force acting on the riser when using the morison formula to calculate these hydrodynamic force components the drag and added mass coefficients are two key factors that affect the predicted results in practical engineering projects values of the drag coefficient ranging from 0 6 to 1 0 and values of the added mass coefficient ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 are recommended by most design specifications api 1998 based on experiments of stationary rigid cylinders however vortices will be generated and alternately shed from the sides of flexible slender risers in an incoming flow resulting in a periodic excitation force if the frequency of the vortex induced force is close to the natural frequencies of the risers a resonance vibration will occur this is the so called vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 which has been studied in depth over the last three decades and and govardhan 2004 chang et al 2018 fang et al 2014 gopalkrishnan 1993 govardhan and williamson 2000 khalak and williamson 1999 mengmeng et al ren et al 2018 shan et al 2011 tie et al wang et al 2014a 2015a wang et al 2017b wang et al 2016 viv can significantly amplify the drag forces on flexible risers resulting in a greater drag coefficient than the recommend value chaplin et al 2005 huijsmans et al 2001 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 moreover since the hydrodynamics of risers are not well understood risers are constantly at risk of significant security threats to their safety api 1998 blevins and saunders 1977 especially as oil and gas production moves into deeper waters the structural strength of risers cannot be ensured simply by increasing their safety factors therefore investigations on the hydrodynamic coefficients of flexible risers undergoing viv in both steady and unsteady flows have become very important and have attracted increasing attention from industry and academia over the past half century investigations on the viv of risers have mainly focused on the vibration features in steady flow schewe 1983 williamson 1988 achenbach and heinecke 1981 hallam and etc 1977 and blevins and saunders 1977 first described the relationship among the flow region the hydrodynamic load and the reynolds re number through a rigid stationary cylinder towed in a tank however these studies did not consider viv and its three dimensional effects in steady flow furthermore vandiver 1985 investigated the amplification phenomenon of the drag coefficient through experiments with a flexible riser in uniform flow and found that the drag coefficient depends nonlinearly on the root mean square of the viv displacement in the cross flow cf direction y rms in contrast blevins and saunders 1977 reported that the drag coefficient depends linearly on y rms chaplin et al 2005 performed model tests and found that the mean drag coefficient is a quadratic function of the standard deviation of the viv displacement of a flexible riser in the cf direction in a stepped current song et al 2016 2017 conducted a series of experiments involving flexible pipes in uniform and linear sheared flows an inverse method was proposed to identify the hydrodynamic force as well as the drag force coefficients at each section along the axis of the pipe subsequently an improved formula was proposed to predict the mean drag coefficient which accounts for the effects of the flow velocity the viv dominant mode number and the dominant frequency however the drag and added mass coefficients in unsteady oscillatory flows have never been evaluated in oscillatory flows induced by wave and vessel motions morison et al 1950 1953 first proposed the morison formula to describe the hydrodynamic force components in the il direction the drag coefficient c d and added mass coefficient c m were preliminary found to be 1 7 and 0 4 respectively through experiments conducted on stationary rigid piles under wave actions keulegan 1958 further determined the values of c d and c m for a cylinder exposed to real waves through fourier analysis and found that these coefficients are very sensitive to the stokes parameters subsequently sarpkaya 1976 conducted a more extensive experimental investigation of the forces on cylinders in sinusoidally varying oscillatory flows by using an oscillatory u shaped tube accordingly the features of the hydrodynamic coefficients as functions of the keulegan carpenter kc number and re number as well as the relative roughness of the cylinder were systematically determined justesen 1989 andsarpkaya 2006 focused on the effects of the re number at low kc numbers through experiments on a rigid stationarycylinder exposed to an oscillatory flow although these researches provide a basic understanding on the hydrodynamic coefficients in an oscillatory flow the effects of viv in the cf direction on these coefficients in an oscillatory flow have not been considered recent studies have found that the wave induced periodic motion of a platform and the wave itself always result in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around risers the oscillatory flow induced by the pure motion of a platform can also excite viv in the sag bend region of a steel catenary riser scr wang et al 2015b 2017a this phenomenon is known as vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 vmi viv can induce serious fatigue damage in risers wang et al 2014b to improve the understanding of this phenomenon fu et al 2014 conducted a flexible riser model test in an oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a viv development process for a flexible riser in an oscillatory flow was first proposed that includes the building up lock in and dying out phases this novel viv phenomenon has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia however the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction of a flexible pipe undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow are still unknown thus further research is required to reveal the features of the drag and added mass coefficients of flexible pipes undergoing this novel type of viv in an oscillatory flow in this paper viv model tests under an equivalent oscillatory flow were conducted in an ocean basin the flexible pipe model was forced to harmonically oscillate under various combinations of amplitudes and periods with kc numbers varying between 10 and 178 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 7 9 after describing the experiments the methods of reconstructing the displacement and identifying the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction are introduced and established then the forces and coefficients of the flexible pipe model undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow are revealed compared with the results of a stationary rigid cylinder in an oscillatory flow the effects of viv on the drag and added mass coefficients of the flexible pipe are further studied finally an empirical drag coefficient prediction formula which is feasible for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow is proposed based on the experimental results 2 experimental setup 2 1 test apparatus the experiments were performed in the ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university the whole experimental setup primarily contains two horizontal tracks two vertical tracks and the flexible pipe model the setup was installed under the bottom of the carriage as shown in fig 1 the vertical tracks and horizontal tracks were driven by servo motors as illustrated in fig 2 the details of the connection frame on both ends of the experimental apparatus are shown in fig 3 the pipe model was connected to a force sensor through a universal joint and the force transducer was connected to a tensioner which was fixed on the side support a pretension force of 500 n was applied to the flexible pipe through the tensioner to avoid perturbations caused by the movement of the side supports two endplates were installed at the ends of the test model the flexible pipe model was constructed with a polypropylene random ppr pipe on the exterior and a copper cable within silicone gel was placed between the different layers to avoid relative slippage the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the 1st and 2nd order eigen frequencies of the flexible pipe in still water are 2 68 hz and 5 46 hz respectively the added mass coefficient is assumed to be 1 0 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed along the surface of the model to measure the strain responses in both the cf direction and the il direction the fbg groups in the cf and il directions cf a cf c il b and il d have 7 and 11 measurement points along the pipe respectively as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 4 the details of the sensor arrangement are given in table 2 2 2 test arrangement to simulate an oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motion under various combinations of amplitudes and periods in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as 1 x t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are the oscillation amplitude and period respectively the main parameters for drag and added mass coefficients are the kc number re number and stokes number β sarpkaya 1976 which can be expressed as 3 k c 2 π a m d 4 re 2 π a m d t υ 5 β re k c d 2 υ t where υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient υ 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 in addition the drag and added mass coefficient are related to the viv response the kc number and maximum reduced velocity vr are considered the two main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under an oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 as well as the hydrodynamic coefficient vr can be presented as 6 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 is used here considering that the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all test cases notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation period will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity from the definitions of the four parameters in eqs 3 6 conflicts are evident between the maximum reduced velocity vr and stokes number β to study the performance of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the flexible pipe undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow the test cases were divided into three groups according to their maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 3 each test group maintained the same maximum reduced velocities and had test cases with kc numbers ranging from approximately 10 to 178 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for the convenience of description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one of the ending points of the pipe and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the pipe the il direction and the cf direction respectively as shown in fig 2 at the start of the experiment a constant pretension of 500 n was exerted at the ends of the flexible pipe however this pretension periodically varied with the oscillation of the pipe thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain caused by pretension the varying axial strain caused by varying tension and the bending strain caused by vortex induced vibration therefore the pure viv strain at position z ε cf z t can be calculated by 7 ε c f z t ε c f a z t ε c f c z t 2 where ε cf a z t and ε cf c z t are the original strain time histories at position z sampled by the cf a and cf c measurement points respectively at the same time the bending strain ε il z t caused by the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be calculated by eq 8 8 ε i l z t ε i l b z t ε i l d z t 2 where ε il b z t and ε il d z t are the original strain time histories at position z sampled by the il b and il d measurement points respectively then a band pass filter was utilized to eliminate the higher frequency noise in the il direction and to remove corresponding higher frequency noise and effects of pendulum motion caused by forced motion in the cf direction the cutoff frequencies of the band pass filter were 0 hz and 25 hz for the il direction and 2 5f o f o is the forced oscillation frequency and 15 hz for the cf direction 3 2 displacement reconstruction according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the viv displacement response of a flexible pipe under an external load can be expressed as the sum of the modal shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values at each step taking the response in the cf direction as an example the viv displacement response y z t can be expressed as 9 y z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement value at time t and ϕ i z is the displacement at position z in the ith modal shape based on an assumption of small deformation the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 10 κ z t 2 y z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 11 ε z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at position z in the flexible pipe model the modal shape of the displacement is sinusoidal and thus can be expressed as 12 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 10 the modal shape of the curvature is also sinusoidal after obtaining the modal shapes of the displacement and curvature the generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 11 then the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be calculated by eq 9 using the same method the displacement response of the il direction can also be obtained 3 3 inverse identification of the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients the flexible pipe model in the test is modeled as a tensioned euler bernoulli beam with negligible torsional deformation according to the governing equation of the vibration in the il direction the force can be inversely identified as 13 f z t m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f t t 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 where m is the mass per unit length in air c is the damping of the pipe c 4 π ζ m f 1 f t t is the time varying axial tension force ei is the bending stiffness f z t is the hydrodynamic force at position z at time t in the il direction 2 x z t t 2 and x z t t represent the acceleration and velocity responses in the il direction respectively 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 are the second and fourth order spatial derivatives of the displacement in the il direction respectively after obtaining the displacement response the velocity and acceleration responses can be calculated by using the central difference method to compute the first and second order partial derivatives of the displacement respectively with respect to t 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 can also be calculated by using the central difference method to compute the second and fourth order partial derivatives of the displacement respectively with respect to z finally the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be identified through eq 13 according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 1953 the total force in the il direction can be decomposed into two components i e the drag force related to the square of the velocity and the inertial force proportional to the acceleration thus the total force can be expressed as 14 f z t 1 2 ρ d c d z u t x z t t u t x z t t c m z ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 where f z t represents the force predicted by the morison formula at position z at time t c d z and c m z are the drag and added mass coefficients at position z respectively ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 for convenience it is assumed that 15 c 1 z t 1 2 ρ d u t x z t t u t x z t t c 2 z t ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 then eq 14 can be simplified as 16 f z t c d z c 1 z t c m z c 2 z t the least square method is utilized to fit the drag and added mass coefficients in the il direction c d z and c m z can be obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference j 1 c d z c m z between the predicted and identified force which can be expressed as 17 c ˆ d z c ˆ m z argmin j 1 c d z c m z w h e r e j 1 c d z c m z i 1 n f z t f z t 2 where n is the sample number to minimize the difference between the identified and predicted values of the hydrodynamic force eq 18 should be satisfied as 18 j 1 c d z c m z c d z 0 j 1 c d z c m z c m z 0 transforming eq 18 into matrix form 19 h h t c d z

paper more than 20 oscillation periods are used to reconstruct the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients 3 4 time frequency analysis in an oscillatory flow the shedding frequency changes with the periodic oscillation velocity of the model which can be written as 22 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number typically st 0 2 and f st is the vortex shedding frequency under the effect of a periodically varying shedding frequency the viv characteristics in the cf direction vary with time this time varying feature has been reported to be the major difference between the viv in steady flow and that in an oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 to investigate the effects of this time varying feature on the hydrodynamic force and coefficients the wavelet transform is introduced to analyze the time frequency distribution of viv in an oscillatory flow the continuous wavelet transform equation is expressed as 23 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where wt f a τ is the coefficient of the time domain signal f t after the wavelet transform representing the frequency variation at that time scale the parameter a is the scale factor τ is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet in this paper the morlet wavelet equation is employed as the mother wavelet and this wavelet can be defined as 24 ψ t ce t 2 2 cos 5 t where c is the wavelet transform coefficient 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the flexible pipe fig 5 shows the distribution of the root mean square rms displacement and strain responses along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 as shown in fig 5 a and b the blue and red lines represent the displacement responses under kc 31 and 178 respectively the displacement responses under kc 31 in both the cf direction and the il direction are larger than those under kc 178 to verify the displacement reconstruction method the identified bending strain was recalculated based on the reconstructed displacement response through eq 10 curvature can be obtained by the second order difference of displacement response to position z then identified strain values are further calculated by eq 11 the identified bending strain is compared with the measured strain as presented in fig 5 c and d the blue solid line and red dashed line are the identified bending strains under kc 31 and 178 respectively the blue circle and red square symbols represent the corresponding measured bending strains under kc 31 and 178 respectively on the basis of fig 5 c and d the identified values are in good agreement with the measured values demonstrating the validity of the displacement reconstruction method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow fig 6 and fig 7 show the time histories of the viv displacement responses and time frequency distributions at the 4th gauge point in the cf direction for vr 6 5 under a small kc number kc 31 and a large kc number kc 178 respectively each figure contains four subplots a shows the time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated based on eq 22 b illustrates the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method proposed in section 3 2 c presents the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the intensity of the color indicates the level of concentration of the strain the blue and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequencies respectively while the black line refers to the dominant frequency d shows the time history of the modal weight p t of the displacement it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequencies f 1 and f 2 have been considered the measured time varying tension f t t assuming that the added mass coefficient c m is equal to 1 the eigen frequencies can be calculated by 25 f n t n 2 l f t t m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 as shown in fig 6 the shedding frequency varies from 0 to 3 53 hz the viv displacement amplitude is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 60d as seen from the wavelet analysis results shown in fig 6 c although the response at the 4th gauge point is dominated by the 1st natural mode higher harmonics also occur under the small kc number kc 31 meanwhile under the large kc number kc 178 as shown in fig 7 a strong amplitude modulation phenomenon appears and the viv development process is composed of three phases namely the building up lock in and dying out phases the maximum viv displacement amplitude reaches 0 54d other features such as the hysteresis of the displacement response observed under the large kc number were previously revealed by fu et al 2014 and wang et al 2014b recently through experiments with flexible pipes in uniform flow researchers song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 have found that the drag force and coefficients in the il direction are greatly affected by the viv response the significant differences in the viv responses between the small and large kc numbers may lead to different performances of the hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction which requires further investigation 4 2 hydrodynamic force distributions based on the measured strains the displacement responses and hydrodynamic forces in the il direction can be calculated the processed data for vr 6 5 and kc 31 are presented in fig 8 fig 8 a presents the strain time history at the position of sensor il6 fig 8 b illustrates the displacement response which is reconstructed by the method proposed in section 3 2 fig 8 c identifies the hydrodynamic force which is computed through eq 13 in fig 8 the waveforms in the three subplots are consistent this indicates the feasibility of the hydrodynamic force identification method to some extent to further verify the proposed hydrodynamic force identification method a finite element model of the flexible pipe with a pretension force is built with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 by using ansys 12 5 the strain response in the il direction is calculated by applying the same time history of the identified hydrodynamic force to the flexible pipe fig 9 presents the time histories of the measured and calculated strains with vr 6 5 for kc 31 and 178 at the position of the 6th gauge point in the il direction the blue and red lines represent the measured and calculated strains respectively fig 10 and fig 11 show the distributions of the measured and calculated strains relative error between two values along flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 for kc 31 and 178 respectively the relative error e 1 is defined as eq 26 the calculated strain values are in good agreement with the measured values as shown in figs 9 and 10 a and fig 11 a the relative errors in the case of kc 31 and 178 under vr 6 5 are around 5 as illustrated in figs 10 b and fig 11 b this consistency demonstrates the validity of this hydrodynamic identification method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow 26 e 1 ε m ε c ε m 100 where ε m and ε c are the root mean square values of measured and calculated strain respectively using the hydrodynamic force identification method proposed in section 3 3 the force in each case with a different reduced velocity and a different kc number can be obtained fig 12 presents the hydrodynamic forces on the flexible pipe in the time space domain and the time histories of the force at the 6th gauge point in the il direction for two cases as shown in fig 12 a the hydrodynamic forces along the length of the flexible pipe vary synchronously and periodically under both small and large kc numbers a high frequency component of the hydrodynamic force appears when the forced oscillation velocity reaches the maximum value these force components can be attributed to the high harmonic response performance in the cf direction as shown in fig 6 c the relatively high harmonic vibration in the cf direction may be caused by different shedding patterns denoted 2 t fu et al 2014 williamson and jauvtis 2004 therefore these patterns will also lead to a correspondingly high frequency hydrodynamic force component and response in the il direction in an oscillatory flow each half period of the oscillation motion contains the acceleration and deceleration stages the asymmetry of the hydrodynamic force in these two stages can be clearly seen from fig 12 b which is similar to the hysteresis of the viv response reported by fu et al 2014 to reveal the relationship between the force in the il direction and the response in the cf direction the hilbert transform is used to obtain the amplitude envelope of the viv displacement response as shown in fig 13 then it is easy to analyze the relationship among y d f and the instant reduced velocity u f 1 d as shown in fig 14 the red solid lines and green dotted lines represent the acceleration and deceleration stages respectively it is clear that the hysteresis of the viv response and the asymmetry of the force coexist at all kc numbers the maximum amplitude differences in the viv response are approximately 0 15d for both kc 31 and 178 the viv response in the acceleration stage is smaller than that in the deceleration stage while this behavior is the opposite for the hydrodynamic force in the two stages based on the experimental results for a flexible pipe in steady flow a larger viv response will lead to a larger drag force chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 however the hydrodynamic force and viv response during the half cycle of the oscillation motion are not consistent with these beliefs these unexpected results may be closely related to the interaction between the vortex shedding derived forth and the backward motion of the flexible pipe fig 15 presents the sketch of this interaction in the deceleration phase the pipe drives the attached water to the right when pipe accelerates back to the left it will encounter former water body moving to the right this makes the effective velocity in acceleration phase faster than that in deceleration phase resulting in corresponding former hydrodynamic force is larger than the latter one this is called wake effects williamson 2006 more insightful experiments and cfd simulations will be carried out in the near future to further investigate this interesting phenomenon 4 3 drag and added mass coefficients after obtaining the viv response and hydrodynamic force in the il direction the drag coefficient c d z and added mass coefficient c m z at each node can be calculated by using the method proposed in section 3 3 fig 16 presents the hydrodynamic coefficients along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 5 under different kc numbers this figure shows that the distribution of drag coefficients is relatively constant along the spanwise direction the maximum drag coefficient reaches 3 15 and 2 3 for kc 31 and 178 respectively the values of c d for kc 31 are larger than those for kc 178 which is consistent with the displacement response shown in fig 5 b this indicates that the drag coefficient is magnified in the case of the small kc number compared with the distribution of the drag coefficient the added mass coefficients vary greatly under a small kc number the maximum added mass coefficient is approximately 2 5 at z 0 35 m while the value of c m is approximately 0 7 at the center of the flexible pipe for kc 178 the maximum added mass coefficient is approximately 1 2 to check the reliability of these results the drag and added mass coefficients at each node are used to calculate the corresponding hydrodynamic forces fig 17 illustrates the measured and calculated hydrodynamic forces at approximately the 1st z 0 35 m and 6th z 2 0 m gauge points for kc 31 and 178 fig 18 and fig 19 present the distributions of the measured and calculated forces relative error between two force values along the flexible pipe in the case of kc 31 and 178 under vr 6 5 respectively the similar relative error e 2 is also defined and expressed as eq 27 the measured and calculated forces are in good agreement in the cases with different kc numbers these indicate that the identified hydrodynamic coefficients are correct 27 e 2 f m f c f m 100 where f m is the root mean square value of identified force derived from measured strain through eq 13 f c is the root mean square value of force recalculated by using identified hydrodynamic force coefficients through eq 14 to further reveal the effects of the aforementioned key parameters on the hydrodynamic coefficients in the il direction the mean coefficients are introduced here the mean drag coefficient c d and mean added mass coefficient c m are defined as 28 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z 29 c m 1 l 0 l c m z d z where l is the length of the flexible pipe model upon averaging the hydrodynamic coefficients through eqs 28 and 29 the mean drag and added mass coefficients under different kc numbers can be summarized fig 20 shows the distributions of drag coefficients versus kc numbers under different reduced velocities an obvious phenomenon is that the drag coefficients are significantly amplified in the cases with a small kc number the maximum value of the drag coefficient can reach up to 3 5 which is approximately 3 times the typical value of c d 1 2 for a stationary cylinder in uniform flow as the kc number increases the drag coefficients gradually stabilize at 1 45 1 85 and 1 7 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively such large drag coefficients at small kc numbers should be taken more into consideration in practical projects to further reveal the effects of viv on the drag coefficient the results for a rigid cylinder without viv from published studies keulegan 1958 sarpkaya 1976 are collected and plotted as shown by the dashed lines in figs 20 and 21 it should be noted that keulegan 1958 found that the drag coefficient is very sensitive to the stokes number β hence the parameters of the collected results are the same as our experiments for each case compared with the collected results the drag coefficients of the flexible pipe undergoing viv are much larger this indicates that viv can significantly amplify the drag coefficient in an oscillatory flow this is consistent with the results reported by vandiver 1985 according to experiments of a flexible pipe in steady flow in the case of a large kc number the stable values of the drag coefficient do not increase with the maximum reduced velocity although the viv amplitudes at vr 7 9 are slightly larger than those at vr 6 5 for kc 60 the drag coefficients in the former cases are smaller than those in the latter cases this phenomenon can be attributed to the effects of the stokes number in our experiments the value of β at vr 7 9 is larger than that at vr 6 5 under the same kc numbers the expected drag coefficients for the flexible pipe are in good agreement insomuch that larger values of β should lead to smaller drag coefficients as predicted by sarpkaya 1976 although the presence of viv also affects the drag coefficient β plays the dominant role in the case of the large kc number in which the viv response amplitudes are close moreover in the cases with vr 6 5 and 7 9 at kc 60 the values of β change with the kc numbers in our experiments the viv amplitudes and drag coefficients of the flexible pipe remain almost constant while an obvious downward trend in the drag coefficient is observed in the collected results in other words the effects of the stokes number on the drag coefficients of a flexible pipe undergoing viv are not observed this means that the occurrence of viv can reduce the sensitivity of the drag coefficient to β to some extent the reason for the abovementioned magnification of the drag coefficients under a small kc number seems to be relatively complex in the cases with vr 4 0 and 6 5 the viv amplitude increases and then decreases with the kc number as shown in fig 22 the kc number at the inflection point is approximately 25 the viv response for a small kc number close to 20 is more obvious than that for a large kc number the maximum viv displacement response is about 0 36d at kc 20 while the response gradually falls and stabilizes at 0 12d with an increasing kc number at the same time the drag coefficients reduce to 1 45 from approximately 2 5 when kc 20 it seems that the amplification of the drag coefficients at around kc 20 can be attributed to the viv displacement response obvious viv responses appear at a kc number of approximately 20 and the larger response in the cf direction causes the incident area to increase leading to greater drag coefficients however it is difficult to explain the amplification phenomenon of the drag coefficients using the same reasons for the cases with kc 20 for vr 4 0 although the viv displacement amplitude is not very obvious the maximum drag coefficients are observed in this region moreover as the reduced velocity increases to 6 5 and 7 9 the decreasing tendency of the maximum viv displacement response vanishes under vr 7 9 the maximum values of y rms d remain stable at approximately 0 3 d the decreasing trend of the viv amplitude with the kc number disappears in the cases with vr 7 9 this downward trend still remains in the drag coefficient distribution this means that the amplification of drag coefficients is not dependent only on the viv response amplitude to further investigate the reasons for this phenomenon in detail the results of a rigid cylinder without viv for β 497 similar to the value of β under the small kc number in our experiments reported by sarpkaya 1976 are shown in fig 20 the magnification phenomenon under a small kc number and the decreasing trend of the drag coefficient with the kc number can similarly be found in these results through observations of the flow field williamson 2006 revealed that the magnification of the drag coefficient under a small kc number can be attributed to the wake effect he found that the wake could flow back toward the cylinder under a small kc number and cause the effective velocity to become larger than the actual oscillation velocity as the kc number increases the period of oscillation motion becomes longer and the wake effect consequently weakens in summary two reasons can explain the significant magnification of the drag coefficient at a small kc number the effects of the wake amplify the drag coefficients and the occurrence of viv further intensifies this magnification in addition the drag coefficient distributes discretely with the kc number under low reduced velocities vr 4 0 and 6 5 in the cases with small kc numbers while the scatter disappears gradually as the maximum reduced velocity increases to 7 9 this can be attributed to the viv response there are some similarities in the scatter features between the drag coefficients and the viv response as seen in figs 20 and 22 in the cases with small kc numbers kc 60 these scatter features can be found in the distributions of both the drag coefficient and the viv response at vr 4 0 and 6 5 while relatively aggregated distributions of the responses and coefficients are observed for vr 7 9 under larger kc numbers kc 60 the trends of the viv responses and drag coefficients under all reduced velocities are both observed to be stable therefore it can be reasonably inferred that the features of the drag coefficient distributions under different reduced velocities may depend on the corresponding viv displacement distributions fig 21 presents the variations in the added mass coefficients versus kc numbers under different reduced velocities there are no obvious differences in the added mass coefficients among the various maximum reduced velocities in the cases with small kc numbers kc 60 the distributions of the added mass coefficients are slightly discrete combined with the viv response amplitude distributions presented in fig 22 the potential reasons for this discreteness may be the more variable distributions of the viv response amplitude in the cases with large kc numbers kc 60 the added mass coefficients almost do not change with the kc numbers the values of c m stabilize at 0 75 0 75 and 0 85 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively in comparison with the collected results the added mass coefficients of the flexible pipe undergoing viv are amplified under small kc numbers the specific reason for this amplification cannot be reasonably explained more insightful experimental and cfd simulations should be conducted in future work in addition the added mass coefficients in the literature increase with the kc number this is caused by changes in the stokes number β in our experiments the stokes number changes with the kc number keulegan 1958 and sarpkaya 1976 found that the effects of β on the added mass coefficient are significant however these upward trends disappear when the flexible pipe undergoes viv this indicates that viv can also effectively reduce the sensitivity of the added mass coefficient to the stokes number 4 4 prediction of the drag and added mass coefficients fig 21 shows that the distributions of the added mass coefficient are relatively stable with the kc number and are not related to the maximum reduced velocity vr therefore a constant value of c m can be selected as a recommended value in practical design compared with the results derived from our model test the recommended values of the added mass coefficient ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 api 1998 are feasible however the added mass coefficients at high reynolds numbers and high stokes numbers need to be investigated further different from the added mass coefficient the drag coefficient changes with the kc number and vr therefore a method for predicting the drag coefficient should be developed for engineering applications the relationships between the mean drag coefficients and viv responses of a bare pipe in steady flow have been previously studied blevins and saunders 1977 chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 vandiver 1985 proposed a formula to calculate the mean drag coefficient for a flexible smooth pipe 30 c d c d 0 1 1 043 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c d0 is the drag coefficient for a rigid cylinder in steady flow usually taken to be 1 20 as previously mentioned the viv responses amplify the mean drag coefficients by broadening the incident flow area however the viv response features of a flexible pipe are very different between steady and oscillatory flows in steady flow the viv response amplitude modulation is very weak in an oscillatory flow the viv response at small kc numbers is similar to that in steady flow as shown in fig 6 while a strong amplitude modulation occurs intermittently at large kc numbers as shown in fig 7 although the viv response at small kc numbers is the same as that at large kc numbers as shown in fig 23 only the lock in phase with a greater response amplitude may lead to an effective magnification of the drag coefficients in addition the effects of the wake play an important role in amplifying the drag coefficients at small kc numbers therefore the sensitivity of the mean drag coefficients to the viv response may not be the same at different kc numbers this means that a constant value of 1 043 will not be appropriate for predicting the mean drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow for convenience the temporary parameter k is used instead of the constant value of 1 043 and the prediction formula is modified as 31 c d c d 0 1 k 2 y r m s d 0 65 to further verify the above analysis the drag coefficients calculated by using the prediction formula proposed by vandiver 1985 are presented in fig 25 compared with the measured results the predicted results are relatively small at small kc numbers and excessively conservative at large kc numbers this indicates that the value of k is greater than 1 043 at small kc numbers and less than 1 043 at large kc numbers this confirms that the above analysis is reasonable this indicates that the drag coefficient is more sensitive to the viv response at smaller kc numbers and that k is inversely proportional to the kc number to determine the relationship between k and the kc number under different maximum reduced velocities the measured drag coefficient c d corresponding viv displacement response yrms d and c d0 1 20 are substituted into eq 31 fig 24 presents the values of k versus 1 kc under different maximum reduced velocities linear relationships are clearly seen at all reduced velocities especially for large kc numbers in the cases with vr 4 and 7 9 these linear relationships slightly worsen when kc 25 and kc 23 respectively the main reasons for this phenomenon may be the unclear effects of the wake which leads to an uncertain relation between k and the kc number as shown in fig 24 the values of the parameter k are not the same under different maximum reduced velocities it indicates that k may also be affected by vr or even the stokes number β therefore after obtaining the relationships between the parameter k and various kc numbers the prediction formula for the drag coefficient is modified as 32 c d c d 0 1 j 2 v r β k c j 3 v r β 2 y r m s d 0 65 where k j 2 vr β kc j 3 vr β the values of j 2 vr β and j 3 vr β are listed in table 4 using the modified prediction formula for the drag coefficient in an oscillatory flow presented above the values of c d for each case are calculated and shown in fig 25 apart from the range shown in the gray area the present results are consistent with the measured results especially for large kc numbers the feasible and applicable ranges for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 are kc 25 kc 15 and kc 23 respectively the proposed method for predicting the drag coefficients at small kc numbers should be investigated more thoroughly in the future nevertheless compared with the prediction formula proposed by vandiver 1985 the prediction accuracy has been greatly improved this demonstrates that the proposed formula is more reasonable in an oscillatory flow although the relationship among k v r and β cannot be obtained due to the limitations of these experimental results the work in this paper is a preliminary attempt to predict the drag coefficients in an oscillatory flow to present a general drag coefficient prediction formula in an oscillatory flow additional flexible pipe experiments with different reduced velocities should be conducted in future works to establish a simple function of j 2 vr β and j 3 vr β this would be helpful for predicting the global hydrodynamic responses of risers in ocean engineering applications 5 conclusions in this paper the drag and added mass coefficients of a riser undergoing vortex induced vibration in an oscillatory flow are studied through experiments with a flexible pipe the maximum reduced velocities vr range from 4 to 7 9 and the kc numbers range from 10 to 178 the hydrodynamic force and coefficients are first revealed by using inverse and least square methods the relationships among the hydrodynamic coefficients viv response vr and kc number are further investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 similar to the viv response in the cf direction in an oscillatory flow the high frequency components and hysteresis of the hydrodynamic force are first revealed however in contrast to the viv response the force in the acceleration stage is more obvious than that in the deceleration stage 2 the occurrence of viv and the wake effects lead to a significant magnification of the drag coefficients in cases with small kc numbers the maximum values can reach 3 5 the drag coefficients vary with the maximum reduced velocities and gradually stabilize at 1 45 1 85 and 1 7 for vr 4 0 6 5 and 7 9 respectively as the kc number increases there is no clear relationship between the added mass coefficients and maximum reduced velocity 3 compared with the results for a stationary cylinder without viv in an oscillatory flow the occurrence of viv can reduce the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients to the stokes number 4 based on the experimental results an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow that accounts for the viv response and kc number is proposed a comparison between the measured results and predicted results effectively verifies the application of this prediction formula credit authorship contribution statement haojie ren formal analysis writing original

21727,the purpose of this study is to determine the risky areas in terms of air pollution from domestic shipping in izmir bay with the integration of geographic information system gis and emission evaluation methodology to do this initially the emissions as a result of 435 trips of 19 ships engaged in domestic transportation in izmir bay were evaluated by the bottom up method the spatial distribution map was then compiled using the point density analysis through mapinfo v 16 software as a gis instrument the study revealed that annual emissions of pm10 co2 nox so2 and hc from domestic shipping were 601 5 t 925 9 t 62612 1 t 22 0 t and 61 2 t respectively in addition the highest emissions as ton per daily trip were recorded in the cruising mode due to longer operation periods compared to the other modes it was found that the lines between pasaport alsancak and karsiyaka piers are the most polluted routes due to dense ship traffic furthermore bostanli and karsiyaka piers were determined as the points with the lowest air quality due to heavy traffic we concluded that the ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the region in order to reduce the emissions in the area the number of daily voyages and ship size should be optimized for passenger and vehicle density the study also recommends installing emission monitoring stations at the piers to control air pollution keywords geographic information system gis izmir bay ship emission bottom up method domestic shipping 1 introduction throughout history maritime transportation has been an important human activity especially contributing to the global trade and global economy by reducing the unit transportation costs of cargo compared to road and rail transport tzannatos 2010 considering the ratio of cargo amount to emission per unit maritime transportation is a more environmentally friendly way of transportation compared to other modes of transportation olivier and berdowski 2001 deniz and kilic 2010 saracoglu et al 2013 however ships are the only responsible mobile units that causes air pollution in the seas by releasing exhaust gases such as particulate material pm volatile organic compounds voc co2 fuglestvedt et al 2009 so2 and nox endresen et al 2003 eyring et al 2010 maritime transport is responsible for 13 of annual global nox emissions and 12 of so2 emissions chen et al 2019 according to the estimations greenhouse gas ghg emissions from shipping are expected to increase from 50 to 250 in 2050 imo 2018 air pollution from ships affects the mainland even 400 km away from the coast at the same time depending on the weather conditions the exhaust gases emitted from the ships can penetrate to the inland causing decrease in air quality song and shon 2014 olukanni and esu 2018 especially air pollution caused by the ships visiting ports located near city centres has more negative effects on the public health ng et al 2013 therefore in recent years there is an increasing public concern about the effects of ship generated air pollution on environment and human health song and shon 2014 olukanni and esu 2018 despite the growing amount of published research about emission inventory in international maritime transportation rather less attention has been paid to studying on the estimation and spatial analysis of air pollution from domestic shipping although several emission inventory studies were carried out in the izmir bay previously ilek and elbir 2012 saracoglu et al 2013 ekmekcioglu et al 2019 there is still a research gap in the spatial analysis for this reason this study aims to draw attention to air pollution caused by domestic shipping especially in a large populated city such as izmir in line with this purpose the gis methodology as the principal spatial analysis instrument has been used to define risky areas in terms of air pollution from domestic shipping 1 1 literature review in recent years due to the rapid growth in maritime transport dramatic increases have been recorded in the number of studies on air pollution from ships corbett and koehler 2003 endresen et al 2007 the transport sector is responsible for 24 of global co2 emissions tatar and ozer 2018 while maritime transport is responsible for 3 of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions and 2 6 of co2 emissions oecd iea 2017 in the maritime transportation a large part of co2 87 is emitted from ships operating in international waters while 9 are generated by domestic shipping tatar and ozer 2018 therefore most of the emission studies in the literature focus on the emission estimation from ships engaged in international shipping however due to geographical proximity to the residential area domestic shipping has a more negative impact on the urban atmosphere certain strategies to reduce emissions from shipping are developed by utilizing air pollution inventories nowadays at this stage evaluation of ship generated emissions is crucial song and shon 2014 in order to take preventive measures to combat air pollution in recent years significant studies by using different approaches have been conducted to create emission inventories in the literature there are basically two methodologies based on emission estimation namely a bottom up and top down wang et al 2007 the bottom up approach estimates the emissions from ships considering vessel activities and operation of a fleet at a specific position tzannatos 2010 eyring et al 2010 nunes et al 2017 moreover a top down approach evaluates the emissions considering the variables on global scale such as fuel statistics and engine types miola and ciuffo 2011 merk 2014 tichavska and tovar 2015 one of the major challenges with this methodology is the statistical difficulty in the fuel consumption calculation of ships in a particular region merien paul et al 2018 there is still another model hybrid that combines the top down and bottom up approaches in the literature nunes et al 2017 using hybrid approaches ekmekcioglu et al 2019 calculated the emissions from ships calling to izmir and mersin ports there are a limited number of emission studies in the literature solely focused on domestic shipping and spatial analysis mckinnon 2007 evaluated co2 emissions from domestic shipping in the uk using a bottom up approach and compared it with the other modes of transport walsh et al 2012 modified mckinnon 2007 methodology with the adoption of a new bottom up approach to estimate emissions from sea trade in the uk ilek and elbir 2012 applied epa iscst3 model to create an air pollution density map using emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay deniz and durmusoglu 2008 conducted a study to estimate emissions from domestic shipping using the top down algorithm in the marmara sea and the turkish straits with 2003 data tzannatos 2010 conducted a study using a top down algorithm to reveal the effects of emissions from domestic shipping on air quality in greece 2 materials and method 2 1 research design in the research a two step methodology emission evaluation and spatial analysis was followed in the first step emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay were evaluated using bottom up approach then using the gis methodology the spatial distribution map of air pollution was created the main structure including these steps is shown in fig 1 as understood from fig 1 the study consists of three main steps starting with the collection of technical and activity data of each ship from data providers agencies local authority information databases and relevant literature the emissions were then evaluated through activity based methodology in the second step the data required for point source were collected in order to develop gis database in the last step the cartographic output of the thematic map representing the air pollution density distribution as a result of point density analysis was compiled by using mapinfo software 2 2 method 2 2 1 ship emission evaluation in this research the bottom up approach is used to evaluate the emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay in this methodology the emissions are estimated considering the ship activity and technical data activity of ships is classified under three operation modes hotelling manoeuvring and cruising the main engine operates at all time with varying loads depending on the modes of the operation while the auxiliary engine provides energy for heating electricity and other propulsion components since the loads on the main engine and auxiliary engine vary according to the operation modes emission values are calculated for each mode considering the loads listed below assumptions regarding engine operation for the different activities has shown in table 1 the exhaust gases emitted during the operation modes were calculated using the following equations 1 e a at sea d km v km h me kw l f me ae kw l f ae e f at sea g kwh d

load factor of main engine at manoeuvring lfae load factor of generator at manoeuvring efman emission factors for manoeuvring mode in addition to ship activity data parameters that are important for emission calculation such as emission factors and load factors have been defined for each ship depending on engine and fuel type the categorization of engine and fuel types is shown in table 2 as seen in table 2 marine diesel engines are classified as slow medium and fast according to rpm engines with rpm value above 1000 are defined as high speed diesel hsd engines while engines with rpm below 300 are low speed diesel ssd engines and engines with rpm between 300 and 1000 medium speed diesel msd are defined as engines in the light of the categorization above technical information of each ship was compiled by reviewing manufacturers manuals in order to determine the engine and fuel types as shown in table 3 the technical details of the ships engaged in domestic transportation in izmir bay shown in table 3 were evaluated in the light of the factors given in table 2 and it was observed that the engine type of the ships would be classified as hsd and the fuel type as mdo in the light of this classification assumed emission factors for each mode of operation are shown in table 4 in this study the emission factors in the emission calculation are taken into account according to the fuel types and engine types of the ships as shown in table 4 however evaluations carried out with theoretical approach are affected by several uncertainties in activity and technical data especially assumptions on the load factor and emission factor of ship engines cause uncertainties in the emission evaluation to minimise this uncertainty emission inventory studies were conducted to guide the determination of emission factors and load factors these inventory studies which are accepted in the literature have formed a framework that enables to determine emission factor and load factor to be used other emission studies depending on the type of ship fuel and engine the main variables that determine the effect of emissions on air quality are the amount of pollutants emitted and the percentage of harmful gases in the emission for that reason rate of components in the emissions is the main determinant in air pollution the legal framework addressing the component limits within the pollutant is shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 the rate of sulphur content in so2 varies depending on the type of fuel in addition although an equal amount of so2 is emitted in different service of transportation domestic or international the effect of emissions on air quality differ as the sulphur content varies depending on the fuel type 2 2 2 gis geographic information systems gis an information system that integrates functions such as data collection storage analysis and visualization is widely applied for solving spatial problems therefore it is possible to make spatial based decisions on the data stored in the gis by querying displaying and analysing geographic data point density analysis one of the most used spatial analysis tool is used to observe how the point density of the samples in the study area is distributed in this analysis the density surface is created using points and then the vector property points are transformed into a raster surface with mathematical models fotheringham and rogerson 2013 in this study spatial analysis in mapinfo v 16 as a gis tool was performed in order to reveal distribution the air pollution from domestic shipping in izmir bay 2 3 study area located on the west coast of turkey and the third largest city with a population of approximately 4 4 million izmir is the city with the most intensive maritime traffic after istanbul according to the latest data there is an increase of 1 33 in izmir city population in 2017 2018 and 0 95 between 2018 and 2019 tcs 2019 in parallel with the increase in population the demand for transportation in izmir also increases over the years urban transportation is carried out by road rail systems and maritime transportation a total of 1 million 250 thousand passengers are transported daily by public transport 74 by road 23 by rail systems and 3 by sea in the city the changes in the number of vehicles and passengers carried by sea in the last 20 years are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 there is a significant increase in the number of passengers and vehicles transported by sea in the last 20 years currently passenger and vehicle transportation services are provided in izmir bay with a total of 24 ships including 15 light cruise ships 1 passenger ship and 4 car ferries owned by izmir metropolitan municipality and 4 passenger boats rented by turyol cooperative as of 2019 approximately 50 000 passengers and 2500 vehicles are transported daily by sea main lines of domestic shipping are shown in fig 3 according to the map ships engaged in domestic transportation in izmir bay are operated on 8 main lines throughout the year ferries carrying vehicles are operated between uckuyular and bostanli ferry piers while other piers serve only ships carrying passengers 2 4 data in this study air pollution caused by a total of 19 ships including 15 small tonnage passenger ships and 4 ferries carrying passengers and vehicles in the inner bay was taken into consideration the details of the daily trips and the characteristics of ships were obtained from izmir metropolitan municipality the technical details of the ships carrying passengers in the bay and the total operation time are shown in table 6 table 6 reveals that a total of 435 voyages are made within one day in the bay the measurement of air emissions was calculated separately for each period and the final emission values were estimated the waiting manoeuvring and sailing periods of the ships are listed in detail on a daily basis the air emission values were calculated for each period of operation 3 results the annual estimated emissions by routes are shown in table 7 the study found that the domestic shipping in izmir bay is responsible for a significant part of the air pollution the tables tables 7 and 8 table 9 clearly show that among all emissions in all operation modes co2 accounts for the largest share in the air pollution nox and so2 emissions are the other air pollutants that pose the highest risk for the region after co2 it is seen from table 7 that the highest emissions were recorded on the passport alsancak karsiyaka route due to high number of 40 trips per day in addition the bostanli uckuyular line is the second most air polluted line due to high emissions generated by 4 ferries with high engine power emissions estimated at pier are indicated in table 8 as can be seen from table 8 the highest emissions were recorded in bostanli and karsiyaka piers due to dense ship traffic these piers are responsible for 41 of the total emissions during the hotelling period konak pier in the city centre accounted for the third largest share 15 2 in air pollution due to the high number of passengers carried relatively lower emissions were recorded in uckuyular pier which is a ferry pier due to the low number of daily trips emissions estimated during manoeuvre are shown in table 9 as indicated in table 9 exhaust gases emitted from ships during the manoeuvre around uckuyular and bostanli piers represent more than half 53 4 of all emissions the reason is that the ferries with high engine power generate more contaminants during manoeuvring in addition it is found that emissions recorded during the manoeuvre are higher than those estimated during the hotelling period detailed emission evaluations according to the routes are shown in table 10 as a conclusion the highest emissions as ton per daily trip were recorded in the cruising mode due to longer operation periods compared to the other modes in addition pasaport alsancak karsiyaka line and bostanli uckuyular line were determined as routes where the highest emissions were recorded goztepe karantina line was found as the lowest risk route in terms of air pollution in the literature there are only few studies aiming to pay attention to the air pollution from domestic shipping in izmir bay as tabulated below table 11 the results of the previous study and the findings of our research were compared for better discussion as can be seen from table 11 it is seen that the emissions evaluated in this research are significantly higher than the previous study conducted with 2009 data ilek and elbir 2012 in the last 10 years the number of passengers carried in the bay has increased five times and the number of vehicles transported has increased ten times despite the fact that the daily voyage numbers are the same the emissions in this research were found higher than the previous study ilek and elbir 2012 due to the renewal of the ferry fleet operating between bostanli and uckuyular in 2016 similarly higher emissions were recorded on the goztepe karsiyaka route due to the increase in the tonnage and number of daily voyages the comparison of the results of this study with previous study is shown in table 12 the study found that the domestic shipping in izmir bay is responsible for a significant part of the air pollution table 12 shows that emissions from international shipping in izmir bay are higher than those of domestic shipping in addition as it is understood from the data period taken into consideration in the previous study it is estimated that the so2 emissions from international shipping may have a more negative impact on the air quality since the sulphur content in the fuel is determined according to tier i limits in addition the fact that internationally operated ships travel with heavy fuel hfo to the manoeuvring area increases the severity of this effect not only in terms of sulphur but also for other emissions since the ships in the domestic transportation in izmir bay have the latest technology engines they use fuels in euro diesel standards with ultra low sulphur content in the second part of this research the emission density map of the inner bay was created using the emissions the study area was then disaggregated into grid cells 0 1 0 1 km to assign points representing location affected the point density analysis a tool that assigns data points to the grid cells in mapinfo v 16 was used to represent the emission density the colours used to identify cells represent the emission density per grid spatial distribution of emissions from domestic shipping is illustrated in fig 4 according to fig 4 manoeuvring areas and piers are determined as the most polluted areas according to the emission per grid among all piers the dirtiest air conditions were recorded in bostanli pier due to frequency of voyages despite the low number of trips the uckuyular pier was determined as the most risky pier in the bay in terms of air pollution after bostanli in addition karantina and goztepe piers were identified as the piers with relatively higher air quality 4 discussion our study reveals that the domestic shipping is one of the main sources of air pollution in izmir bay our findings present that the density of air pollution increases towards the pier as the region is characterized by the area where the ships manoeuvre frequently it has been observed that the emission from domestic shipping is not homogeneously distributed to each region according to the density distribution map compiled with gis like previous study ilek and elbir 2012 it has been found that ships operating in domestic lines are important sources of air pollution in izmir bay however our research also contrasts with the previous study in terms of emissions per line due to the different methodology used compared to another study saracoglu et al 2013 evaluating emissions from international shipping in izmir bay it was found that international shipping poses more threats to air quality although the number of voyages in domestic transportation is much higher in addition emissions from large ships using residual oil with rich sulphur content may have more negative impact on human health compared to the air pollution from domestic ships using fuel with ultra low sulphur content in this study activity based bottom up approach was used to evaluate emission from domestic shipping in izmir bay in this methodology although the algorithm used in the calculation of emissions from domestic shipping and international shipping is the same but the variables used in the calculation load factor and emission factor are determined according to the engine type and fuel type according to the classification the factor coefficients taken into account in the assessment of emissions from domestic ships with high speed diesel engines using marine diesel oil hsd mdo and large tonnage international ships with residual oil using medium speed diesel engines msd ro vary however uncertainties have arisen due to the fact that the factors taken into consideration in the utilized emission inventories do not exactly match the ships in our study therefore emission inventories covering domestic shipping in turkey should be created in this study bottom up methodology was used as an emission evaluation method considering the one year activity in domestic shipping for a more comprehensive inventory it is recommended to consider longer period data using other methodologies 5 conclusion in this research emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay the region with the most intense domestic shipping after istanbul have been estimated using an activity based algorithm then the air pollution density map of the region has been created using gis with the data obtained from the calculations in our study real time activity data and technical data of each ship has been considered in order to minimise data based uncertainties one of the most important conclusions of this research is that co2 which has the highest share among the emissions is the most concentrated air pollutant in the pier area and therefore a major threat to the air quality of city it was found that the lines between pasaport alsancak and karsiyaka piers are the most polluted routes due to dense ship traffic furthermore bostanli and karsiyaka piers were determined as the points with the lowest air quality due to heavy traffic although the highest emissions in tons per day trip are recorded in cruise mode air pollution per grid in this mode is relatively low compared to other modes the results clearly indicate that the hotelling and manoeuvring are the determinant operation modes in air pollution in order to reduce the emissions in these periods the number of daily voyages and ship size should be optimized for passenger and vehicle density in our study the peak emissions have been recorded in the bostanli uckuyular and karsiyaka piers respectively due to high number of voyages strategies to shorten waiting times at the port should be determined to reduce the density of air pollution in addition it is recommended to install emission monitoring stations at the piers to control air pollution there are a limited number of studies in the literature evaluating emission from domestic shipping besides its contribution to the current body of knowledge this study provides useful information to local policymakers to become aware of this environmental problem for that reason the results above are valuable for designating strategies to control the emissions and to improve urban air quality at the beginning of this study we argued that data validity plays an important role for accurate results what this study contributes to the current literature is that the high level of uncertainty resulting from estimated data in air emission evaluation is minimized by using actual data credit authorship contribution statement muge buber

21727,the purpose of this study is to determine the risky areas in terms of air pollution from domestic shipping in izmir bay with the integration of geographic information system gis and emission evaluation methodology to do this initially the emissions as a result of 435 trips of 19 ships engaged in domestic transportation in izmir bay were evaluated by the bottom up method the spatial distribution map was then compiled using the point density analysis through mapinfo v 16 software as a gis instrument the study revealed that annual emissions of pm10 co2 nox so2 and hc from domestic shipping were 601 5 t 925 9 t 62612 1 t 22 0 t and 61 2 t respectively in addition the highest emissions as ton per daily trip were recorded in the cruising mode due to longer operation periods compared to the other modes it was found that the lines between pasaport alsancak and karsiyaka piers are the most polluted routes due to dense ship traffic furthermore bostanli and karsiyaka piers were determined as the points with the lowest air quality due to heavy traffic we concluded that the ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the region in order to reduce the emissions in the area the number of daily voyages and ship size should be optimized for passenger and vehicle density the study also recommends installing emission monitoring stations at the piers to control air pollution keywords geographic information system gis izmir bay ship emission bottom up method domestic shipping 1 introduction throughout history maritime transportation has been an important human activity especially contributing to the global trade and global economy by reducing the unit transportation costs of cargo compared to road and rail transport tzannatos 2010 considering the ratio of cargo amount to emission per unit maritime transportation is a more environmentally friendly way of transportation compared to other modes of transportation olivier and berdowski 2001 deniz and kilic 2010 saracoglu et al 2013 however ships are the only responsible mobile units that causes air pollution in the seas by releasing exhaust gases such as particulate material pm volatile organic compounds voc co2 fuglestvedt et al 2009 so2 and nox endresen et al 2003 eyring et al 2010 maritime transport is responsible for 13 of annual global nox emissions and 12 of so2 emissions chen et al 2019 according to the estimations greenhouse gas ghg emissions from shipping are expected to increase from 50 to 250 in 2050 imo 2018 air pollution from ships affects the mainland even 400 km away from the coast at the same time depending on the weather conditions the exhaust gases emitted from the ships can penetrate to the inland causing decrease in air quality song and shon 2014 olukanni and esu 2018 especially air pollution caused by the ships visiting ports located near city centres has more negative effects on the public health ng et al 2013 therefore in recent years there is an increasing public concern about the effects of ship generated air pollution on environment and human health song and shon 2014 olukanni and esu 2018 despite the growing amount of published research about emission inventory in international maritime transportation rather less attention has been paid to studying on the estimation and spatial analysis of air pollution from domestic shipping although several emission inventory studies were carried out in the izmir bay previously ilek and elbir 2012 saracoglu et al 2013 ekmekcioglu et al 2019 there is still a research gap in the spatial analysis for this reason this study aims to draw attention to air pollution caused by domestic shipping especially in a large populated city such as izmir in line with this purpose the gis methodology as the principal spatial analysis instrument has been used to define risky areas in terms of air pollution from domestic shipping 1 1 literature review in recent years due to the rapid growth in maritime transport dramatic increases have been recorded in the number of studies on air pollution from ships corbett and koehler 2003 endresen et al 2007 the transport sector is responsible for 24 of global co2 emissions tatar and ozer 2018 while maritime transport is responsible for 3 of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions and 2 6 of co2 emissions oecd iea 2017 in the maritime transportation a large part of co2 87 is emitted from ships operating in international waters while 9 are generated by domestic shipping tatar and ozer 2018 therefore most of the emission studies in the literature focus on the emission estimation from ships engaged in international shipping however due to geographical proximity to the residential area domestic shipping has a more negative impact on the urban atmosphere certain strategies to reduce emissions from shipping are developed by utilizing air pollution inventories nowadays at this stage evaluation of ship generated emissions is crucial song and shon 2014 in order to take preventive measures to combat air pollution in recent years significant studies by using different approaches have been conducted to create emission inventories in the literature there are basically two methodologies based on emission estimation namely a bottom up and top down wang et al 2007 the bottom up approach estimates the emissions from ships considering vessel activities and operation of a fleet at a specific position tzannatos 2010 eyring et al 2010 nunes et al 2017 moreover a top down approach evaluates the emissions considering the variables on global scale such as fuel statistics and engine types miola and ciuffo 2011 merk 2014 tichavska and tovar 2015 one of the major challenges with this methodology is the statistical difficulty in the fuel consumption calculation of ships in a particular region merien paul et al 2018 there is still another model hybrid that combines the top down and bottom up approaches in the literature nunes et al 2017 using hybrid approaches ekmekcioglu et al 2019 calculated the emissions from ships calling to izmir and mersin ports there are a limited number of emission studies in the literature solely focused on domestic shipping and spatial analysis mckinnon 2007 evaluated co2 emissions from domestic shipping in the uk using a bottom up approach and compared it with the other modes of transport walsh et al 2012 modified mckinnon 2007 methodology with the adoption of a new bottom up approach to estimate emissions from sea trade in the uk ilek and elbir 2012 applied epa iscst3 model to create an air pollution density map using emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay deniz and durmusoglu 2008 conducted a study to estimate emissions from domestic shipping using the top down algorithm in the marmara sea and the turkish straits with 2003 data tzannatos 2010 conducted a study using a top down algorithm to reveal the effects of emissions from domestic shipping on air quality in greece 2 materials and method 2 1 research design in the research a two step methodology emission evaluation and spatial analysis was followed in the first step emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay were evaluated using bottom up approach then using the gis methodology the spatial distribution map of air pollution was created the main structure including these steps is shown in fig 1 as understood from fig 1 the study consists of three main steps starting with the collection of technical and activity data of each ship from data providers agencies local authority information databases and relevant literature the emissions were then evaluated through activity based methodology in the second step the data required for point source were collected in order to develop gis database in the last step the cartographic output of the thematic map representing the air pollution density distribution as a result of point density analysis was compiled by using mapinfo software 2 2 method 2 2 1 ship emission evaluation in this research the bottom up approach is used to evaluate the emissions from domestic shipping in izmir bay in this methodology the emissions are estimated considering the ship activity and technical data activity of ships is classified under three operation modes hotelling manoeuvring and cruising the main engine operates at all time with varying loads depending on the modes of the operation while the auxiliary engine provides energy for heating electricity and other propulsion components since the loads on the main engine and auxiliary engine vary according to the operation modes emission values are calculated for each mode considering the loads listed below assumptions regarding engine operation for the different activities has shown in table 1 the exhaust gases emitted during the operation modes were calculated using the following equations 1 e a at sea d km v km h me kw l f me ae kw l f ae e f at sea g kwh d distance a ship travels in a certain zone of a country v average speed of a ship depending on ship category me installed main engine power lfme average load factor of main engine at sea ae installed

load factor of main engine at manoeuvring lfae load factor of generator at manoeuvring efman emission factors for manoeuvring mode in addition to ship activity data parameters that are important for emission calculation such as emission factors and load factors have been defined for each ship depending on engine and fuel type the categorization of engine and fuel types is shown in table 2 as seen in table 2 marine diesel engines are classified as slow medium and fast according to rpm engines with rpm value above 1000 are defined as high speed diesel hsd engines while engines with rpm below 300 are low speed diesel ssd engines and engines with rpm between 300 and 1000 medium speed diesel msd are defined as engines in the light of the categorization above technical information of each ship was compiled by reviewing manufacturers manuals in order to determine the engine and fuel types as shown in table 3 the technical details of the ships engaged in domestic transportation in izmir bay shown in table 3 were evaluated in the light of the factors given in table 2 and it was observed that the engine type of the ships would be classified as hsd and the fuel type as mdo in the light of this classification assumed emission factors for each mode of operation are shown in table 4 in this study the emission factors in the emission calculation are taken into account according to the fuel types and engine types of the ships as shown in table 4 however evaluations carried out with theoretical approach are affected by several uncertainties in activity and technical data especially assumptions on the load factor and emission factor of ship engines cause uncertainties in the emission evaluation to minimise this uncertainty emission inventory studies were conducted to guide the determination of emission factors and load factors these inventory studies which are accepted in the literature have formed a framework that enables to determine emission factor and load factor to be used other emission studies depending on the type of ship fuel and engine the main variables that determine the effect of emissions on air quality are the amount of pollutants emitted and the percentage of harmful gases in the emission for that reason rate of components in the emissions is the main determinant in air pollution the legal framework addressing the component limits within the pollutant is shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 the rate of sulphur content in so2 varies depending on the type of fuel in addition although an equal amount of so2 is emitted in different service of transportation domestic or international the effect of emissions on air quality differ as the sulphur content varies depending on the fuel type 2 2 2 gis geographic information systems gis an information system that integrates functions such as data collection storage analysis and visualization is widely applied for solving spatial problems therefore it is possible to make spatial based decisions on the data stored in the gis by querying displaying and analysing geographic data point density analysis one of the most used spatial analysis tool is used to observe how the point density of the samples in the study area is distributed in this analysis the density surface is created using points and then the vector property points are transformed into a raster surface with mathematical models fotheringham and rogerson 2013 in this study spatial analysis in mapinfo v 16 as a gis tool was performed in order to reveal distribution the air pollution from domestic shipping in izmir bay 2

21728,in addition to the elevation green s function which is known as the numerical green s function in previous tsunami studies a new type of green s function for shallow water equations is proposed this new green s function is the flow response due to impulsive initial sea surface increase and is dubbed the flow green s function based on the momentum equation its reciprocity to sea surface response for impulsive initial flow is suggested and is shown numerically that is the x and y volume fluxes at the vulnerable city x y caused by an impulsive increase of the unit sea surface η at the source point x s y s are exactly the η response at x s y s caused by an impulsive unit x and y volume fluxes at x y multiplied by the negative gravitational acceleration and the water depth at x y the later will be called a reciprocal flow green s function as reciprocal flow green s functions include information on wave direction by combing reciprocal elevation green s functions known as reciprocal green s functions in previous tsunami studies they can be used as an accurate boundary condition for the simulation of nearshore inundation this new approach is proposed and compared with direct tsunami simulation for both normally case 1 and obliquely case 2 incident tsunamis the accuracy of the new approach is similar to a direct simulation and is a significant improvement compared with a simplified bell shaped wave approach the computer time is significantly reduced compared with direct simulations keywords tsunami inundation shallow water equations reciprocal elevation green s function reciprocal flow green s function 1 introduction inundation maps or hazard maps are essential for tsunami hazard mitigation based on the inundation map affected people can understand whether evacuation is necessary and decide where they should shelter thus it helps displaced people to survive a tsunami hazard the more comprehensive the tsunami information is the more useful the hazard map will be usually an inundation map is precomputed by simulating the tsunami scenario from the beginning of a tsunamigenic earthquake to the inundation in the vulnerable city and different scenarios have to be simulated separately as an inundation map is obtained through a detailed nearshore simulation and the process is very time consuming the simulation of various scenarios needs extensive resources and utilizing the simulation results is a large burden to hazard mitigation agencies when a submarine earthquake occurs various methods can be used to identify the most similar scenario and the corresponding hazard map is selected for example in the japan meteorological agency seismic waves are analysed and a linear interpolation scheme is used to determine the proper scenario see e g tatehata 1997 other methods also include analysis of the tsunami waveform see e g gusman et al 2014 another approach for generating a hazard map is to real time simulate the inundation see e g musa et al 2018 titov et al 2005 as mentioned earlier this will involve lots of computer time and is usually not adopted however as computer science advances and more and more supercomputers become available it is now possible to employ a real time simulation in a tsunami event employing above mentioned approaches to generate inundation maps may encounter problems hazard maps based on scenario analysis can be prepared beforehand and hence can be obtained quickly however numerous scenarios have to be prepared so that scenarios similar to the tsunami event can be found and a more accurate map can be obtained by interpolation if the risk of tsunamigenic earthquakes is underestimated the location and magnitude of the earthquake may be beyond the pre calculated scenarios as extrapolation usually does not work in such a nonlinear phenomenon a proper hazard map cannot be obtained for a real time simulation approach the input information is not limited by the proposed scenarios the hazard map generated in this way can reflect the real situation and should be more accurate and applicable than other approaches however as a great deal of computational resources are required real time simulation is limited to a small vulnerable area and cannot be extended to most coastal areas simplified approaches such as combing a uniform beach slope and using an analytic solution chen et al 2012 lin et al 2014 have been proposed which can provide the inundation limit but the accuracy and resolution are limited when compared to both real time simulations and scenario analyses besides another alternative approach has been proposed chen et al 2015 where the inundation map is calculated with a normally incident bell shaped wave having a 20 min time scale the inundation map of this simple waveform has a very similar inundation area with that due to an earthquake scenario that generates a tsunami of the same offshore wave height however the bell shaped wave approach applies well only when the tsunami propagates perpendicularly toward shore if that is not the case this approach will significantly overestimate the inundation as will be demonstrated in case 2 of the present study that is in practice existing approaches to obtain hazard maps are not perfect and can be improved numerical green s functions gfs see e g wei et al 2003 and reciprocal gfs see e g loomis 1979 chen et al 2015 have previously been applied in seismic tsunami forecast this kind of forecast can be completed in a very short time if the gfs are pre calculated there will be no need for equation solving and the forecast of the water surface is simply a superposition over the product of the initial sea surface elevation and the corresponding gf or reciprocal gf however superposition is applicable in a linear regime while tsunami inundation is highly nonlinear although inundation maps cannot be directly derived from gfs like the offshore water level gfs can help to complete a nearshore simulation more quickly and conveniently for this purpose a new kind of gf is suggested in the present study and its applicability in the simulation of tsunami inundation is proposed this new gf is the flow response to impulsive sea surface disturbances and is called a flow gf fgf in the present study an fgf is different from an elevation gfs egf known as gf in previous tsunami studies which is the response of sea surface elevation η to a concentrated impulsive increase of η both egf and its reciprocal reciprocal egf regf known as rgf in previous tsunami studies are both water surface elevations see e g chen et al 2015 chen and liu 2009 and chen et al 2020 however by definition the reciprocal fgf rfgf should reference to a water surface induced by a flow the reciprocity between fgf and rfgf is not straightforward because they have different units the rfgf will be proposed and the reciprocity will be demonstrated in the present study with the aid of rfgf in addition to regf used in previous studies nearshore inundation can be computed with improved accuracy and the computer time can be significantly reduced compared to real time simulation in the present study this proposed approach is called the regf rfgf method and the details will be explained in sec 2 5 for obliquely incident tsunamis the regf rfgf approach gives inundation water levels significantly lower than the simplified bell shaped waveform approach proposed in chen et al 2015 thus overestimation of coastal inundation will be avoided if the regf rfgf approach is employed in a complete inundation simulation usually a nested grid system is applied simulation of inundation on land needs very fine spatial resolution to conserve water mass imamura 2009 extending a resolution of 25 m or finer to offshore tsunami simulation is not feasible because it requires too much ram and computer time thus using a nested grid is a good strategy for a structured grid 2 methodology unlike analytic gfs for homogeneous medium and infinite domain the present study employs numerical gfs based on linear shallow water equations swes t η x p y q 0 1 t p g d x η 0 t q g d y η 0 where η is the free surface elevation p and q are fluxes along the x and y directions t is time g is gravitational acceleration and d is the water depth taken from the real bathymetry numerical gfs include both the bathymetric inhomogeneity and boundary conditions numerical egfs dubbed gfs in previous studies or regf dubbed rgfs in previous studies have previously been applied in seismic tsunami forecasting e g wei et al 2003 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 this kind of forecast can be completed in a very short time if the egf regf is pre calculated there will be no need for equation solving and the forecast is simply a summation over the product of the initial sea surface elevations and the corresponding egf regf there are three variables in swes of eq 1 viz sea surface elevation η and volume fluxes p and q in two horizontal directions in the forecast of water level in either a seismic tsunami chen et al 2015 or a tsunami due to submarine landslide chen et al 2020 only the response of sea surface elevation η to a concentrated impulsive increase of η is used that is why the gf rgf used in previous studies should be dubbed egf regf in the present study the other two variables viz volume fluxes p and q in x and y directions will be used as new gfs these two gfs are the flow response to an impulsive η increase and are dubbed flow gfs fgfs the relationship between fgf and egf will be discussed in sec 2 1 based on this relationship the rfgf will be proposed in sec 2 2 this rfgf is obtained by applying an impulsive forcing on a momentum equation and the physical meaning will be explained in sec 2 3 to test the feasibility of the regf rfgf approach in the simulation of nearshore inundation the method of direct inundation simulation will be introduced in sec 2 4 in sec 2 5 simplified methods such as the regf rfgf approach as well as the bell shaped wave method proposed by chen et al 2015 will be introduced in detail 2 1 egf and fgf due to an impulsive forcing in the continuity equation in previous studies a gf is the response of linear swes to an impulsive forcing of the continuity equation following chen et al 2020 this response is denoted as a vector g η which comprises three component gfs 2 g η r t r s η η p η q η where η η is the η response p η is the p response and q η the q response to a concentrated impulsive η increase by definition η η is the egf while p η and q η are fgfs thus the continuity equation x and y momentum equations of the linear swes can be rewritten for these gfs as 3 t η η x p η y q η δ t δ x x s δ y y s t p η g d x η η 0 t q η g d y η η 0 to obtain the egf and fgf the initial condition is given by assuming zero initial velocity and zero free surface elevation everywhere except for the source grid point x s y s where the velocity is still zero but the free surface elevation is unity the evolution of the initial condition with time is then calculated by a modified leap frog finite difference scheme in the validated cornell multigrid coupled tsunami model comcot liu et al 1998 wang and powell 2011 the numerical response η of all ocean points in the computational domain is the egf and the volume flux responses p and q are fgfs in x and y directions the fault rupture in a submarine earthquake is much faster than the water wave speed and hence the rupture process can be simply represented by initial sea surface elevations η s which are determined by sea bottom deformation after the fault rupture see e g chen et al 2015 in this way the flow and water surface at a vulnerable city can be derived by these three gfs by summing the product of the initial sea surface elevations and the corresponding gfs over the source zone for example the water surface is obtained by superposing the product of initial surface elevation η s at a source point r s x s y s in the rupture fault zone and the pre computed egf associated with the source point volume fluxes p and q can be obtained in a similar way thus by introducing an unknown vector 4 z η p q the flow and water surface can be briefly expressed as 5 z ω s g η r t r s η s r s d ω s the domain ωs is the source domain or the rupture zone where the initial surface elevation η s does not vanish the fgfs p η and q η are related to the egf η η instead of a strict mathematical proof the relationship of their absolute values can be preliminarily assigned in the following by some reasoning under the assumption of a simplified 1 d propagation in the x direction then the extension to 2 d without the progressiveness assumption will be adopted these presuppositions will be validated later in sec 3 1 for a progressive fourier component a gf becomes the absolute value multiplied by exp ik x i ω t and the x momentum equation of the swes in eq 3 becomes 6 ω p η k g d η η 0 consequently the magnitude of the fgf due to an impulsive η increase can be derived as 7 p η k ω g d η η g d η η note that in this derivation the wave velocity for shallow water waves ω k g d has been used as eq 6 suggests the magnitude of an fgf due to an impulsive sea surface increase is the egf times g d 2 2 reciprol flow green s functions rfgfs in a submarine earthquake the speed of fault rupture is much faster than the speed of water waves instantaneous sea bottom deformations give a similar deformation on the sea surface because there is not enough time for the energy to propagate away the fgfs in eq 2 are responses to an impulsive η increase and hence can represent the flow due to sea bottom deformations in an earthquake as shown in eq 5 thus by integrating over the rupture zone these fgfs multiplied by the initial sea surface elevations η s can be used to forecast tsunami flow near the coast or anywhere else however using fgfs to forecast tsunami flow will encounter a similar problem as in the forecast of sea surface elevation due to a seismic tsunami more than ten thousands of egfs are required for a megathrust like the tohoku tsunami to save computer time and hardware storage the reciprocal of egf is used in previous studies if the forecast is limited to just a few vulnerable cities as has been discussed in chen et al 2015 and chen et al 2020 similarly the reciprocal of an fgf is desirable if we want to save computer resources as an fgf is the flow response to an impulsive η its reciprocal should be an η response to impulsive flow the purpose of a reciprocal gf is to reduce the computer time and hardware storage in computing pre calculated gfs therefore usually an rfgf is computed with the impulse near the vulnerable coastal city just like an regf on the other hand both fgfs and egfs have impulse in the tsunami source area the reciprocity between fgf and rfgf is not straightforward because they have different units the former is the volume flow and the latter is the surface elevation thus a coefficient is required to ensure these two gfs have the same units and the quantity is reciprocal in this section this coefficient is determined based on the relation between flow and elevation gfs shown in eq 7 it should be noted that a comprehensive mathematical proof is not intended instead some reasoning based on the momentum equation is applied and a reasonable coefficient is estimated then a few numerical experiments in sec 3 1 are used to validate the reciprocal relation proposed in this study take the flow in the x direction as an example according to eq 7 the flow response is the sea surface response multiplied by g d similar to chen et al 2020 the gf due to an impulsive forcing in the x momentum equation is denoted as a vector g p which can be expressed in component form as 8 g p r t r s η p p p q p where η p is the η response while p p and q p are the p and q responses to an δ function on the right hand side of the x momentum equation that is the linear swes satisfied by g p can be rewritten as 9 t η p x p p y q p 0 t p p g d x η p δ t δ x x s δ y y s t q p g d y η p 0 the gf component η p is the reciprocal for an fgf and is the desired rfgf the problem now is to find out the coefficient for this rfgf so that it can take over the fgf so that the flow near the vulnerable city can be derived following eq 6 we apply the same assumption of 1 d progressive wave in the x direction by substituting this assumption into the x momentum equation and absolute value of the flux response p p will be the sea surface response η p multiplied by g d to be explicit 10 p p g d η p note that p p is the flow due to impulsive flux increase while η η is the sea surface elevation due to impulsive η increase both the initial impulse of p p and η η can be seen as the superposition of lots of component waves propagating outward from the source point for a progressive wave the flow is proportional to η as shown in eqs 7 and 10 therefore the ratio between each component wave in the initial η impulse and the corresponding component wave in the initial p impulse is the same as one component wave propagates from the source point to the receiver whether the wave is driven by an initialη or an initial p a component wave initially propagating toward a specific direction takes away a fixed portion of the total energy consequently η η p p a more important relation can be derived from eq 10 as 11 p η g d η η g d p p g d η p thus the rfgf is related to fgf by η p 1 g d p η and the coefficient between fgf and rfgf is 1 gd note that the sign for an fgf and an rfgf should be opposite because the wave direction changes when the source and the receiver exchange hence 12 η p p η g d similarly 13 η q q η g d eqs 12 and 13 will be validated numerically in sec 3 1 2 3 physical meaning of green s functions due to an impulsive forcing in the momentum equations based on the derivation of the previous section the physical meaning of rfgf for swes is explained as follows by definition volume flux is the integration of a velocity component from sea bottom to water surface and equals the average velocity multiplied by the undisturbed water depth d if the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity is uniform the volume flux vector and horizontal gradient operator are defined for brevity as v p q and h x y where p and q are respectively volume fluxes in two horizontal directions x and y if an impulsive forcing delta function is added on the right hand side of the continuity equation swes become 14 t η h v 0 t v g d h η e ˆ δ t δ x x s δ y y s where η is sea surface elevation and d is the undisturbed water depth g is the gravitational acceleration e ˆ is a unit vector usually pointing to the direction of tsunami wave propagation and x s y s is the location of the source point for the gf integrating the momentum eq over an infinitesimal space domain ω and a short period of time gives 0 0 d t ω t v g d h η d x d y e ˆ 0 0 ω δ t δ x x s δ y y s d x d y d t e ˆ the second term on the left hand side is negligible if the domain ω is small and the momentum equation can be simplified to 15 ω v d x d y t 0 ω v d x d y t 0 e ˆ that is the impulsively increased volume flux at t 0 equals 1 therefore the physical meaning of gfs in eq 8 are as follows η p is the η response while p p and q p are the p and q responses to a concentrated impulsive increase of volume flux p similarly η q is the η response p q are the p response and q q is the q response to the volume flux q at a point x s y s 2 4 direct simulation of nearshore inundation with a four layer nested grid both direct simulation and the reciprocal gfs including regfs and rfgfs employed in the present study use a modified leap frog finite difference scheme in the validated comcot liu et al 1998 wang and powell 2011 as a tsunami inundates on land and recedes back to sea the sea land boundary moves as well a wet dry boundary condition thus has been used in the inundation simulation of comcot in a direct simulation of nearshore inundation usually a nested grid system is applied to increase the resolution of a structured grid near the shore the same strategy is utilized in comcot a coarse grid offshore can save considerable computer time without much trade off on the accuracy on the other hand simulation of inundation over land needs fine spatial resolution to conserve water mass imamura 2009 extending such high resolution to offshore tsunami simulation is not feasible because it requires too much ram and computer time thus a nested grid that employs coarser offshore grids and finer nearshore grids is a good strategy for a structured grid as the transition between coarser and finer grids should be smooth to avoid numerical instabilities four levels of nested grid are used in the present study in the present study two submarine earthquake scenarios dubbed case 1 and case 2 are used to test simplified approaches for nearshore inundation which will be explained in sec 2 5 the parameters for these two earthquakes are given in tables 1 and 2 the scenarios are chosen because these two cases respectively represent normally and obliquely incident tsunamis besides the wave height at the offshore boundary of layer 4 in these two cases is quite similar tsunamis generated in case 1 and case 2 both have approximately 1 8 m wave height at 137 water depth for both cases 1 and 2 uniform ruptures at a rectangular area are assumed at the focal depth with the length and width following the regression formula of wells and coppersmith 1994 then after applying the elastic half space dislocation theory of mansinha and smylie 1971 the initial sea surface elevation is obtained the details can be found in say chen et al 2015 this initial sea surface elevation is used in layer 1 as the initial condition for linear swes 1 the evolution in time describes the propagation of linear tsunami waves and is integrated by comcot by exchanging sea levels and volume fluxes on the boundary between different layers the tsunami propagates further into layer 2 3 and 4 after the tsunami wave enters the smallest layer 4 where the resolution is finest the sea surface and volume fluxes are governed by more complicated nonlinear swes ζ t p x q y 0 16 p t x p 2 h y p q h g h ζ x τ x ρ 0 q t x p q h y q 2 h g h ζ y τ y ρ 0 where h d η is the total water depth and τ is the bottom shear stress with a subscript representing its direction all other symbols are the same as eq 1 the bathymetries of the four domains used in the present study are shown in fig 1 layer 1 shown in fig 1 a covers the area 114 129 e and 14 26 n including taiwan the luzon strait and luzon island philippines this layer has the coarsest grid of 1 min spatial resolution layers 2 is chosen as the area enclosed by the red rectangle of fig 1 a and includes the whole of southern taiwan the bathymetry of layer 2 shown in fig 1 b has 0 2 min resolution layer 3 is even smaller and has 0 04 min resolution as shown in fig 1 c and the red rectangle of fig 1 b the smallest layer 4 domain is inside the nanwan bay in the southern tip of taiwan with 0 0133 min resolution in the domain shown in fig 1 d and the red rectangle of fig 1 c the bathymetry of layer 1 is based on etope1 data and layer 2 is taken from ocean data bank founded by taiwan s ministry of science and technology most and operated by the institute of oceanography national taiwan university bathymetry of layers 3 and 4 are obtained by interpolation of layer 2 to see how the tsunami wave evolves in its way toward shore 18 locations are chosen along three meridional lines extended from the boundary of the finest layer 4 domain to the land sea boundary the bathymetry the location of these 18 points and the three lines in red are all shown in fig 2 there are six points on each red line with the most northerly two points are located on land before the tsunami arrives these three red lines are not evenly distributed two lines are in the west of the domain because a nuclear power station in the western area of the bay is the focus of the inundation simulation the waveform change is not recorded in the east part of the domain where high cliffs make inundation impossible 2 5 nearshore inundation simulation based on reciprocal elevation and flow green s functions the regf rfgf approach only simulates the smallest domain layer 4 with boundary conditions provided by regfs rfgfs at the offshore boundary for the simulation domain the offshore boundary is the only boundary connected to the sea and all the tsunami information should be transmitted through it thus the water surface and flow due to a tsunami should be provided on every point along the offshore boundary although the simulation domain for layer 4 is not wide the total number of grid points at the boundary is as many as 225 to obtain the water surface and flow at these 225 points 225 regfs and 450 rfgfs are required this is not feasible as the purpose of the present study in addition to obtaining an accurate forecast of inundation is to forecast inundation economically therefore as part of the methodology a simplification is proposed as follows five stations on the ocean side boundary of layer 4 are chosen as shown by the five red numbers in fig 1 d the time series of water surface and two horizontal flows are obtained by eq 5 where the corresponding regf and rfgf are substituted into the green s function vector g η and the integral is replaced by summation in discretized digital computation over the rupture zone because the computational domain is small compared with the wavelength of a tsunami the sea surface and horizontal flows on the offshore boundary vary mildly under the incidence of a tsunami the boundary water level and boundary flow used to force the inundation simulation at neighbouring points are supposed to be very close to each other hence very accurate boundary conditions are determined only at selected stations conditions at other boundary points between these stations are derived by interpolation and the computer time and computation efforts become significantly reduced thus with the aid of regfs and rfgfs time series of p q and η are derived at five stations on the ocean side boundary of layer 4 p q and η at each boundary point are interpolated from these five stations to provide the desired boundary conditions for the inundation simulation inside the nanwan bay these five stations are evenly distributed so that the error in interpolation can be minimized as is shown in fig 1 d usually in the middle of the simulation domain is the area of most concern in the study of tsunami inundation the edge of the domain outside the range of these five stations is not as important as the central part therefore boundary conditions for the edge of the domain are not carefully treated in the present study the boundary conditions of the edge stations are simply extended to points outside these five stations that is for boundary points to the west of the first station the conditions on the first station are applied for boundary points to the east of the fifth station the conditions on the fifth station are applied for both cases 1 and 2 the sea bottom dislocation is applied in the regf rfgf approach as the initial condition just as done in the direct comcot simulation as the linear superposition of eq 5 applies only for a linear system the linear layers 1 to 3 of the nested grid in the direct 4 layer simulation will be replaced by regfs and rfgfs along the boundary between layers 3 and 4 then instead of the nested simulation in the layer 4 regfs and rfgfs will be used to derive the boundary condition for the smallest nanwan bay domain which is exactly the layer 4 domain similar to the direct simulation over the 4 layer nested grid the nonlinear swes of eq 16 is used in the nearshore inundation and the wet dry boundary condition is used on the shoreline after the simulation the result of the regf rfgf approach proposed in the present study is then compared with the direct 4 layer comcot simulation at 18 locations along three meridional lines across the shoreline as points no 1 18 shown in fig 2 points no 6 12 and 18 are on the offshore boundary where the boundary conditions are derived by interpolating the water elevation and the flow cross and along the boundary at five stations shown in fig 1 d points no 1 2 7 8 13 and 14 are on land and represent the tsunami inundation the three meridional lines are not evenly distributed two lines are in the west of the domain because what happens to the nuclear power station in the west of the bay is the main purpose of the inundation study besides the regf rfgf approach a simplified bell shaped wave approach employed in chen et al 2015 is also used this previous approach does not use a complicated nested grid system just one linear layer is used to determine the offshore condition for inundation simulation to make sure the land boundary does not interfere with the tsunami in the coarse grid the offshore boundary is chosen outside nanwan bay further away from the shoreline for both cases 1 and 2 by summing the product of the initial water surface and the regf the water elevation at this farther offshore station is obtained and the incident tsunami wave height is derived with this wave height and a time scale of 20 min an incident bell shaped wave is constructed this bell shaped wave will serve as the offshore boundary condition for a nearshore inundation simulation under the framework of nonlinear swes of eq 16 with 0 0133 min resolution which is the same as both the direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach the simulated inundation at the 18 locations of fig 2 along three meridional lines is also compared with the 4 layer direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach 3 results in this section the reciprocity of fgfs and rfgfs is first validated in sec 3 1 which is proposed in eqs 12 and 13 then a normally incident tsunami scenario case 1 sec 3 2 and an obliquely incident tsunami scenario case 2 sec 3 3 are used to verify the applicability of the regf rfgf approach in the simulation of nearshore inundation 3 1 reciprocity of fgf and rfgf three stations a b and c of different water depths and latitudes in the india ocean are used to test the reciprocity of fgfs and rfgfs this reciprocity proposed in sec 2 2 can be stated as follows the x and y volume fluxes induced by an impulsive unit η increase at the source point x s y s are the η response due to an impulsive unit x and y volume fluxes at the vulnerable city multiplied by gd the computational domain is shown in fig 3 where the location of these three stations and the bathymetry of the whole domain are shown the bathymetry is based on etope1 data with 1 min resolution as has been discussed in previous studies chen et al 2015 the magnitude of an egf is proportional to the grid area the same principle applies to an rfgf according to the physical meaning discussed in sec 2 3 the initial impulsive increase of both volume fluxes is proportional to the grid area and hence gfs as the response to the forcing are also proportional to the area of the source grid cell for spherical coordinate system receiver grid and source grid have unequal grid area and hence the rfgf is not exactly reciprocal unless it is multiplied by the area ratio of the source grid area to the receiver grid area for 1 min resolution the grid width varies with latitude and hence the area of each grid cell is proportional to the cosine of the latitude in this way the reciprocity for each volume flux p or q can be tested for each pair of stations the reciprocity is between a source point and a receiver point hence there are three combinations of reciprocal stations viz a and b b and c c and a besides there are x and y components for volume fluxes hence two reciprocity relations exist for each pair of reciprocal stations and the total number of reciprocal pairs is 6 for these three stations take stations a and b for example let η p be the η response at station a due to an impulsive unit increase of volume flux p at station b while p η is the p response at station b due to an impulsive unit increase of η at station a according to eq 12 η p is p η divided by gd note that p and q are the average velocities multiplied by the water depth d therefore the average velocities at b due to unit η increase at the station a are the η response due to an impulsive unit p and q at station b multiplied by g fig 4 shows the result of the reciprocity comparison the blue curve in fig 4 a is the average x velocity at station b caused by unit η increase at station a or the fgf p η divided by the water depth 3164 m the red curve is the rfgf η p which is the η at station a caused by unit p increase at station b then multiplied by g where the negative sign is due to the wave directions from stations a to b and from b to a these two curves are very close suggesting eq 12 holds with high accuracy similar agreement between the other 5 reciprocal pairs can be found two more examples are shown below the same reciprocity of η and p between stations a and c is given in fig 4 b and the reciprocity of η and q between stations a and b is given in fig 4 c that is the blue curve in fig 4 b is the average x velocity at station a caused by unit η increase at station c which is the fgf divided by the water depth 235 m the red curve is the rfgf which is the η at station c caused by unit p increase at station a then also multiplied by g because of the opposite wave propagation directions from stations c to a and from a to c the blue curve in fig 4 c is the y fgf which is the q at station b caused by unit η increase at station a divided by the water depth 3157 m the red curve is the rfgf which is the η at station a caused by unit q increase at station b then multiplied by g where the negative sign is due to opposite wave directions from stations a to b and from b to a these panels in fig 4 show p and q due to unit η increase are exactly gd multiplied by the η due to unit p and q increases as has been proposed in sec 2 3 it should be noted that a staggered grid configuration is employed in comcot where η is the water surface at the center of the grid cell and p and q are x and y volume fluxes at the cell edge thus p represents the x flow zonally half a grid away from the center of the grid while q represents the y flow meridionally half a grid away from the grid center the water depths in calculation p and q are different even if they represent the flow for the same grid cell 3 2 nearshore inundation with normal incident tsunamis in a bay south of taiwan as has been explained in sec 2 4 the normally incident tsunami with the initial water surface of fig 5 is generated by the earthquake parameters of table 2 the fault is to the south of nanwan bay with a 270 strike angle so that the tsunami will propagate northward into the bay η p and q at the five stations of fig 1 d are calculated by the direct comcot simulation with the nested 4 layer grid the results at station 3 are represented by the red curve of fig 6 a c on the other side reciprocal elevation and flow gfs regfs and rfgfs at the five stations are calculated by comcot with the first three layers of the nested grid then η p and q at the five stations are calculated by combining reciprocal gfs and the initial water surface of fig 5 the results at station 3 are represented by the blue curve of fig 6 a c the offshore tsunami information can be accurately derived by the reciprocal elevation and flow gfs note that because of the staggered grid of comcot locations and water depths in calculating p q and η may have half a grid difference in fig 6 besides the regf rfgf approach a simplified bell shaped approach employed in chen et al 2015 is also used outside nanwan bay a further offshore station of 137 m water depth is chosen as shown in fig 7 a by summing the product of the initial water surface of fig 5 and the regf the water elevation at this offshore station is obtained in fig 7 b and the incident tsunami wave height is derived with this wave height and a time scale of 20 min an incident bell shaped wave is constructed as the offshore boundary condition for a simulation of nearshore inundation the simulated inundation at the 18 locations of fig 2 along three meridional lines is also compared with the 4 layer direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach the comparison of tsunami waveform from the inland inundation back to the offshore station is shown in fig 8 fig 8 a is the comparison along the west line of fig 2 with points no 1 and 2 on land while point no 6 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 58 and 1 93 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 0 4 m and 4 92 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and hence the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline fig 8 b is the comparison along the middle line of fig 2 with points 7 and 8 on land while point 12 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 55 and 1 87 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 3 27 and 23 81 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline fig 8 c is the comparison along the east line of fig 2 with points 13 and 14 on land while point 18 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 65 and 3 35 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 8 99 m and 57 12 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and once again the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline for regions of high nonlinearity such as the west line the waveform calculated by rgf boundary conditions is very close to the direct simulation for the middle and east lines the consistency is not as good as the west line therefore nonlinearity is not a problem on the other hand the waveform in the deep water is also very close to direct comcot simulation and hence linearity does not necessarily make the simulation worse it is concluded that the bathymetric change in the middle may change the waveform less mildly the bell shaped incident tsunami gives a different waveform from the offshore point to the point on land however the wave height provided by this simple approach is still reasonable and sometimes very close to the direct simulation the 20 min time scale seems to be an overestimate for a mw 8 earthquake the comparison of water surface along three comparison lines is quite good for both the regf rfgf approach and direct comcot simulation the bell shaped wave significantly overestimates the inundation time extension partly due to the fact that the scenario earthquake is relatively small and the 20 min time scale is an overestimate however the bell shaped wave can correctly represent the highest water level of inundation which is consistent with previous studies of chen et al 2015 3 3 nearshore inundation with oblique incident tsunamis in a bay south of taiwan the obliquely incident tsunami with the initial water surface of fig 9 is generated by the earthquake parameters of table 3 the fault is to the northeast of nanwan bay so that the tsunami will propagate south westwards into the bay as is shown in fig 10 the regf and rfgf can accurately provide the offshore tsunami information at either the station 3 of 65 m depth or the offshore station of 137 m depth see table 4 the comparison of tsunami waveform along three red lines from the inland inundation back to the offshore station is shown in fig 11 fig 11 a is the comparison at points 1 6 along the line on the west side of the map shown in fig 2 where points 1 2 are on land and point 6 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 58 and 1 93 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 0 4 and 4 92 m as the six panels of fig 11 a show the regf rfgf approach gives a waveform quite close to that of the direct 4 layer simulation the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline suggesting an regf rfgf approach is not affected by nonlinearity fig 11 b is the comparison at points 7 12 along the middle line of fig 2 with points 7 8 on land while point 12 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 55 and 1 87 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 3 27 and 23 81 m fig 11 c is the comparison along the east line of fig 2 with points 13 14 on land while point 18 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 65 and 3 35 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 8 99 and 57 12 m the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m but the water depth in the middle and the east lines is deeper than the west line as they are close to the center of nanwan bay the regf rfgf approach gives good results which is consistent with the direct 4 layer simulation but the discrepancy is a little higher than the west line the discrepancy may be attributed to the bathymetry near the middle and the east line the water depth is deeper and hence the spatial variation is larger than the west line in the regf rfgf approach the flow and water elevation on the boundary are interpolated among the five stations as the boundary condition this interpolation is based on the distance to the neighbouring station without considering the water depth thus if the bathymetry does not change smoothly the boundary condition may not be very accurate and discrepancies may occur unlike case 1 where the wave height can be reasonably estimated by a bell shaped wave significant overestimate of wave height can be easily seen in case 2 if the obliquely incident tsunami is replaced by a bell shaped wave of 20 min time scale at some points the oblique incident tsunami only reaches half the height of the bell shaped wave thus using the regf rfgf is a significant improvement 4 discussions and conclusion 4 1 computer time comparison of various approaches in inundation simulation besides accuracy the efficiency of the regf rfgf method is compared with the direct simulation for desktop pcs with ddr4 2666 16 gb ram and an intel i5 9600 k cpu the cpu time for the 4 layer nested direct simulation is 1260 s for the rfgf approach with the same desktop pc the most time consuming part is the simulation of the nearshore inundation which applies nonlinear swes over the layer 4 domain and takes 90 s the simulation of nearshore inundation is driven by boundary conditions from the offshore side therefore the sea surface or the flow at the offshore grid point should be calculated first employing regfs and rfgfs the average time required to obtain the sea surface or the flow in either x or y direction is 0 6 s for the regf rfgf approach there are two ways of proceeding one is to derive the sea surface and two horizontal flows for each point on the offshore boundary in the example of nanwan bay used in the present study there are 225 boundary points and hence the boundary condition requires 405 s 225 0 6 3 and the total computation takes 495 s the other approach does not calculate each point accurately by regf rfgf instead the boundary condition at neighbouring points are supposed to be very close to each other and hence very accurate water surface and flow are calculated only at selected points flows and water levels at other points on the offshore boundary are derived by interpolation for example if 5 points are chosen as indicated by fig 1 d flows and water levels at 5 locations will take 9 s 5 3 0 6 while interpolation and other arrangements to set the offshore boundary conditions takes 10 s the total computer time is 109 s for the approach using a bell shaped wave chen et al 2015 the offshore condition is assumed uniform and only the incident tsunami height is required therefore the total simulation time is 90 6 s 4 2 applicability of regf rfgf and bell shaped wave approaches in nearshore inundation for both cases 1 and 2 the regf rfgf approach gives a waveform very close in comparison with the 4 layer direct simulation even for the on land inundation of tsunami this approach used less than one tenth of the computer time than the direct simulation 109 1260 and can be considered as the most comprehensive method so that accuracy and economy are in good balance if it is desirable to reduce the already minor discrepancies one may calculate the water level and flows at every boundary point in this case the computer time is less than one half of the direct simulation 495 1260 thus it is still a significant improvement in computational efficiency on the other hand the most economical way to simulate the nearshore inundation is to use the simplest bell shaped tsunami however the simulation of land inundation is not very accurate for obliquely incident tsunami and the reduced computer time is very minor compared to the regf rfgf approach nevertheless if the tsunami is normally incident simulating the nearshore inundation by a bell shaped tsunami can still generate a very similar inundation area furthermore as the incident tsunami is determined by the wave height in this simplified approach only a limited number of simulations are required and can be pre calculated thus for any incident tsunami height the inundation map is obtained by interpolating the distance to the shoreline chen et al 2015 in this way the inundation map can be obtained very quickly and no real time simulations are needed as long as the offshore tsunami flow is nearly perpendicular to the shore 4 3 water depth and the applicability of linear swes both regfs and rfgfs are fundamental solutions of linear swes and hence should be used when the tsunami wave amplitude is small for both the kinematic and the dynamic free surface boundary conditions the ratio between the nonlinear term and the leading linear term is approximately the wave amplitude divided by the water depth this ratio is the nonlinear parameter for shallow water waves and can be used to determine the applicability of linear swes if the offshore water depth is deeper than 50 m shuto 1991 linear swe is always valid and the regf rfgf approach is always applicable if the nearshore water depth is not as deep as 50 m the linearity assumption still holds as long as the wave amplitude is much smaller than the water depth the water depth and the linearity of tsunami waves at the offshore boundary is briefly discussed in this section in the two cases used in the present study the tsunami wave height is about 4 6 m at the outer boundary and the wave amplitude is 2 3m based on table 1 the water depth at station 3 65 m is much larger than the wave amplitude and the linearity can be guaranteed to the west and east of station 3 water depths at stations 2 and 4 are respectively 38 and 29 m the maximum wave amplitude is respectively 2 7 and 2 2 m and the corresponding nonlinear parameter is below 0 076 hence the nonlinearity contributes less than 1 10 of the linear wave amplitude and the application of gfs is also justified the outermost boundary stations stations 1 and 5 have the shallowest depths 10 and 12 m while the maximum wave amplitude is as high as 3 m hence the accuracy of linear swes is marginal because the ratio between the wave amplitude and the water depth reaches 0 3 however the edge of the domain is not as important as the central part because the middle of the simulation domain is the area of most concern thus using linear swes and gfs for the offshore boundary condition is reasonable and can be applied in constructing the boundary condition for nearshore inundation credit authorship contribution statement guan yu chen conceptualization chin chu liu validation declaration of competing

21728,in addition to the elevation green s function which is known as the numerical green s function in previous tsunami studies a new type of green s function for shallow water equations is proposed this new green s function is the flow response due to impulsive initial sea surface increase and is dubbed the flow green s function based on the momentum equation its reciprocity to sea surface response for impulsive initial flow is suggested and is shown numerically that is the x and y volume fluxes at the vulnerable city x y caused by an impulsive increase of the unit sea surface η at the source point x s y s are exactly the η response at x s y s caused by an impulsive unit x and y volume fluxes at x y multiplied by the negative gravitational acceleration and the water depth at x y the later will be called a reciprocal flow green s function as reciprocal flow green s functions include information on wave direction by combing reciprocal elevation green s functions known as reciprocal green s functions in previous tsunami studies they can be used as an accurate boundary condition for the simulation of nearshore inundation this new approach is proposed and compared with direct tsunami simulation for both normally case 1 and obliquely case 2 incident tsunamis the accuracy of the new approach is similar to a direct simulation and is a significant improvement compared with a simplified bell shaped wave approach the computer time is significantly reduced compared with direct simulations keywords tsunami inundation shallow water equations reciprocal elevation green s function reciprocal flow green s function 1 introduction inundation maps or hazard maps are essential for tsunami hazard mitigation based on the inundation map affected people can understand whether evacuation is necessary and decide where they should shelter thus it helps displaced people to survive a tsunami hazard the more comprehensive the tsunami information is the more useful the hazard map will be usually an inundation map is precomputed by simulating the tsunami scenario from the beginning of a tsunamigenic earthquake to the inundation in the vulnerable city and different scenarios have to be simulated separately as an inundation map is obtained through a detailed nearshore simulation and the process is very time consuming the simulation of various scenarios needs extensive resources and utilizing the simulation results is a large burden to hazard mitigation agencies when a submarine earthquake occurs various methods can be used to identify the most similar scenario and the corresponding hazard map is selected for example in the japan meteorological agency seismic waves are analysed and a linear interpolation scheme is used to determine the proper scenario see e g tatehata 1997 other methods also include analysis of the tsunami waveform see e g gusman et al 2014 another approach for generating a hazard map is to real time simulate the inundation see e g musa et al 2018 titov et al 2005 as mentioned earlier this will involve lots of computer time and is usually not adopted however as computer science advances and more and more supercomputers become available it is now possible to employ a real time simulation in a tsunami event employing above mentioned approaches to generate inundation maps may encounter problems hazard maps based on scenario analysis can be prepared beforehand and hence can be obtained quickly however numerous scenarios have to be prepared so that scenarios similar to the tsunami event can be found and a more accurate map can be obtained by interpolation if the risk of tsunamigenic earthquakes is underestimated the location and magnitude of the earthquake may be beyond the pre calculated scenarios as extrapolation usually does not work in such a nonlinear phenomenon a proper hazard map cannot be obtained for a real time simulation approach the input information is not limited by the proposed scenarios the hazard map generated in this way can reflect the real situation and should be more accurate and applicable than other approaches however as a great deal of computational resources are required real time simulation is limited to a small vulnerable area and cannot be extended to most coastal areas simplified approaches such as combing a uniform beach slope and using an analytic solution chen et al 2012 lin et al 2014 have been proposed which can provide the inundation limit but the accuracy and resolution are limited when compared to both real time simulations and scenario analyses besides another alternative approach has been proposed chen et al 2015 where the inundation map is calculated with a normally incident bell shaped wave having a 20 min time scale the inundation map of this simple waveform has a very similar inundation area with that due to an earthquake scenario that generates a tsunami of the same offshore wave height however the bell shaped wave approach applies well only when the tsunami propagates perpendicularly toward shore if that is not the case this approach will significantly overestimate the inundation as will be demonstrated in case 2 of the present study that is in practice existing approaches to obtain hazard maps are not perfect and can be improved numerical green s functions gfs see e g wei et al 2003 and reciprocal gfs see e g loomis 1979 chen et al 2015 have previously been applied in seismic tsunami forecast this kind of forecast can be completed in a very short time if the gfs are pre calculated there will be no need for equation solving and the forecast of the water surface is simply a superposition over the product of the initial sea surface elevation and the corresponding gf or reciprocal gf however superposition is applicable in a linear regime while tsunami inundation is highly nonlinear although inundation maps cannot be directly derived from gfs like the offshore water level gfs can help to complete a nearshore simulation more quickly and conveniently for this purpose a new kind of gf is suggested in the present study and its applicability in the simulation of tsunami inundation is proposed this new gf is the flow response to impulsive sea surface disturbances and is called a flow gf fgf in the present study an fgf is different from an elevation gfs egf known as gf in previous tsunami studies which is the response of sea surface elevation η to a concentrated impulsive increase of η both egf and its reciprocal reciprocal egf regf known as rgf in previous tsunami studies are both water surface elevations see e g chen et al 2015 chen and liu 2009 and chen et al 2020 however by definition the reciprocal fgf rfgf should reference to a water surface induced by a flow the reciprocity between fgf and rfgf is not straightforward because they have different units the rfgf will be proposed and the reciprocity will be demonstrated in the present study with the aid of rfgf in addition to regf used in previous studies nearshore inundation can be computed with improved accuracy and the computer time can be significantly reduced compared to real time simulation in the present study this proposed approach is called the regf rfgf method and the details will be explained in sec 2 5 for obliquely incident tsunamis the regf rfgf approach gives inundation water levels significantly lower than the simplified bell shaped waveform approach proposed in chen et al 2015 thus overestimation of coastal inundation will be avoided if the regf rfgf approach is employed in a complete inundation simulation usually a nested grid system is applied simulation of inundation on land needs very fine spatial resolution to conserve water mass imamura 2009 extending a resolution of 25 m or finer to offshore tsunami simulation is not feasible because it requires too much ram and computer time thus using a nested grid is a good strategy for a structured grid 2 methodology unlike analytic gfs for homogeneous medium and infinite domain the present study employs numerical gfs based on linear shallow water equations swes t η x p y q 0 1 t p g d x η 0 t q g d y η 0 where η is the free surface elevation p and q are fluxes along the x and y directions t is time g is gravitational acceleration and d is the water depth taken from the real bathymetry numerical gfs include both the bathymetric inhomogeneity and boundary conditions numerical egfs dubbed gfs in previous studies or regf dubbed rgfs in previous studies have previously been applied in seismic tsunami forecasting e g wei et al 2003 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 this kind of forecast can be completed in a very short time if the egf regf is pre calculated there will be no need for equation solving and the forecast is simply a summation over the product of the initial sea surface elevations and the corresponding egf regf there are three variables in swes of eq 1 viz sea surface elevation η and volume fluxes p and q in two horizontal directions in the forecast of water level in either a seismic tsunami chen et al 2015 or a tsunami due to submarine landslide chen et al 2020 only the response of sea surface elevation η to a concentrated impulsive increase of η is used that is why the gf rgf used in previous studies should be dubbed egf regf in the present study the other two variables viz volume fluxes p and q in x and y directions will be used as new gfs these two gfs are the flow response to an impulsive η increase and are dubbed flow gfs fgfs the relationship between fgf and egf will be discussed in sec 2 1 based on this relationship the rfgf will be proposed in sec 2 2 this rfgf is obtained by applying an impulsive forcing on a momentum equation and the physical meaning will be explained in sec 2 3 to test the feasibility of the regf rfgf approach in the simulation of nearshore inundation the method of direct inundation simulation will be introduced in sec 2 4 in sec 2 5 simplified methods such as the regf rfgf approach as well as the bell shaped wave method proposed by chen et al 2015 will be introduced in detail 2 1 egf and fgf due to an impulsive forcing in the continuity equation in previous studies a gf is the response of linear swes to an impulsive forcing of the continuity equation following chen et al 2020 this response is denoted as a vector g η which comprises three component gfs 2 g η r t r s η η p η q η where η η is the η response p η is the p response and q η the q response to a concentrated impulsive η increase by definition η η is the egf while p η and q η are fgfs thus the continuity equation x and y momentum equations of the linear swes can be rewritten for these gfs as 3 t η η x p η y q η δ t δ x x s δ y y s t p η g d x η η 0 t q η g d y η η 0 to obtain the egf and fgf the initial condition is given by assuming zero initial velocity and zero free surface elevation everywhere except for the source grid point x s y s where the velocity is still zero but the free surface elevation is unity the evolution of the initial condition with time is then calculated by a modified leap frog finite difference scheme in the validated cornell multigrid coupled tsunami model comcot liu et al 1998 wang and powell 2011 the numerical response η of all ocean points in the computational domain is the egf and the volume flux responses p and q are fgfs in x and y directions the fault rupture in a submarine earthquake is much faster than the water wave speed and hence the rupture process can be simply represented by initial sea surface elevations η s which are determined by sea bottom deformation after the fault rupture see e g chen et al 2015 in this way the flow and water surface at a vulnerable city can be derived by these three gfs by summing the product of the initial sea surface elevations and the corresponding gfs over the source zone for example the water surface is obtained by superposing the product of initial surface elevation η s at a source point r s x s y s in the rupture fault zone and the pre computed egf associated with the source point volume fluxes p and q can be obtained in a similar way thus by introducing an unknown vector 4 z η p q the flow and water surface can be briefly expressed as 5 z ω s g η r t r s η s r s d ω s the domain ωs is the source domain or the rupture zone where the initial surface elevation η s does not vanish the fgfs p η and q η are related to the egf η η instead of a strict mathematical proof the relationship of their absolute values can be preliminarily assigned in the following by some reasoning under the assumption of a simplified 1 d propagation in the x direction then the extension to 2 d without the progressiveness assumption will be adopted these presuppositions will be validated later in sec 3 1 for a progressive fourier component a gf becomes the absolute value multiplied by exp ik x i ω t and the x momentum equation of the swes in eq 3 becomes 6 ω p η k g d η η 0 consequently the magnitude of the fgf due to an impulsive η increase can be derived as 7 p η k ω g d η η g d η η note that in this derivation the wave velocity for shallow water waves ω k g d has been used as eq 6 suggests the magnitude of an fgf due to an impulsive sea surface increase is the egf times g d 2 2 reciprol flow green s functions rfgfs in a submarine earthquake the speed of fault rupture is much faster than the speed of water waves instantaneous sea bottom deformations give a similar deformation on the sea surface because there is not enough time for the energy to propagate away the fgfs in eq 2 are responses to an impulsive η increase and hence can represent the flow due to sea bottom deformations in an earthquake as shown in eq 5 thus by integrating over the rupture zone these fgfs multiplied by the initial sea surface elevations η s can be used to forecast tsunami flow near the coast or anywhere else however using fgfs to forecast tsunami flow will encounter a similar problem as in the forecast of sea surface elevation due to a seismic tsunami more than ten thousands of egfs are required for a megathrust like the tohoku tsunami to save computer time and hardware storage the reciprocal of egf is used in previous studies if the forecast is limited to just a few vulnerable cities as has been discussed in chen et al 2015 and chen et al 2020 similarly the reciprocal of an fgf is desirable if we want to save computer resources as an fgf is the flow response to an impulsive η its reciprocal should be an η response to impulsive flow the purpose of a reciprocal gf is to reduce the computer time and hardware storage in computing pre calculated gfs therefore usually an rfgf is computed with the impulse near the vulnerable coastal city just like an regf on the other hand both fgfs and egfs have impulse in the tsunami source area the reciprocity between fgf and rfgf is not straightforward because they have different units the former is the volume flow and the latter is the surface elevation thus a coefficient is required to ensure these two gfs have the same units and the quantity is reciprocal in this section this coefficient is determined based on the relation between flow and elevation gfs shown in eq 7 it should be noted that a comprehensive mathematical proof is not intended instead some reasoning based on the momentum equation is applied and a reasonable coefficient is estimated then a few numerical experiments in sec 3 1 are used to validate the reciprocal relation proposed in this study take the flow in the x direction as an example according to eq 7 the flow response is the sea surface response multiplied by g d similar to chen et al 2020 the gf due to an impulsive forcing in the x momentum equation is denoted as a vector g p which can be expressed in component form as 8 g p r t r s η p p p q p where η p is the η response while p p and q p are the p and q responses to an δ function on the right hand side of the x momentum equation that is the linear swes satisfied by g p can be rewritten as 9 t η p x p p y q p 0 t p p g d x η p δ t δ x x s δ y y s t q p g d y η p 0 the gf component η p is the reciprocal for an fgf and is the desired rfgf the problem now is to find out the coefficient for this rfgf so that it can take over the fgf so that the flow near the vulnerable city can be derived following eq 6 we apply the same assumption of 1 d progressive wave in the x direction by substituting this assumption into the x momentum equation and absolute value of the flux response p p will be the sea surface response η p multiplied by g d to be explicit 10 p p g d η p note that p p is the flow due to impulsive flux increase while η η is the sea surface elevation due to impulsive η increase both the initial impulse of p p and η η can be seen as the superposition of lots of component waves propagating outward from the source point for a progressive wave the flow is proportional to η as shown in eqs 7 and 10 therefore the ratio between each component wave in the initial η impulse and the corresponding component wave in the initial p impulse is the same as one component wave propagates from the source point to the receiver whether the wave is driven by an initialη or an initial p a component wave initially propagating toward a specific direction takes away a fixed portion of the total energy consequently η η p p a more important relation can be derived from eq 10 as 11 p η g d η η g d p p g d η p thus the rfgf is related to fgf by η p 1 g d p η and the coefficient between fgf and rfgf is 1 gd note that the sign for an fgf and an rfgf should be opposite because the wave direction changes when the source and the receiver exchange hence 12 η p p η g d similarly 13 η q q η g d eqs 12 and 13 will be validated numerically in sec 3 1 2 3 physical meaning of green s functions due to an impulsive forcing in the momentum equations based on the derivation of the previous section the physical meaning of rfgf for swes is explained as follows by definition volume flux is the integration of a velocity component from sea bottom to water surface and equals the average velocity multiplied by the undisturbed water depth d if the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity is uniform the volume flux vector and horizontal gradient operator are defined for brevity as v p q and h x y where p and q are respectively volume fluxes in two horizontal directions x and y if an impulsive forcing delta function is added on the right hand side of the continuity equation swes become 14 t η h v 0 t v g d h η e ˆ δ t δ x x s δ y y s where η is sea surface elevation and d is the undisturbed water depth g is the gravitational acceleration e ˆ is a unit vector usually pointing to the direction of tsunami wave propagation and x s y s is the location of the source point for the gf integrating the momentum eq over an infinitesimal space domain ω and a short period of time gives 0 0 d t ω t v g d h η d x d y e ˆ 0 0 ω δ t δ x x s δ y y s d x d y d t e ˆ the second term on the left hand side is negligible if the domain ω is small and the momentum equation can be simplified to 15 ω v d x d y t 0 ω v d x d y t 0 e ˆ that is the impulsively increased volume flux at t 0 equals 1 therefore the physical meaning of gfs in eq 8 are as follows η p is the η response while p p and q p are the p and q responses to a concentrated impulsive increase of volume flux p similarly η q is the η response p q are the p response and q q is the q response to the volume flux q at a point x s y s 2 4 direct simulation of nearshore inundation with a four layer nested grid both direct simulation and the reciprocal gfs including regfs and rfgfs employed in the present study use a modified leap frog finite difference scheme in the validated comcot liu et al 1998 wang and powell 2011 as a tsunami inundates on land and recedes back to sea the sea land boundary moves as well a wet dry boundary condition thus has been used in the inundation simulation of comcot in a direct simulation of nearshore inundation usually a nested grid system is applied to increase the resolution of a structured grid near the shore the same strategy is utilized in comcot a coarse grid offshore can save considerable computer time without much trade off on the accuracy on the other hand simulation of inundation over land needs fine spatial resolution to conserve water mass imamura 2009 extending such high resolution to offshore tsunami simulation is not feasible because it requires too much ram and computer time thus a nested grid that employs coarser offshore grids and finer nearshore grids is a good strategy for a structured grid as the transition between coarser and finer grids should be smooth to avoid numerical instabilities four levels of nested grid are used in the present study in the present study two submarine earthquake scenarios dubbed case 1 and case 2 are used to test simplified approaches for nearshore inundation which will be explained in sec 2 5 the parameters for these two earthquakes are given in tables 1 and 2 the scenarios are chosen because these two cases respectively represent normally and obliquely incident tsunamis besides the wave height at the offshore boundary of layer 4 in these two cases is quite similar tsunamis generated in case 1 and case 2 both have approximately 1 8 m wave height at 137 water depth for both cases 1 and 2 uniform ruptures at a rectangular area are assumed at the focal depth with the length and width following the regression formula of wells and coppersmith 1994 then after applying the elastic half space dislocation theory of mansinha and smylie 1971 the initial sea surface elevation is obtained the details can be found in say chen et al 2015 this initial sea surface elevation is used in layer 1 as the initial condition for linear swes 1 the evolution in time describes the propagation of linear tsunami waves and is integrated by comcot by exchanging sea levels and volume fluxes on the boundary between different layers the tsunami propagates further into layer 2 3 and 4 after the tsunami wave enters the smallest layer 4 where the resolution is finest the sea surface and volume fluxes are governed by more complicated nonlinear swes ζ t p x q y 0 16 p t x p 2 h y p q h g h ζ x τ x ρ 0 q t x p q h y q 2 h g h ζ y τ y ρ 0 where h d η is the total water depth and τ is the bottom shear stress with a subscript representing its direction all other symbols are the same as eq 1 the bathymetries of the four domains used in the present study are shown in fig 1 layer 1 shown in fig 1 a covers the area 114 129 e and 14 26 n including taiwan the luzon strait and luzon island philippines this layer has the coarsest grid of 1 min spatial resolution layers 2 is chosen as the area enclosed by the red rectangle of fig 1 a and includes the whole of southern taiwan the bathymetry of layer 2 shown in fig 1 b has 0 2 min resolution layer 3 is even smaller and has 0 04 min resolution as shown in fig 1 c and the red rectangle of fig 1 b the smallest layer 4 domain is inside the nanwan bay in the southern tip of taiwan with 0 0133 min resolution in the domain shown in fig 1 d and the red rectangle of fig 1 c the bathymetry of layer 1 is based on etope1 data and layer 2 is taken from ocean data bank founded by taiwan s ministry of science and technology most and operated by the institute of oceanography national taiwan university bathymetry of layers 3 and 4 are obtained by interpolation of layer 2 to see how the tsunami wave evolves in its way toward shore 18 locations are chosen along three meridional lines extended from the boundary of the finest layer 4 domain to the land sea boundary the bathymetry the location of these 18 points and the three lines in red are all shown in fig 2 there are six points on each red line with the most northerly two points are located on land before the tsunami arrives these three red lines are not evenly distributed two lines are in the west of the domain because a nuclear power station in the western area of the bay is the focus of the inundation simulation the waveform change is not recorded in the east part of the domain where high cliffs make inundation impossible 2 5 nearshore inundation simulation based on reciprocal elevation and flow green s functions the regf rfgf approach only simulates the smallest domain layer 4 with boundary conditions provided by regfs rfgfs at the offshore boundary for the simulation domain the offshore boundary is the only boundary connected to the sea and all the tsunami information should be transmitted through it thus the water surface and flow due to a tsunami should be provided on every point along the offshore boundary although the simulation domain for layer 4 is not wide the total number of grid points at the boundary is as many as 225 to obtain the water surface and flow at these 225 points 225 regfs and 450 rfgfs are required this is not feasible as the purpose of the present study in addition to obtaining an accurate forecast of inundation is to forecast inundation economically therefore as part of the methodology a simplification is proposed as follows five stations on the ocean side boundary of layer 4 are chosen as shown by the five red numbers in fig 1 d the time series of water surface and two horizontal flows are obtained by eq 5 where the corresponding regf and rfgf are substituted into the green s function vector g η and the integral is replaced by summation in discretized digital computation over the rupture zone because the computational domain is small compared with the wavelength of a tsunami the sea surface and horizontal flows on the offshore boundary vary mildly under the incidence of a tsunami the boundary water level and boundary flow used to force the inundation simulation at neighbouring points are supposed to be very close to each other hence very accurate boundary conditions are determined only at selected stations conditions at other boundary points between these stations are derived by interpolation and the computer time and computation efforts become significantly reduced thus with the aid of regfs and rfgfs time series of p q and η are derived at five stations on the ocean side boundary of layer 4 p q and η at each boundary point are interpolated from these five stations to provide the desired boundary conditions for the inundation simulation inside the nanwan bay these five stations are evenly distributed so that the error in interpolation can be minimized as is shown in fig 1 d usually in the middle of the simulation domain is the area of most concern in the study of tsunami inundation the edge of the domain outside the range of these five stations is not as important as the central part therefore boundary conditions for the edge of the domain are not carefully treated in the present study the boundary conditions of the edge stations are simply extended to points outside these five stations that is for boundary points to the west of the first station the conditions on the first station are applied for boundary points to the east of the fifth station the conditions on the fifth station are applied for both cases 1 and 2 the sea bottom dislocation is applied in the regf rfgf approach as the initial condition just as done in the direct comcot simulation as the linear superposition of eq 5 applies only for a linear system the linear layers 1 to 3 of the nested grid in the direct 4 layer simulation will be replaced by regfs and rfgfs along the boundary between layers 3 and 4 then instead of the nested simulation in the layer 4 regfs and rfgfs will be used to derive the boundary condition for the smallest nanwan bay domain which is exactly the layer 4 domain similar to the direct simulation over the 4 layer nested grid the nonlinear swes of eq 16 is used in the nearshore inundation and the wet dry boundary condition is used on the shoreline after the simulation the result of the regf rfgf approach proposed in the present study is then compared with the direct 4 layer comcot simulation at 18 locations along three meridional lines across the shoreline as points no 1 18 shown in fig 2 points no 6 12 and 18 are on the offshore boundary where the boundary conditions are derived by interpolating the water elevation and the flow cross and along the boundary at five stations shown in fig 1 d points no 1 2 7 8 13 and 14 are on land and represent the tsunami inundation the three meridional lines are not evenly distributed two lines are in the west of the domain because what happens to the nuclear power station in the west of the bay is the main purpose of the inundation study besides the regf rfgf approach a simplified bell shaped wave approach employed in chen et al 2015 is also used this previous approach does not use a complicated nested grid system just one linear layer is used to determine the offshore condition for inundation simulation to make sure the land boundary does not interfere with the tsunami in the coarse grid the offshore boundary is chosen outside nanwan bay further away from the shoreline for both cases 1 and 2 by summing the product of the initial water surface and the regf the water elevation at this farther offshore station is obtained and the incident tsunami wave height is derived with this wave height and a time scale of 20 min an incident bell shaped wave is constructed this bell shaped wave will serve as the offshore boundary condition for a nearshore inundation simulation under the framework of nonlinear swes of eq 16 with 0 0133 min resolution which is the same as both the direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach the simulated inundation at the 18 locations of fig 2 along three meridional lines is also compared with the 4 layer direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach 3 results in this section the reciprocity of fgfs and rfgfs is first validated in sec 3 1 which is proposed in eqs 12 and 13 then a normally incident tsunami scenario case 1 sec 3 2 and an obliquely incident tsunami scenario case 2 sec 3 3 are used to verify the applicability of the regf rfgf approach in the simulation of nearshore inundation 3 1 reciprocity of fgf and rfgf three stations a b and c of different water depths and latitudes in the india ocean are used to test the reciprocity of fgfs and rfgfs this reciprocity proposed in sec 2 2 can be stated as follows the x and y volume fluxes induced by an impulsive unit η increase at the source point x s y s are the η response due to an impulsive unit x and y volume fluxes at the vulnerable city multiplied by gd the computational domain is shown in fig 3 where the location of these three stations and the bathymetry of the whole domain are shown the bathymetry is based on etope1 data with 1 min resolution as has been discussed in previous studies chen et al 2015 the magnitude of an egf is proportional to the grid area the same principle applies to an rfgf according to the physical meaning discussed in sec 2 3 the initial impulsive increase of both volume fluxes is proportional to the grid area and hence gfs as the response to the forcing are also proportional to the area of the source grid cell for spherical coordinate system receiver grid and source grid have unequal grid area and hence the rfgf is not exactly reciprocal unless it is multiplied by the area ratio of the source grid area to the receiver grid area for 1 min resolution the grid width varies with latitude and hence the area of each grid cell is proportional to the cosine of the latitude in this way the reciprocity for each volume flux p or q can be tested for each pair of stations the reciprocity is between a source point and a receiver point hence there are three combinations of reciprocal stations viz a and b b and c c and a besides there are x and y components for volume fluxes hence two reciprocity relations exist for each pair of reciprocal stations and the total number of reciprocal pairs is 6 for these three stations take stations a and b for example let η p be the η response at station a due to an impulsive unit increase of volume flux p at station b while p η is the p response at station b due to an impulsive unit increase of η at station a according to eq 12 η p is p η divided by gd note that p and q are the average velocities multiplied by the water depth d therefore the average velocities at b due to unit η increase at the station a are the η response due to an impulsive unit p and q at station b multiplied by g fig 4 shows the result of the reciprocity comparison the blue curve in fig 4 a is the average x velocity at station b caused by unit η increase at station a or the fgf p η divided by the water depth 3164 m the red curve is the rfgf η p which is the η at station a caused by unit p increase at station b then multiplied by g where the negative sign is due to the wave directions from stations a to b and from b to a these two curves are very close suggesting eq 12 holds with high accuracy similar agreement between the other 5 reciprocal pairs can be found two more examples are shown below the same reciprocity of η and p between stations a and c is given in fig 4 b and the reciprocity of η and q between stations a and b is given in fig 4 c that is the blue curve in fig 4 b is the average x velocity at station a caused by unit η increase at station c which is the fgf divided by the water depth 235 m the red curve is the rfgf which is the η at station c caused by unit p increase at station a then also multiplied by g because of the opposite wave propagation directions from stations c to a and from a to c the blue curve in fig 4 c is the y fgf which is the q at station b caused by unit η increase at station a divided by the water depth 3157 m the red curve is the rfgf which is the η at station a caused by unit q increase at station b then multiplied by g where the negative sign is due to opposite wave directions from stations a to b and from b to a these panels in fig 4 show p and q due to unit η increase are exactly gd multiplied by the η due to unit p and q increases as has been proposed in sec 2 3 it should be noted that a staggered grid configuration is employed in comcot where η is the water surface at the center of the grid cell and p and q are x and y volume fluxes at the cell edge thus p represents the x flow zonally half a grid away from the center of the grid while q represents the y flow meridionally half a grid away from the grid center the water depths in calculation p and q are different even if they represent the flow for the same grid cell 3 2 nearshore inundation with normal incident tsunamis in a bay south of taiwan as has been explained in sec 2 4 the normally incident tsunami with the initial water surface of fig 5 is generated by the earthquake parameters of table 2 the fault is to the south of nanwan bay with a 270 strike angle so that the tsunami will propagate northward into the bay η p and q at the five stations of fig 1 d are calculated by the direct comcot simulation with the nested 4 layer grid the results at station 3 are represented by the red curve of fig 6 a c on the other side reciprocal elevation and flow gfs regfs and rfgfs at the five stations are calculated by comcot with the first three layers of the nested grid then η p and q at the five stations are calculated by combining reciprocal gfs and the initial water surface of fig 5 the results at station 3 are represented by the blue curve of fig 6 a c the offshore tsunami information can be accurately derived by the reciprocal elevation and flow gfs note that because of the staggered grid of comcot locations and water depths in calculating p q and η may have half a grid difference in fig 6 besides the regf rfgf approach a simplified bell shaped approach employed in chen et al 2015 is also used outside nanwan bay a further offshore station of 137 m water depth is chosen as shown in fig 7 a by summing the product of the initial water surface of fig 5 and the regf the water elevation at this offshore station is obtained in fig 7 b and the incident tsunami wave height is derived with this wave height and a time scale of 20 min an incident bell shaped wave is constructed as the offshore boundary condition for a simulation of nearshore inundation the simulated inundation at the 18 locations of fig 2 along three meridional lines is also compared with the 4 layer direct simulation and the regf rfgf approach the comparison of tsunami waveform from the inland inundation back to the offshore station is shown in fig 8 fig 8 a is the comparison along the west line of fig 2 with points no 1 and 2 on land while point no 6 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 58 and 1 93 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 0 4 m and 4 92 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and hence the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline fig 8 b is the comparison along the middle line of fig 2 with points 7 and 8 on land while point 12 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 55 and 1 87 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 3 27 and 23 81 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline fig 8 c is the comparison along the east line of fig 2 with points 13 and 14 on land while point 18 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 65 and 3 35 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 8 99 m and 57 12 m on the other hand the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and once again the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline for regions of high nonlinearity such as the west line the waveform calculated by rgf boundary conditions is very close to the direct simulation for the middle and east lines the consistency is not as good as the west line therefore nonlinearity is not a problem on the other hand the waveform in the deep water is also very close to direct comcot simulation and hence linearity does not necessarily make the simulation worse it is concluded that the bathymetric change in the middle may change the waveform less mildly the bell shaped incident tsunami gives a different waveform from the offshore point to the point on land however the wave height provided by this simple approach is still reasonable and sometimes very close to the direct simulation the 20 min time scale seems to be an overestimate for a mw 8 earthquake the comparison of water surface along three comparison lines is quite good for both the regf rfgf approach and direct comcot simulation the bell shaped wave significantly overestimates the inundation time extension partly due to the fact that the scenario earthquake is relatively small and the 20 min time scale is an overestimate however the bell shaped wave can correctly represent the highest water level of inundation which is consistent with previous studies of chen et al 2015 3 3 nearshore inundation with oblique incident tsunamis in a bay south of taiwan the obliquely incident tsunami with the initial water surface of fig 9 is generated by the earthquake parameters of table 3 the fault is to the northeast of nanwan bay so that the tsunami will propagate south westwards into the bay as is shown in fig 10 the regf and rfgf can accurately provide the offshore tsunami information at either the station 3 of 65 m depth or the offshore station of 137 m depth see table 4 the comparison of tsunami waveform along three red lines from the inland inundation back to the offshore station is shown in fig 11 fig 11 a is the comparison at points 1 6 along the line on the west side of the map shown in fig 2 where points 1 2 are on land and point 6 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 58 and 1 93 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 0 4 and 4 92 m as the six panels of fig 11 a show the regf rfgf approach gives a waveform quite close to that of the direct 4 layer simulation the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m and the tsunami is highly nonlinear near the shoreline suggesting an regf rfgf approach is not affected by nonlinearity fig 11 b is the comparison at points 7 12 along the middle line of fig 2 with points 7 8 on land while point 12 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 55 and 1 87 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 3 27 and 23 81 m fig 11 c is the comparison along the east line of fig 2 with points 13 14 on land while point 18 is near the offshore boundary of layer 4 the altitude of the point on hand is between 0 65 and 3 35 m above mean sea level and the water depth for points in the sea is between 8 99 and 57 12 m the nearshore tsunami wave height is more than 5 m but the water depth in the middle and the east lines is deeper than the west line as they are close to the center of nanwan bay the regf rfgf approach gives good results which is consistent with the direct 4 layer simulation but the discrepancy is a little higher than the west line the discrepancy may be attributed to the bathymetry near the middle and the east line the water depth is deeper and hence the spatial variation is larger than the west line in the regf rfgf approach the flow and water elevation on the boundary are interpolated among the five stations as the boundary condition this interpolation is based on the distance to the neighbouring station without considering the water depth thus if the bathymetry does not change smoothly the boundary condition may not be very accurate and discrepancies may occur unlike case 1 where the wave height can be reasonably estimated by a bell shaped wave significant overestimate of wave height can be easily seen in case 2 if the obliquely incident tsunami is replaced by a bell shaped wave of 20 min time scale at some points the oblique incident tsunami only reaches half the height of the bell shaped wave thus using the regf rfgf is a significant improvement 4 discussions and conclusion 4 1 computer time comparison of various approaches in inundation simulation besides accuracy the efficiency of the regf rfgf method is compared with the direct simulation for desktop pcs with ddr4 2666 16 gb ram and an intel i5 9600 k cpu the cpu time for the 4 layer nested direct simulation is 1260 s for the rfgf approach with the same desktop pc the most time consuming part is the simulation of the nearshore inundation which applies nonlinear swes over the layer 4 domain and takes 90 s the simulation of nearshore inundation is driven by boundary conditions from the offshore side therefore the sea surface or the flow at the offshore grid point should be calculated first employing regfs and rfgfs the average time required to obtain the sea surface or the flow in either x or y direction is 0 6 s for the regf rfgf approach there are two ways of proceeding one is to derive the sea surface and two horizontal flows for each point on the offshore boundary in the example of nanwan bay used in the present study there are 225 boundary points and hence the boundary condition requires 405 s 225 0 6 3 and the total computation takes 495 s the other approach does not calculate each point accurately by regf rfgf instead the boundary condition at neighbouring points are supposed to be very close to each other and hence very accurate water surface and flow are calculated only at selected points flows and water levels at other points on the offshore boundary are derived by interpolation for example if 5 points are chosen as indicated by fig 1 d flows and water levels at 5 locations will take 9 s 5 3 0 6 while interpolation and other arrangements to set the offshore boundary conditions takes 10 s the total computer time is 109 s for the approach using a bell shaped wave chen et al 2015 the offshore condition is assumed uniform and only the incident tsunami height is required therefore the total simulation time is 90 6 s 4 2 applicability of regf rfgf and bell shaped wave approaches in nearshore inundation for both cases 1 and 2 the regf rfgf approach gives a waveform very close in comparison with the 4 layer direct simulation even for the on land inundation of tsunami this approach used less than one tenth of the computer time than the direct simulation 109 1260 and can be considered as the most comprehensive method so that accuracy and economy are in good balance if it is desirable to reduce the already minor discrepancies one may calculate the water level and flows at every boundary point in this case the computer time is less than one half of the direct simulation 495 1260 thus it is still a significant improvement in computational efficiency on the other hand the most economical way to simulate the nearshore inundation is to use the simplest bell shaped tsunami however the simulation of land inundation is not very accurate for obliquely incident tsunami and the reduced computer time is very minor compared to the regf rfgf approach nevertheless if the tsunami is normally incident simulating the nearshore inundation by a bell shaped tsunami can still generate a very similar inundation area furthermore as the incident tsunami is determined by the wave height in this simplified approach only a limited number of simulations are required and can be pre calculated thus for any incident tsunami height the inundation map is obtained by interpolating the distance to the shoreline chen et al 2015 in this way the inundation map can be obtained very quickly and no real time simulations are needed as long as the offshore tsunami flow is nearly perpendicular to the shore 4 3 water depth and the applicability of linear swes both regfs and rfgfs are fundamental solutions of linear swes and hence should be used when the tsunami wave amplitude is small for both the kinematic and the dynamic free surface boundary conditions the ratio between the nonlinear term and the leading linear term is approximately the wave amplitude divided by the water depth this ratio is the nonlinear parameter for shallow water waves and can be used to determine the applicability of linear swes if the offshore water depth is deeper than 50 m shuto 1991 linear swe is always valid and the regf rfgf approach is always applicable if the nearshore water depth is not as deep as 50 m the linearity assumption still holds as long as the wave amplitude is much smaller than the water depth the water depth and the linearity of tsunami waves at the offshore boundary is briefly discussed in this section in the two cases used in the present study the tsunami wave height is about 4 6 m at the outer boundary and the wave amplitude is 2 3m based on table 1 the water depth at station 3 65 m is much larger than the wave amplitude and the linearity can be guaranteed to the west and east of station 3 water depths at stations 2 and 4 are respectively 38 and 29 m the maximum wave amplitude is respectively 2 7 and 2 2 m and the corresponding nonlinear parameter is below 0 076 hence the nonlinearity contributes less than 1 10 of the linear wave amplitude and the application of gfs is also justified the outermost boundary stations stations 1 and 5 have the shallowest depths 10 and 12 m while the maximum wave amplitude is as high as 3 m hence the accuracy of linear swes is marginal because the ratio between the wave amplitude and the water depth reaches 0 3 however the edge of the domain is not as important as the central part because the middle of the simulation domain is the area of most concern thus using linear swes and gfs for the offshore boundary condition is reasonable and can be applied in constructing the boundary condition for nearshore inundation credit authorship contribution statement guan yu chen conceptualization chin chu liu validation declaration of competing

21729,several methodologies have been proposed to mitigate vortex induced motions vim on offshore structures such as the use of strakes splitter plates and spoiler plates among the mitigation devices spoiler plates remain insufficiently explored given the situation a parametric experimental investigation was undertaken to investigate the suppression of vortex induced motions of a circular cylinder with a low aspect ratio using spoiler plates the experiments were carried out in a towing tank the circular cylinder tested had an aspect ratio l d of 1 5 which is typically employed in monocolumns and columns of semi submersible ss platforms several configurations were investigated by changing the spoiler plate aspect ratio a r s the number of rings with spoiler plates along the vertical axis of the cylinder n l and the number of spoiler plates per ring n d the reduced velocities investigated varied from 1 to 12 and the reynolds number from 12 500 to 95 000 the results demonstrated the occurrence of a desynchronization of the vortex shedding which led to a significant reduction of the in line and transverse amplitudes moreover a decrease in drag forces of approximately 50 occurred

turbine mic most improved case psd power spectrum density ss semi submersible std standard deviation vim vortex induced motions 1 introduction study of vortex induced motions vim is fundamental in offshore and ocean engineering as the sea current passes by the offshore platforms it generates vortices in the wake of the structure the vortex shedding leads to an alternate pressure on the platform exciting the system which triggers the vim phenomenon when the frequency of the vortices matches the frequency of the structure resonance occurs and this can reduce the lifetime of the moorings this phenomenon has frequently been investigated over the past decades in the offshore field studies of vim for low aspect ratio cylinders have been motivated by the rising size of the circular oil and gas platforms such as for spar with an aspect ratio 1 5 l d 6 0 see dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2003 and monocolumns with 0 2 l d 0 5 see gonçalves et al 2010 recently investigation into vim has also been shown to be important in the renewable energy field of floating offshore wind turbines fowt see examples for semi submersible platforms in gonçalves et al 2019 and spar platforms in carlson and sadeghi 2017 the main concern associated with the vim is the issue of fatigue in the mooring components such as the chains and fairleads due to the cyclical frictions acting on their surfaces in terms of its effects on fowt the additional accelerations in the nacelle of the turbine may cause its shutdown leading to the electric cables and mooring system being damaged as a result mechanisms to mitigate the vim phenomenon are extremely valuable however it should be noted that some alternatives are more feasible than others due to the complexity of their construction and cost in this general context there is a lack of studies in the literature regarding the use of spoiler plates spoiler plates are relatively simple to build compared with other passive control solutions that mitigate the vim thus this work performs a parametric study by changing the spoiler plate arrangement and selecting the most improved case mic to demonstrate the applicability of this mitigation device for cylinders with a low aspect ratio 2 background flow induced motions fim comprise a group of phenomena related to fluid structure interactions known as vortex induced vibration viv vim and galloping this work focuses on vim which mainly occurs in rigid bodies with symmetrical geometry self excited and self limited behavior can result in resonances between the frequency of the vortex shedding and the platform motion the flow velocity range in which the synchronization occurs termed lock in is characterized by large amplitudes of motion in both the in line and transverse directions as a result the mooring system and cables may suffer excessive cyclical loads which can result in a reduction in the component s lifetimes due to fatigue at this range of velocity based on that methods to avoid and mitigate the vim have been investigated by both industry and the academy according to fredsoe and sumer 1997 three different methodologies are used to classify vim mitigation based on the parameters controlled reduced velocity using active control systems to change the natural period of the motion see kokkinis et al 2004 or changing the design of the structure such as the diameter to delay the synchronization region mass and damping increasing the mass of the structure and the damping to reduce or avoid the vim phenomenon implications for the natural frequency of the motion must be considered vortex shedding including protuberances on the surface of the structure used to modify the pattern of the vortices and their effect on the structure this is a consequence of a modification of the boundary layer around the object several different technologies have been studied and applied in the offshore field such as strakes fins fairings and spoiler plates as depicted in fig 1 the feasibility of the mitigation devices is highly dependent on the platform concept employed in the past few years strakes have frequently been highly applied in offshore scenarios for the sake of vortex mitigation in spar platforms with large aspect ratios and risers in such a passive control option the vortex shedding is successfully mitigated however an increase in the drag forces has been noticed see fredsoe and sumer 1997 another drawback is the installation of such a mitigation device which is complicated and costly especially for the case of cylinders with a low aspect ratio the efficiency of the strakes is not significant since the number of pitches is very low for low aspect ratio structures due to the low tilt angle of the helix designed to fit on the surface nonetheless spoiler plates can address these difficulties according to previous work by gonçalves et al 2010 the use of spoiler plates had demonstrates a relevant reduction in both in line and transverse amplitude for low aspect ratio cylinders the main mitigation effect of spoiler plates on transverse motion can be related to the position and the type of vortices created for instance the vorticity created in that area is mainly suppressed due to the spoiler arrangement on the side of the cylinder several works in the literature tried to evaluate the characteristics of the vortices shed in the wake of a fixed cylinder and their pattern experimentally and numerically through piv tests and cfd simulations respectively for example the results by kawamura et al 1984 and sakata et al 2018 show the presence not only of 2d vortices but also 3d vortices created by the free end of the platform 3d vortices generation is related to the formation of stagnation and recirculating areas in a specific position in the wake of the cylinder as investigated in past articles for example in gonçalves et al 2015 for a fixed cylinder a r 1 5 vortex shedding is dominated by von kármán vortices in the streamwise direction and is also affected by vortices originating from the free end of the cylinder the vortex structures change the motion of the cylinder and their effects are distinguished according to where they originated e g side and free end effects the intensity of the effect is strongly related to the aspect ratio of the structure therefore the contribution of the side vortices increases with the aspect ratio and reduces the contribution of the free end vortices and vice versa see fig 2 for the aspect ratio 0 5 a r 1 5 both the von karman and the free end characteristics are present while for a r 0 5 the free end vortices are predominant therefore the aim of this work is to extend the knowledge of the spoiler plate as a mitigation device of the vim caused by the von kármán vortices for cylinders with low aspect ratios 3 experimental setup the experimental setup of the reduced scale circular cylinder model was conducted at the towing tank at the university of tokyo japan the main tank dimensions were 85 0 m 3 5 m x 2 4m length x wide x depth and the towing car had a maximum velocity of 0 4 m s during the tests fig 3 illustrates the experimental setup and main dimensions and fig 4 shows the towing tank facility the model was elastically supported by 4 horizontal linear springs mounted along the in line and transverse directions to provide the required stiffness of the mooring system equivalent to 26n m in each direction hence the natural periods for the motions in the in line and transverse directions were the same the individual characteristics of the springs including the unstretched length l 0 are presented in table 1 the 6 degree of freedom dof motions were captured using an optical motion capture system qualisys with 4 cameras installed on the cart the sampling frequency was 100hz and uncertainty in the measurements was less than 0 5 mm for a cylinder with a low aspect ratio l d 1 5 the synchronization region in both the in line and transverse directions occurred for reduced velocities between 4 u r 9 see gonçalves et al 2018 this reduced velocity range was crucial for the analysis however lower and higher reduced velocities were also tested for each spoiler plate configuration the range of reduced velocities was varied from 1 to 12 which were evenly distributed into 25 points the froude number range f r was between 0 032 and 0 236 and the reynolds number range r e was between 12 500 and 95 000 koop et al 2016 showed that the vim model tests performed for r e 100 000 were conservative compared with the full scale ones and other factors should be considered such as waves and external damping when compared with the real case however the model tests are still a feasible procedure to understand the vim behavior of floating systems in the early stages of the design process 3 1 reduced scale model table 2 shows the main dimensions of the model the model was made of steel with a smooth surface and the spoiler plates were made of neodymium a ferromagnetic material to facilitate the alternation of arrangements the model was ballasted to have enough hydrostatic stability and to keep the natural frequencies of roll and pitch outside the range of frequency of the vortex shedding 3 2 spoiler plates two non dimensional parameters are used to describe the spoiler plates the spoiler plate aspect ratio a r s is defined as 1 a r s d s l s where d s is the length of the spoiler plate in the radial direction of the cylinder and l s is the height of the spoiler plate in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 the ratio between the length of the spoiler plate in the radial direction and the diameter of the platform is defined as 2 l r s d s d the parameters selected and their values were based on their feasibility of construction in the actual platform cases and on the expectation of their having a significant influence on the results due to the lack of studies and data about spoiler plate dimensions three different values were used see table 3 fig 5 shows the reduced model with one configuration of spoiler plates the thickness of the spoiler plate was designed to ensure the attachment between the spoiler and the curved surface of the cylinder during the experiments the spoiler arrangement consisted of a set of rings equidistant along the vertical axis n l containing a number of spoiler plates per ring n d with an angle α between the spoiler plates of the same ring the plates were not aligned in the vertical direction and a twisted angle between the spoiler plates of adjacent rings was made β α 2 fig 6 illustrates the discretization in the tangential and vertical axes and the configurations chosen are shown in table 4 4 analysis methodology the vim response was analyzed through non dimensional motion amplitudes and hydrodynamic forces in the transverse and in line directions 4 1 non dimensional motion amplitudes the motion is commonly represented in a dimensionless form as x d and y d whose nominal amplitudes are calculated based on the standard deviation of the time series of the motion in the steady state region namely 3 x d 2 s t d x d 4 y d 2 std y d 4 2 frequency analysis the frequency of vortex shedding f s is proportional to the velocity of the flow u and the characteristic length of the body the cylinder diameter d 5 f s s t u d where the proportional factor is a non dimensional parameter named the strouhal number s t which is strongly dependent on the reynolds number re the strouhal number of a cylinder with a low aspect ratio and free to oscillate is approximately s t 0 1 for the range of reynolds numbers tested see gonçalves et al 2018 the frequency analysis consists of identifying the synchronization range between the vortex shedding and the platform motion the frequency of motion was obtained from the power spectrum density psd of the oscillation using the fast fourier transform fft in this work it was calculated using the welch method as explained in welch 1967 based on the psd plot it is possible to have a clear visualization of the range of reduced velocities in which the vim was active and whether or not the phenomenon were synchronized 4 3 reduced velocities the reduced velocity u r is defined as 6 u r u t n d where t n is the natural period of motion of the platform in the transverse direction in still water obtained from the decay test the natural period for each spoiler plate configuration was measured however the changes in the natural periods due to the spoiler plate presence could be neglected 4 4 hydrodynamic forces the rigid body motion equations for the cylinder in the transverse and in line directions are derived based on the equations and discussion proposed by sarpkaya 2004 as follows 7 m x t c x t k x x t f h x t 8 m y t c y t k y y t f h y t where m denotes the structural mass of the platform c is the structural damping coefficient of the system k is the stiffness coefficient f h is defined as the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system and subscripts x and y represent the in line and transverse directions respectively in such formulations the structural components of the force are placed on the left side of the equations the hydrodynamic effects such as the added mass hydrodynamic damping and other fluid forces are placed on the right side of the equation as a result the hydrodynamic forces in each direction can be estimated indirectly using these equations of motion in this regard the restoring forces were calculated from the mooring line displacements and the structural damping was neglected due to its magnitude compared with the other dynamic forces therefore the hydrodynamic forces were estimated based on the restoring and inertial forces as for the amplitude results the hydrodynamic forces are represented in non dimensional values for the transverse direction the hydrodynamic force is described as a lift coefficient given by 9 f h y t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l t where ρ is the fluid density and s denotes the projected area perpendicular to the flow direction thus s l d the characteristic values of lift are presented as the rms of the lift coefficient over the steady state range of the time series regarding the in line direction the hydrodynamic force can be described in two components the first relates to the static component mean drag coefficient c d and the second is associated with the oscillatory component dynamic drag coefficient c d d given by 10 f h x t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c d t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c d c d d t 11 c d c d t 12 c d d t c d t c d the characteristic values of dynamic drag are presented as the rms of the dynamic drag coefficient over the steady state range of the time series following the derivations in sarpkaya 2004 and vikestad et al 2000 the hydrodynamic force in the transverse direction can be expressed as a harmonic excitation 13 f h y t f 0 s i n ω t φ f 0 cos φ sin ω t f 0 sin φ cos ω t where f 0 is the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force in the transverse direction ω denotes the angular frequency of the platform motion and φ is the phase difference between the force and motion as introduced in khalak and williamson 1999 and reviewed in sarpkaya 2004 this force can be represented by two main components one term in phase with the platform acceleration and the other term in phase with the platform velocity which is related to the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient respectively based on that the non dimensional lift coefficient in equation 9 can be expressed as 14 c l t c a sin ω t c v cos ω t where c a denotes the added mass coefficient and c v denotes the damping coefficient the added mass coefficient is estimated based on the classical analysis in the frequency domain proposed in fujarra and pesce 2002 where the following relation can be obtained 15 f f t f h y t f f t y t m a ω i c v ω ω and where f f t represents the fast fourier transform operator therefore the added mass coefficient is obtained by 16 c a f d ω r f f t f h y t f f t y t m where r is the real part of the complex number obtained via the fft the added mass coefficient was taken from the frequency of interest which contains the highest energy the same procedure for hydrodynamic forces estimation during vim model tests was applied by gonçalves et al 2010 and gonçalves et al 2018 for a monocolumn and for circular cylinders a with very low aspect ratio and the methodology presented satisfactory results compared with direct force measurements 5 experimental development only motions in the in line and the transverse directions were investigated since the motions of the other degrees of freedom were not relevant as was noted by gonçalves et al 2018 the time series were obtained using a motion capture system and the steady state data were selected manually to avoid transient effects such as the start and stop effects of the cart three parameters were chosen for the parametric study namely n d n l and a r s the parameters were described in section 3 2 an initial configuration with the following parameters was assumed n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 1 which will be used as a base case and be improved in the next stage of the parametric study all the spoiler plate configurations were compared with the bare hull case no spoiler plate table 5 shows the experiment matrix fig 7 shows the experiment chart that demonstrates the methodology for obtaining the most improved case i e the best mitigation performance the experiments were divided into four stages for each of which a parametric study was conducted varying one parameter stage 0 the case without spoiler plates was investigated to evaluate the mitigation performance stage a using the initial base case n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 1 0 the values of the spoiler ratio were varied as a r s 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 stage b using the best case from stage a as the base case n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 2 0 the number of spoiler plates were varied as n d 4 8 and 16 stage c using the best case from stage b as the base case n d 4 n l 5 and a r s 2 0 the number of rings with spoiler plates were varied as n l 3 5 and 7 the following section explains in detail the results for each stage of the parametric study in detail 5 1 stage 0 bare hull in the first stage the vim of the model without spoiler plates was investigated to obtain the benchmark data fig 8 and fig 9 show the non dimensional in line and transverse amplitudes respectively the in line amplitudes presented a local maximum around u r 3 which confirms the in line resonance for 2dof cylinders for u r 4 an increase in the in line amplitudes was observed without a decrease in amplitudes for the reduced velocities carried out the transverse amplitudes showed a significant increase in amplitudes for u r 4 and a maximum value of amplitudes y d 1 0 around u r 10 the results were similar to the ones presented by gonçalves et al 2018 for experiments in a circulating water channel and gonçalves et al 2020 for tests performed in the same towing tank facility for a different diameter however the present results extend the range of reduced velocities presented in gonçalves et al 2018 2020 showing the drop in amplitudes for u r 10 for comparison purposes all the psd results are normalized by the peak value of the bare cylinder case without spoiler plates to highlight the improvement in the mitigation effect fig 10 and fig 11 show the psd results for in line and transverse motions respectively the results show a synchronization range for the in line and transverse directions at 5 u r 10 and 5 u r 12 respectively in this range it is possible to observe the high energy level in the psd which means that the motion is periodic and with significant amplitudes as pointed out jauvtis and williamson 2004 and gonçalves et al 2018 the in line frequency is twice the transverse frequency in the synchronization range of 2dof vim which can be observed in figs 10 and 11 5 2 stage a spoiler plate ratio a r s in the second stage the effect of the spoiler plate ratio a r s was investigated parametrically hence n d 8 and n l 5 were kept constant and three different values of a r s were carried out namely 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 fig 12 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio a r s in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased when the spoiler ratio increased for the entire reduced velocity range experimented fig 13 shows the transverse amplitude results y d for the transverse motions the difference in the results was observed for u r 5 as for the in line direction the transverse amplitudes decreased when the spoiler ratio increased more substantial differences were observed for u r 8 the effect of the spoiler plate ratio was to anticipate the desynchronization and to reduce the amplitudes fig 14 presents the mean drag coefficient results c d the mean drag values were related entirely to the in line amplitudes during the occurrence of the vim phenomenon the mean drag coefficient increased due to the coupling between the in line and transverse motions this phenomenon is known as dynamic amplification of the drag as reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 blevins and coughran 2009 huang et al 2011 and gonçalves et al 2013 the same statements can be made for the dynamic drag coefficient results c d d in fig 15 as the effects of a rough surface the inclusion of the spoiler plates on the cylinder created a boundary layer transition this effect for rough surfaces was reported by allen and henning 2001 and observed by blevins and coughran 2009 for the same range of reynolds as the present experiments 50 000 r e 100 000 however the effects of spoiler plates are more significant than surface roughness because the spoiler plates prevented the boundary layer in a classic sense to build up on the cylinder by breaking any small boundary layer for rough cylinders there is a well defined boundary layer that starts its transition much earlier than for a smooth cylinder while spoiler plates may even change the flow significantly upstream of the cylinder fig 16 presents the lift coefficient results c l the slight reduction of the transverse amplitude in the synchronization range can be attributed to c l the added mass coefficient results c a showed a significant difference when the spoiler plates were included mainly in the range at the beginning of the synchronization u r 5 as shown in fig 17 the desynchronization and presence of the lower branch occur when the resonance finishes and the added mass coefficient is equal to zero as reported by vikestad et al 2000 and cunha et al 2006 increasing the spoiler plate ratio meant that the desynchronization occurred earlier c a 0 as did the decrease in transverse amplitude see fig 12 fig 18 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio on the energy levels of psd results for the in line motions the results were compared with the bare hull case from these results significant mitigation of the motions can be observed in the in line direction and almost no energy levels for the largest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 fig 19 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio on the energy levels of psd results for the transverse motions the mitigating impact can be seen by increasing the spoiler plate ratio however considerable energy remained for the highest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 the increase in the spoiler ratio decreased the energy level and also narrowed the reduced velocity range of the synchronization range the synchronization range was 5 u r 12 for the bare hull case and 6 u r 10 for the largest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 5 3 stage b number of spoiler plates per ring n d in the third stage the number of spoiler plates per ring n d was investigated parametrically hence a r s 2 and n l 5 were kept constant and three different values of n d were carried out namely 4 8 and 16 the constant value of the spoiler plate ratio a r s 2 was chosen because it was shown to be the most effective in terms of mitigation in the previous stage fig 20 presents the effect of the number of spoiler plates per ring n d in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased by reducing the number of vertical planes of the spoiler plates ratio for the entire range of reduced velocity there was a drop in the in line amplitude for n d 4 this behavior was not observed for the other cases tested including different spoiler plate ratio cases in general the configuration of spoiler plates for the n d 4 case obtained the best performance between the configurations studied the desynchronization of the vortex shedding may be the reason for the significant difference mainly for u r 9 fig 21 presents the transverse amplitude results y d for the transverse motions a difference in the results was observed for u r 8 as for the in line direction the transverse amplitudes decreased when the number of vertical planes of spoiler plates decreased a significant difference was observed for u r 8 and n d 4 in which the transverse amplitudes dropped to around 20 compared with the bare cylinder the results of the mean drag dynamic drag lift and added mass coefficients presented in figs 22 25 respectively corroborate to the statements made before another interesting effect is the reduction of the drag coefficient when including of spoiler plates these results can be an advantage compared with the strakes because the latter were responsible for increasing the drag of the structures such as risers and spar platforms fig 26 and fig 27 present the psd results for the in line and transverse directions respectively for the in line direction almost no energy was observed for all the n d values tested which showed a high mitigation level for this dof for the transverse direction the change in the number of vertical planes of spoiler plates from 8 to 4 increased the mitigation for this dof and further narrowed the synchronization range from 6 u r 10 for n d 8 to 6 u r 9 to n d 4 therefore it was possible to find the most effective configuration by changing n d 5 4 stage c number of rings with spoiler plates n l in the fourth and final stage the number of rings with spoiler plates n l was investigated parametrically therefore a r s 2 and n d 4 were kept constant and three different values of n l were carried out namely 3 5 and 7 the number of vertical planes n d 4 was chosen because it was shown to be the most effective in terms of mitigation from the previous stage fig 28 presents the effect of the number of rings with spoiler plates n l in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased when the number of rings increased for the entire reduced velocity range experimented no difference was observed for n l 5 and n l 7 fig 29 presents the transverse amplitude results y d as the in line amplitudes the transverse amplitudes decreased when n d increased the lowest transverse amplitudes could be observed for n l 7 and this behavior showed that the increase in the number of rings was more effective for the transverse than for the in line direction the most significant mitigation occurred for u r 8 around the peak amplitude and also for reduced velocities u r 9 which confirmed the anticipation of the lower branch and the synchronization ended the results of the mean drag dynamic drag lift and added mass coefficients presented in figs 30 33 respectively corroborate the statements made before the forces followed the same behavior as the motions a decrease in the forces was observed when the number of rings increased fig 34 and fig 35 present the psd results for the in line and transverse directions respectively these psd results consolidated the parametric study and showed improvement until it was possible to select the most improved case mic from the parametric study case a r s 2 0 n l 7 and n d 4 can be considered the be the mic amongst all the cases tested in terms of the psd energy the in line energy was mitigated and the transverse energy was limited to a small range of reduced velocity 6 u r 9 with lower energy than the bare cylinder case 6 general conclusions a parametric study on the geometry and configuration of spoiler plates positioned in a floating circular cylinder was carried out experimentally in a towing tank to verify the mitigation effects on the vim phenomenon three parameters were selected for evaluation during the parametric study namely n d n l and a r s the results of the motion amplitudes and forces were compared with the bare cylinder case to prove the mitigation behavior of the spoiler plates the most improved case mic amongst the configurations tested was a r s 2 0 n l 7 and n d 4 figs 36 and 37 underline the comparison between the bare cylinder and the mic for the amplitudes in the in line and transverse directions respectively the use of spoiler plates reduced both in line and transverse motions the best performance in both directions was achieved for reduced velocities beyond 9 which suggests anticipation in the desynchronization range was caused by the arrangement of the spoiler plates and their associated vortices the effectiveness of the spoiler plates was higher for the motions in the in line direction with values higher than 50 compared with the case without spoiler plates for the entire reduced velocity range tested for the transverse direction the reduction was around 20 in the reduced velocity range inside the synchronization range of the bare hull case around 5 u r 7 and above to 60 for higher reduced velocities the percentage reduction of the motion amplitudes compared with the bare hull case is presented in fig 38 fig 39 highlights the comparison between the bare hull and the mic for the mean drag force coefficient and fig 40 shows the percentage reduction of the mean drag force the mean drag force is a significant factor for offshore platforms design due to the loads at mooring systems risers and electrical cables compared with the literature regarding mitigation devices the spoiler plates proved to be effective in terms of mean drag forces while the strakes are effective for this purpose in most of the cases a reduction of around 60 for the transverse motion was observed for u r 6 mainly because of the significant mitigation of the in line motions which can be associated with the prevented dynamic amplification of the drag phenomenon at this velocity range regarding the effectiveness of the parameters the spoiler ratio a r s was the most affecting parameter among the set of configuration parameters selected the other parameters also suppressed the phenomenon with a minor contribution therefore it is hard to distinguish significant changes during the parametric analysis and to determine the best value only a superposition of the effects of the best parameters in each base case as previously specified revealed which is the best value for the remaining parameters since the study was not an optimization process the mic might not be the optimized geometry using the parameters of this study however the study showed a direction through which to optimize the geometry for spoiler plates and also helped to conclude that the presence of spoiler plates can mitigate the motions in the in line and transverse directions along with decreasing the drag coefficient due to the low aspect ratio characteristic of the cylinder the applied configuration of the spoiler plate might not suppress the vortices generated from the free end of the cylinder the free end vortices could be the reason for the high amplitudes in the synchronization range even though the mitigation device is applied gonçalves et al 2018 showed high transverse amplitudes for cylinders subjected to free end vortices and very low aspect ratios l d 0 5 alone further studies are necessary to investigate the mitigation of the free end vortices credit

21729,several methodologies have been proposed to mitigate vortex induced motions vim on offshore structures such as the use of strakes splitter plates and spoiler plates among the mitigation devices spoiler plates remain insufficiently explored given the situation a parametric experimental investigation was undertaken to investigate the suppression of vortex induced motions of a circular cylinder with a low aspect ratio using spoiler plates the experiments were carried out in a towing tank the circular cylinder tested had an aspect ratio l d of 1 5 which is typically employed in monocolumns and columns of semi submersible ss platforms several configurations were investigated by changing the spoiler plate aspect ratio a r s the number of rings with spoiler plates along the vertical axis of the cylinder n l and the number of spoiler plates per ring n d the reduced velocities investigated varied from 1 to 12 and the reynolds number from 12 500 to 95 000 the results demonstrated the occurrence of a desynchronization of the vortex shedding which led to a significant reduction of the in line and transverse amplitudes moreover a decrease in drag forces of approximately 50 occurred

turbine mic most improved case psd power spectrum density ss semi submersible std standard deviation vim vortex induced motions 1 introduction study of vortex induced motions vim is fundamental in offshore and ocean engineering as the sea current passes by the offshore platforms it generates vortices in the wake of the structure the vortex shedding leads to an alternate pressure on the platform exciting the system which triggers the vim phenomenon when the frequency of the vortices matches the frequency of the structure resonance occurs and this can reduce the lifetime of the moorings this phenomenon has frequently been investigated over the past decades in the offshore field studies of vim for low aspect ratio cylinders have been motivated by the rising size of the circular oil and gas platforms such as for spar with an aspect ratio 1 5 l d 6 0 see dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2003 and monocolumns with 0 2 l d 0 5 see gonçalves et al 2010 recently investigation into vim has also been shown to be important in the renewable energy field of floating offshore wind turbines fowt see examples for semi submersible platforms in gonçalves et al 2019 and spar platforms in carlson and sadeghi 2017 the main concern associated with the vim is the issue of fatigue in the mooring components such as the chains and fairleads due to the cyclical frictions acting on their surfaces in terms of its effects on fowt the additional accelerations in the nacelle of the turbine may cause its shutdown leading to the electric cables and mooring system being damaged as a result mechanisms to mitigate the vim phenomenon are extremely valuable however it should be noted that some alternatives are more feasible than others due to the complexity of their construction and cost in this general context there is a lack of studies in the literature regarding the use of spoiler plates spoiler plates are relatively simple to build compared with other passive control solutions that mitigate the vim thus this work performs a parametric study by changing the spoiler plate arrangement and selecting the most improved case mic to demonstrate the applicability of this mitigation device for cylinders with a low aspect ratio 2 background flow induced motions fim comprise a group of phenomena related to fluid structure interactions known as vortex induced vibration viv vim and galloping this work focuses on vim which mainly occurs in rigid bodies with symmetrical geometry self excited and self limited behavior can result in resonances between the frequency of the vortex shedding and the platform motion the flow velocity range in which the synchronization occurs termed lock in is characterized by large amplitudes of motion in both the in line and transverse directions as a result the mooring system and cables may suffer excessive cyclical loads which can result in a reduction in the component s lifetimes due to fatigue at this range of velocity based on that methods to avoid and mitigate the vim have been investigated by both industry and the academy according to fredsoe and sumer 1997 three different methodologies are used to classify vim mitigation based on the parameters controlled reduced velocity using active control systems to change the natural period of the motion see kokkinis et al 2004 or changing the design of the structure such as the diameter to delay the synchronization region mass and damping increasing the mass of the structure and the damping to reduce or avoid the vim phenomenon implications for the natural frequency of the motion must be considered vortex shedding including protuberances on the surface of the structure used to modify the pattern of the vortices and their effect on the structure this is a consequence of a modification of the boundary layer around the object several different technologies have been studied and applied in the offshore field such as strakes fins fairings and spoiler plates as depicted in fig 1 the feasibility of the mitigation devices is highly dependent on the platform concept employed in the past few years strakes have frequently been highly applied in offshore scenarios for the sake of vortex mitigation in spar platforms with large aspect ratios and risers in such a passive control option the vortex shedding is successfully mitigated however an increase in the drag forces has been noticed see fredsoe and sumer 1997 another drawback is the installation of such a mitigation device which is complicated and costly especially for the case of cylinders with a low aspect ratio the efficiency of the strakes is not significant since the number of pitches is very low for low aspect ratio structures due to the low tilt angle of the helix designed to fit on the surface nonetheless spoiler plates can address these difficulties according to previous work by gonçalves et al 2010 the use of spoiler plates had demonstrates a relevant reduction in both in line and transverse amplitude for low aspect ratio cylinders the main mitigation effect of spoiler plates on transverse motion can be related to the position and the type of vortices created for instance the vorticity created in that area is mainly suppressed due to the spoiler arrangement on the side of the cylinder several works in the literature tried to evaluate the characteristics of the vortices shed in the wake of a fixed cylinder and their pattern experimentally and numerically through piv tests and cfd simulations respectively for example the results by kawamura et al 1984 and sakata et al 2018 show the presence not only of 2d vortices but also 3d vortices created by the free end of the platform 3d vortices generation is related to the formation of stagnation and recirculating areas in a specific position in the wake of the cylinder as investigated in past articles for example in gonçalves et al 2015 for a fixed cylinder a r 1 5 vortex shedding is dominated by von kármán vortices in the streamwise direction and is also affected by vortices originating from the free end of the cylinder the vortex structures change the motion of the cylinder and their effects are distinguished according to where they originated e g side and free end effects the intensity of the effect is strongly related to the aspect ratio of the structure therefore the contribution of the side vortices increases with the aspect ratio and reduces the contribution of the free end vortices and vice versa see fig 2 for the aspect ratio 0 5 a r 1 5 both the von karman and the free end characteristics are present while for a r 0 5 the free end vortices are predominant therefore the aim of this work is to extend the knowledge of the spoiler plate as a mitigation device of the vim caused by the von kármán vortices for cylinders with low aspect ratios 3 experimental setup the experimental setup of the reduced scale circular cylinder model was conducted at the towing tank at the university of tokyo japan the main tank dimensions were 85 0 m 3 5 m x 2 4m length x wide x depth and the towing car had a maximum velocity of 0 4 m s during the tests fig 3 illustrates the experimental setup and main dimensions and fig 4 shows the towing tank facility the model was elastically supported by 4 horizontal linear springs mounted along the in line and transverse directions to provide the required stiffness of the mooring system equivalent to 26n m in each direction hence the natural periods for the motions in the in line and transverse directions were the same the individual characteristics of the springs including the unstretched length l 0 are presented in table 1 the 6 degree of freedom dof motions were captured using an optical motion capture system qualisys with 4 cameras installed on the cart the sampling frequency was 100hz and uncertainty in the measurements was less than 0 5 mm for a cylinder with a low aspect ratio l d 1 5 the synchronization region in both the in line and transverse directions occurred for reduced velocities between 4 u r 9 see gonçalves et al 2018 this reduced velocity range was crucial for the analysis however lower and higher reduced velocities were also tested for each spoiler plate configuration the range of reduced velocities was varied from 1 to 12 which were evenly distributed into 25 points the froude number range f r was between 0 032 and 0 236 and the reynolds number range r e was between 12 500 and 95 000 koop et al 2016 showed that the vim model tests performed for r e 100 000 were conservative compared with the full scale ones and other factors should be considered such as waves and external damping when compared with the real case however the model tests are still a feasible procedure to understand the vim behavior of floating systems in the early stages of the design process 3 1 reduced scale model table 2 shows the main dimensions of the model the model was made of steel with a smooth surface and the spoiler plates were made of neodymium a ferromagnetic material to facilitate the alternation of arrangements the model was ballasted to have enough hydrostatic stability and to keep the natural frequencies of roll and pitch outside the range of frequency of the vortex shedding 3 2 spoiler plates two non dimensional parameters are used to describe the spoiler plates the spoiler plate aspect ratio a r s is defined as 1 a r s d s l s where d s is the length of the spoiler plate in the radial direction of the cylinder and l s is the height of the spoiler plate in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 the ratio between the length of the spoiler plate in the radial direction and the diameter of the platform is defined as 2 l r s d s d the parameters selected and their values were based on their feasibility of construction in the actual platform cases and on the expectation of their having a significant influence on the results due to the lack of studies and data about spoiler plate dimensions three different values were used see table 3 fig 5 shows the reduced model with one configuration of spoiler plates the thickness of the spoiler plate was designed to ensure the attachment between the spoiler and the curved surface of the cylinder during the experiments the spoiler arrangement consisted of a set of rings equidistant along the vertical axis n l containing a number of spoiler plates per ring n d with an angle α between the spoiler plates of the same ring the plates were not aligned in the vertical direction and a twisted angle between the spoiler plates of adjacent rings was made β α 2 fig 6 illustrates the discretization in the tangential and vertical axes and the configurations chosen are shown in table 4 4 analysis methodology the vim response was analyzed through non dimensional motion amplitudes and hydrodynamic forces in the transverse and in line directions 4 1 non dimensional motion amplitudes the motion is commonly represented in a dimensionless form as x d and y d whose nominal amplitudes are calculated based on the standard deviation of the time series of the motion in the steady state region namely 3 x d 2 s t d x d 4 y d 2 std y d 4 2 frequency analysis the frequency of vortex shedding f s is proportional to the velocity of the flow u and the characteristic length of the body the cylinder diameter d 5 f s s t u d where the proportional factor is a non dimensional parameter named the strouhal number s t which is strongly dependent on the reynolds number re the strouhal number of a cylinder with a low aspect ratio and free to oscillate is approximately s t 0 1 for the range of reynolds numbers tested see gonçalves et al 2018 the frequency analysis consists of identifying the synchronization range between the vortex shedding and the platform motion the frequency of motion was obtained from the power spectrum density psd of the oscillation using the fast fourier transform fft in this work it was calculated using the welch method as explained in welch 1967 based on the psd plot it is possible to have a clear visualization of the range of reduced velocities in which the vim was active and whether or not the phenomenon were synchronized 4 3 reduced velocities the reduced velocity u r is defined as 6 u r u t n d where t n is the natural period of motion of the platform in the transverse direction in still water obtained from the decay test the natural period for each spoiler plate configuration was measured however the changes in the natural periods due to the spoiler plate presence could be neglected 4 4 hydrodynamic forces the rigid body motion equations for the cylinder in the transverse and in line directions are derived based on the equations and discussion proposed by sarpkaya 2004 as follows 7 m x t c x t k x x t f h x t 8 m y t c y t k y y t f h y t where m denotes the structural mass of the platform c is the structural damping coefficient of the system k is the stiffness coefficient f h is defined as the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system and subscripts x and y represent the in line and transverse directions respectively in such formulations the structural components of the force are placed on the left side of the equations the hydrodynamic effects such as the added mass hydrodynamic damping and other fluid forces are placed on the right side of the equation as a result the hydrodynamic forces in each direction can be estimated indirectly using these equations of motion in this regard the restoring forces were calculated from the mooring line displacements and the structural damping was neglected due to its magnitude compared with the other dynamic forces therefore the hydrodynamic forces were estimated based on the restoring and inertial forces as for the amplitude results the hydrodynamic forces are represented in non dimensional values for the transverse direction the hydrodynamic force is described as a lift coefficient given by 9 f h y t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l t where ρ is the fluid density and s denotes the projected area perpendicular to the flow direction thus s l d the characteristic values of lift are presented as the rms of the lift coefficient over the steady state range of the time series regarding the in line direction the hydrodynamic force can be described in two components the first relates to the static component mean drag coefficient c d and the second is associated with the oscillatory component dynamic drag coefficient c d d given by 10 f h x t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c d t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c d c d d t 11 c d c d t 12 c d d t c d t c d the characteristic values of dynamic drag are presented as the rms of the dynamic drag coefficient over the steady state range of the time series following the derivations in sarpkaya 2004 and vikestad et al 2000 the hydrodynamic force in the transverse direction can be expressed as a harmonic excitation 13 f h y t f 0 s i n ω t φ f 0 cos φ sin ω t f 0 sin φ cos ω t where f 0 is the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force in the transverse direction ω denotes the angular frequency of the platform motion and φ is the phase difference between the force and motion as introduced in khalak and williamson 1999 and reviewed in sarpkaya 2004 this force can be represented by two main components one term in phase with the platform acceleration and the other term in phase with the platform velocity which is related to the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient respectively based on that the non dimensional lift coefficient in equation 9 can be expressed as 14 c l t c a sin ω t c v cos ω t where c a denotes the added mass coefficient and c v denotes the damping coefficient the added mass coefficient is estimated based on the classical analysis in the frequency domain proposed in fujarra and pesce 2002 where the following relation can be obtained 15 f f t f h y t f f t y t m a ω i c v ω ω and where f f t represents the fast fourier transform operator therefore the added mass coefficient is obtained by 16 c a f d ω r f f t f h y t f f t y t m where r is the real part of the complex number obtained via the fft the added mass coefficient was taken from the frequency of interest which contains the highest energy the same procedure for hydrodynamic forces estimation during vim model tests was applied by gonçalves et al 2010 and gonçalves et al 2018 for a monocolumn and for circular cylinders a with very low aspect ratio and the methodology presented satisfactory results compared with direct force measurements 5 experimental development only motions in the in line and the transverse directions were investigated since the motions of the other degrees of freedom were not relevant as was noted by gonçalves et al 2018 the time series were obtained using a motion capture system and the steady state data were selected manually to avoid transient effects such as the start and stop effects of the cart three parameters were chosen for the parametric study namely n d n l and a r s the parameters were described in section 3 2 an initial configuration with the following parameters was assumed n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 1 which will be used as a base case and be improved in the next stage of the parametric study all the spoiler plate configurations were compared with the bare hull case no spoiler plate table 5 shows the experiment matrix fig 7 shows the experiment chart that demonstrates the methodology for obtaining the most improved case i e the best mitigation performance the experiments were divided into four stages for each of which a parametric study was conducted varying one parameter stage 0 the case without spoiler plates was investigated to evaluate the mitigation performance stage a using the initial base case n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 1 0 the values of the spoiler ratio were varied as a r s 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 stage b using the best case from stage a as the base case n d 8 n l 5 and a r s 2 0 the number of spoiler plates were varied as n d 4 8 and 16 stage c using the best case from stage b as the base case n d 4 n l 5 and a r s 2 0 the number of rings with spoiler plates were varied as n l 3 5 and 7 the following section explains in detail the results for each stage of the parametric study in detail 5 1 stage 0 bare hull in the first stage the vim of the model without spoiler plates was investigated to obtain the benchmark data fig 8 and fig 9 show the non dimensional in line and transverse amplitudes respectively the in line amplitudes presented a local maximum around u r 3 which confirms the in line resonance for 2dof cylinders for u r 4 an increase in the in line amplitudes was observed without a decrease in amplitudes for the reduced velocities carried out the transverse amplitudes showed a significant increase in amplitudes for u r 4 and a maximum value of amplitudes y d 1 0 around u r 10 the results were similar to the ones presented by gonçalves et al 2018 for experiments in a circulating water channel and gonçalves et al 2020 for tests performed in the same towing tank facility for a different diameter however the present results extend the range of reduced velocities presented in gonçalves et al 2018 2020 showing the drop in amplitudes for u r 10 for comparison purposes all the psd results are normalized by the peak value of the bare cylinder case without spoiler plates to highlight the improvement in the mitigation effect fig 10 and fig 11 show the psd results for in line and transverse motions respectively the results show a synchronization range for the in line and transverse directions at 5 u r 10 and 5 u r 12 respectively in this range it is possible to observe the high energy level in the psd which means that the motion is periodic and with significant amplitudes as pointed out jauvtis and williamson 2004 and gonçalves et al 2018 the in line frequency is twice the transverse frequency in the synchronization range of 2dof vim which can be observed in figs 10 and 11 5 2 stage a spoiler plate ratio a r s in the second stage the effect of the spoiler plate ratio a r s was investigated parametrically hence n d 8 and n l 5 were kept constant and three different values of a r s were carried out namely 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 fig 12 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio a r s in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased when the spoiler ratio increased for the entire reduced velocity range experimented fig 13 shows the transverse amplitude results y d for the transverse motions the difference in the results was observed for u r 5 as for the in line direction the transverse amplitudes decreased when the spoiler ratio increased more substantial differences were observed for u r 8 the effect of the spoiler plate ratio was to anticipate the desynchronization and to reduce the amplitudes fig 14 presents the mean drag coefficient results c d the mean drag values were related entirely to the in line amplitudes during the occurrence of the vim phenomenon the mean drag coefficient increased due to the coupling between the in line and transverse motions this phenomenon is known as dynamic amplification of the drag as reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 blevins and coughran 2009 huang et al 2011 and gonçalves et al 2013 the same statements can be made for the dynamic drag coefficient results c d d in fig 15 as the effects of a rough surface the inclusion of the spoiler plates on the cylinder created a boundary layer transition this effect for rough surfaces was reported by allen and henning 2001 and observed by blevins and coughran 2009 for the same range of reynolds as the present experiments 50 000 r e 100 000 however the effects of spoiler plates are more significant than surface roughness because the spoiler plates prevented the boundary layer in a classic sense to build up on the cylinder by breaking any small boundary layer for rough cylinders there is a well defined boundary layer that starts its transition much earlier than for a smooth cylinder while spoiler plates may even change the flow significantly upstream of the cylinder fig 16 presents the lift coefficient results c l the slight reduction of the transverse amplitude in the synchronization range can be attributed to c l the added mass coefficient results c a showed a significant difference when the spoiler plates were included mainly in the range at the beginning of the synchronization u r 5 as shown in fig 17 the desynchronization and presence of the lower branch occur when the resonance finishes and the added mass coefficient is equal to zero as reported by vikestad et al 2000 and cunha et al 2006 increasing the spoiler plate ratio meant that the desynchronization occurred earlier c a 0 as did the decrease in transverse amplitude see fig 12 fig 18 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio on the energy levels of psd results for the in line motions the results were compared with the bare hull case from these results significant mitigation of the motions can be observed in the in line direction and almost no energy levels for the largest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 fig 19 presents the effect of the spoiler ratio on the energy levels of psd results for the transverse motions the mitigating impact can be seen by increasing the spoiler plate ratio however considerable energy remained for the highest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 the increase in the spoiler ratio decreased the energy level and also narrowed the reduced velocity range of the synchronization range the synchronization range was 5 u r 12 for the bare hull case and 6 u r 10 for the largest spoiler ratio a r s 2 0 5 3 stage b number of spoiler plates per ring n d in the third stage the number of spoiler plates per ring n d was investigated parametrically hence a r s 2 and n l 5 were kept constant and three different values of n d were carried out namely 4 8 and 16 the constant value of the spoiler plate ratio a r s 2 was chosen because it was shown to be the most effective in terms of mitigation in the previous stage fig 20 presents the effect of the number of spoiler plates per ring n d in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased by reducing the number of vertical planes of the spoiler plates ratio for the entire range of reduced velocity there was a drop in the in line amplitude for n d 4 this behavior was not observed for the other cases tested including different spoiler plate ratio cases in general the configuration of spoiler plates for the n d 4 case obtained the best performance between the configurations studied the desynchronization of the vortex shedding may be the reason for the significant difference mainly for u r 9 fig 21 presents the transverse amplitude results y d for the transverse motions a difference in the results was observed for u r 8 as for the in line direction the transverse amplitudes decreased when the number of vertical planes of spoiler plates decreased a significant difference was observed for u r 8 and n d 4 in which the transverse amplitudes dropped to around 20 compared with the bare cylinder the results of the mean drag dynamic drag lift and added mass coefficients presented in figs 22 25 respectively corroborate to the statements made before another interesting effect is the reduction of the drag coefficient when including of spoiler plates these results can be an advantage compared with the strakes because the latter were responsible for increasing the drag of the structures such as risers and spar platforms fig 26 and fig 27 present the psd results for the in line and transverse directions respectively for the in line direction almost no energy was observed for all the n d values tested which showed a high mitigation level for this dof for the transverse direction the change in the number of vertical planes of spoiler plates from 8 to 4 increased the mitigation for this dof and further narrowed the synchronization range from 6 u r 10 for n d 8 to 6 u r 9 to n d 4 therefore it was possible to find the most effective configuration by changing n d 5 4 stage c number of rings with spoiler plates n l in the fourth and final stage the number of rings with spoiler plates n l was investigated parametrically therefore a r s 2 and n d 4 were kept constant and three different values of n l were carried out namely 3 5 and 7 the number of vertical planes n d 4 was chosen because it was shown to be the most effective in terms of mitigation from the previous stage fig 28 presents the effect of the number of rings with spoiler plates n l in the in line amplitude results x d the in line amplitudes decreased when the number of rings increased for the entire reduced velocity range experimented no difference was observed for n l 5 and n l 7 fig 29 presents the transverse amplitude results y d as the in line amplitudes the transverse amplitudes decreased when n d increased the lowest transverse amplitudes could be observed for n l 7 and this behavior showed that the increase in the number of rings was more effective for the transverse than for the in line direction the most significant mitigation occurred for u r 8 around the peak amplitude and also for reduced velocities u r 9 which confirmed the anticipation of the lower branch and the synchronization ended the results of the mean drag dynamic drag lift and added mass coefficients presented in figs 30 33 respectively corroborate the statements made before the forces followed the same behavior as the motions a decrease in the forces was observed when the number of rings increased fig 34 and fig 35 present the psd results for the in line and transverse directions respectively these psd results consolidated the parametric study and showed improvement until it was possible to select the most improved case mic from the parametric study case a r s 2 0 n l 7 and n d 4 can be considered the be the mic amongst all the cases tested in terms of the psd energy the in line energy was mitigated and the transverse energy was limited to a small range of reduced velocity 6 u r 9 with lower energy than the bare cylinder case 6 general conclusions a parametric study on the geometry and configuration of spoiler plates positioned in a floating circular cylinder was carried out experimentally in a towing tank to verify the mitigation effects on the vim phenomenon three parameters were selected for evaluation during the parametric study namely n d n l and a r s the results of the motion amplitudes and forces were compared with the bare cylinder case to prove the mitigation behavior of the spoiler plates the most improved case mic amongst the configurations tested was a r s 2 0 n l 7 and n d 4 figs 36 and 37 underline the comparison between the bare cylinder and the mic for the amplitudes in the in line and transverse directions respectively the use of spoiler plates reduced both in line and transverse motions the best performance in both directions was achieved for reduced velocities beyond 9 which suggests anticipation in the desynchronization range was caused by the arrangement of the spoiler plates and their associated vortices the effectiveness of the spoiler plates was higher for the motions in the in line direction with values higher than 50 compared with the case without spoiler plates for the entire reduced velocity range tested for the transverse direction the reduction was around 20 in the reduced velocity range inside the synchronization range of the bare hull case around 5 u r 7 and above to 60 for higher reduced velocities the percentage reduction of the motion amplitudes compared with the bare hull case is presented in fig 38 fig 39 highlights the comparison between the bare hull and the mic for the mean drag force coefficient and fig 40 shows the percentage reduction of the mean drag force the mean drag force is a significant factor for offshore platforms design due to the loads at mooring systems risers and electrical cables compared with the literature regarding mitigation devices the spoiler plates proved to be effective in terms of mean drag forces while the strakes are effective for this purpose in most of the cases a reduction of around 60 for the transverse motion was observed for u r 6 mainly because of the significant mitigation of the in line motions which can be associated with the prevented dynamic amplification of the drag phenomenon at this velocity range regarding the effectiveness of the parameters the spoiler ratio a r s was the most affecting parameter among the set of configuration parameters selected the other parameters also suppressed the phenomenon with a minor contribution therefore it is hard to distinguish significant changes during the parametric analysis and to determine the best value only a superposition of the effects of the best parameters in each base case as previously specified revealed which is the best value for the remaining parameters since the study was not an optimization process the mic might not be the optimized geometry using the parameters of this study however the study showed a direction through which to optimize the geometry for spoiler plates and also helped to conclude that the presence of spoiler plates can mitigate the motions in the in line and transverse directions along with decreasing the drag coefficient due to the low aspect ratio characteristic of the cylinder the applied configuration of the spoiler plate might not suppress the vortices generated from the free end of the cylinder the free end vortices could be the reason for the high amplitudes in the synchronization range even though the mitigation device is applied gonçalves et al 2018 showed high transverse amplitudes for cylinders subjected to free end vortices and very low aspect ratios l d 0 5 alone further studies are necessary to investigate the mitigation of the free end vortices credit
